Balance your saving and spending needsSo far, there is no Brexit-related justification to cancel Christmas. But equally, it is prudent not to blow all your spare cash in these times of uncertainty.           Save wisely: The amount most of us should aim to have in emergency savings is three to six months’ worth of current incomeThe amount most of us should aim to have in emergency savings is three to six months’ worth of current income, Royal London suggests.If you have met this goal, there is no reason to rein in your spending from what’s normal for you.2. Regularly review outgoingsIf you normally re-assess your big outgoings once a year, why not bring it forward a bit? You could save money each month by switching to a cheaper mortgage deal if you are already at or coming to the end of an existing deal, Royal London suggests.Another option is to try an automatic energy switching service to ensure you are always on the cheapest energy deal. Also make sure you check the cheapest petrol and diesel prices near you on petrol comparison websites to make sure you aren’t overpaying on fuel.3. Explore new savings optionsWhile interest rates on savings are still low, they are creeping up and more rate rises from the Bank of England are on the cards for next year.Royal London has pointed out that it is still better to be on a best buy easy access savings account than an older account offering a lower rate.This is Money has an up-to-date table detailing the best easy access savings accounts available now. 4. Exchange your currencyThe pound has already weakened in response to Brexit and now stands at around €1.12.  If you need to buy foreign currency for a future trip or to send money abroad, then Royal London suggests exchanging in advance in order to mitigate potential market volatility. 5. Invest wiselyThe usual guidance to spread your investments is particularly worth heeding at times of uncertainty. Royal London suggests that investors with a low appetite for risk should ensure most of their assets are held in sterling bonds and cash to protect their investments from swings in the exchange rate. If you are a growth-oriented investor you could consider opting for a multi asset approach to help you ride out any ups and downs in the market with money spread across a variety of asset types including bonds and commercial property as well as stocks and shares, both at home and abroad.Making investment decisions can be challenging, but This is Money has a useful guide to get you started or help you improve your portfolio.        Fees back in tradesFees back in tradesGood for big potsTools and fund ideas\u0026gt Compare the best investing platform for you"},{"url":null,"title":"Kanye Wests stepfather reveals rapper confident prodigy genius child","story":"    Kanye West\u0027s \u0027stepfather\u0027 has told DailyMailTV that the outspoken rapper has always had an ego as he reveals that the \u0027prodigy genius child\u0027 had a slight speech impediment and had dreams of becoming a baseball player          Speaking to DailyMailTV, Blakeley says that from a young age Kanye\u0027s talent was \u0027off the scale\u0027, saying he was \u0027a prodigy genius child from when I first set eyes on him\u0027          Ulysses Blakeley lived with West and his mother Donda throughout the musician\u0027s childhood.   The 67-year-old watched Kanye grow up from the age of three to 11 and even bought Donda and Kanye their first home on South Shore Drive in Chicago    Ulysses Blakeley  was one of Donda\u0027s last true loves before she died after a botched cosmetic surgery operation in November 2007Blakeley said Kanye would rap in poems all the time instead of speaking normally, even for the most mundane things, like passing the salt at the dinner table. \u0027We installed into him an unshakable belief in his own talents, we encouraged him, and when he does things different, you don\u0027t judge anything he does artistically or poetically. So he would speak to you in poems, and sometimes, he\u0027d talk in riddles, and it would be like: \u0027\u0027Stop that now\u0027\u0027. But we tried not to be like that,\u0027 he adds.Although Blakeley says that he doesn\u0027t know how much influence he had on West\u0027s music and art, he does admit: \u0027How much of Kanye was innate and nothing to do with us? It might have been us or might have been the environment we created. We were both musical, writers, and cultural. Did that provide the path to wherever he is?\u0027 Although West was different, he didn\u0027t get bullied and would stand up for himself, a trait he shared with everyone in his family.\u0027He was a tough little kid, not bully-able in any way, shape or form. I remember one time he was out in the park, a boy who was ten or eleven, and Kanye was only five, took his Frisbee and threw it in the tree,\u0027 says Blakeley.\u0027Kanye told him to get it down, but this boy just played around with him, so Kanye socked him, pow, he kicked his a**, regardless of his size. There\u0027s not this intellectual, nerdy reticence in him. There\u0027s nobody in his family like that, they\u0027re forthright and aggressive.\u0027But the family did go to church and Sunday School every week. Donda says in her book that they\u0027d attend Christ Universal Temple in Chicago, a black megachurch on the South Side: \u0027I wanted Kanye to be steeped in that kind of exposure to God.\u0027It\u0027s a little known fact that West also went to a \u0027positive thinking\u0027 kindergarten for black children called the New Concept Development Center, where he was taught Swahili by Donda\u0027s trusted friend and fellow professor, Haki Madhubuti.

The bath was down the hall and the room was definitely no-frills.

Kanye went right along to the red-light district with me. From there it was on to Koh Samui. The beaches there are some of the most beautiful in the world. \u0027I was totally embarrassed, though, when one of the professors (also a Catholic priest) asked Kanye what was the favorite part of his holiday. Kanye answered: \u0027\u0027The nude beaches in Thailand\u0027\u0027.\u0027But this is nothing compared to the revelations that Donda reveals about West\u0027s sexual habits when he was approaching his teenage years.She wrote: \u0027I talked with him about it, like I talked with him about everything. There was no topic that was off limits, not even sex. When he was twelve, that conversation came up.\u0027It was my time to car pool and Kanye was in the car along with two of his friends. Jocelyn Elders came on the radio and, as I remember it, she was talking about the rise of teenage pregnancy.\u0027  Blakeley said: \u0027He was a little boy, preschool. He was off the scale. One time, someone asked him when they were looking at his drawings: \u0027Do you want to be an artist when you grow up?\u0027 He said: \u0027I am an artist\u0027. The ego\u0027s always been there!\u0027          Donda revealed in her book that she encouraged Kanye to masturbate rather than having sex with girlfriends at a young age. She added: \u0027I found out later my words had sunk in because Kanye told me so\u0027Donda continues in the book: \u0027That\u0027s when I told Kanye and his friends that masturbation was a far better alternative to having sex at such a young age.  \u0027I told them it was perfectly healthy, normal, and gratifying and that they did not have to participate in sex with another partner and risk some young lady getting pregnant or contracting a venereal disease, not the least of which was AIDS. They said nothing.\u0027They just sat there anxious for us to get to school I\u0027m sure, so they could get out of that car. I found out later my words had sunk in because Kanye told me so.\u0027After coming back from China, the pair moved home several times.          Blakeley had a special relationship with West, Donda revealed in her 2007 biography, Raising Kanye, which was published just before she diedThe star\u0027s very first music studio was his bedroom on Longwood Drive, Blue Island - which is now an abandoned, ramshackle home, until his mother booted him out for playing his music 247.Donda reveals: \u0027Kanye spent hours and hours mixing, rapping, and writing. It was nonstop. He became so involved that his socializing revolved around that studio in his room.\u0027That thumping bass line seemed to shake the very foundation of our house. Boom-boom-boom day and night. There were all sorts of people coming in and out of the house. \u0027Mainly it was the thundering bass that was no longer welcome—not all day and all night, anyway. I finally had to say to Kanye: \u0027You\u0027re moving\u0027.\u0027Another of his former homes, a tiny, rundown apartment on Lake Bluff Drive, Tinley Park, is where West saw the apparition of Christ - Yeezus meets Jesus!Donda reveals: \u0027One day Kanye was playing in the dining room of our first home in Chicago, a third-floor apartment on the South Side. \u0027All of a sudden, he looked toward the door and the staircase leading down. He pointed and said, \u0027Look, there goes Jesus!\u0027 My heart raced. I saw energy.           Blakeley watched Kanye grow up from the age of three to 11 and even bought Donda and Kanye their first home on South Shore Drive in Chicago (pictured)  The house was meant to be turned into a community center for the youth, but arguments between a charity named after Donda and Kanye means it hasn\u0027t happened yet\u0027To this day, I believe it was Christ giving us just a little extra protection that day. Neither Kanye nor I have spoken of it since.\u0027But it was very real to me and just one of the reasons I think Kanye is connected in a special way or for a special purpose. God has chosen him to not only reach but also touch millions.\u0027 Kanye\u0027s first job was as a busboy collecting plates at the American diner chain Bob Evans.Although, according to Donda, \u0027he decided immediately that bussing tables was not something that would work for him. He quit on his first day before he even started.\u0027When West finally broke onto the music scene, he moved to New York, where he found an apartment at the Hudson Tea Building, in New Jersey, directly across the river from Manhattan, as can be seen in our images.\u0027We rented it, sight unseen. It was $850 a month, with a living room and a step-up great room with a glass ceiling. You could actually look up and see the sky. It was wonderful. And Kanye was inspired...\u0027Kanye loved that place. He called up his friends and said, \u0027Man, you should see this place. It\u0027s like something off of TV.\u0027 Kanye was exactly where he wanted to be. He was on his way to fulfilling his dream,\u0027 says Donda in her book.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/11/15/16/03B6E933000003E8-0-image-m-8_1542300429456.jpg","title":"How Yoko Ono relentlessly pursued John Lennon","story":"John Lennon became mesmerized by Yoko Ono (pictured in 1968) after she relentlessly pursued him everywhere he went – in person and with letters, a new book claims           The superstar\u0027s aunt Mimi called Yoko a poisoned dwarf and John\u0027s band mates Paul, Ringo and George did not want her sitting in on album recording sessions or label meetings. Pictured: Yoko in the studio with the Beatles (pictured in 1969)          But by 1972, the \u0027dazzle had gone out of their lives\u0027. The only way out Yoko could see was to get John a mistress and she set up the relationship with May Pang, 22, (pictured with John in the 1970s) a beautiful Chinese girl who had been working for the coupleTheir relationship would lead to suffocation for John and he talked of orce while Yoko had found her métier running the iconic British band\u0027s empire.\u0027Her detractors, however, and there are many, point to some clever plotting and attention-seeking behavior on her behalf\u0027, writes Connolly. \u0027A little-known avant-garde artist who was wishing to make a name for herself in a new country could do no better than by finding a way of association with the Beatles, and especially John Lennon, whose every action was newsworthy and was now rich enough to be a very important person\u0027.The Beatles lived in a feel-good party bubble for two years after finishing their first North American tour in the summer of 1964.           Author Ray Connolly writes in Being John Lennon: A Restless Life that Yoko found a way to make a name for herself through John Lennon was already taking Preludin, an amphetamine, to keep up the intense booking schedule, as well as drinking alcohol.When Bob Dylan introduced the band to marijuana, consumption quickly progressed to smoking it for breakfast.LSD became John\u0027s next drug of choice and he took acid while reading a book by Timothy Leary about destroying your ego.Lennon\u0027s drug habits caused him to start panicking about death threats to the group, who were then confined to their hotel while touring.When crowds started spitting at them, the band decided it was time to \u0027give rock a rest.\u0027\u0027It was f***ing humiliation,\u0027 John said. \u0027One has to completely humiliate oneself to be what the Beatles were.\u0027The whole Beatle thing was just beyond comprehension. I was eating and drinking like a pig, and I was as fat as a pig\u0027.\u0027The Ku Klux Klan had nailed Beatles albums to burning crosses and radio stations began to ban the playing of Beatles records,\u0027 writes the author.\u0027To John, ever dissatisfied with the way things were, the idea of a spiritual rebirth, a starting again, was always attractive\u0027.The group went their separate ways - George went to India, Paul composed music for a movie, Ringo took a holiday and John went to Spain before returning to London.          The Beatles (above in 1965) lived in a feel-good party bubble for two years after making their first North American tour in summer of 1964. Lennon was already taking Preludin, an amphetamine, to keep up the intense booking schedule, as well as drinking alcohol          Yoko, a heroin addict, turned up in Lennon\u0027s (pictured in 1969) life during a time when he was seeking a spiritual rebirth and turned him onto her drug of choice, and she would eventually be instrumental in breaking up the BeatlesEnter Yoko Ono, who always claimed that their meeting at the Indica Gallery in London was \u0027purely by accident\u0027.John had been dropped off at the gallery by owner John Dunbar. He viewed the art as a con and suspected that he was being hustled to buy something.Downstairs he was introduced to \u0027a very small Japanese lady wearing a black sweater and black trousers, peering out from between two curtain folds of long black hair\u0027.She was preparing her exhibition opening the following day and was in London with her current husband and child, Kyoko.Yoko claimed she hadn\u0027t recognized John \u0027although she had insisted to Dunbar that a Beatle be invited\u0027, writes the author.One of her art pieces was a board with a chain and a hammer hanging on it and a bunch of nails at the bottom.John asked: \u0027Can I hammer a nail in it\u0027? \u0027No\u0027, she said and walked away.She came back and asked for five shillings. Lennon had no money on him and said he would give her five imaginary shillings to hammer in an imaginary nail.She later contacted Lennon and asked him for an original music score for a short film. He sent lyrics to one of the Beatles\u0027 songs but John didn\u0027t know that she had initially asked Paul who refused her request.\u0027Yoko had broken into the orbit of the Beatles\u0027, writes the author.A few weeks after the Indica Gallery meeting, she showed up at the Beatles\u0027 office in Mayfair hoping to speak to John.She wanted financial backing to wrap the statues of the lions in Trafalgar Square in canvas.          Yoko had John finance her art project that featured a room that had half of every object. Pictured: Yoko sitting in her \u0027half bedroom\u0027 in 1968          Yoko has always claimed that she met John at the Indica Gallery in London \u0027purely by accident\u0027. Yoko claimed she hadn\u0027t recognized John \u0027although she had insisted to Dunbar that a Beatle be invited\u0027, writes the author. Pictured: The couple in 1971In John\u0027s absence, she pitched the idea to Ringo who was \u0027non plussed --- and commented she might just as well have been speaking in Japanese for the little he understood of her plan\u0027.\u0027From the very beginning of her career, she understood the power of networking and self-promotion especially self-promotion,\u0027 according to Connolly, a veteran journalist and screenwriter who John befriended in the late 1960s.Yoko\u0027s next move was to send John a copy of her self-published book of \u0027instructional poems\u0027 called Grapefruit.One poem was: \u0027Stir inside of your brains with a penis until things are mixed up. Take a walk. Smoke everything you can, including your pubic hair\u0027.John \u0027felt that she was the star and he the audience\u0027.He hadn\u0027t felt that for a long time. She was an enigma to him. Never had he met anyone like this \u0027odd little Japanese woman dressed in her black intellectual\u0027s uniform,\u0027 writes the author.In the summer of 1967, the Sgt. Pepper album was released, while John was still high on LSD and feeling \u0027needles of jealousy\u0027 towards Paul for his clever songwriting.Beatles manager Brian Epstein was dead of an accidental overdose of sleeping pills, leaving John feeling guilty having introduced his old friend to pills.John knew years earlier that Epstein, openly gay, had fallen in love with him. It made John question his own sexuality and he once let Brian pleasure him him but then he later turned on him and called him a \u0027queer Jew\u0027. Throughout all of this, Yoko was writing letters to John, getting under his skin and suddenly was everywhere he was.She even showed up at a meeting that John, Paul and Jane Asher had with a yogi in the Indian Himalayas.          Throughout all of this, Yoko was writing letters to John (pictured in 1969), getting under his skin and suddenly was everywhere he was. She even showed up at a meeting that Paul and Jane Asher had with a yogi in the Indian HimalayasYoko wrote John multiple times a week while he was in India. He collected the letters at the post office so his wife, Cynthia, would be none the wiser.Yoko never quit the chase and John made up his mind to orce Cynthia, his high school Brigitte Bardot fantasy, and leave his wife and child for Yoko. Yoko, seven years John\u0027s senior, was born in Tokyo, her father a wealthy banker and a Christian, her mother a Buddhist. When her father was posted to a position in the U.S. and the family moved to Scarsdale, New York, Yoko enrolled at Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers but dropped out after meeting a Japanese composer, Toshi Ichiyanagi, studying at the Julliard School, a performing arts conservatory.They were married and with little money, Yoko waitressed to support her bohemian lifestyle and her conceptualist art.\u0027If she received any reviews at all, they were usually critical, but criticism and rejection never stopped her\u0027, writes the author. \u0027Her belief in herself was total\u0027.She had affairs during that short-lived marriage and the couple separated with Yoko returning to Japan and putting on one of her conceptual art \u0027events\u0027.Failing to ignite any excitement, she was institutionalized by her husband and family after overdosing on sleeping pills.American filmmaker, Tony Cox pursued Yoko in Japan and helped her get out of the hospital. She got pregnant, quickly orced Toshi and married Cox.Cox delivered the baby at home and continued to do most of the childcare for their daughter. When fame eluded Yoko in Japan, she returned to New York.          Yoko, seven years John\u0027s senior, was born in Tokyo, her father a wealthy banker and a Christian, her mother a Buddhist.

There were no reviews.Invited to appear at a symposium in London, she reconnected with John who \u0027finally found someone who was balmy as I am\u0027, John told his friend Pete Shotton.Yoko and John became a couple and a brand -- JohnandYoko -- and the \u0027poisoned dwarf\u0027 finally got her wish. \u0027She was becoming famous\u0027.They were never apart for the next three years before moving to Manhattan in 1971.With Yoko, he was no longer the front man as he was with the Beatles and never away from her side.Ronnie Spector, 75, reveals the moment her \u0027abusive\u0027...Tantalising secrets of The Beatles buried in the White...John Lennon\u0027s killer reveals he purposely used hollow...Share this articleThey dressed in matching white suits and both parted their long hair down the middle. John insisted that Yoko be at all recording sessions –inhibiting to the other Beatles and helped escalate the final demise of the band.Yoko had already expressed she didn\u0027t like rock and roll music and viewed it as culturally crude. She made suggestions in a field she knew nothing about.She was staging her own \u0027events\u0027 that critics viewed as \u0027Yoko\u0027s vanity projects that John was funding. Interest in them was low to non-existent,\u0027 writes the author.John sued Cynthia for orce citing adultery, a charge later withdrawn and reversed to John\u0027s uncontested adultery.Now he could marry Yoko but she was still married to Cox who had originally encouraged Yoko to pursue John as an art patron and she owed him a lot of money.          Inseparable, John insisted that Yoko be at all recording sessions –inhibiting to the other Beatles and helped escalate the final demise of the band. Pictured: John and Yoko in one of the last photos of John before he was shot dead in 1980 \u0027He got her out of the mental hospital in Japan, he kept her going, raised money for her shows...went after all the publicity, found backers for her films, borrowed money from banks...\u0027 writes the author, and now she was dumping him for someone rich and famous.John was blinded by Yoko and saw her as the most intelligent woman he had ever met as well as being very beautiful.The workforce at Apple Records didn\u0027t like Yoko and remembered her as \u0027a very pushy broad with not an ounce of humble in her\u0027.Mimi, John\u0027s aunt, told a reporter, \u0027I didn\u0027t like the look of her from the start\u0027. \u0027My God, what\u0027s that?\u0027 she said on first sight and dubbed her \u0027the poisoned dwarf\u0027.Little did Mimi know at the time that Yoko introduced heroin to John who began sniffing it regularly. John and Yoko were busted for hash, traces of marijuana and half a gram of morphine. John\u0027s own arrest didn\u0027t phase him. \u0027I was stoned all the time and just didn\u0027t give a s**t\u0027, he told Connelly.He was so stoned, he no longer cared about the once magical writing relationship with McCartney.While John was \u0027lost in the glow of love\u0027, he never recognized that Yoko was generating ill from fans and the general public who hated her music.          While John was \u0027lost in the glow of love\u0027, he never recognized that Yoko was generating ill from fans and the general public who hated her music. Neither did the other Beatles who wanted to get the group back to being only four          After Yoko gave her blessing to May and John (pictured together in 1974), the pair escaped to Los Angeles and stayed together for eighteen months. Yoko phoned John a dozen times a day still high on heroinThey just didn\u0027t like her – and neither did the other Beatles who wanted to get the group back to being only four. \u0027I think you\u0027re both nuts, the pair of you\u0027, Ringo told John.Yoko had driven a wedge between John and Paul as well as into the management battle and the new agent asking for a larger percentage.Life at the Dakota apartment building on Manhattan\u0027s Upper West Side where the couple lived turned into suffocation for the Beatle. John spent hours sleeping or staring mutely at the TV.\u0027The dazzle had gone out of their lives\u0027, writes the author. The myth of perfect love evaporated by 1972.The only way out Yoko could see was to get John a mistress and she set up the relationship with May Pang, 22, a beautiful Chinese girl who had been working for the couple.The pair escaped to Los Angeles and stayed together for eighteen months.Yoko phoned John a dozen times a day.John was now happier than he had been in years --- until Yoko rang saying she had found a cure for John\u0027s cigarette smoking – hypnotism and that could only take place at the Dakota.May wasn\u0027t invited to the session and off John went in January 1975.John never revealed what transpired during the session but he became quite ill and the author suggests some kind of aversion therapy transpired.John saw May on the sly but he was back in the grip of Yoko.          \u0027She was more than a wife to him. She was more like a mother. \u0027Perhaps that was why he began to call her Mother\u0027. Pictured: John and Yoko in November of 1980 \u0027She had needed him for his fame and the cachet it gave her, for his money and the limousines. She made him feel clever and not just a rock and roller. Now as she ran the Dakota apartment and staff, and sat in his place on the Apple board, she seemed to offer to bring order to his life\u0027, writes Connolly.\u0027She was more than a wife to him. She was more like a mother. \u0027Perhaps that was why he began to call her Mother\u0027.She took control of all of John\u0027s finances and became his manager.But his muse was dried up and for the next four years, John was rarely seen in public.He had nowhere to go, no one to see and spent time watching Dumbo cartoons with their young son, Sean.He became anorexic thin and was sure that the FBI was listening in on all his calls. No calls from friends were put through to him. \u0027Yoko has him all locked up\u0027, Mick Jagger said.\u0027Yoko had found her métier in life – she ran the busy Lennon empire\u0027 – according to whether or not Mercury was in retrograde.Lennon\u0027s days were spent living on the fringes of \u0027a world that Yoko was running without him\u0027.It was only when John went on a stormy sailing trip from Cape Town, South Africa to Bermuda that he regained his self-confidence and sense of self-worth.On his return he was ready to write and record again. But it wasn\u0027t to be.John was shot dead by Mark David Chapman on December 8, 1980 outside of the Dakota.Thirty-eighty years after the crime, Chapman remains in Attica State Prison. Ray Connolly\u0027s Being John Lennon: A Restless Life is available here. "},{"url":null,"title":"The Royal wee Princess Charlotte stuns punters nips south London pub use toilet","story":"    Princess Charlotte added an extra royal engagement to her brief public life – an unexpected visit to a south London pub to use the loo, MailOnline can reveal          The fourth in line to the throne nipped into the Phoenix in Stockwell with her mother to use the ladies after she was caught short while travelling down the notoriously busy A3 trunk road          Regulars and staff were stunned by the visit with one punter joking: \u0027It just goes to show that the royals are like any other family.

It is hard to deal with.\u0027 Dooley revealed he is currently estranged from his father, who earlier this year released a public letter begging Prince Harry not to marry Meghan. \u0027The only family I have left now are my mom, brother, and grandfather,\u0027 Dooley said. \u0027We are still close and fine but for the rest of my family, their lives are lived out in the tabloids and that is the hardest thing.\u0027 \u0027I have to read what\u0027s going on in my family in the news because I don\u0027t even speak to them.\u0027 While Dooley hasn\u0027t spoken to Meghan in three years, he defended his aunt and said she doesn\u0027t deserve the way Samantha and his father have spoken about her. \u0027Meghan has always been a hard worker,\u0027 he said. \u0027I know she focused on her passion and trying to make a name for herself.\u0027           Meghan (pictured age 11) is seen next to Dooley, her father Thomas Markle Sr, Dooley\u0027s brother Thomas, and Samantha Markle \u0027She was a young girl with big ambitions.

We should not make any utopian promises here.\u0027           Austrian Interior Minister Herbert Kickl (right) chats with German counterpart Horst Seehofer (L) during an European Interior Minister council in Brussels on ThursdayAn EU diplomat told AFP on condition of anonymity that it is \u0027pretty fair to say\u0027 the bloc has abandoned the plan to meet the 10,000 target. \u0027For now it is unrealistic.\u0027In September, Jean-Claude Juncker, who heads the Commission, the EU\u0027s executive arm, announced the plan to sharply boost the current pan-EU force of 1,300 staff to help inidual member states patrol their borders.But a number of member countries were uncomfortable with it, including Juncker\u0027s call for 10,000 border guards.Poland, for example, said that funds for the force might mean less money for road and other infrastructure projects.Frontline countries Italy, Greece and Spain expressed fears that border guards recruited from other member countries would erode their national sovereignty if deployed to their territory during a crisis.The beefed-up force has been the flagship of EU efforts to bolster its long maritime and land borders against flows of migrants fleeing war and poverty from the Middle East and Africa.The unlikelihood of meeting the border guard numbers by 2020 is all the more glaring as EU member states have found it easier to bolster borders than agree how to share responsibility for refugees who reach European shores.The EU is trying to boost its defences against future migrant surges after having sharply reduced arrivals since a 2015 peak as a result of cooperation with Turkey and Libya.The last surge, which amounted to Europe\u0027s biggest migration crisis since World War II, fuelled isions across the bloc - particularly over a plan to relocate tens of thousand of asylum seekers among EU member states. "},{"url":null,"title":"Tory loyalists launch Commons bid limit Brexit backstop one year","story":"    Hugo Swire (pictured), a former Northern Ireland minister, tabled the amendment along with Bob Neill and Richard Graham          Theresa May said this morning that killing off her plan could result in no-deal, or no Brexit at allAnd it would require Mrs May to seek \u0027further assurances from the EU that the backstop would only be a temporary arrangement\u0027.The amendment was tabled by loyalist MPs Sir Hugo Swire and Richard Graham.

His annual remuneration of £1.7million can buy a lot of holidays there.The chief executive of publicly-funded Motability Operations, which supplies vehicles to the disabled, enjoys other trappings, too – all the fripperies of the modern boss, such as gold-plated medical insurance, entertainment expenses and away-days in posh hotels to discuss \u0027strategy\u0027. And, of course, nice cars.\u0027It goes without saying that he loves his cars, and he never drives anything more than six months old,\u0027 says one who has worked for Betts. His car changes all the time. He\u0027s into his Mercs and likes Range Rovers, too. Some of the other directors go for Porsche 911s.\u0027Motability\u0027s London office is on the south bank of the Thames in Southwark. The directors all have offices on the top floor, which had an expensive refit a few years ago. \u0027They didn\u0027t scrimp on anything,\u0027 adds the former employee. \u0027It was stupid money, spent on high-quality artworks, beautiful wooden furniture and top-end fixtures and fittings.\u0027Then there is the penthouse flat. Mr Betts, 56 – a father of two grown-up children – is lucky enough to live just around the corner from his office in a £5million suite in a super-trendy warehouse conversion within a popping champagne cork\u0027s distance of Tower Bridge.From his balcony overlooking the river, Mr Betts, a Buckinghamshire boy made good and then some, can survey the London skyline, bubbly in hand, and celebrate his good fortune.He\u0027s a generous boss, too, according to that former employee. \u0027He will often hand his credit card to another director to buy drinks at the bar.\u0027But then he can afford to be generous, given his level of income. It does, however, prompt the question: What is his extraordinary pay package for, exactly?          Mr Betts, 56 – a father of two grown-up children – is lucky enough to live just around the corner from his office in a £5million suite in a super-trendy warehouse conversion within a popping champagne cork\u0027s distance of Tower BridgeNot least because Mr Betts will be walking into the corporate sunset in the not-too-distant future, quitting by May 2020 following 16 years in the job and after coming under fire from the media and politicians on all sides in the past year.But not before he has filled his boots with yet more money – a hitherto secret £2million bonus exposed by the Mail this week – also from the taxpayer.Motability Operations (MO) is a public limited company, but that designation is somewhat misleading. It is not a corporation in the genuine FTSE100 sense, but the delivery arm of a charitable enterprise called Motability, established in 1977 to help disabled people acquire reasonably priced and reliable cars, scooters and powered chairs. The scheme is very popular, with 614,000 customers as of September last year.Its \u0027Plc\u0027 tag suggests a major company subject to market turbulence and risk, constantly fighting competitors, red in tooth and claw. After all, vehicle leasing is a crowded, ever-evolving market. The challenges of free competition are routinely trotted out to justify stratospheric boardroom rewards, but MO is a stranger to this commercial jungle. It grazes in much safer territory.It is a monopoly, the sole recipient of mobility benefit paid by the Department of Work and Pensions to disabled claimants who want to use the scheme – a single, ultra-reliable source of funding.What\u0027s more, MO benefits from generous tax breaks of £890million. Due to this huge built-in advantage, and because of its vast purchasing power in the new car market, MO can drive down the price of the vehicles it buys.Married substitute teacher, 27, who preyed on 15-year-old...Share this articleEffectively, this is a licence to print money – shown by MO\u0027s accumulation of a vast £2.62billion reserve, mostly in vehicles, which are sold into the second-hand market after three years.The shareholders – four high street banks – are not allowed idends, so this pile of taxpayers\u0027 money sits there, growing larger. In its damning report, released today, the official spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, repeatedly points to these implicit advantages, criticising MO for setting executive performance targets that are almost impossible to miss, given its unique circumstances. This resulted in five executive directors of the company receiving bonuses of £15.3million between 2008 and 2015.Indeed, it would take a pretty dumb bunch of executives to mess up such a \u0027business\u0027. But this has not stopped the top people at MO patting themselves on the back and awarding each other lavish, fat-cat payouts on a regular basis.As for finding out Mr Betts\u0027 total annual remuneration package (revealed by this paper in February) – which includes performance and loyalty bonuses paid for reaching targets that are easy to maintain and loyalty that should be a given in his position – it wasn\u0027t easy because a big chunk of it was squirrelled away in the firm\u0027s annual accounts under an entry that did not bear Mr Betts\u0027 name.Yet, Motability is a far from perfect scheme. Only a third of the 1.72million mobility benefit claimants eligible to join it actually do, and they found themselves being overcharged to the tune of £390million for their lease agreements when MO over-estimated the rate of depreciation on vehicles.The Motability scheme itself has previously been criticised for its failure to police itself. Disabled applicants can nominate able-bodied relatives and friends to drive their vehicles if they can\u0027t manage it, leading to claims that able-bodied people are using cars bought mainly for their own use.Surely the most bloated feline on the block is Michael Keith Betts. MO assures the world that his pay and privileges are decided independently by the remuneration committee – of which he is a member. Conflict of interest is avoided, says MO, by Mr Betts leaving the room while his stonking pay packet is discussed.          It may be that Mike Betts harbours an appetite for yet more years behind a sprawling desk. But, if not, he will be able to enjoy a long and happy retirement, enjoying those flawless stretches of sand in the West Indies. And he has you, the humble British taxpayer, to thank for it\u0027Betts comes over as a nice guy – he is on first-name terms with everyone and he will talk to anyone on any level – but it\u0027s not always a fun conversation,\u0027 adds the source. \u0027He has an unnerving habit of suddenly checking if you know the exact price of a particular car to keep you on your toes.\u0027He is very much the boss and is basically surrounded by yes-men. He always knows exactly what he wants and pushes people hard to get it. He can be quite ruthless.\u0027The National Audit Office points out that MO insists on comparing itself to real private businesses rather than the \u0027public-sector entities\u0027 and \u0027charitable trusts\u0027 that it more closely resembles.Acidly, the report\u0027s authors point out that even BBC executives inhabit a more competitive environment than MO bosses and take home far less moneyThe Motability charity\u0027s governors have been aware of this inconsistency for years – as correspondence contained in the NAO report shows – but have done precious little to rein in such greed.The NAO reveals that governors of the Motability charity often spend far longer in post than the recommended nine years – sometimes twice as long – and it suggests refreshing the ranks of those whose job it is to monitor how MO bosses spend public money.There is perhaps 18 months before Mr Betts bids farewell to the corporate trough, effectively forced out by howls of criticism from Parliament and diligent reporting by this newspaper.MO puts a gloss on events, issuing this statement: \u0027After 16 years in the business, Motability Operations chief executive Mike Betts and the board of Motability Operations Group plc have agreed that, following the implementation of actions agreed as an outcome of the NAO review, and working to help the new chairman settle in, a suitable successor will be found, and Mike will step down from the board, no later than May 2020.\u0027The board is clear that recommendations made by the NAO will benefit from Mr Betts\u0027s experience and skills to see them through.\u0027It may be that Mike Betts harbours an appetite for yet more years behind a sprawling desk. But, if not, he will be able to enjoy a long and happy retirement, enjoying those flawless stretches of sand in the West Indies.

The apartment in the City Life hotel in Queen Street, pictured, has been named by police as a location of interest\u0027Police have identified this man and he has been spoken to,\u0027 Mr Beard told reporters.\u0027Through our investigations we have also identified a location of interest, an apartment in the City Life hotel in Queen Street.\u0027In the six days since Grace\u0027s disappearance officers have conducted multiple inquiries and are now conducting a scene examination at the apartment.Grace was said to have been in regular contact with her family and friends until Saturday night - the day before her birthday. \u0027At this point we hold grave fears for her safety,\u0027 Mr Beard said.  Grace\u0027s brother also made an emotional appeal for help find her in a video widely shared on social media.  Declan Millane spoke to New Zealand TV station The Project NZ in an emotional  appearance during which he urged authorities to do everything in their power to \u0027bring her home\u0027.\u0027We raised our concerns on Monday 3rd December with local police and the embassy in New Zealand,\u0027 he said in an interview.

Thousands of anti-LGBT protestors took to the streets outside Jakarta on November 9, whilst a television station has even started airing shocking \u0027exorcism\u0027 shows claiming to \u0027cleanse\u0027 homosexualsConcerns have been aggravated by president Joko Widodo selecting a conservative cleric, known for his disparaging views of the gay community and other minorities, as his running mate for next year\u0027s elections.A poll this year showed nearly 90 percent of Indonesians felt \u0027threatened\u0027 by the LGBT community, while a 2013 Pew survey said 72 percent of Indonesian Muslims supported replacing the secular code with Islamic law, which bans gay sex.\u0027(The elections) could mean an uptick in politicians scapegoating... people for cynical political gain,\u0027 said Human Rights Watch researcher Kyle Knight.\u0027The verbal threats politicians issue can quickly metastasise into physical attacks.\u0027          Indonesia\u0027s small LGBT community is under attack as a spike in hateful rhetoric and record number of arrests raise fears that the vulnerable group could be targeted for violence, critics say.Police arrested at least 300 suspected LGBT people last year - a record - mostly under an anti-pornography law as homosexuality and gay sex are legal in Indonesia.This month, 10 people described as \u0027suspected lesbians\u0027 were arrested in West Sumatra, following the detention of another eight lesbians and transgender people in October.\u0027This situation is alarming as the hateful abuses by law enforcement bodies... are seen as a normal practice by many people,\u0027 said Usman Hamid, Amnesty International Indonesia\u0027s Executive Director.  However, officials are unfazed by the criticism.\u0027We\u0027re being consistent in our efforts to eradicate LGBT (behaviour) because it\u0027s very destructive,\u0027 said West Sumatra deputy governor Nasrul Abit, adding that thousands of people were having \u0027deviant sex\u0027 in the region.Parliament is considering a move to criminalise sex outside marriage - including gay couples - while the health ministry previously announced plans to release a medical guide classifying homosexuality as a mental disorder.The UN human rights chief and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have criticised the proposed legal overhaul.          Thousands of anti-LGBT demonstrators marching in Bogor, outside the capital Jakarta, on November 9Authorities have also taken aim at social media, arresting two men for links to a LGBT community Facebook page.Google in January pulled one of the world\u0027s largest gay dating apps from the Indonesian version of its online store in response to government demands. The latest crackdown can be traced back to 2016 when Indonesia\u0027s higher education minister Mohamad Nasir called for LGBT student groups to be banned from universities, and the defence minister criticised gay and trans rights activism, Human Rights Watch said.Since then, police have raided nightclubs, saunas, hair salons, hotels and even private homes in pursuit of LGBT people.Gay people have been publicly flogged in Aceh under the province\u0027s Islamic legal code.Local police there made global headlines when they arrested a dozen transgender people and publicly humiliated them by chopping off their long hair and forcing them to wear men\u0027s clothes.But there are few hopes that Widodo or other senior officials vying for re-election will protect a widely hated minority, said HRW researcher Andreas Harsono.\u0027We need leaders who have the courage to say this is wrong.\u0027Islamic exorcisms used as conversion therapy as Indonesian city moves against LGBT population - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)"},{"url":null,"title":"Cabinet ministers left frustrated demand comes way save Brexit deal","story":"Share this articleBrexit latest news: EU prepared to offer Theresa May lifeline by extending Article 50Brexit latest news: Cabinet ministers demand answers as Chief Whip admits May will lose Tuesday’s voteNikki da Costa on Twitter: \u0026quotI know a government amendment when I see one :)… \u0026quot"},{"url":null,"title":"British mother left trapped broken shoulder catamaran overturns South Africa","story":"    Holiday horror: The British woman ended up trapped inside the catamaran as she had gone down into the galley as it was overturnedThe yacht skipper bravely took off his life jacket and free-ed under the water and through the rigging to try and save her. He surfaced inside an air pocket in the galley and found the terrified woman and calmed her down and told her she would have to swim back out the catamaran.Baffled young cheetahs don\u0027t know what to make of huge...British pilot is hailed a hero after taking the controls of...Share this articleHe instructed her to e down through the freezing water and guided her out through the galley doors and back up to the surface to his two waiting crew members.The terrified mother was in agony with a broken shoulder and had to be helped and guided to safety through the choppy seas.The NSRI lifeboats based inside Cape Town harbour had been alerted and they launched two sea rescue craft Spirit of Day and Spirit of Vodacom who raced to the scene.

There was a net loss of 127 public libraries in England, Wales and Scotland, while 712 full-time employees lost or left their jobs and volunteer numbers increased by 3,000, to 51,394.“Community-run” library branches have become the norm in the UK as councils ask volunteers to take the service off their books. In 2010, estimates from Public Libraries News suggest there were only around 10 libraries in the hands of volunteers by 2017, the figure had risen to around 500. Cipfa calculations show that 10,000 new volunteers have joined Britain’s library service over the last three years, increasing from 41,402 in 2014-15 to 51,394 in 2017-18.Rob Whiteman, CEO of Cipfa, said libraries were “a canary in the coal mine for what is happening across the local government sector”.“A lack of funds is forcing many councils to get creative in how they deliver their services, and we find in our public libraries this loss of paid employees is creating a reliance on volunteers,” he said. “Similar cost-shifting is happening across almost all local government services, with communities finding everything from legal aid to green waste collection no longer as accessible. There really need to be some honest conversations about the direction of travel of our councils and what their role is, as the funding gap will continue to exacerbate these issues.”While visitor numbers fell by 10 million this year, to 233 million, the three most popular libraries in Britain – Manchester’s central library, and the Wembley and Woolwich Centre libraries in London – continued to see more than one million people enter their doors last year.Tim Coates, the former managing director of Waterstones and now a library campaigner in the US, said Britain’s woes were unique. “The real heart of the problem with British public libraries is that they are terribly badly operated and managed,” he said. “The decline in use has been going on for over 20 years, since long before the cuts in funding started, and no one in government or the library profession or sector has taken the action needed to improve. There have been literally dozens of ineffective and wasteful reports and initiatives.“The US and Australia show increased use and popularity of their traditional public libraries, so it cannot be true to say that ‘changing technology or changing society’ have caused the decline. If the service is not used it is only reasonable for taxpayers to pay less … People certainly want public libraries, but not in the way they are operated at present. The service is poor. We need a whole change of management.”Nick Poole, chief executive of Cilip, the library and information association, called the figures “a clear wake-up call” and called on the government to use the forthcoming 2019 spending review, announced by chancellor Philip Hammond in October, to invest in libraries once more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b85f5c354ca8de03592dafcbfe6882b947773a03/0_32_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22e7b02ffac2635ad3c586e1ab1e2099","title":"markets rebound ftse asia wall street huawei us jobs report business live","story":"Shares are recovering in Asia and Europe after Thursday’s rout, but investors are still nervous following the arrest of Huawei’s CFOThat’s a blow to US families in the run-up to the festive season.BREAKING: The US economy created 155,000 new jobs last month, fewer than the 200,000 which Wall Street had expected.And in another blow, October’s figures was revised down to 237,000, from a first estimate of 250,000.That suggests the labor market isn’t as strong as hoped - which will lower the pressure to raise US interest rates.More to follow.....Brad Bechtel, global head of FX at Jefferies, predicts that shares will fall if the US jobs report beats forecasts....and rise if it misses.As he puts it on Bloomberg TV:Good equals bad, and bad equals good.That’s because the markets will assume that the US Federal Reserve will step in to support the economy, if required. We’ll find out if he’s right very soon!Word from the White House....As City traders grab a quick sandwich before the US jobs report (oh the glamour!), here’s a look at the markets.A reminder of how the US monthly job-creation figures have bounced around in recent months:The London stock exchange is holding onto most of its early gains, as City traders turn their attention across the Atlantic.Huawei’s CFO, Meng Wanzhou, is expected at a bail hearing in Canada later today. That might yield more information about why she was arrested, and whether she’ll be extradited to the US.Mihir Kapadia of Sun Global Investments says investors are worried that Meng’s arrest will destabilise US-China relations.China and the US continue to have frosty relations and this has seen investors prefer to stay away than get involved in what has proven to be a volatile market for quite some time now. This reversed the hope felt earlier in the week after it was announced the US would delay tariffs on China in the aim of making progress but it is now clear that this negativity will last until the new year.”A strong report might rock markets, as it would put pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in 2019. But weak job creation, and paltry earnings growth, could force the Fed to leave borrowing costs alone - which is good for equities.The Bank of England is already under fire over its warning about a no-deal Brexit. But it now faces another storm.Top officials from Venezuela have flown to London, to ask for 14 tonnes of their gold back. The Press Association has the details:The Bank is reportedly due to meet Calixto Ortega Sanchez, president of the Venezuelan Central Bank, and Simon Zerpa, the Venezuelan minister of finance, over the repatriation of 550 million US dollars (431 million) of gold. The Bank is the second largest depository of gold and has been holding Venezuela’s gold deposits since the 1980s. Andrew Lewer MP wrote to the Bank and the Treasury, criticising the move, saying a meeting “would pose significant reputational risk to the Bank and may be in violation of US Treasury imposed sanctions”. Mr Lewer said Mr Zerpa has been sanctioned by the US Treasury Department and that Mr Ortega Sanchez “is not a legitimate president” of the Venezuelan Central Bank as his appointment “was not ratified by the National Assembly”. “It is entirely inappropriate for senior officials of the Bank of England to meet with an inidual who has been placed on the US sanctions list for reasons of corruption. To treat with such an inidual would threaten the reputation of both the Bank of England and the Government as a whole,” Mr Lewer said. Although the markets are up today, fears over the global economy haven’t gone away.Royal Bank of Canada have cautioned that Chinese trade data due out on Saturday should be watched very closely, for signs that export growth have dropped.There is compelling evidence that exports, which have surprised significantly to the upside in the last three months, have been boosted by front-loading ahead of successive tranches of tariffs.But as the chart shows, there is potential for a much sharper weakening, this month or in the coming one to three months. Exports in the sectors first affected by tariffs (steel and aluminium) are already falling from their June peak.The FTSE 250 index, which contains smaller UK-focused companies, is also recovering today.It told shareholders this morning that sales and profits are in line with expectations, and that its Warhammer business is in “great shape in our core markets.”But while demand for GW’s intricately-designed Cataphractii Terminators, Taurox armoured personnel carriers and chainsword-toting missionaries is holding up now, an economic shock could change that.Last week, company founder Ian Livingstone warned that Brexit could destabilise the UK’s gaming sector, which contributes around £2bn to the UK economy per year.Paul Donovan of UBS Wealth Management believes the threat of new US tariffs on Chinese goods caused Thursday’s sell-off.But on the upside, he reckons today’s non-farm payroll jobs report will show American workers are in demand.Equity markets had a bad day on Thursday. The fear of additional US trade taxes is really not being well received, and investors seem to see the risk as rising.Otherwise, economic data was generally pretty good. Today’s US employment report is more likely to show firms struggling to find people to hire, than a lack of jobs available. Ralf Preusser, head of rates research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, says recent market instability is mainly due to concerns about the underlying global economy.That includes the impact of the US-China trade dispute, and worries that we are approaching the end of the economic cycle (ie, heading towards a recession)Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Preusser explains that the markets are paying “particular attention” to the Federal Reserve, to see how US central bankers handle the situation.Will the Fed recognise these fears, and try to engineer a soft landing (by being more cautious about rate hikes)? Or will they press on, given that economic data suggests the US economy isn’t really slowing at all, he explains.Consumer-facing firms, telecoms, tech and industrial companies are leading the rally in London:Good news! £27bn has been wiped back onto the value of Britain’s biggest companies this morning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93ede7f5409a5a4930e3fcfafe00b616d7417680/15_18_1749_1050/master/1749.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0bca59f390ca1e79d545e9763aa8b4e3","title":"jeremy corbyn general election brexit labour theresa may","story":"The botched Brexit deal that Theresa May has put to parliament this week is a monumental and damaging failure for our country. Instead of the sensible agreement the prime minister could have negotiated, it is a worst-of-all-worlds deal that works for nobody, whether they voted leave or remain.Instead of taking back control, it gives up control. Instead of protecting jobs and living standards, it puts them at risk by failing to put in place the basis for frictionless trade. For two and a half years the Conservatives have been negotiating with themselves, rather than the European Union. The result has been a lockdown withdrawal agreement, which ties Britain either into extending the transition phase at unknown cost – or tips us into a lopsided backstop agreement from which there is no independent exit. As the legal advice the prime minister tried to prevent us from seeing this week spells out, the backstop would “endure indefinitely” without the say-so of the EU.What that means in practice is that the wish list of the government’s “future partnership” agreement with the EU would remain just that, without the leverage to get a long-term and effective trade deal. Meanwhile, Britain would have no say in either its own customs arrangements or key market regulations. While workers’ rights would be allowed to fall behind, restrictions on state aid to industry would be locked in.May claims this is just an insurance policy. But it’s now clear the backstop is at the heart of her deal. It would leave Britain with no say in a humiliating halfway house which we couldn’t leave without the EU’s permission. There is no precedent I am aware of for a British government signing up to an international treaty it cannot withdraw from without the agreement of other countries. It is clearly unacceptable.The only reason the government has agreed such a convoluted package is to manage the warring factions of the Tory party. But it has failed. Instead it has united Conservative leavers and remainers, the DUP and every opposition party against it.This dreadful deal must be defeated when it is put to the vote next week. We are working with MPs and parties across the House of Commons not only to ensure it is rejected, but also to prevent any possibility of a no-deal outcome.But its defeat cannot be taken for granted. In an effort to drag Tory MPs back onside, May is claiming that defeat for her deal means no deal or no Brexit, because there is no viable alternative. That is false. Labour’s alternative plan would unlock the negotiations for our future relationship with the EU and allow us to move away from such a damaging backstop.A new, comprehensive customs union with the EU, with a British say in future trade deals, would strengthen our manufacturing sector and give us a solid base for industrial renewal under the next Labour government, especially for our held-back communities. It would remove the threat of different parts of the UK being subject to separate regulations. And it would deal with the large majority of problems the backstop is designed to solve.Second, a new and strong relationship with the single market that gives us frictionless trade, and the freedom to rebuild our economy and expand our public services – while setting migration policies to meet the needs of the economy, not fuelling xenophobia with phoney immigration targets or thresholds – makes far more sense than the prime minister’s dismal deal.Lastly, we want to see guarantees that existing EU rights at work, environmental standards and consumer protections will become a benchmark to build on – not fall behind and undercut other countries at our people’s expense. These rights and protections, whether on chlorinated chicken or paid holidays, are what people actually want. But the government is determined to trade them away in a race to the bottom.Labour has very different priorities. Our alternative plan would ensure an open border in Ireland, provide security for investment, give our manufacturing sector a springboard for renewal, ensure we have the powers to rebuild our economy and public services and guarantee world-beating support for workers, consumers and our environment. We are absolutely committed to internationalist cooperation and anti-racist solidarity across Europe, in or out of the EU, and determined to ensure opportunities for students to study in other countries are protected.Unlike the Norway-plus option now being canvassed among MPs, our plan would not leave Britain as an across-the-board rule-taker of EU regulations without a say. It’s a plan that can be negotiated with the EU, even at this late stage, with most of the building blocks already in place. The EU has shown it is prepared to renegotiate even more complex agreements than this, such as the Lisbon treaty. And ours is a plan I believe could command a majority in parliament and bring the country together.The stakes could not be higher next week. If the prime minister’s deal is defeated, the government will have lost its majority on the most important issue facing the country and lost its ability to govern. The best outcome in those circumstances would be to let the country decide on the way ahead and the best team to lead it. That means a general election.In the past, a defeat of such seriousness as May now faces would have meant an automatic election. But if under the current rules we cannot get an election, all options must be on the table. Those should include Labour’s alternative and, as our conference decided in September, the option of campaigning for a public vote to break the deadlock. Two years ago, people voted remain because they wanted an open, international relationship with Europe and a multicultural society. Many voted leave out of anger at the way the political class had left them behind, with crumbling infrastructure and low-paid, insecure jobs. Our job is to unite people with a plan that works for the whole country.Given the decisions taken in parliament this week, it should now be easier to build support for an alternative plan to bring the country together. The government’s deal must not stand. In those circumstances parliament has shown it is ready to take control, and Labour will give the leadership the country needs.• Jeremy Corbyn, the MP for Islington North, is the leader of the Labour party"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/131f3e4df6ef614b532028588481aee2466d0898/169_67_3752_2252/master/3752.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53d0f2490f3213d7600d02f1a2ee278c","title":"in the febrile atmosphere of brexit the far right is waiting to pounce","story":"Intent on fomenting hatred, supporters of ‘Tommy Robinson’ and Ukip are using Brexit uncertainty to advance their causeIt’s been a busy week for Ukip.

Members of the hooligan-led street movement, the Democratic Football Lads Alliance (DFLA), are now allied with Ukip too.Batten has brought the worst tendencies within his party to the fore.

Those might now seem mild compared to the rantings of its current leader about Muslims and “rape gangs” at a time of rising anti-Muslim hate crimes, but Ukip has always flirted with such bigotry.Batten and Yaxley-Lennon are seeking to take Ukip even further to the right. Professional agitating about “betrayal” is now big business, of course. There is a real danger of the far right – which now includes Ukip – attempting to weaponise Brexit to bring in new support to this racist agenda. It’s unlikely Batten will advertise the serious political and financial backing that has come to support his new “special personal adviser on rape gangs and prison conditions and prison reform”. Yaxley-Lennon is estimated to have made over £2m in donations this summer, and stood to rake in another £1m during an aborted US tour.Yaxley-Lennon now links through to a network that includes Steve Bannon (who is struggling to get his anti-EU “movement” off the ground), the seven Republican members of congress who invited him to his US speaking tour last month, and the dollars that have been flowing in from the former English Defence League leader’s legal backers, Daniel Pipes’ Middle East Forum in the US and far-right alternative media outfit Rebel Media, run by Ezra Levant, in Canada.In the run-up to this demonstration, Farage quit the party that he, with Batten, helped to found – ironically over the extreme path he himself set them on. He said: “The very idea of Tommy Robinson being at the centre of the Brexit debate is too awful to contemplate.” Well, quite. But the gall of the man in walking away from the beast he helped create is staggering. After all, it was Farage who fronted the hugely offensive “Breaking Point” poster campaign during the EU referendum who backed the anti-Muslim Alternative for Germany (AfD) party and who showed open support for Front National leader Marine le Pen in the French presidential elections. Not to mention he employed then-Breitbart London editor Raheem Kassam as his close adviser.Given the violence that erupted at Free Tommy demonstrations this summer, it’s hard to rule out the possibility of anger erupting again among Yaxley-Lennon’s supporters. After all, he spent four years dragging his English Defence League thugs around our towns and cities, costing UK taxpayers in excess of £10m in policing costs.At an earlier Day for Freedom demo in May – involving Yaxley-Lennon, Kassam, Batten, the DFLA and others – speaker after speaker decried their apparent lack of free speech, while preaching from a stage equipped with video screens and marching through the political heart of the UK: bizarre, but another example of how the far right weaponises such debates. That event also descended into violence. Despite all this, Yaxley-Lennon’s well-funded backers in the US later flew in Arizona congressman Paul Gosar to speak at a Free Tommy event in July, while Donald Trump’s ambassador for religious freedom lobbied the UK ambassador in Washington over Yaxley-Lennon’s imprisonment on contempt of court charges.• Nick Ryan, director of communications, Hope Not Hate"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb7536adf76b6e7bfb5f29f69dace7270251bd40/0_207_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ee8b1618176d55f5432e420a9d70ed7","title":"how do you spend your time when youre stuck at home in winter","story":"With long nights and wet weather we’d like to hear how you stop yourself from going stir-crazy when you’re stuck at homeFrom Almaty to Zagreb, from London (England) to London (Ontario), the days are getting colder, the nights are getting longer and the clouds are getting lower.How do you cope when you can’t face the gloom, the rain, the wind or the snow, yet have already spent far too many hours at home?

Should her latest egg with her longtime lover, Akeakamai, hatch, fledge and take to the open sea, it will be her 37th.Wisdom was first banded in 1956 by biologist Chandler Robbins, who estimated that she was about five years old at the time. The biologist and bird met again in 2002 when he went to band her and recognized that she had been one of the 8,400 birds he recorded during his first season, 46 years previously.Albatrosses are known for their long life s and often outlive their researchers – Robbins died in 2017 at the age 98 – but what makes Wisdom unique is that researchers have been able to monitor her habits for so long. She may or may not be the oldest wild bird, but she is the oldest known wild bird, and her habits have been lovingly documented by the fish and wildlife service over social media.And because so much of her background and history is known, researchers are learning more about her species by observing her. To a human, 68 years old may seem preposterous to still be laying eggs, but Wisdom and the other few documented examples of albatrosses in their 50s and 60s who do not appear to have trouble breeding at that age show the situation may be different for birds, said Beth Flint, a USFWS wildlife biologist.Like many albatrosses, Wisdom returns nearly every year to the place she was born for nesting and mating. Midway Atoll, a two-and-a-half-sq-mile island belonging to the US that was the site of the decisive Battle of Midway during the second world war, remains mostly uninhabited when it comes to humans. But come winter, more than 1m Laysan albatrosses flock to the beaches to nest.Albatrosses take mating and nesting seriously, forming bonds with their mates for life. The Cornell lab describes their courtship displays as elaborate they include “coordinated movements in which the birds touch bills, spread one or both wings, bob their heads, place their bill under one wing, and pause with their bill pointed at the sky”.Once they’ve met their mates, the birds will rendezvous at the same nest site every winter – and go through some iteration of the courtship process again, Flint said.“There is preening and a dance,” she said. “They’re very tactile animals. They sit closely and preen each other and snuggle. We can’t know what they’re feeling, but they exhibit the kind of behaviors that reinforce a bond and a connection.”Researchers first noted Wisdom’s relationship with Akeakamai in 2006 and are unsure if she had other mates before Akeakamai. But albatrosses are believers in co-parenting, and will take turns incubating an egg, caring for the chick and foraging for food over the ocean. Should this egg survive, Wisdom and Akeakamai will spend about seven months on Midway Atoll incubating and raising their chick.Albatrosses lay only one egg a year, and because it’s such a lengthy and energy-consuming process to both incubate and raise a healthy chick, most do not do it annually. While researchers are still collecting data as to the frequency in which Laysan albatrosses breed, Wisdom “does seem to be exceptional in that she has bred for a number of years consecutively and has not taken a break”, Flint said.Wisdom has managed to raise a number of chicks who have gone on to raise a number of chicks of their own, she has also faced hardship. In 2015, her egg was reported missing, which biologists say is just what happens sometimes.But her fertile contributions to the continuation of her species make every homecoming a celebration for scientists. Last year, they observed a chick that she fledged in 2001 setting up a nest just a few feet away. It was the first time one of her chicks had been documented returning to nest.“Midway Atoll’s habitat doesn’t just contain millions of birds, it contains countless generations and families of albatrosses,” Kelly Goodale, a fish and wildlife service refuge biologist, said in a blogpost. “If you can imagine when Wisdom returns home, she is likely surrounded by what were once her chicks and potentially their chicks.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cafbab96d5753a31e244def3ade3474215d5900/244_97_966_579/master/966.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae72cf66ae4ceb130e14861322a7a567","title":"how to wear strictly come dancing tess daly claudia winkleman jess cartner morley","story":"Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman wear grownup party clothes: block colour jumpsuits or little black dresses, long dresses with splits or boxy minisI don’t really see the point in going out on a Saturday night between October and Christmas. What could you possibly do, where could you possibly go – crucially, what could you possibly wear – that would be more glamorous than Strictly? Camaraderie, dancefloor elation, gossip, the full Saturday night package, is delivered to you at home so you don’t have to move. Bliss.In the unlikely event that I do leave the house on a Strictly Saturday, I take the dress code with me. Not the maribou-edged nudity of the dancefloor, obviously. Instead, the dress code that applies to presenters Tess and Claudia. Every week, those two wear the grownup party clothes: block colour jumpsuits or little black dresses, long dresses with splits or boxy minis. In the Strictly narrative, the dancing couples are all hormones and tears, babbling a mile a minute about how tonight is the most amazing thing that has happened to them like alcopop-fuelled teenagers. Tess and Claudia bring a little grownup perspective, with (respectively) a steadying arm around the shoulder and a dose of wry humour. While everyone around them couples up in Strictly’s weekly parade of state-licensed infidelity, Tess and Claudia are each other’s constant wingmen.This is not the place for an in-depth discussion of the presenters’ respective aesthetics. (That place, in case you are wondering, is my sofa.) The topline takeaway from the Tess-and-Claudia look is how to hold your own when the glamour stakes are raised, without feeling like you have to go full pelt into the maribou trims.At the risk of sounding 567 years old, bare shoulders don’t appeal at this time, especially since most thermostats in restaurants and party venues seem to be set for the comfort of a man in a shirt and a jacket, not a woman in a strapless dress. So a skirt that is fancy enough to pair with a polo neck is a dream. Get your dancing shoes, and you are good to go. Or, of course, to stay put.Styling: Melanie Wilkinson.

He realized that short skirts and blond hair combined with heavy doses of racist fearmongering and hysterical patriotism could hook a cable TV audience of mostly old white male Americans, especially the type who thought of themselves as hardcore conservatives but who in fact were eager to get on board with the zaniest conspiracy theories – Barack Obama is a Muslim born in Kenya – as long as it vindicated and reinforced their pinched worldview.Then Ailes turned around and scammed those same viewers by showing them promos for dubious products such as gold coins alongside ads for products those viewers actually needed: weight loss, psoriasis treatment, insurance and portable oxygen. The proceeds, plus a mountain of fees from cable and satellite distributors – to the tune of $4.42bn in quarterly revenue for Fox’s cable ision – were passed straight up the corporate chain to Rupert Murdoch and sons.It can be argued that Ailes’s political products were even more spurious than the emergency gold. Recent work by the Stanford academics Gregory J Martin and Ali Yurukoglu has indicated that Fox News was stunningly successful at helping to elect George W Bush twice, and the network remade itself as a state media arm for Donald Trump, two presidencies devoted to making sure rich people – not the core Fox News viewership – have the tools to stay that way.Behind the scenes, we now know, Ailes was engaging in serial sexual harassment, and he presided over a culture that marginalized and demeaned women, the extent of which was a shocking discovery when it came to light through a lawsuit brought in 2016 by the former host Gretchen Carlson – shocking even given the blatant game of sexual objectification and titillation on display in most every Fox News broadcast.But there was another side to Ailes, who died in May 2017. He was more than unusually good at television, and more than unusually committed to owning the liberals, and he knew a thing or two about human nature, and he was very ambitious, and he loved to be a star, and he never claimed to be a journalist. And you can’t argue with the popularity of the network he built or its influence.Thus duty-bound, one wades into the Ailes life story, which is thankfully told with both journalistic verve and human sensitivity in the new documentary Divide and Conquer, directed by Alexis Bloom, who won a Producers Guild of America award for her 2013 film We Steal Secrets: The Story of WikiLeaks.Should you miss Divide and Conquer, be advised that it is merely the leading edge of a breaking wave of cultural content centered on Ailes, with upcoming offerings including a Showtime series with Naomi Watts and Russell Crowe and an Adam McKay-directed film starring John Lithgow as Ailes and Charlize Theron as former Fox host Megyn Kelly, whose own story of harassment helped end Ailes’s career.The Divide and Conquer film-makers set out to balance the story of Ailes’s brilliance with the reality of his corrosiveness, said Bloom.“I think the two things coexist in reality, and you have to find some way to make them coexist in the film,” she said. “It’s not true to life if you come out that he’s just pernicious and monstrous. Neither that he was a genius. He was both.”There’s a debate to be had about whether the film gets that balance right, considering the havoc wreaked by Fox News on the country, embodied by the current president. Political scientists have measured rapidly growing political polarization in the United States which has in turn been linked to the rise of siloed media of which Fox News is the apotheosis. That polarization has diminished the quality of the elected leadership while breeding a sense of alienation and suspicion among the populace.While Divide and Conquer does not go deep on the changes wrought to America by Fox News, the film does a good job of getting former Fox News personalities to speak about Ailes, including Glenn Beck, whose interview on camera is a masterpiece of pseudo-insightful mumbo-jumbo.“It’s easy to make somebody into a monster,” Beck says. “It’s hard to see that you’re on that path, too.” Unless … you aren’t?“It wasn’t easy to get access,” said Bloom. “We never thought it was going to be easy. But those who had left Fox – it became easier when he died, because people really feared his litigiousness.“People who’ve worked there have described it as a cult, and many are aware of the kind of repressive aspects of the workplace. But they’re incredibly well-paid, and Roger was famous for taking care of people.”The film vividly tells the story of the lesser-known passages in Ailes’s life, including his foreshadowing work as president of the cable channel America’s Talking and his later, unsuccessful effort to jerk around the Hudson Valley town of Cold Spring when he moved there.In a brilliant move, the film-makers cast a genderqueer actor, Babette Bombshell, as Ailes’s body double, for a scattering of re-enactment scenes. It has the ring of poetic justice, given Fox News’s record of homophobia and fear-mongering on transgender issues.But most powerfully, the film puts the camera on women telling their stories of how Ailes sexually harassed them. The stories have previously been printed, but it is galvanizing to meet the women onscreen and watch them as reveal the true story of Ailes, who resigned amid accusations of harassment by more than 20 women.People in TV are enamored by what they do, and the film leans heavily on television people, producer types, speaking in hushed tones about “the genius of Roger” and his knack for camera positioning and closeups and the number of seats in the audience.“There is a Citizen Kane quality to his life,” somebody says at one point, and at another a comparison between Ailes and John Wayne is supported by footage of the movie star. We also learn that Ailes was a hemophiliac whose “daily life was a fear of annihilation” which supposedly “allowed him to understand the fears of other people”.Or maybe he was just an uncommonly talented and unscrupulous television producer. Do we really care what made Roger Ailes tick?“The big disappointment was that he used his talent and his media savvy to build something that drove a wedge,” says Felycia Sugarman, a former producer at Ailes communications, in the film. “To me that’s pretty devastating.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b84d4af57a3a96a46bec927f7c128da14bb3987e/0_100_3517_2112/master/3517.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc48dabc37fab93a4c4eb38a669f3d11","title":"kevin hart steps down as oscars host after three days of controversy","story":"Actor apologises to LGBTQ community for past ‘insensitive words’ and says he does not want ‘to be a distraction’ Kevin Hart has announced he is stepping down as host of next year’s Oscars ceremony following an outcry over perceived homophobic comments and tweets from the comedian.On Friday Hart posted an apology to the LGBTQ community on Twitter for his past “insensitive words” and confirmed he would not take on the gig, so as not to be a “distraction”.“I have made the choice to step down from hosting this year’s Oscars,” wrote Hart, who as well as his stand-up work is the star of films like Ride Along and Jumanji.“This is because I do not want to be a distraction on a night that should be celebrated by so many amazing talented artists. I sincerely apologize to the LGBTQ community for my insensitive words from my past.“I’m sorry that I hurt people. I am evolving and want to continue to do so. My goal is to bring people together not tear us apart. Much love and appreciation to the Academy. I hope we can meet again.”Just hours earlier, Hart, who is currently in Australia, posted a video to Instagram saying he had received a call from the Academy telling him to apologise or he would be removed as host.In the video, Hart said he would not apologise.“I chose to pass, I passed on the apology. The reason I chose to pass is because I’ve addressed this several times, this is not the first time this has come up, I’ve addressed this… I’m not going to continue to go back and tap into the days of old when I’ve moved on and I’m in a completely different space in my life,” he said.“Regardless, Academy, I’m thankful and appreciative of the opportunity. If it goes away no harm no foul.”It was announced on Tuesday that Hart would host the Oscars ceremony in February 2019, which is considered one of the most prestigious but difficult jobs in showbusiness.“I am blown away simply because this has been a goal on my list for a long time,” Hart wrote on his Instagram page.Hart would have been one of a few black Oscar hosts in the event’s history, after Chris Rock, Whoopi Goldberg and Sammy Davis Jr.However, the choice quickly prompted a backlash after a significant number of Hart’s tweets in which he used homophobic slurs were re-posted on Twitter. A video from a 2010 standup special in which Hart delivered an extended joke based on the fear his three-year-old son would be gay also resurfaced."},{"url":null,"title":"marvel avengers 4 endgame first trailer released","story":"First footage from the fourth film in the popular superhero series, and sequel to Infinity War, makes its debut onlineThe trailer for the fourth Avengers film, Avengers: Endgame, has been launched onto the internet.Conceived as a direct sequel to, and filmed at the same time as, Avengers: Infinity War, the film is due to pick up at the stunning finish of its predecessor, as supervillain Thanos appears to have wiped out half of all life (as well a considerable numbers of superheroes) after activating the Infinity Gauntlet.Anticipation for the film is huge, after Infinity War became the highest grossing film of 2018 (though Black Panther did better in the US alone), and like Infinity War, the film is directed by Anthony and Joe RussoIt is due for release in the UK on 26 April, and in the US on 3 May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8800d5b3bee029c767b3ae2153b8f87f3da4c6a/0_0_3297_1979/master/3297.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45a6637ba0a3016b4f1a29a0d5bb2ea4","title":"move over peter parker the new spider man ushers in a bold superhero era","story":"Throughout film history, superheroes have been white and male. But after the success of Wonder Woman and Black Panther, all that is changing – and fast‘Really? We now have a half-black, half-Hiic, gay Spider-Man?” This was the reaction of conservative broadcaster Glenn Beck in 2011, upon learning that Marvel was introducing a new Spider-Man named Miles Morales, who was not white. Morales wasn’t gay, it turned out, but still, the move was seen by some critics as a publicity stunt, or pandering to political correctness. Beck blamed the Obamas, which was actually not far off the mark. The new Spider-Man represented “the ersity, in background and experience, of the 21st century”, explained the Marvel editor-in-chief, Axel Alonso, including its “president of mixed heritage”. But Beck also linked the news to a speech by Michelle Obama in which she declared that Americans were “gonna have to change their traditions”, implying that to mess with the US’s history of white, male superheroism was to undermine its very foundations.This goes some way to explaining why we had to wait another seven years (and two more white, male movie Spider-Men) before Hollywood was ready to put Morales on the screen. But, here he is at last, in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, and most people are happy to see him. Into the Spider-Verse is visibly different from your standard-issue superhero movie. It is rendered in a distinctive, vibrant animation – part-computer-animated, part-hand-drawn – that is closer to comic-book art than live-action cinema, and of a piece with its fresh, young hero. Unlike nerdy Peter Parker, the original Spider-Man, Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore) is a streetwise Brooklyn kid, the son of an African-American police officer and a Puerto Rican nurse. He sprays graffiti on the subways and sticker-bombs the streets, while his playlist leans towards hip-hop and R\u0026ampB.Into the Spider-Verse is further evidence of how much the superhero-movie terrain has shifted as a result of two seismic events. First, 2017’s Wonder Woman, which proved that not only was a female-led superhero movie commercially viable, but that audiences were hungry for it: she was the highest-grossing superhero last year in the US. And secondly, there was this year’s colossally successful Black Panther, which did the same for superheroes of colour. Far from being a liability, ersity is now a money-spinner. Which means we are due to see a great deal more of it. So much, in fact, that the superhero movie schedule looks like a ersity arms race.Going up against Into the Spider-Verse this week is Aquaman, the latest release by Marvel’s arch-rivals DC. Again, Aquaman is not quite business as usual. In his 76-year history in comic books, Aquaman – whose mother is from the underwater city of Atlantis – was drawn as a fair-haired, light-skinned Nordic type. In the movie, he is played by Jason Momoa, who grew up in the US and has Hawaiian, European and Native American ancestry. With his dark complexion, long hair and liberal body tattoos, Momoa’s Aquaman looks more like a Pacific island surfer dude. “It’s cool that there’s a brown-skinned superhero,” Momoa said in 2015.No doubt mindful of DC’s success with Wonder Woman, Marvel launches its first female-led title in March. Brie Larson will play Captain Marvel, whose pivotal role in the studio’s lucrative Avengers saga was trailed at the end of this year’s Infinity War. Next year also sees X-Men spin-off Dark Phoenix, led by Sophie Turner and Jennifer Lawrence. And poor old Scarlett Johansson, who has soldiered away as Marvel’s Smurfette for almost a decade, will finally get her solo Black Widow movie.DC, meanwhile, has a Wonder Woman sequel in the works, plus Cyborg, its African American superhero, and the cumbersomely titled Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn). The latter is an all-female superhero team-up, including non-white characters played by Jurnee Smollett-Bell and Rosie Perez. Well done, DC – but here comes Marvel announcing plans for its own all-female spin-off to Into the Spider-Verse. The studio is also working on Black Panther 2. And just this week, Marvel revealed plans for the first standalone Asian-led superhero movie, centred on its martial arts master Shang-Chi.Every week, it seems, one or other of the comic-book empires announces a new, ersity-championing project: Asian-American director Chloé Zhao has been hired to direct Marvel’s next generation of superheroes, the Eternals Ava DuVernay is on board to do likewise for DC’s New Gods. Meanwhile, Marvel’s original old, white guys – Iron Man, Thor and Captain America – are preparing for retirement, and DC’s Batman and Superman movies seem to be on the back burner.The benefits of having a culturally inclusive pantheon of superheroes barely need pointing out, but perhaps Marvel mastermind Kevin Feige put it best. “Black Panther’s not real, but he represents real hopes, and real dreams, and real representation,” he said. “A lot of people said: ‘Wait a minute, this is a hero that looks like me.’ And the importance of that really can’t be understated.”But let’s not forget that the movie business is a business. Marvel had already made 17 movies in the past decade with white, male leads before Black Panther, honouring a Hollywood tradition that extends back to Christopher Reeve’s Superman in 1978. “As much as it would be lovely to think that both companies are really committed to ersity, if Marvel had lost money on Black Panther, we would not be seeing a Shang-Chi movie,” says Graeme McMillan, who writes on the superhero genre for the Hollywood Reporter. “If DC’s Wonder Woman had tanked, we probably would not be seeing Captain Marvel. The fact that they are successful is what means we are seeing more of this.”It hasn’t always gone smoothly: Marvel tied itself in knots with Doctor Strange, where Tilda Swinton was cast to portray the Ancient One, a mentor character written in the comics as an Asian man. Marvel cast Swinton to avoid the stereotype of the “wise old Asian”, it argued. In doing so, it brought accusations of “whitewashing” – depriving an actor of colour of an opportunity by replacing their character with a white one. Similar problems arose with its TV superhero Iron Fist – a white American who was better at kung-fu than the Asians.But as well as changing the culture, these movies are materially changing an industry whose white male dominance is even more pronounced off the screen than on it. It is hardly a coincidence that Black Panther was directed by a black person (Ryan Coogler) and Wonder Woman by a woman (Patty Jenkins). Studios are aware that their commitments to ersity will ring false unless they are matched by equivalent personnel changes. Captain Marvel is co-written and directed by husband-and-wife team Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden, the latter of whom becomes the first female director of a Marvel movie. DC’s Birds of Prey is to be directed by Chinese-American Cathy Yan its writer is Anglo-Taiwanese Christina Hodson. After that, Hodson’s next job is writing DCWarners’ proposed Batgirl movie. Warners originally hired Joss Whedon – director of the first two Avengers movies and all-round pop-culture supremo – to write Batgirl, but he departed the project this February confessing: “It took me months to realise I really didn’t have a story.” Maybe his being a 50-year-old man had something to do with that.Don’t expect this new, inclusive superhero universe to unfold without a hitch, though. For one thing, there is always the possibility that so many new films will lead to superhero fatigue. There is also the fact that other well-established, fan-friendly franchises, such as Star Wars and Doctor Who, have attracted ugly criticism for incorporating female or minority characters or “politically correct” stories. The comics world is no different. Following in the footsteps of Miles Morales, Marvel and DC have ersified their comic book lines, introducing female successors to Iron Man and Thor, a black Captain America, a gay Green Lantern and a female Muslim superhero (Ms Marvel).A backlash has emerged, including a “comicsgate” movement that has protested against “leftwing dominance” and “oppressive social justice warrior harassment”. Some, including Marvel’s own executives, have even blamed falling comic book sales on too much ersity. This theory is incorrect – two of the biggest-selling titles last year were Black Panther and Ms Marvel – but it does suggest a conflict between diehard, conservative-minded fans and general movie audiences.

But hot or cold? Brandy butter or cream? And does it matter which hand you eat it with?In 1733, the Gentleman’s Magazine carried a short reflection on mince pies – née Christmas pyes – that, among other observations, noted how puritanical Quakers swerved them on the basis that they are an “invention of the Scarlet Whore of Babylon, an Hodge-Podge of Superstition, Popery, the Devil and all his Works”.Sounds exciting, right? But, in 2018, the mince pie, subject of this month’s seasonal How to Eat (HTE), lacks that transgressive edge. We may buy a staggering 370m every Christmas but we also throw a shameful 74m away, indicative of how innocuous they now are. Any tingle of forgive-me-father-for-I-have-wolfed-four excitement has gone. Mince pies are mundane. We take them for granted.Part of the problem is that most shop-bought mince pies are clumsily spiced, collapsing air-pockets of disappointment. But this is a treat of diminishing returns for other reasons, too. We routinely abuse the mince pie. We fail to treat it with reverence. Which is where HTE – the series identifying how best to eat Britain’s favourite dishes – can help. Merry Christmas!As regular readers know, HTE is less a food column and more an examination of the misfiring engine in the once luxury saloon that is late capitalism. This supposed purring motor of perennial growth is now an old banger running on empty. Endless novelty is its only method of distracting us from its rusty, clanking malfunctions and the smoke belching from its exhaust. Nowhere is this truer than in mince pies. A 13th-century invention, their ideal form was established hundreds of years ago, but supermarkets must endlessly reinvent them in order to part a jaded, gullible public from its hard-earned.Iced pies, sloe gin-spiked pies, chocolate chip andor orange and cherry pies, crumble- or hazelnut-topped pies, plum, cinnamon and ginger pies, cranberry-mined pies: this is but a fragment of the long list of “mince pies” clearly created in an attempt to sell mince pies to people who do not like mince pies – spawning myriad culinary disasters in the process. Likewise, from brownies to baklava, magazine recipe writers redeploy mincemeat in endlessly ludicrous ways to offer us a twist on this classic. To paraphrase that great Salfordian sage, Shaun Ryder, it is twisting HTE’s melons, man.Repeated attempts to doughnut-ify or deep-fry the pie are also unnecessary, once we think past our drooling Pavlovian response to the words “deep fry”. In terms of foodie affectation, such splashy attempts to reinvent this wheel are topped only by those poseurs who insist you should be putting real meat in your mincemeat. These nose-to-tail outliers talk enthusiastically of blurring the distinction between sweet and savoury, a concept as reckless as crossing the streams in Ghostbusters.Even the supposed shortcrust versus puff pastry debate is overhyped, given that all reasonable people know that (unsweetened) shortcrust pastry is the correct casing.HTE tries to maintain a relaxed attitude to cooking and baking your own … anything. It is not always possible or preferable. But when the chef Jeremy Lee told the Independent in 2011 that commercial mince pies are “generally unspeakable”, he had a point. A point reinforced by this year’s Which? survey of Christmas foods, which found that, while there are diamonds in the rough (Asda’s Extra Special mince pies took its top spot), the general standard of pies is on the slide. The cost of butter and dried fruit is rising and manufacturers are increasingly stingy with these star ingredients. If you haven’t already been seduced by Iceland’s unlikely palm-free hook-up with Selfridges, home-baking your mince pies is a wise move. Go easy on those spices, though. A mince pie should not smell like the perfume counter in Boots.If you cannot heat your mince pie, it is better not to eat it. HTE is so adamant on this point that, for once, it will even license use of the microwave. It will heat your pie to thermonuclear temperatures, requiring ninja-like self-discipline as you allow it to cool to edible over three hours (timings approximate, inidual appliances will vary). But at least you will not have to eat a cold, stodgy puck of a pie, its pastry dry and brittle, its filling claggy, its aromas and flavours as faint as the chances of Theresa May’s Brexit deal passing in parliament.Heat transforms even the most half-arsed mince pie: butter and fats melt, pectin softens, scents are liberated. The whole thing takes on an almost supernatural lightness, as if the mince pie has been borne aloft by the oven’s hot draughts.Like Kendrick Lamar or Scott Walker, a great mince pie speaks for itself. It stands alone. It does not need any embellishment, no backing band, no guest verses on big pop hits. But there are a lot of middling mince pies out there, which can get monotonous over Christmas, and which need a little lubrication or, for the sake of variety, an added inflection of flavour. But tread carefully.Creme fraiche Supremely light and kissed with a lactic tang, creme fraiche is the hot mince pie’s most elegant cooling counterpoint.Single or double cream Either will grease the wheels, so to speak.Custard There is something magical about the contrast between hot mince pie and cold cream on the same plate. Custard, however, particularly in the first phases of Christmas, before gout sets in, can take the mince pie in an altogether gutsier, stickier, self-indulgent direction.Squirty cream “It’s better than nothing,” says your mum. She is wrong. This artificial abomination ruins anything it comes into contact with.Rum or brandy butter The only time alcohol works in food is when that alcohol is first cooked off, modulating the drink’s flavour. Raw alcohol is an aggressive, incoherent presence in any dessert, and particularly in the thick, creamy context of rum and brandy butters (top-shelf concoctions often made with rock-bottom brands), it creates a truly nauseating mouthful.Ice-cream Sounds good, in theory, but unlike cream (which we instinctively add judiciously), you will always add too much ice-cream until the whole thing becomes too sickly and too filling.Natural yoghurt It’s Christmas. Treat yourself. Keep this all-too-tart interloper away from your mince pies.Clotted cream Cream at its most extreme and proof that you really can have too much of a good thing.Blue cheese A slice of stilton with HTE’s mince pie, you say? Clearly this is something made up by mischievous internet trolls to fool innocent readers into trying it. It will ruin mince pies for you, for ever.The mince pie is the season’s emergency snack standby, frequently served ad hoc as friends, neighbours and relatives drop in. According to that hilarious satirical comedy creation andor renowned etiquette expert “William Hanson” (trigger warning: links to the Daily Mail), each guest should be given a napkin to catch their crumbs because, of course, nothing says: “Relax, make yourself at home,” like someone passive-aggressively warning you not to drop any mince pie on their carpet. If you are that uptight, hand plates around. Better still, go with the traditional serve, where everyone eats their mince pies with the little foil cup perched under their chin (useful to catch any major pieces of debris, but not too prissy), and then put the Hoover round later. What are a few crumbs between mates?Such informality is an alien concept to Hanson. For instance, rather than decline a second mince pie, he advises you take it home in a napkin so as not to offend your host. Should you come across anyone that easily offended, the better course of action is to decline that pie, bite that bullet and expunge that person from your social circle. They clearly have issues that it would take a lifetime of expensive therapy to unpack.Hanson further advises you should always eat a mince pie in your left hand. Not due to some ancient chivalric knights’ code (something about always being ready to defend yourself against killer ravens or dragons, HTE is imagining), but so that you can still shake hands with people. Key HTE tip: do not linger where people would expect you to prioritise polite mingling over a eating a pie. Of course, if serving your pie with cream you will require a side plate and a fork. A greater volume of liquid (eg custard) needs a bowl and a spoon. Do not try to cup it in your hands. That way madness lies.When unexpected visitors drop in (the horror!). In those moments of mid-afternoon peckishness between Christmas and new year, when your daily calorific intake has plateaued at a steady 6,000. As consolation when you arrive home from work at any point in December, wet, cold and thoroughly miserable, in desperate need of a little bump of sugar and self-care. On that blessed day, when – having spent the last week being dragged around Britain, including three days of high psycho-emotional tension at the in-laws – you can slump down on your own sofa and actually start to enjoy Christmas. The only bad news? You are back in work tomorrow.Champagne and mince pies is instant heartburn sherry and mince pies is too saccharine but good brandy is a fine foil for all that rich fruit and spice. Is alcohol really necessary, though? There is something about a good mug of strong tea, its tannins cleaning your mouth like a stiff-bristled brush on a patio, that – particularly when you are on a three- or four-pie bender – is the most effective way of resetting your palate for the next assault.So, mince pies, how do you eat yours?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fc71e2cd4f1ef68dc845b11294c4d2021220490/134_55_2747_1649/master/2747.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a030a65ca4dd51ad12cbfd98867bbd3","title":"arsenal nitrous oxide ozil aubameyang spoken to responsibilities","story":"Arsenal have responded to footage showing some of their players apparently inhaling nitrous oxide in a London nightclub by saying those involved will be spoken to and reminded of their responsibilities.A number of players, including Mesut Özil, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Alexandre Lacazette and Mattéo Guendouzi, appear to inhale nitrous oxide – also referred to as laughing gas or hippy crack – in footage published by the Sun.The incident is reported to have taken place in August, before the start of Arsenal’s season.

In the last two matches we played well for 55, 60 minutes, then the first difficulty we went in blackout. In the first match (against Fulham) we were lucky because they didn’t score. In the last match (at Wolves) we were a little bit unlucky. For the opponents, five shots, only two on target.

Email yer thoughts to Nick.Miller.casual@the, or tweet @NickMiller79“Vincent Kompany has no idea what he’s talking about,” writes JR. “I think I speak for the majority when I say that I find Jose Mourinho exceptionally offensive.”I was watching Ederson’s warm-up on Tuesday before their game against Watford, and for 10 minutes he practised kicking from his hands to a coach on the halfway line. His accuracy was absolutely astonishing. The coach barely had to move his feet to collect the ball. During the game City seemed to use the same combination again and again as they played out of defence: Ederson passes to left-sided centre-back (Kompany on Tuesday), who is rapidly closed down and goes back to Ederson, who hits first-time to Fernandinho in the middle, who also has opponents bustling around him, and he passes back to Stones on the right of the area, at which point the opponents have run out of appetite for high pressing and Stones has space to bring the ball out. Though City were extremely dominant and Watford didn’t force him into a great deal of action I thought Ederson was outstanding, and contributed massively to his team’s victory (including with some shameless time-wasting towards the end).Vincent Kompany has taken an apparent swipe at José Mourinho among others by saying that Eden Hazard finally has an attack-minded manager at Chelsea who can get the best out of him:I think he was due an offensive manager. I can’t remember him having that a lot in his career. Eventually a manager like this is what he needed, no matter where he was, to get the best out of him. The future is bright for him.News of another busted ACL, the third of the morning, comes from Arsenal, who have just put this statement on their website:Further to the injury sustained during our match at Manchester United on Wednesday night, we can confirm that Rob Holding has ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament of his left knee.Rob will undergo surgery to repair this in the coming days. The rehabilitation process is expected to take between six to nine months. Everyone at the club will now be working as hard as we can to ensure Rob is back on the pitch as soon as possible.Southampton’s new manager, Ralph Hasenhuettl, has hinted at major squad surgery to come in January as he attempts to drag the team out of a Mark Hughes-inspired relegation mire:I think the squad is very big. So we have a lot of positions where we have too many players and maybe one or the other is leaving us and we bring something new. I have spoken with the chairman about that and they do everything to help my wishes. The first target is to get out of this relegation zone. It is tough with our schedule over Christmas.

My lemon-spiked roasties accompany – you really can’t go wrong.This is a centrepiece of a tart that that really makes a star of the beautiful wedges of roasted squash, so if you can find them, buy crown prince or onion squash, which will look amazing – though butternut will do.

Add a little more water if it feels dry, and keep blitzing until the dough comes together in a ball it should be a buttery pastry and not feel overly crumbly. Wrap the dough in clingfilm or greaseproof paper and put in the fridge.Meanwhile, make the filling. Whisk the flour into one of the eggs to make a paste. Add the remaining eggs one at a time, mixing well. Whisk in the cream and milk, then strain this mixture into a bowl to remove any lumps of flour.

It was 2009 and I was 25, working as a musical director for a circus in the UK. I’d travelled alone from Gloucestershire to the village of Gornja Grabovica in Serbia, on a mission to learn Roma-style accordion. A week or so into my two-month trip, a friend called Dusan took me to meet his cousin Branko, who he said was one of the country’s best violinists.When we arrived, Branko came out of the house he shared with his aunt and grandmother, wearing a white vest and jeans. I don’t remember thinking he was attractive, but for some reason I took a photo of him that I still have today.We all sat around a table in the garden. I didn’t speak a word of Serbian and Branko knew no English, so Dusan struggled to translate. Branko was shy it wasn’t every day an English woman turned up at his house. The following day I went back, and we played music together late into the night. We did this several more times, quickly developing a strong connection. It was totally platonic, however nothing else entered my head, partly because he had a girlfriend.After two months I returned to Britain. I was still determined to learn Roma accordion, but for the next couple of years I was busy touring with my work. Then, in July 2011, I had a few weeks off, and felt I was being called back to Serbia.As soon as Branko heard I was back in Gornja Grabovica, he came straight to see me. With Dusan translating again, he told me he’d thought about me every day since I had left. He had broken up with his girlfriend months earlier. It felt unreal, like magic. It was exciting to acknowledge our connection, but unusual to feel something for each other without being able to communicate fully.That night we went to an igranke, or dance. I just enjoyed being near Branko. His body language was so open, and he was so kind and loving. The next day we played music together for hours, creating new compositions. He still couldn’t say a word in English, and I’d only picked up basic things in Serbian, but it just felt right. We could usually work out what the other was trying to convey on an instinctual level, and if we couldn’t, we’d just laugh. It was so romantic. If I could rewind time, I’d go back to that moment.I stayed at his house that night, and we fell asleep in each other’s arms. I’d never felt so happy. Not being able to express the subtleties of my emotions made it more intense. It was a relief for me to be able to just feel and be, rather than constantly talking.After three weeks, I had to leave for work in Britain. It was incredibly painful, and Branko worried I’d never come back. But I was desperate to go straight back out there. My mum was very supportive, advising me to do what felt right. From then, it became more real. I bought audio tapes to learn Serbian and booked a one-way flight. This time I stayed for three months.The type of Serbian Roma culture Branko lived in was very different from the English culture I knew. There isn’t the same language to describe the process of starting a relationship if you start spending time with someone, then you’re with them, and you immediately say, “I love you.”Branko and I planned to go to Britain together for a while to earn money and introduce him to my life but he had rarely travelled even in his own country, and his tourist visa was refused twice. It was difficult to go back alone. When I returned, we decided to get married, and in March 2012 we had a simple but chaotic wedding in Serbia. We built a house on the exact spot we first met in Branko’s grandmother’s garden.We formed a band, Faith i Branko, and have spent the last three years touring Europe, Australia and New Zealand, playing festivals and releasing an album. Today my Serbian is pretty good, and while Branko still doesn’t speak fluent English, he understands a lot. They say music is the language of the soul.

Would it work for me?I am on the phone trying to book a special appointment: a foreskin facial. The treatment is not widely available in the US, so the calls yield nothing except a series of confusing conversations.“Do you do a foreskin facial?” I ask a facialist at one New York salon.“We do a four-step facial called HydraFacial,” she says.“Does it have foreskin in it?” I say, a bit louder than before.“Well it has four steps. First, we ...”“Sorry, I hate to labor the point – but does it actually contain foreskin?”“I don’t know what you mean. Foreskin?”“Yes. Like on the end of a penis?”“Oh no, we don’t do it there. We only treat the face.”“No, I get that – but does the facial ingredient contain foreskin?”The procedure, popular in Hollywood celebrity circles, injects cells from a baby’s foreskin – specifically a South Korean baby’s foreskin – into the face. Sandra Bullock and Cate Blanchett are big fans. Just last month Kate Beckinsale had one, and said it was “amazing”. I was curious. After a couple of false starts, I snag an appointment at the Georgia Louise Atelier salon, in Manhattan’s Upper East Side, where they prefer to call the foreskin facial the “Hollywood EGF facial”. It costs $650, plus tip, and mine is being administered by a woman called Sarah.I’d been looking forward to it: the facial is supposed to reduce wrinkles and improve skin tone. As a 17-year-old in Preston, Lancashire, I was fresh-faced enough to have to borrow my friend Martin’s driver’s license to get into Tokyo Jo’s nightclub. But 16 years on, I’m aware of crow’s feet around my eyes and a crease between my brows. I was not aware of wrinkles stretching from my nose to the corners of my mouth, but Sarah assures me I have those, too.Now I’m here, I’m nervous. I’m also feeling nauseous, owing to some enthusiastically prepared but dubiously cooked beef ribs I ate last night. When Sarah, preparing creams and clothes somewhere behind me, starts talking about skin peels and secret serums, my stomach begins to rumble.Sarah pops up close to my face to show me the tool that’ll pump the foreskin formula into my skin. It’s 12 needles, tightly packed in a little circle, attached to some sort of electronic device.Soon, I’m having cream slathered on my face while soft music wafts in the background. Sarah announces that she is doing a peel, and once that’s done, she sticks goggles on me and shines a blue light in my face.The key to the foreskin facial is using epidermal growth factors, or EGF, which in this case come from cells from a newborn baby’s foreskin. EGF, according to Georgia Louise Atelier, helps to “generate collagen and elastin”. By having the cells injected into the face, you can get the collagen and elastin deeper into the skin, where it can do its best work.Sarah smears the foreskin formula on to my face and neck. (She doesn’t normally do the neck, but they can’t work through my beard, so the extra goop goes there.) Then the needle gun is fired up, quite close to my ear, and Sarah gets to work jabbing me.“Oh, you’re bleeding,” she says at one point, as casually as you might tell someone they’ve got lint on their sweater. I’ve been numbed, so the needles don’t hurt, but the tool sounds unnervingly like a tattoo gun, and the thought crosses my mind that Sarah is giving me some impromptu and unwanted face art.But she isn’t. Once the blood is dabbed off, I’m slathered in a final batch of seaweed-smelling cream and we’re done. I look in the mirror. My face is very red and very shiny. On my neck there are red blotches from where the needles have done their work. It looks like I’ve been suction-cupped.Georgia Louise, the establishment’s owner, declined an interview, which meant I was unable to ask why she specifically uses foreskins from South Korean babies. When I asked Sarah the same question, she said South Korea tends to be ahead of the curve with beauty treatments, and this treatment had been inspired by work there. When I step out of the salon – after turning down their offer to buy some healing cream for $54 – my face feels tight and raw, as if I’ve been slapped. The final batch of cream Sarah had put on my face, the one that smelled like seaweed, hadn’t been quite so pungent in the salon. But as it starts to dry, and as the wind whistles down the street, wafting the scent from cheek to nostril, there it is: semen.It’s not just a hint. It’s a proper smell of semen. Later, on the subway, I’m worried it will put someone off their dinner.It takes a couple of days for the redness to die down. I’ve been told to avoid hot yoga, which doesn’t pose much of a problem, and to avoid the sun. It could take days or weeks for the foreskin cells to work their magic.In the meantime, friends and acquaintances monitor my face for evidence of improvements. Two people say my crow’s feet have gone. A colleague mauls my cheek and tells me my skin is soft. A guy I know in a bar says I have “a glow”, but I take it with a pinch of salt as he falls off his chair 20 minutes later.The main difference is people want to talk to me more than usual, if only about foreskins, and relative strangers keep touching my face.Personally I can’t see much difference. If anything, staring endlessly in the mirror, looking for changes, has made me more self-conscious about my face. I notice one of my eyes doesn’t open properly. My nose is bent. There’s a lump on my lip from where someone punched me – on one of those nights that I used Martin’s ID to get into Tokyo Jo’s.Perhaps there’s a lesson in that. Maybe we shouldn’t try to defy our age.﻿"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9abe7ee6cd73ca214b7bd242788c31de79368927/0_397_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2c955501648d8aeba453e8f904bcce0","title":"mother on instagram baby fell down stairs parental phone use children","story":"As new research looks at the impact of distracted parenting on child development, we talk to families about the battle with ‘technoference’Earlier this year, Sara Davidson had what she calls “a massive wakeup call” about the damage our relationship with our phones can do to our children. Davidson (not her real name), a 34-year-old mother of two from London, was mindlessly scrolling through her mobile, “sucked into the Insta-vacuum”, when her eight-month-old baby crawled across the bedroom floor and on to the landing. “I heard a thud, then a cry,” she says. “My brain, transfixed by my phone, took a couple of seconds to realise that she had tumbled down the stairs. I hadn’t even noticed she was out of sight. My stomach turned.”Davidson admits that she was very lucky: apart from being a little shocked, her daughter was fine. Her fall had been broken three steps down. “I was riddled with guilt,” Davidson says. “I could have damaged my child, and for what? For looking at some meaningless nonsense on social media? I can’t bring myself to tell my husband. But it has been enough to make me re-evaluate my relationship with my devices. The irony is, I’ve always been pretty militant about their screen time – they are both under three and don’t watch TV or have iPads.”Many parents feel adrift in this new era of technology. Those with teenagers feel in constant conflict over screens, where leniency, rules and even bans all fail in different ways. Those with younger kids are trying to entertain and appease them, while instinctively wanting to limit time on devices that seem to do everything possible to keep children hooked. Yet parents seem unaware of the impact their own screen use has on their kids – prompting the education minister Damian Hinds to argue last month that they should consider putting phones away and prioritising “one-to-one time without gadgets”, so that children are properly supported in their learning at home.More worryingly, evidence is building that screen use, particularly of smartphones, has a negative impact on the conversational development of very young children. Chris Calland, a child behaviour expert and adviser to parents, schools and nurseries across the UK on what has been dubbed “technoference”, says a clear relationship has emerged over the last five years between adults who are glued to their phones and children who arrive at school without the language and interpersonal skills expected of a four- to five-year-old. “I was recently asked into a school reception class to help teachers find new ways to get through to parents who were persistently talking or scrolling on their phones, even as they collected their children, took their hands and walked them away from the school gates.”They concluded that one solution would be to write scripts that could be handed out to parents to re-educate them in talking to their children. For example: “Look at that dog”, or “Tell me one nice thing you’ve done today.” At one nursery Calland worked with, staff put up pictures of phones with red lines through them, because they were struggling so hard to gain parents’ attention. Perhaps this is not surprising, when parents can now buy a phone holder that clips on to a pram or even a “swipe and feed” accessory that can be attached to a baby bottle. “This is not about judgment,” Calland says. “Being drawn into our phones is insidious. But the first three years are the most formative for children, and when parents have their attention locked on their phones, they are missing countless cues to interact with their kids.”In learning language, the quality of interaction is critical. The “conversational duet” was first identified in the 1980s to describe the learning stage between 18 months and three years – the intimate cooing and babbling between parent and child as it learns and repeats language through a magical ensemble of bodily, facial and vocal interactions. Interruptions – calls, notifications, Facebook updates or photo-taking – sabotage that exchange.In a study published in the US journal Developmental Psychology in August 2017, researchers asked two groups of mothers to teach their children two words. In one group, the mothers were interrupted by a phone call whether they explained the interruption or not, their children did not learn the new words. The children who weren’t interrupted did. To make sense of this effect, Maryam Abdullah, a developmental psychologist who directs the parenting programme at the University of California, Berkeley’s Greater Good Science Center, says it’s important to recognise how crucial attachment is to child development. “Children are learning the rhythm of what it feels like to be in a social interaction. They are learning social dialogue from the responsiveness of the parent to their changes in emotion.”This delicate, gentle process of bonding and learning is critical for parents, too, honing their ability to read their child’s cues and anticipate a problem or need before it escalates. And a key part of attachment is, unsurprisingly, attention – the very thing our devices are so good at stealing from us.Michelle Morris, consultant speech and language therapist at Salford Royal NHS Trust, cautions that there is no unequivocal data on the effects of tech, because there are so many other variables at work. “We do, however, know about early language development and the importance of the adult being ‘in the moment’ and starting a conversation. If a child points to some ducks in a park, and the adult is not ‘present’ because they are looking at Instagram, they won’t see this non-verbal exchange and will miss the opportunity to respond accordingly. It frustrates the child and, over time, may reduce the likelihood of them initiating that type of interaction again. It reduces the opportunity for exposure to words, and it misses a vital early learning opportunity.”Even with adolescents – who are naturally pushing for autonomy to make their own decisions – the example set by their parents is hugely formative. Our self-management skills typically don’t mature until we reach our mid-20s, suggesting our parents and, to some extent, our peers, influence our development until then. All this means that if you’re confiscating your kids’ devices in the evening, but are still glued to your own phone at night, it’s a recipe for conflict, because you’re not setting a consistent example.I recently visited a church in Livermore, a quiet Californian town 40 miles from Silicon Valley, where a crowd of parents and slightly reluctant teenagers had gathered to watch Screenagers , an indie documentary about teenagers’ use of technology. There were groans of recognition as it played. “I got Lauren a phone when she was 13,” parent Michelle Deplitch tells me afterwards, “and now her sister is coming up to 13 and she wants one, too. But I say, ‘I already lost one child. I can’t lose another.’” Lauren and her younger brother, Ian, see things differently, of course. “Dad is on his computer from when he wakes up at 5am to when we leave for school, looking at motorcycles and boats and stuff,” Ian says. “It’s not at the right times,” Lauren adds. “When we have to go places, he’ll do everything at the last minute and we’ll be late.”Jaron Lanier doesn’t think it’s helpful to blame parents or their children for this apparent crisis in our prosocial development. A computer scientist, technology philosopher and musician, Lanier has been warning of technology’s “agents of alienation” since 1992. He has been emphatically vindicated by the era of the data-gathering, attention-stealing smartphone. He is multitasking when I talk to him, organising imminent delivery of tonight’s dinner with his 12-year-old daughter, while describing the malign effects of the technology companies to me on the phone. “I’m not claiming to be an ideal parent because I’m figuring this out, too,” he says. “But I do know about the technology and, from that perspective, it’s important to remember that these devices are designed to be addictive, in the formal sense. That’s the acknowledged truth from executives at these companies. Rather than thinking it’s the kids’ fault or the parents’ fault, we have to recognise that these are cruel systems that prey on universal human frailties.”Despite this, Lanier has detected the earliest shoots of conscience in Silicon Valley, not least because many technologists are now in their 30s with kids of their own. This summer, Google and Apple introduced features that let smartphone users monitor and limit how much time they spend on their own devices, although these are basic and easy to work around. Surely the industry could do more to come up with technologies that compete less aggressively for our attention and which are better for our physical and emotional health?Janet Read, professor of child computer interaction at the University of Central Lancashire, says part of the problem is that many services are based on rigid systems originally built for the workplace. These allow users to play, surf or browse infinitely, giving little encouragement to moderate screen time – whether they are a Facebook-addicted mother or a Minecraft-obsessed child. A more humane approach would be to use artificial intelligence to develop computers that could mimic and reflect the behaviour of children. “Maybe the computer could have a hissy fit, or it could slow down, or stop interacting or be naughty. That kind of interaction could be more helpful to a child’s development because it reflects our own instincts and behaviours.” If the computer decides that 20 minutes is enough, or that we seem too tired to play, it could just shut down – and, in doing so, help us to learn what the right time to switch off feels like.Read says there is insufficient research in this area, but that computers could be taught to respond to humour and playfulness, or to empathise when a user seems to be struggling. At school, that might mean creating a computer that behaves more like a teacher, adjusting each interaction according to the learning style of the child. Children could be encouraged to share, take turns and resolve arguments. But until there is some kind of maturity in the technology we have all come to rely on, Read acknowledges that parents are in a difficult position. For poorer families, in particular, the phone can provide a lifeline to support and connection when someone is feeling stressed and isolated. “You can’t teach anyone how to parent – they’ve got to figure it out for themselves,” she says.Advice published by the American Medical Association in August suggests good technology hygiene: no devices while driving, at the dinner table or in the bedroom allocating time to unplug with your children and showing them how to focus on a single task at a time. Crucially, it also advises prioritising quality, technology-free time with your children while resisting the urge to document it all. Morris, of Salford Royal NHS Trust, believes public health intervention is necessary. “One of the most helpful things that we can do is have a discussion with all parents about their screen time and ask them to monitor how much they are on their phones – everyone is shocked. We can then encourage them to pledge a planned period of phone-free time when they are with their children. This way no families are stigmatised.”Kelsey Wolfman, a parent from the San Francisco bay area, has had more success than most in rebalancing her family’s use of devices. She recently banned her three young children from playing video games, watching TV or using their tablet computers. She was tired of the tantrums when it was time to do homework and increasingly worried about the impact of screen time on her children’s wellbeing, especially when one of her sons started struggling with anxiety and night terrors.“I decided to do a screen fast and see if we could reduce the battle we are having,” she says. “Now I find I spend more time entertaining them, interjecting in arguments or when they are getting a bit too creative with toys. But what has helped them be OK with not having their screens is that I have turned off all the notifications on my own phone and, instead, try to check in once every couple of hours. I felt bad about them seeing me constantly responding to my phone. I don’t want them to stop having a zest for life in general, for being outside and exploring and getting their hands dirty. I want them to know that there is a huge world out there.”• Additional reporting by Deborah LintonCommenting on this piece?

He rose to fame as a purveyor of honest, bar-band rock, devoid of the ponderous flim-flam, elevated self-importance and glittery excess to which other 70s musicians were partial a trustworthy teller of gritty truths about blue-collar America a true believer in the primal power of rock’n’roll. He’s a very odd fit among the razzle-dazzle of the Great White Way’s other current musical offerings: Phantom of the Opera, Chicago, The Cher Show and Frozen.Or perhaps not. Virtually the first thing you hear on this 150-minute live recording is Springsteen slyly informing his audience that he’s exactly what fans think he’s not: phoney. “I come from a boardwalk town where everything is tinged with just a bit of fraud – so am I … I’ve never held an honest job in my entire life … never worked nine-to-five … I’ve never seen the inside of a factory and yet it’s all I’ve ever written about. Standing before you is a man who has become wildly and absurdly successful writing about something of which he had absolutely no experience. I made it all up.”Should anyone think that Springsteen on Broadway is a stark, purgative exercise in stripping away decades of accumulated mythology, it’s worth noting that Springsteen follows this confession with a description of seeing Elvis on the Ed Sullivan Show. It’s so epic in its mythologising that it brings to mind Nick Cave’s Tupelo, a song that depicts Presley’s birth as an awesome, terrifying supernatural event from the pages of the Old Testament. This contrast sets the tone for the whole enterprise. Springsteen on Broadway is a really charming album – charming enough, in fact, to convince a Boss agnostic that there’s more to the man than they might previously have thought – and its charm rests on Springsteen’s alternating conflicting desires to let light in on what he calls “the magic trick”, and suggest that it might really be magic after all.We learn that Bruce Springsteen is as much a contrived character as Ziggy Stardust – a stadium-filling exaggeration of Springsteen’s troubled factory-worker father – and that we should be wary of treating what he says as gospel: “I’m Mr Born to Run … New Jersey is a death-trap, listen to my lyrics … I currently live 10 minutes from my home town.” But we also learn that the man behind said character truly believes all the hokey stuff he yells at those packed stadiums about just being a prisoner of rock’n’roll, a belief occasionally expressed in terms so earnest they would make Bono blush: “Bands come in search of lightning and thunder … a communion of souls … true rock’n’roll will never die.” Nor, unlike a lot of performers who have created a character to inhabit on stage, is Springsteen a man much crippled by self-doubt: “Before me, there was no Jersey Shore. Jersey almighty, I fuckin’ invented it.”Its charm is aided by the fact that, while clearly scripted, the between-song monologues – which occasionally last three or four times as long as the song they’re introducing – are filled with striking, writerly imagery: his lengthy description of being sent into his local bar as child to fetch his dad home is a funny, telling short story in itself. If the monologues occasionally overshadow the material they’re meant to support, more often the stripped-back acoustic performances alone cast his songs in fresh light. Denuded of the E Street Band’s post-Phil Spector blare, Thunder Road sounds dark and desperate rather than cathartic. Born in the USA undergoes the most dramatic transformation: it starts out as – of all things – a Within You Without You-esque faux-raga, then turns into desolate a cappella blues. Its triumphal original incarnation became perhaps the most widely misunderstood song in rock history. Here, there’s absolutely no doubt what Springsteen was driving at all along. Perhaps understandably, given its history, Born in the USA is preceded by a very lengthy explanation of its genesis. This is one of a handful of moments where, in recorded form at least, you start to wish he’d get on with it.It’s not the only point where Springsteen on Broadway hits the standard problem with live albums as a poor substitute for actually being there. The appearance of his wife and musical collaborator Patti Scialfa was widely reported as an emotional highlight of the Broadway shows. Here, it doesn’t seem that way: her voice sounds beautiful harmonising on Tougher Than the Rest, but some atmospheric impact has clearly been lost in the transition from stage to tape. Most of the time, however, the cocktail of homespun wisdom, frankness and blatant yarn-spinning is genuinely enthralling, a portrait of the rock star as a complex, conflicted 69-year-old man.Confidence Man – Santa’s Comin’ Down the ChimneyA useful corrective to the already nerve-jangling sound of Wonderful Christmastime and Do They Know It’s Christmas blaring out everywhere: a minimal, funky 80s house-inspired bit of festive cool.• This review was originally published on 6 December and removed for breaking an embargo.

By  Louisa Lim and  Julia BerginAs they sifted through resumes, the team recruiting for the new London hub of China’s state-run broadcaster had an enviable problem: far, far too many candidates. Almost 6,000 people were applying for just 90 jobs “reporting the news from a Chinese perspective”. Even the simple task of reading through the heap of applications would take almost two months.For western journalists, demoralised by endless budget cuts, China Global Television Network presents an enticing prospect, offering competitive salaries to work in state-of-the-art purpose-built studios in Chiswick, west London. CGTN – as the international arm of China Central Television (CCTV) was rebranded in 2016 – is the most high-profile component of China’s rapid media expansion across the world, whose goal, in the words of President Xi Jinping, is to “tell China’s story well”. In practice, telling China’s story well looks a lot like serving the ideological aims of the state.For decades, Beijing’s approach to shaping its image has been defensive, reactive and largely aimed at a domestic audience. The most visible manifestation of these efforts was the literal disappearance of content inside China: foreign magazines with pages ripped out, or the BBC news flickering to black when it aired stories on sensitive issues such as Tibet, Taiwan or the Tiananmen killings of 1989. Beijing’s crude tools were domestic censorship, official complaints to news organisations’ headquarters and expelling correspondents from China.But over the past decade or so, China has rolled out a more sophisticated and assertive strategy, which is increasingly aimed at international audiences. China is trying to reshape the global information environment with massive infusions of money – funding paid-for advertorials, sponsored journalistic coverage and heavily massaged positive messages from boosters. While within China the press is increasingly tightly controlled, abroad Beijing has sought to exploit the vulnerabilities of the free press to its advantage.In its simplest form, this involves paying for Chinese propaganda supplements to appear in dozens of respected international publications such as the Washington Post. The strategy can also take more insidious forms, such as planting content from the state-run radio station, China Radio International (CRI), on to the airwaves of ostensibly independent broadcasters across the world, from Australia to Turkey.Meanwhile, in the US, lobbyists paid by Chinese-backed institutions are cultivating vocal supporters known as “third-party spokespeople” to deliver Beijing’s message, and working to sway popular perceptions of Chinese rule in Tibet. China is also wooing journalists from around the world with all-expenses-paid tours and, perhaps most ambitiously of all, free graduate degrees in communication, training scores of foreign reporters each year to “tell China’s story well”.Since 2003, when revisions were made to an official document outlining the political goals of the People’s Liberation Army, so-called “media warfare” has been an explicit part of Beijing’s military strategy. The aim is to influence public opinion overseas in order to nudge foreign governments into making policies favourable towards China’s Communist party. “Their view of national security involves pre-emption in the world of ideas,” says former CIA analyst Peter Mattis, who is now a fellow in the China programme at the Jamestown Foundation, a security-focused Washington thinktank. “The whole point of pushing that kind of propaganda out is to preclude or preempt decisions that would go against the People’s Republic of China.”Sometimes this involves traditional censorship: intimidating those with dissenting opinions, cracking down on platforms that might carry them, or simply acquiring those outlets. Beijing has also been patiently increasing its control over the global digital infrastructure through private Chinese companies, which are dominating the switchover from analogue to digital television in parts of Africa, launching television satellites and building networks of fibre-optic cables and data centres – a “digital silk road” – to carry information around the world. In this way, Beijing is increasing its grip, not only over news producers and the means of production of the news, but also over the means of transmission.Though Beijing’s propaganda offensive is often shrugged off as clumsy and downright dull, our five-month investigation underlines the granular nature and ambitious scale of its aggressive drive to redraw the global information order. This is not just a battle for clicks. It is above all an ideological and political struggle, with China determined to increase its “discourse power” to combat what it sees as decades of unchallenged western media imperialism.At the same time, Beijing is also seeking to shift the global centre of gravity eastwards, propagating the idea of a new world order with a resurgent China at its centre. Of course, influence campaigns are nothing new the US and the UK, among others, have aggressively courted journalists, offering enticements such as freebie trips and privileged access to senior officials. But unlike those countries, China’s Communist party does not accept a plurality of views. Instead, for China’s leaders, who regard the press as the “eyes, ears, tongue and throat” of the Communist party, the idea of journalism depends upon a narrative discipline that precludes all but the party-approved version of events. For China, the media has become both the battlefield on which this “global information war” is being waged, and the weapon of attack.Nigerian investigative journalist Dayo Aiyetan still remembers the phone call he received a few years after CCTV opened its African hub in Kenya in 2012. Aiyetan had set up Nigeria’s premier investigative journalism centre, and he had exposed Chinese businessmen for illegally logging forests in Nigeria. The caller had a tempting offer: take a job working for the Chinese state-run broadcaster’s new office, he was told, and you’ll earn at least twice your current salary. Aiyetan was tempted by the money and the job security, but ultimately decided against, having only just launched his centre.As the location of the Chinese media’s first big international expansion, Africa has been a testbed. These efforts intensified after the 2008 Olympics, when Chinese leaders were frustrated with a tide of critical reporting, in particular the international coverage of the human rights and pro-Tibet protests that accompanied the torch relay around the world. The following year China announced it would spend $6.6bn strengthening its global media presence. Its first major international foray was CCTV Africa, which immediately tried to recruit highly-respected figures such as Aiyetan.For local journalists, CCTV promised good money and the chance to “tell the story of Africa” to a global audience, without having to hew to western narratives. “The thing I like is we are telling the story from our perspective,” Kenyan journalist Beatrice Marshall said, after being poached from KTN, one of Kenya’s leading television stations. Her presence strengthened the station’s credibility, and she has continued to stress the editorial independence of the journalists themselves.Over the past six years, CGTN has steadily increased its reach across Africa. It is displayed on televisions in the corridors of power at the African Union, in Addis Ababa, and beamed for free to thousands of rural villages in a number of African countries, including Rwanda and Ghana, courtesy of StarTimes, a Chinese media company with strong ties to the state. StarTimes’ cheapest packages bundle together Chinese and African channels, whereas access to the BBC or al-Jazeera costs more, putting it beyond the means of most viewers. In this way, their impact is to expand access to Chinese propaganda to their audience, which they claim accounts for 10m of Africa’s 24m pay-TV subscribers. Though industry analysts believe that these numbers are likely to be inflated, broadcasters are already concerned that StarTimes is edging local companies out of some African media markets. In September, the Ghana Independent Broadcasters Association warned that “If StarTimes is allowed to control Ghana’s digital transmission infrastructure and the satellite space … Ghana would have virtually submitted its broadcast space to Chinese control and content.”For non-Chinese journalists, in Africa and elsewhere, working for Chinese state-run media offers generous remuneration and new opportunities. When CCTV launched its Washington headquarters in 2012, no fewer than five former or current BBC correspondents based in Latin America joined the broadcaster. One of them, Daniel Schweimler, who is now at al-Jazeera, said his experience there was fun and relatively trouble-free, though he didn’t think many people actually saw his stories.Describing his work at Xinhua, the former employee said: “You’ve got to think it’s like creative writing. You’re combining journalism with a kind of creative writing.” Another former employee, Christian Claye Edwards, who worked for Xinhua news agency in Sydney between 2010 and 2014, says: “Their objectives were loud and clear, to push a distinctly Chinese agenda.” He continued: “There’s no clear goal other than to identify cracks in a system and exploit them.” One example would be highlighting the chaotic and unpredictable nature of Australian politics – which has seen six prime ministers in eight years – as a way of undermining faith in liberal democracy. “Part of my brief was to find ways to exert that influence. It was never written down, I was never given orders,” he said.Edwards, like other former employees of China’s state-media companies, felt that the vast majority of his work was about domestic signalling, or telegraphing messages that demonstrated loyalty to the party line in order to curry favour with senior officials. Any thoughts of how his work was furthering China’s international soft power goals came a distant second. But since Edwards left in 2014, Xinhua has begun looking outwards one sign of this is the existence of its Twitter account – followed by 11.7 million people – even though Twitter is banned in China.Outright censorship is generally unnecessary at China’s state-run media organisations, since most journalists quickly gain a sense of which stories are deemed appropriate and what kind of spin is needed. “I recognised that we were soft propaganda tools – but not to any greater extent than for the BBC or al-Jazeera, and certainly nothing like RT,” said Daniel Schweimler, who worked for CCTV in South America for two years. “We always joked that we’d have no interference from Beijing or DC so long as the Dalai Lama never came to visit.”When the Dalai Lama did come to visit Canada in 2012, one journalist in Xinhua’s Ottawa bureau, Mark Bourrie, was placed in a compromising position. On the day of the visit, Bourrie was told to use his parliamentary press credentials to attend the Tibetan spiritual leader’s press conference, and to find out what had happened in a closed-door meeting with the then prime minister, Stephen Harper. When Bourrie asked whether the information would be used in a piece, his boss replied that it would not. “That day I felt that we were spies,” he later wrote. “It was time to draw the line.” He returned to his office and resigned. Now a lawyer, Bourrie declined to comment for this story.His experience is not unusual. Three separate sources who used to work at Chinese state media said that they sometimes wrote confidential reports, knowing that they would not be published on the newswire and were solely for the eyes of senior officials. Edwards – who wrote one such report on Adelaide’s urban planning – saw it as “the lowest level of research reporting for Chinese officials”, essentially providing very low-level intelligence for a government client.That vanishingly thin line between China’s journalism, propaganda work, influence projection and intelligence-gathering is a concern to Washington. In mid-September this year, the US ordered CGTN and Xinhua to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (Fara), which compels agents representing the interests of foreign powers in a political or quasi-political capacity to log their relationship, as well as their activities and payments. Recently Donald Trump’s campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was charged for violating this act by failing to register as a foreign lobbyist in relation to his work in Ukraine. “Chinese intelligence gathering and information warfare efforts are known to involve staff of Chinese state-run media organisations,” a congressional commission noted last year.“Making the Foreign Serve China” was one of Chairman Mao’s favoured strategies, as epitomised by his decision to grant access in the 1930s to the American journalist Edgar Snow. The resulting book, Red Star Over China, was instrumental in winning western sympathy for the Communists, whom it depicted as progressive and anti-fascist.Eight decades on, “making the foreign serve China” is not just a case of offering insider access in return for favourable coverage, but also of using media companies staffed with foreign employees to serve the party’s interests. In 2012, during a series of press conferences in Beijing at the annual legislature, the National People’s Congress, government officials repeatedly invited questions from a young Australian woman unfamiliar to the local foreign correspondents. She was notable for her fluent Chinese and her assiduously softball questions.After the Beijing press pack accused Yu of being a “fake foreign reporter”, who was effectively working for the Chinese government, she told an interviewer: “When I first entered my company, there’s only a certain amount of understanding I have about its connections to the government. I didn’t know it had any, for example.” She left CAMG shortly after, but the same performance was repeated at the National People’s Congress two years later with a different Chinese-speaking Australian working for CAMG, Louise Kenney, who publicly pushed back against accusations of being a shill.The use of foreign radio stations to deliver government-approved content is a strategy the CRI president has called jie chuan chu hai, “borrowing a boat to go out to the ocean”. In 2015, Reuters reported that Global CAMG was one of three companies running a covert network of 33 radio stations broadcasting CRI content in 14 countries. Three years on, those networks – including Ostar – now operate 58 stations in 35 countries, according to information from their websites. In the US alone, CRI content is broadcast by more than 30 outlets, according to a combative recent speech by the US vice president, Mike Pence, though it’s difficult to know who is listening or how much influence this content really has.Beijing has also taken a similar “borrowed boats” approach to print publications. The state-run English-language newspaper China Daily has struck deals with at least 30 foreign newspapers – including the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post and the UK  – to carry four- or eight-page inserts called China Watch, which can appear as often as monthly. The supplements take a didactic, old-school approach to propaganda recent headlines include “Tibet has seen 40 years of shining success”, “Xi unveils opening-up measures” and – least surprisingly of all – “Xi praises Communist party of China members.”Figures are hard to come by, but according to one report, the Daily  is paid £750,000 annually to carry the China Watch insert once a month. Even the Daily Mail has an agreement with the government’s Chinese-language mouthpiece, the People’s Daily, which provides China-themed clickbait such as tales of bridesmaids on fatal drinking sprees and a young mother who sold her toddler to human traffickers to buy cosmetics. Such content-sharing deals are one factor behind China Daily’s astonishing expenditures in the US it has spent $20.8m on US influence since 2017, making it the highest registered spender that is not a foreign government.The purpose of this “borrowed boats” strategy may also be to lend credibility to the content, since it’s not clear how many readers actually bother to open these turgid, propaganda-heavy supplements. “Part of it really is about legitimation,” argues Peter Mattis. “If it’s appearing in the Washington Post, if it’s appearing in a number of other papers worldwide, then in a sense it’s giving credibility to those views.”In September, Donald Trump criticised this practice, claiming China was pushing “false messages” intended to damage his prospects in the midterm elections. His wrath was directed at a China Watch supplement in the Iowa-based Des Moines Register, designed to undermine farm-country support for a trade war. He tweeted: “China is actually placing propaganda ads in the Des Moines Register and other papers, made to look like news. That’s because we are beating them on Trade, opening markets, and the farmers will make a fortune when this is over!”In the Xi Jinping era, propaganda has become a business. In a 2014 speech, propaganda tsar Liu Qibao endorsed this approach, stating that other countries have successfully used market forces to export their cultural products. The push to monetise propaganda provides canny businesspeople with opportunities to curry favour at high levels, either through partnering with state-run media companies or bankrolling Chinese proxies overseas. The favoured strategy now is not just “borrowing foreign boats” but buying them outright, as the University of Canterbury’s Anne-Marie Brady has written.The most visible example of this came in 2015, when China’s richest man acquired the South China Morning Post (SCMP), a 115-year-old Hong Kong paper once known for its editorial independence and tough reporting. Jack Ma, whose Alibaba e-commerce empire is valued at $420bn, has not denied suggestions that he was asked by mainland authorities to make the purchase. “If I had to bother about what other people speculated about, how would I get anything done?” he said in December 2015. Around the same time, Alibaba’s executive vice-chairman Joseph Tsai made clear that under new ownership, the SCMP would provide an alternative view of China to the one found in western media: “A lot of journalists working with these western media organisations may not agree with the system of governance in China and that taints their view of coverage. We see things differently, we believe things should be presented as they are,” Tsai told an interviewer.The task of executing that mission has fallen to 35-year-old CEO Gary Liu, a Mandarin-speaking California native with a Harvard degree, who had previously worked as chief executive of the digital news aggregator Digg and before that, on the business side of the music streaming company Spotify. When we spoke via Skype, Liu sounded a little bit uncomfortable when asked how well the SCMP is fulfilling Tsai’s vision. “The owners have their set of language, and the newspaper has our convictions,” he said. “And our conviction is that our job is to cover China with objectivity, and to do our best to show both sides of a very, very complicated story.” The paper’s role, as he sees it, is “to lead the global conversation about China.” And to achieve that goal, Liu is being given significant resources. Staffers talk of “staggering” expenditures, with one employee describing the number of new hires “like the cast of Ben Hur”.Even under new ownership, the SCMP treads a delicate line on China, continuing to run granular political analysis and original reporting on sensitive issues such as human rights lawyers and religious crackdowns. Though pages are free from Xinhua copy, cynics joke the paper itself is transmogrifying into a kind of China Daily-lite, with increasing prominence given to stories about Xi Jinping, pro-Beijing editorials and politically on-message opinion pieces. All this is combined with constant, fawning coverage of owner Jack Ma, memorably described by the paper as a “modern-day Confucius”.Two stories in particular have been heavily criticised. First, in 2016, it published an interview with a young human rights activist named Zhao Wei, who had disappeared into police custody a year before. In the interview, the activist’s quotes, recanting her past behaviour, were reminiscent of Mao-era “self-criticism”. Fears she had spoken under duress were confirmed a year later, when she admitted she’d given her “candid confession” after being held in a heavily monitored cell for a year – “No talking. No walking. Our hands, feet, our posture … every body movement was strictly limited,” she wrote.Then, earlier this year, the SCMP accepted a “government-arranged interview” with bookseller Gui Minhai. Gui, a Swedish citizen, was one of five sellers of politically sensational books who disappeared in 2015 – in his case from his home in Thailand – and then reappeared in police custody in China in 2016. The SCMP interview was conducted in a detention facility, with Gui flanked by security guards.But Liu is adamant that the paper has not made any missteps on his watch. He says the paper was invited – not forced – to cover these stories. In Gui’s case, he insists the decision was based on journalistic merit: “The senior editorial leadership team got together, and said: This is important for us to show up. If not, there’s a very high likelihood that the other stories reported do not share the entire situation. In fact, a lot of the other reports did not mention the fact that there were security guards standing on either side of Gui Minhai at the start and at the end of the interviews.” Liu stressed that “there is a significant difference between how we reported it, and how we would expect state propaganda to report it.” But many in Hong Kong were distressed that a journal once seen as a paper of record was effectively running a forced confession on behalf of the Chinese state.To insiders, even the paper’s hardhitting coverage of China forms part of a broader strategy. “It’s all smoke and mirrors,” longtime contributor Stephen Vines said. “It’s so pernicious because a lot of is quite plausible.” In November, Vines issued a public statement announcing he will no longer write for the paper. A current SCMP journalist described “a veneer of press freedom”, noting, “It’s not so much that pieces are pulled and changed. It’s where they’re positioned, how they’re promoted. The digital revolution has made that all very easy to do. You write whatever you want, but the people control what we see.” The SCMP has countered public criticism of censorship aggressively, even running a column in which a senior editor blamed censorship accusations on “butthurt ex-Post employees with axes to grind”.But Essa pulled no punches in a piece he subsequently wrote for Foreign Policy: “Red lines are thick and non-negotiable. Given the economic dependence on the Chinese and crisis in newsrooms, this is rarely confronted. And this is precisely the type of media environment that China wants their African allies to replicate.” This is true not just in Africa, but for China’s media interests across the world.These days Australia has come to be seen as a petri dish for Chinese influence overseas. At the heart of the row is a controversial Chinese billionaire, Huang Xiangmo, whose links to Labor party politician Sam Dastyari precipitated Dastyari’s resignation in 2017. Three years earlier, Huang provided A$1.8m of seed funding to establish the Australia China Relations Institute, a thinktank based at the University of Technology Sydney. ACRI, which is led by former foreign minister Bob Carr, aims to promote “a positive and optimistic view of Australia-China relations”.In the past two years, ACRI has spearheaded a programme organising study tours to China for at least 28 high-profile Australian journalists, whisking them on all-expenses tours with extraordinary access. Many of the breathless resulting articles – footnoting their status as “guests of ACRI” or “guests of the All China Journalist Association” – accord remarkably closely with Beijing’s strategic priorities. As well as paeans to China’s modernity and size, the articles advise Australians not to turn their backs on China’s One Belt One Road initiative, and not to publicly criticise China’s policy towards the South China Sea, or anything else for that matter.Participants on the study tours do not downplay their influence. “I found the trip fantastic”, says one reporter who asked not to be named. “In Australia, the reporting often doesn’t go beyond having a one-party communist system. There’s a lot of positive things happening in China in terms of technology, business and trade, and that doesn’t get a lot of positive coverage.” Others treat the trips with more caution. “You go on these trips knowing you’re going to be getting their point of view,” says the ABC’s economics correspondent Peter Ryan, who went on an ACRI-sponsored trip in 2016.ACRI responded to our questions about the trips by issuing a statement, saying that its tours “pale into insignificance” compared with similar trips organised by the US and Israel. A spokesman wrote: “Not for a moment has ACRI ever lobbied journalists about what they write. They are free to take whatever position they want.” The spokesman also confirmed that in-kind support to the trips has been given by the All-China Journalists Association, a Communist party body whose mission is to “tell China’s stories well, spread China’s voice”. For his part, Huang Xiangmo said he has no involvement in ACRI’s operations.ACRI is a relatively new player in this game. Since 2009, the China-United States Exchange Foundation (Cusef), headed by Hong Kong’s millionaire former chief executive Tung Chee-hwa, has taken 127 US journalists from 40 US outlets to China, as well as congressmen and senators. Since Tung has an official position – vice-chairman of the Chinese government advisory body, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference – Cusef is registered as a “foreign principal” under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (Fara).A picture of how Cusef has worked to sway coverage of China inside the US can be found in Fara filings by a PR firm working for the foundation since 2009. BLJ Worldwide, which has also represented Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, the Gaddafi family, and Qatar’s World Cup bid, organised journalist tours and cultivated a number of what it calls “third-party supporters” to marshal positive coverage of China in the US. In one year alone, 2010, BLJ’s target was to place an average of three articles per week in the US media, in venues such as the Wall Street Journal, for which it was paid around $20,000 a month. In a memo from November 2017, BLJ lists eight recommended third-party supporters who, it claimed, “can engage by writing their own op-eds, providing endorsements of Cusef, and potentially speaking to select media”. Fara filings also show that in 2010, BLJ discussed how to influence the way US schoolchildren are taught about China’s much-criticised role in Tibet. After conducting a review of four high-school textbooks, BLJ proposed “a strong, factual counter-narrative be introduced to defend and promote the actions of China within the Tibet Autonomous Region”.Over the past decade, Cusef has widened its remit, mooting ambitious cultural diplomacy plans to influence the US public. According to a January 2018 memo, one of the schemes included a plan to build a Chinese “town called Gung-Ho in Detroit”. The memo suggests redeveloping an entire city block to showcase Chinese innovation using design elements from both countries, with a budget of $8-10m. The memo even suggests shooting a reality TV show following the progress of the Gung-Ho community as “a living metaphor for the promise of the US-China relationship”. Given Detroit’s parlous state, the memo concludes, “It will be very difficult for the news media to be critical of the project.”Cusef responded to questions about its activities with a statement, saying: “Cusef has supported projects which enhance the communication and understanding between peoples of US and China. All of our programmes and activities operate within the framework of the laws and we are fully committed to carrying out our work by maintaining the highest standard of integrity.” BLJ did not respond to requests for comment.China’s active courtship of journalists extends well beyond short-term study tours to encompass longer-term programmes for reporters from developing countries. These moves were formalised under the auspices of the China Public Diplomacy Association, established in 2012. The targets are extraordinarily ambitious: the training of 500 Latin American and Caribbean journalists over five years, and 1,000 African journalists a year by 2020.Through these schemes, foreign reporters are schooled not just on China, but also on its view of journalism. To China’s leaders, journalistic ideals such as critical reporting and objectivity are not just hostile, they pose an existential threat. One leaked government directive, known as Document 9, even defines the ultimate goal of the western media as to “gouge an opening through which to infiltrate our ideology”. This gulf in journalistic values was further underlined in a series of CGTN videos issued last year, featuring prominent Chinese journalists accusing non-Chinese practitioners of being “brainwashed” by “western values of journalism”, which are depicted as irresponsible and disruptive to society. One Xinhua editor, Luo Jun, argues in favour of censorship, saying, “We have to take responsibility for what we report. If that’s being considered as censorship, I think it’s good censorship.”With its fellowships for foreign reporters, Beijing is moving to train a young generation of international journalists. A current participant in this programme is Filipino journalist Greggy Eugenio, who is finishing up an all-expenses-paid media fellowship for reporters from countries participating in China’s grand global infrastructure push, the Belt and Road Initiative. For 10 months, Eugenio has been studying and travelling around China on organised tours, as well as doing a six-week internship at state-run television. Twice a week he attends classes on language, culture, politics and new media at Beijing’s Renmin University of China, as he works towards a master’s degree in communication.“This programme continuously opens my mind and heart on a lot of misconceptions I’ve known about China,” Eugenio said in an email. “I’ve learned that a state-owned government media is one of the most effective means of journalism. The media in China is still working well and people here appreciate their work.” Throughout his time in China, he has been filing stories for the state-run Philippine News Agency, and when he finishes next month he will return to his position writing for the presidential communication team of Filipino president Rodrigo Duterte.Some observers argue the expansion of authoritarian propaganda networks – such as Russia’s RT and Iran’s Press TV – has been overhyped, with little real impact on global journalism. But Beijing’s play is bigger and more multifaceted. At home, it is building the world’s biggest broadcaster by combining its three mammoth radio and television networks into a single body, the Voice of China. At the same time, a reshuffle has transferred responsibility for the propaganda machinery from state bodies to the Communist party, which effectively tightens party control over the message. Overseas, capitalising on the move from analogue to digital broadcasting, it has used proxies likesuch as StarTimes to increase its control over global telecommunications networks, while building out new digital highways. “The real brilliance of it is not just trying to control all content – it’s the element of trying to control the key nodes in the information flow,” says Freedom House’s Sarah Cook. “It might not be necessarily clear as a threat now, but once you’ve got control over the nodes of information you can use them as you want.”Such blatant exhibitions of power indicate the new mood of assertiveness. In information warfare – as in so much else – Deng Xiaoping’s famous maxim of “hide your strength and bide your time” is over. As the world’s second-largest economy, China has decided it needs discourse power commensurate with its new global stature. Last week, a group of the US’s most distinguished China experts released a startling report expressing concern over China’s more aggressive projections of power. Many of the experts have spent decades promoting engagement with China, yet they conclude: “The ambition of Chinese activity in terms of the breadth, depth of investment of financial resources, and intensity requires far greater scrutiny than it has been getting.”As Beijing and its proxies extend their reach, they are harnessing market forces to silence the competition. Discourse power is, it seems, a zero-sum game for China, and voices that are critical of Beijing are co-opted or silenced, left without a platform or drowned out in the sea of positive messaging created by Beijing’s own “borrowed” and “bought” boats. As the west’s media giants flounder, China’s own media imperialism is on the rise, and the ultimate battle may not be for the means of news production, but for journalism itself.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/faac2655d5f2ebaee13498e4ac5d97eb5d8a3271/195_0_5326_3196/master/5326.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7829af5b3f40cd52baab6a1bbf9c438b","title":"in the room for the brexit showdown","story":"In July, Nick de Bois found himself as chief of staff in the Brexit department after the sudden resignation of David Davis and the appointment of Dominic Raab.

The UK would need Norway’s permission to join its Efta club.The rejection is a blow to an influential cross-party group led by the Tory MP Nick Boles, with private cabinet support, that is looking for a plan B if, as expected, MPs reject Theresa May’s deal next Tuesday.The former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband and the Tory former universities minister Jo Johnson also condemned Norway-plus as throwing away a key advantage of current membership “in the form of our vote, voice and veto around the table”.The former ministers’ joint assault on Norway-plus, in a pamphlet written by the People’s Vote campaign, is in some senses confirmation that the Boles plan could become a credible rival to a second referendum as a MPs search for a way out of a potential Commons deadlock.The two men insist Norway-plus “would not be easy to negotiate, would not mean reduced payments to the EU and would not allow the UK to end freedom of movement for migrants from the EU”.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Johnson said: “Norway-plus does not deliver on the referendum since it would reduce the UK to a nation of lobbyists camped outside the European parliament in Brussels.” Describing such an outcome as undignified and the worst of all worlds, he said it would only add to a sense of deceit for voters who had backed Brexit.People’s Vote claims that at a time when trust in politics is at low point, it is better to confront voters with the true choices on offer, rather than “repeating the deeply misleading promises made for Brexit two years ago”, Johnson said.But Stephen Kinnock, one of the Labour advocates for Norway-plus, said the Efta court could erge from the European court of justice, and that the Efta treaty allowed for an emergency brake on migration in exceptional circumstances. He claimed as many as 10 cabinet ministers backed a pivot to Norway-plus after the expected Commons defeat next week, and urged May to take up this option.Any attempt to push through May’s deal or a second referendum was deeply risky, he said. This soft Brexit compromise has been championed by the former Conservative minister Nick Boles as a plan B for leaving the European Union if Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement is defeated in the Commons.It is based on Norway’s relationship with the EU, which is outside the bloc and the customs union but inside the single market. Under the plan the UK would have to join Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland in the European Free Trade Association (Efta), which would then allow it to participate in the European Economic Area (EEA).The ‘plus’ in this option refers to a temporary customs union with the EU, which would need to be negotiated to avoid a hard border ion the island of Ireland. The temporary arrangement would remain in place until the EU and UK agreed a specific trade deal.The option has the advantage of being as close to the EU as possible without full membership, and it would do away with the need for a problematic backstop for Northern Ireland. Like Norway, the UK would be outside the common fisheries and agriculture policies, and would not be subject to the European court of justice.But it crosses a key red line for Brexiters by continuing freedom of movement, one of the preconditions of single market membership. It would also limit the UK ability to negotiate its own trade deals while a new customs arrangement is under discussion. And it would require continued financial contributions to the EU without an influence inside the bloc.Norway-plus, the softest form of Brexit, requires the UK to seek to apply to join the European Free Trade Area grouping, consisting of Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. The scheme, as revised by Boles, would require the UK also to remain in the EU customs union indefinitely, or at least until a solution to the border in Ireland could be found.But the plan was rejected by Heidi Nordby Lunde, an MP in Norway’s governing Conservative party, and leader of Norway’s European movement. She said her views reflected those of the governing party even though the Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg, has been more diplomatic by saying Norway would examine a UK application.Lunde told the : “Really, the Norwegian option is not an option. We have been telling you this for one and a half years since the referendum and how this works, so I am surprised that after all these years it is still part of the grown-up debate in the UK. You just expect us to give you an invitation rather than consider whether Norway would want to give you such an invitation. It might be in your interest to use our agreement, but it would not be in our interest.”Explaining Norway’s fear of the UK joining the Efta club, she said: “The three countries in Efta have to agree on all the regulations coming from the EU, so if one country vetoes something we all have to veto, which means that if the UK enters the Efta platform and starts to veto regulations that we want, this will affect not just the UK but also us as well. Part of the success we have had with this EEA agreement is for the last 25 years is that we do accept the rules and regulations that do come out of the EU, mostly because it is in our interest.“If, as I understand, UK politicians do not want to be ruled by regulations coming from other countries, why would they accept a country with 38,000 citizens like Liechtenstein being able to veto regulations that the UK wants. That would be the reality.”A member of the parliament’s economic affairs committee, she said “it is not in my country’s interests to have the UK aboard, and I cannot see how possibly an EEAEfta agreement could be in the interests of the UK”.“As part of the agreement with the EU we accept migration and free movement, we have our own body of justice, but it is compliant with the European court of justice. We accept the rules and regulations of the single market.”She added: “It is not an option for the UK to stay inside the customs union, as the UK proposes to solve the Northern Ireland border issue, if you are part of the Efta platform, since Efta is its own free trade bloc. We have 29 trade agreements with 39 countries outside the EU that the UK would need to be able to accept. I do not understand why it would be in the UK interests to enter into trade agreements on the basis of agreements that have been negotiated in our interests and not the UK’s.”She said the only politicians in Norway who wanted the UK to join Efta were the Eurosceptic party that wanted to destroy Norway’s relationship with the EU.Her fears have been echoed by Ole Erik Almlid, of the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise business association, who has also questioned whether the UK would be willing to go from rule maker to rule taker. He said Norway would suffer and parts of the Efta agreement with the EU would have to be suspended if an Efta member such as the UK refused to abide by the obligations in the agreement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fd0ac3acebf8850c3dd329bdccaca465043649d/0_47_2491_1494/master/2491.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad9fdeefde41b57b8a648d3ab70413c8","title":"two climactic weeks in the brexit saga a day by day guide","story":"After an inauspicious string of defeats, Theresa May leads the country into a pivotal weekThe attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, takes questions from MPs on May’s Brexit deal but refuses to release his full cabinet advice, despite having been ordered to do so by the Commons. Opposition parties initiate proceedings for contempt.Theresa May’s government is defeated three times in just over an hour in the Commons, the first time for 40 years an administration has suffered so many defeats in one day. Ministers are forced to publish the legal advice in full as a result.Brexiter fears are confirmed when the legal advice says the customs backstop will exist “indefinitely”. Northern Ireland’s DUP strikes a pact with hard Brexiters in the European Research Group (ERG) to vote down May’s deal, but immediately afterwards to prop up the Tories in any confidence vote.The cabinet shows growing signs of panic as the soft Brexiters Philip Hammond and Greg Clark warn of the dangers of no-deal, amid growing concern May has no other plan B. May suggests MPs could have a vote in 2020 on whether the UK will enter the unpopular customs backstop, but this gains no immediate traction.May spends the day in Downing Street, while 30 ministers are dispatched around the country to try to sell the Brexit deal. No 10 insists the vote is going ahead, while stepping up no-deal planning in the NHS and at the borders.MPs return to a febrile Westminster for the penultimate day of the five-day Brexit debate waiting to see if May will make any last-minute concessions. It will be surprising if Downing Street fails to shift given the intense pressure.The Commons decides on May’s Brexit final deal, with a widespread expectation it will be voted down. If so, all eyes on the size of the defeat: if the prime minister were to lose by more than 100 votes, her chances of survival would be remote.Labour could table a vote of no confidence in May’s government for debate – or Tory MPs could try to force a Conservative party leadership contest. Or both. Unless, of course, the prime minister has won an unlikely victory.An EU summit begins in Brussels, with May due to represent the UK. Brexit is not on the agenda, although if May’s deal is voted down and she is still prime minister, she will be expected to obtain some concessions or reassurance from EU leaders.The Brussels summit wraps up, with press conferences just after lunch.

There are differences between Chequers and the political declaration, but you have to be following the process quite closely to know what they are. Perhaps these figures reflect the fact that people think the package agreed in November really is worse. Or perhaps they reflect the fact that, over time, as May’s general plan has received more scrutiny, it has become more unpopular.The poll also shows that there is no consensus about what should happen if MPs vote down May’s deal on Tuesday.Curiously, even though opposition to May’s plan is rising, the poll also suggests that support for May amongst Conservative supporters has gone up over the last two months. Even if people do not like what May’s is proposing, she seems to be getting credit for trying. By contrast, satisfaction with Jeremy Corbyn amongst Labour supporters has gone done since October.Transport secretary Chris Grayling has been briefing freight and business leaders on no-deal planning for Dover Port as Kent County Council warned of chaos for schools, hospitals, morgues, weddings and tourism next One source, who spoke to him, said he did not share plans but said he told them “detail on contingency planning on motorways, lorry parks and ferry details, particularly around Kent and Dover port would be released later today”. The leader of the Conservative led Kent County Council Paul Carter has told the  that no-deal could cost Kent £1.5m a day, and the country £250m a day. There are more details in our story here.The disintegration of Ukip continues. Gerard Batten, its leader and an MEP, has now announced that he is leaving the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy group in the European parliament, a grouping for rightwing Eurosceptics dominated by Ukip (or, at least it used to be). Batten said:It is not possible for me to remain in the group when the president of the group Mr Farage launches continual attacks on me and Ukip in the UK media.You can read all the ’s Brexit coverage here. And you can read all our politics stories here. There is some overlap, obviously.And here are some of the more interesting Brexit stories around elsewhere today.The prime minister was confronted in Downing Street by Amber Rudd and other senior ministers who demanded to know what she intends to do to salvage the vote, and her Brexit deal with it.During a crisis meeting in Downing Street called by Mrs May they offered her four options - including a postponement of the vote - but came away exasperated when she refused to commit to any of them.At one point a frustrated Ms Rudd asked her: “What do you want to do, prime minister?” only to receive a “non-committal” reply.Several people involved said that an aide to Lynton Crosby, the Australian political strategist behind the Conservatives’ 2015 election victory, has been working with Eurosceptic MPs in plotting the future course of Brexit. This has included informal conversations on how to handle another plebiscite. David Canzini, former head of campaigns for the Conservative party, is said to be working at CTF Partners — Sir Lynton’s consultancy, which has close ties to Boris Johnson, a leading Eurosceptic — with Brexit-supporting MPs on the so-called “Chuck Chequers” campaign against Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement. Those involved said this work forms the natural starting point for a no-deal campaign in the event of a second referendum because it is the most organised pro-Brexit operation at present.Denying suggestions she had been “emotional” during the tense exchanges at last month’s five-hour Cabinet showdown, which resulted in her resigning along with Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, the Liverpudlian MP told the : “No one in Cabinet supported me. I was astounded. What I was asking for was a vote on the most important issue in a generation.”Calling on Cabinet colleagues to “reflect upon” why they refused to be “accountable”, the former TV presenter turned politician described the deal as “terrible” and said she had told the Prime Minister it was “the worst of both worlds” and a “deal for nobody”.“I thought we needed to focus our minds because this was a huge change for the country. But when the moment came, my Cabinet colleagues chose not to say anything. People talk about accountability, people talk about transparency, people talk about politicians with integrity but when it came to the crunch the other people around the room crumbled. I said: I hope they weren’t like that in their EU negotiations.”Confirming she had been “shouted down” by Sedwill and chief whip Julian Smith, McVey said: “I was accused of having a meltdown but actually it was the opposite way round because people were so adamant not to have a vote that various people, the chief whip, Sedwill, yes they did all (shout me down).”European leaders are preparing to give Theresa May a chance at Thursday’s EU summit to request further concessions from Brussels to get the withdrawal agreement through parliament.A slot has been set aside for her to address the 27 member states two days after the Commons vote. When Mrs May has finished, the leaders will consider a range of next steps, options and scenarios running into next February.We know that you understand how vital party funds are. Every quiz, every lunch, every race night brings precious contributions which members are happy to give to help our Party succeed in elections. These funds should not be used on isive issues where the majority of members strongly object to a flawed agenda.Firstly, we’ve got a floating pound … it won’t go into freefall.The first thing that will happen is it will go about five, ten points down further from the 15 it already is. So, we’ll end up 20 or 25 below what it was before the referendum. That’s not a bad thing. The pound’s always been too high from the point of view of industry because of the effect of the City.So, our competitive position with vis-a-vis Europe would be dramatically better even if there are tariffs. It would be much bigger than any tariff impact on us for everything except some agriculture. It will exacerbate the tariff effect on let’s say the German car industry or the German dairy industry for that matter.John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has rejected warnings from Len McCluskey, the Unite leader, that Labour members would see support for a second Brexit referendum as a betrayal, my colleague Severin Carrell reports. McCluskey, who wields substantial influence within the party, told a group of Labour MPs earlier this week the party could alienate supporters by backing a fresh referendum, and urged them to stick to Labour’s alternative Brexit plan. But McDonnell said that in a choice between staying in the EU and Theresa May’s deal he would vote to remain. Asked during a visit to Glasgow on Friday if the Unite general secretary was right supporters would see that as a betrayal, McDonnell said: “No.” He said that if there were a second referendum it was “inevitable” the choice for voters on the ballot would be remain versus Theresa May’s deal, adding “and if it was I would vote remain.”You can read Severin’s full story here.Matthew Goodwin, the academic who is co-author of a very readable and thought-provoking new book about “national populism”, has joined the debate about Norway plus. He doesn’t think it’s a solution either.And the Lib Dems have now sent out a new release about their second referendum amendment. This is from Tom Brake, the party’s Brexit spokesman.The Liberal Democrats have led the campaign for a people’s vote. We are proud to have tabled an amendment which, if passed, would ensure the people get the final say on Brexit.Whilst we have heard warm words from Labour MPs, including the shadow chancellor, Labour seem unlikely to support a final say despite it being popular with their voters and members. However, if Labour MPs and others who are concerned about the country’s future want to join us, Liberal Democrats would welcome their support.This does rather corroborate the People’s Vote claim that the Lib Dems are using the amendment for party political advantage. (See 11.25am.)This is from the Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn.Last night the Liberal Democrats tabled a new amendment to the government motion approving Theresa May’s Brexit deal that will be put to a vote on Tuesday. The Lib Dem amendment proposes a second referendum, and it says:At end, add “and instructs the government to take all necessary steps to prepare for a people’s vote in which the public may give their informed consent on leaving the EU or retaining the United Kingdom’s membership of the European Union.”You can read the original motion, and all the amendments that have been tabled (13 so far), on the order paper here (pdf).You might suppose the the People’s Vote campaign, which is campaigning for a second referendum, would welcome this move by the only party in the Commons enthusiastically campaigning for a second referendum.But they haven’t. In the second referendum camp there is a huge split over tactics, and the People’s Vote campaign have this morning released a statement saying the Lib Dem move is “deeply unhelpful” because it is premature. A spokesman for the campaign explained:The amendment by the Liberal Democrats is deeply unhelpful at this stage and does not have cross-party support or the backing of the People’s Vote campaign.The focus and strategy of our campaign has always been first to get the government’s Brexit deal rejected by parliament on Tuesday and then pave the way for a People’s Vote when it has maximum support in the House of Commons.This amendment is more about political point scoring than following a strategy and it would be deeply unfair for the Liberal Democrats to use this amendment against other supporters of the People’s Vote campaign who are united behind efforts to get the deal rejected and then secure the British public the final say they deserve.The Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, who also backs the campaign for a second referendum, had been expected to table her own cross-party second referendum amendment, with support from other doctors in the Commons. They argue that a “people’s vote” is necessary because Brexit should only go ahead with the “informed consent” of the electorate. But Wollaston has put her amendment on hold, accepting the People’s Vote argument that it is too early to put this to a Commons vote.(There are good grounds for delaying. As Theresa May is discovering, there is no point scheduling a Commons vote on something until you know you are likely to win, and realistically a second referendum motion will only have a good chance of getting passed in the Commons when Labour whips its MPs to support the idea - which it is not willing to do yet.)UPDATE: A People’s Vote source has been on to complain about the reference in the post above to a “huge” split in the second referendum camp. He says the People’s Vote campaign are united it is just the Lib Dems who are off on their own. Whether or not that amounts to a big split, I suppose, depends on whether or not you think the Lib Dems are a significant part of the pro second referendum lobby. Senior Norwegian politicians and businesses figures have rejected Norway plus, the increasingly touted British cross-party plan for the UK to leave the EU but join Norway in a free trade trade area inside the EU single market, my colleague Patrick Wintour reports.Patrick’s story also quotes from a report by People’s Vote, the campaign for a second referendum, arguing that Norway plus won’t work. You can read the full 17-page report here (pdf).David Coburn, the Scottish Ukip MEP, is also quitting the party.On the Today programme this morning the Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, who has been actively promoting “Norway plus” as a Brexit solution (the UK staying in the single market, as Norway is, plus in the customs union too), claimed that at least 10 cabinet ministers were in favour of the idea. He said:The country is crying out for us to put our narrow tribalism to one side.We understand that there are at least 10 cabinet ministers who are supporting this arrangement. What we need the prime minister to do, when she loses the vote on Tuesday, is to go on to the steps of Downing Street and make a very clear statement that we must pivot now to Norway plus.But the Conservative pro-European Jo Johnson, who resigned as a transport minister over Theresa May’s Brexit deal, told the same programme that Norway plus was a “non-starter” because it would leave the UK as a “nation of lobbyists” seeking to influence rules set in Brussels over which it had no say.Paul Nuttall, who was Ukip’s leader at the time of the 2017 general election and who is an MEP for north west England, has become the latest person to announce he is leaving the party because its current leader, Gerard Batten, is making it explicitly anti Muslim and pro Tommy Robinson. In a statement Nuttall said:After much soul-searching over the past week, I have concluded that I must, as of today, resign as a member of Ukip. I do this with an immense amount of reluctance and regret, as I have worked tirelessly for the party for the past fourteen years. I am resigning because the party is being taken in a direction which I believe is harmful to Brexit. The association with Tommy Robinson will simply appal many moderate Brexit voters and inevitably be detrimental to the cause.The Tommy Robinson issue should have been shelved and debated within the party following Brexit in line with the sensible decision taken by the national executive committee last month. The party leadership and my MEP colleagues have been aware of my views on this issue for some time. Putting Tommy Robinson front and centre, whilst Brexit is in the process of being betrayed is, in my view, a catastrophic error. To conflate Brexit and Robinson at this crucial moment is to put the Eurosceptic cause in danger and I cannot and will not be party to that. Nigel Farage, the most successful of Ukip’s many leaders and a figure who arguably did as much as anyone to create the conditions for the leave vote in 2016, announced he was leaving the party earlier this week.In his Today interview Matt Hancock, the health secretary, also said that Downing Street had been “very clear” that the Brexit vote would not be delayed.And he said that, if MPs voted down Theresa May’s Brexit deal, then the default option would be for the UK to leave the EU with no deal. He saidI don’t know how likely ‘no deal’ is. It is what happens automatically unless parliament passes something else. Good morning. Sorry about the late start.The Commons is not sitting today, and so we will have to wait until Monday for day four of the Brexit debate. But campaigning ahead of the vote continues. Downing Street is sending around 30 ministers on local visits today to promote the merits of Theresa May’s Brexit deal. In a statement released overnight, May said:We have delivered a deal that honours the vote of the British people.“I’ve been speaking to factory workers in Scotland, farmers in Wales and people right across the country, answering their questions about the deal and our future. Overwhelmingly, the message I’ve heard is that people want us to get on with it. And that’s why it’s important that ministers are out speaking with communities across the UK today about how the deal works for them.It is an odd tactic, because we are not in a general election campaign (yet?). But Number 10 clearly think that, if they cannot win round Tory MPs directly, then they might be able to do so indirectly, via their constituents. It all seems a bit of a long shot.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, was on the Today programme this morning talking about Brexit, and about planning for a no deal. As the Press Asociation report, he said that planes could be used to fly in drugs, and medicines could be given priority access through gridlocked ports in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The PA story goes on:Hancock also said the government was consulting on plans for chemists to ration drugs to ensure patients can retain access to vital medicines in the event of shortages. He defended the government’s preparations for a no-deal Brexit but stressed that the potential problems were a reason to back Theresa May’s plan in the crunch December 11 vote. The Times reported that a consultation launched by the Department for Health and Social Care called for rapid changes to medicine rules to “support the continuity of supply of medicines in a ‘no-deal’ scenario”. The government wants to enable ministers to issue a “serious shortage protocol” for pharmacies to follow, the newspaper said. It “could be issued in case of a serious national shortage and would enable community pharmacists and other dispensers to dispense in accordance with the protocol rather than the prescription without contacting the GP”. Ministers would order pharmacists to dispense a “reduced quantity” of the medicine, an “alternative dosage form”, a “therapeutic equivalent” or a “generic equivalent”.Hancock told BBC Radio 4’s Today that “this is something we are consulting on” and “it’s about having the appropriate clinical flexibility”. He insisted that his department was “on track” with arrangements for a no-deal Brexit. But he added: “The deal allows us to both deliver on the referendum result but do so in a way that allows both the economy to function but also these logistical problems not to arise.” As part of the plans “we are working on ensuring that we have aviation capacity”, he said. Asked if that would mean chartering planes to fly in medicines, he said: “We are working on exactly how we are going to do that, but that is part of the work we are doing.” Hancock added that there had been work to fast-track lorries containing medical supplies through ports such as Dover if there were problems. “If there is serious disruption at the border we will have prioritisation, and prioritisation will include medicines and medical devices,” he said. The government was also “buying a large collection of refrigeration units so that those drugs that can be stockpiled, we will have a stockpile of,” he said.Here is our overnight story with all yesterday’s main Brexit developments.There are no specific items in the diary for today.As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

The basin it is bound for is more than 15,000 miles (24,000km) across and eight miles deep.“Going to the far side of the moon is a major technological feather in the cap for China,” said Katherine Joy, a lunar scientist at the University of Manchester. “The Chinese lunar space programme is hugely ambitious.“It’s going to a place that is really special for lunar science. The impact crater carved a huge hole in the lunar crust and possibly into the lunar mantle. It potentially unlocks rocks that we wouldn’t normally find on the surface of the moon.” If the moon shot goes smoothly, the probe will swing into lunar orbit, descend on thrusters and then drop the final few metres to the barren surface in the first week of January. Once the dust has settled, the lander will deploy a ramp for the onboard rover to trundle down. In all, the mission will deliver more than a tonne of hardware to the moon’s surface.Chinese officials have revealed few details about the probe’s precise landing site, but a study this May from researchers at the Planetary Science Institute at the China University of Geosciences described how Chang’e 4 would explore the Von Kármán crater found inside the enormous impact basin.In targeting the side of the moon that constantly faces away from Earth, mission controllers must contend with the fact that they cannot communicate directly with the spacecraft. Instead, messages to and from Chang’e 4 will be relayed by the agency’s Queqiao satellite, which is in a “halo orbit” on the other side of the moon.Chang’e 4 is the latest giant leap in China’s fast-moving and ambitious lunar programme. The first two Chang’e missions in 2007 and 2010 sent probes into orbit around the moon. They were followed by Chang’e 3, a lander and rover that touched down on the Mare Imbrium lava plain on the moon’s near side. For the third phase of the programme, the Chang’e 5 and 6 missions will attempt to collect lunar samples and return them to Earth. Chang’e 5 is due to launch in December next year.Instruments onboard the lander and rover will allow them to study the local lunar geology, probe the moon’s interior, and analyse the solar wind – the stream of high-energy particles that come flooding out of the sun. One onboard experiment will test how well plants grow in the feeble lunar gravity.“By landing on the far side for the first time, the Chang’e 4 lander and rover will help us understand so much more about the moon’s formation and history. But just as importantly, it gives us practice operating a mission from the far side of the moon, and relaying data back to Earth via a satellite circling the far side,” said Tamela Maciel, from the UK National Space Centre in Leicester.The moon always shows the same face to Earth because it is close enough to become locked in position by the planet’s gravitational field. One of the enduring mysteries of the moon is why the near side has a different chemical makeup to the far side. By landing on the far side and examining its geology, scientists may get some hints as to how this came about.The Chinese mission reflects a broader resurgence of interest in the moon by national space agencies. The US, European, Russian, Japanese and Canadian agencies have set their sights on a “lunar gateway”, a habitable station that will orbit the moon and provide a stopping-off point for astronauts working on the lunar surface.Beyond the science of understanding how the moon came to be, scientists see other benefits in working on the surface. The moon makes an excellent observation post for the Earth and sun. And on the far side of the moon, the electromagnetic noise from terrestrial broadcasts are almost entirely blocked out, making it a prime spot from which to perform radio astronomy.“Astronomers have long dreamed of a radio telescope array built on the far side of the moon, said Maciel. “Since the far side of the moon never faces the Earth, it’s shielded from all of our radio noise, and a radio telescope here would be like escaping from city light pollution and seeing the night sky from the top of a mountain.“With a radio telescope on the far side of the moon, we would be able to explore the furthest and oldest objects in the universe like never before. But first we have to practice operating a mission from the far side first, and that’s what Chang’e 4 will help us do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e909d8da276dcaa25baca97b134d6d63e8664e75/0_36_6025_3615/master/6025.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d04b42c53a680540b4376e4d4a104bc","title":"young british black men change their names to increase chances of being hired","story":"A Hackney youth project aims to help overqualified but underemployed young people find their placeIn youth centres in cities across the UK young people are going into studios and remixing music. But at the Moving on Up project at Hackney Council for Voluntary Service (HCVS), young men searching for a job are remixing their names.Oluwatosin Adegoke, 23, who graduated this year from Bristol University, was an early adopter of this strategy. He’s been called Peter, the last of his four middle names, since he was a child.“I think my African parents want it to be easier for me in school,” he says. “But in the past two to three years I’ve had to start thinking about it a bit more. One, it’s instinct and two, whenever I go by Oluwatosin I have to spell it, and sometimes I get referred to as Oliver – even after I spell it out.”At Moving on Up, which the  visited as part of its Bias in Britain series, they aim to do something about that. “The difference is getting a foot in the door,” says Deji Adeoshun, a youth worker at HCVS, who advises Adegoke and others who take part. “I’ve had some guys who have had to change their surname because that was an issue,” he says, describing one in particular who was applying for an IT job. “Same job – applied with his actual surname and didn’t get a call back, applied with a Christian name and got an interview.”The strategy Adeoshun advocates might seem radical to some, but in the context of a workplace culture that often leaves black men excluded, radical action can be necessary. Such prejudices have clear economic consequences. The poverty rate for ethnic minorities is double that of white groups, according to research last year by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which also noted that workers who were not white were concentrated in low-paid sectors. And that was despite generally higher standards of academic attainment than most white groups.It is young black men who suffer the brunt of the exclusion, in particular thanks to specific stereotypes around aggression and fecklessness. “Aggression and violence is the strongest stereotype that research has shown is associated with black men,” Kandola says.Connor Robinson, mixed race, from south Croydon, is taller and bigger than your average 18-year-old. Robinson has been working with Talent Match Croydon, a local project set up to help disadvantaged young people into work.“Being brown or being black has been a big effect on my life,” says Robinson. “I think white people are very stereotyping towards me because I’m brown, because they think I’m a rudeboy or gangster. White people are very quick to judge black and brown people.”While many black and brown people learn to ignore, or become inured to, such casual racism, for Connor, who is autistic, the experiences continue to trouble him. Racism, he says, means he is socially isolated from a community which he strongly identifies with through his white mother.Most confrontational racism went out with the Equalities Acts, hate crimes legislation and black and white TV. But as Adeoshun, the youth worker, points out, these days, and particularly in the workplace: “Racism is not overt, it’s subtle.”While discrimination comes top of a list of barriers that face young black jobseekers, it is commonly expressed through other, related, hurdles. One is a lack of self-confidence in an alien environment entirely the preserve of white people.Another problem is a lack of role models and social networks to help people into industries. Lamide Olusegun, 23, one of the young men visiting Hackney CVS, who this year received a higher education diploma in animation from the University of the Creative Arts, had hoped for work in a production company. It was not that the doors were shut to him, more that he could not find any doors at all.“I felt like it’s who you know, it’s not really what’s in your portfolios. Especially in this art field. A lot of jobs are gotten in the bars and it’s just connections,” he says. As a black animator, he feels he has no one to look up to. “I’ve not seen personally any other black animators. Even at uni on my course, I don’t think there was that many black people, maybe just a handful – or even Asians as well, just ethnic people.”Such barriers mean that by the time young black men find their way into work they have been forced to severely moderate their ambitions. So, they – and particularly the subgroup of black African workers – are more likely to be overqualified for their roles. Adeoshun, a law graduate, is a prime example. He passed his bar exams only to find he was unable to secure a pupillage at a chambers.And for those who appear stuck on the scrapheap, the lure of the shadow economy is strong. One young man in Croydon speaks of how, in an effort to raise a couple of hundred pounds, he pulled a scam and was convicted of fraud. Now he is blocked from any job in a bank, further limiting his prospects.What are the solutions? Many companies, including the , have begun rolling out “unconscious bias” training for senior managers, in an effort to make people aware of any unexamined prejudices that could lead to their not hiring people from ethnic minority groups.But in a key report on race in the workplace, commissioned by the government and published in February last year, the Conservative peer Ruby McGregor-Smith said this unconscious bias was often anything but. “We need to stop hiding behind the mantle of ‘unconscious bias’,” she declared.Lady McGregor-Smith said: “I have to question how much of this bias is truly ‘unconscious’ and by terming it ‘unconscious’ how much it allows us to hide behind it. Conscious or unconscious, the end result of bias is racial discrimination, which we cannot and should not accept.”Kandola, the business psychologist, warns that such a stance risks undermining attempts to eliminate what is a most insidious form of racism. “Not all biases are conscious,” he says. “There are some things that are very blatant that occur in the workplace and they are clearly not unconscious. But there are other things which are far more subtle that happen and people may not be aware they are doing it.He recommends seeing racial bias as a performance issue at work, feeding back to managers about their biases and telling them how to change them, and disciplining those who fail to respond.But young black men are not sitting back and waiting for procedures to be put in place and for attitudes to change. Olusegun is among those being active. Instead of trying to find work with an established production company he has taken his future into his own hands by starting his own business, merchandising his cartoon characters for sale online and in the market.“I’ve seen the light in self-employment, it’s helped me build some resilience as well,” he says. “I’ve learned so much of how to run a business, how to brand yourself, how to market yourself. These are things that I had a little idea about, but I’d never had a chance to practice it. And I’m seeing results as well, so it’s not looking bleak for me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb52b723ae113746baf57d08f247054e9b832afd/0_55_5642_3385/master/5642.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9a3a425368e687a0ce0d8d3a066e846","title":"motability firm boss to get 22m bonus on top of 17m salary","story":"Public spending watchdog attacks package for Mike Betts, whose firm gets £888m of tax breaksThe boss of the business that leases cars to people with disabilities on behalf of the Motability charity is stepping down after it emerged he is set to receive a £2.2m bonus on top of his seven-figure salary.Mike Betts, the chief executive of Motability Operations, came under fire earlier this year after MPs called his annual £1.7m pay package “totally unacceptable”.A report by the government spending watchdog, the National Audit Office (NAO), published on Friday says as well as his “generous” remuneration, Betts is in line for a previously undisclosed performance bonus worth about £2.2m.Following the report, Motability Operations announced that Betts would stand down from his position by May 2020, while the group’s chairman, Neil Johnson, would retire in April 2019.In a statement, Motability Operations said: “After 16 years in the business, Motability Operations chief executive Mike Betts and the board of Motability Operations Group plc have agreed that, following the implementation of actions agreed as an outcome of the NAO review, and working to help the new chairman settle in, a suitable successor will be found, and Mike will step down from the board, no later than May 2020.“The board is clear that recommendations made by the NAO will benefit from Mr Betts’ experience and skills to see them through.”The Motability scheme enables disabled people to lease adapted cars using their enhanced mobility disability benefits – either disability living allowance or its successor, the personal independence payment. It currently helps about 614,000 people, many of whom would otherwise struggle to afford a vehicle.The NAO is critical of the performance plan put in place for Betts and his fellow directors in 2008, saying that the targets meant to incentivise “excellent performance” were set at levels below what the company was achieving when the scheme was introduced.The targets were “easily exceeded” and in the first seven years of the plan, five executive directors received “generous” remuneration of £15.3m in total, a near fourfold increase for what the NAO suggests was unexceptional performance.“Motability Operations’ management has performed well since 2002. However, we do think there is a difference between turning an underperforming business around and carrying out a series of important but not necessarily exceptional tasks to keep it on a road to a successful operation,” it concludes.Although the 2008 scheme ended in 2015 and a new scheme will cut directors’ remuneration – Betts’ package is likely to shrink from £1.7m to £1.4m in 2019-20 – the NAO says it will still be substantially more generous than those for comparable public sector organisations that compete with the private sector for executive talent, such as BBC Studios and Network Rail.Although Motability does not directly receive public funding, critics point out that it receives about half of its annual £4bn income from disability benefits redirected to it by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) on behalf of claimants. It also receives £888m worth of tax breaks that no other firm is entitled to, and is in effect a monopoly.While the company has performed well and deserves credit for providing an excellent service to customers, it has operated in a protected environment, the NAO says. It has made £1bn in unplanned profit since 2008 and holds nearly £2.6bn in reserves, significantly higher than other major car-leasing companies.The scheme is overseen by a charity, Motability, and operated under a seven-year rolling contract by Motability Operations, which is a public limited company. The NAO found that the charity had little formal influence over Motability Operations’ executive pay arrangements.The NAO notes that the company has donated £345m to the Motability charity since 2010. In September it announced a further £400m donation, an amount equivalent to 14 times the charity’s annual spending in 2017-18. It was not yet clear that Motability could absorb the scale of the donations it had received or spend them effectively.Responding to the NAO report, the Motability charity said it would “seek improved mechanisms to better influence Motability Operations’ executive remuneration”. Its chair, Lord Sterling, said that the scheme accepted the watchdog’s recommendations but insisted there were “areas still open to further debate”.A DWP spokeswoman said: “To ensure that the scheme is focused on delivering better value for money we are committed to working with the charity and key stakeholders so that current and future arrangements result in improved outcomes for disabled people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/149da46085537ef181c66666903b34adf0e10e4a/3_163_4464_2677/master/4464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03b08afd8e33e0d8062aabf6299bcdce","title":"lima sopoaga wasps","story":"The former All Black candidly admits that filling Danny Cipriani’s boots at Wasps has not always been easyLima Sopoaga is not the first All Black – and will not be the last – to take time to adjust to his new surroundings. Gazing out of the window at the lashing rain whipping across the pitches of Broadstreet RFC is not the vision he was sold when he signed for Wasps as one of English club rugby’s best-paid players. “The sun’ll still come up in the morning,” murmurs the fly-half, trying hard to look on the bright side. “Or a lot of grey anyway.”There is, to be fair, limited glamour to be found on a wet Monday lunchtime on the outskirts of Coventry. When Sopoaga chose to curtail his Test career and seek his fortune on wintry foreign fields he was also unaware he would be joining an underperforming new club. By his own admission, their new figurehead has also been below-par. “Everyone thinks he’s ridden into town on a big white horse and everything’s going to be alright,” sighs Dai Young, his director of rugby. “That hasn’t quite happened.”These things, of course, are never the fault of one man. Wasps have been disrupted by injuries and international calls, Sopoaga has had assorted different players around him and off-field certainty has also been absent. The prospect of Elliot Daly, Nathan Hughes and Willie le Roux all being at the club next season seems remote and front-row fitness issues have hindered preparations for the first of the club’s back-to-back European games against Toulouse at the Ricoh Arena on Saturday.Lose at home and, as Young concedes, Wasps’ European goose will probably be cooked before Christmas. Having committed to paying Sopoaga a reported £1.5m over two-and-a-half years, it would not be an auspicious start. The 27-year-old has definitely looked happier. “It’s not that I don’t love this but there are things that do get you down,” he confirms, softly. “It’s not all glitz and glamour. A lot of the time people just see the 80 minutes, they don’t see what goes on behind closed doors and how winning and losing can affect players.”Ask him to elaborate and it all comes tumbling out. “I take it all quite personally. I know when I’ve been playing well and when I haven’t and, at the moment, I’m just not quite there. It’s not through a lack or preparation or not trying my best. I know guys who have come over in different positions who have also found it hard but when you’re such a focal point...”There is a pause as he reaches for the best analogy. “If I came in as a full-back or a wing all I’d really need to do is know my moves, score tries, run fast and catch high balls. Here I’ve got to play chess and drive the bus. On occasions I’ve felt I’ve driven it well on others I know I haven’t really nailed it. I feel that deeply and I shoulder a lot of that personally. Dropping balls or kicking out on the full are all things I can control. Coming over as a marquee player adds more pressure but there is no one with greater expectations of me than me.”His honesty is admirable but the confident match-winner sought by Wasps as a replacement for Danny Cipriani is hard to spot. A proven goal-kicker and deceptive runner, Sopoaga won 16 caps for New Zealand and helped steer the Highlanders to the 2015 Super Rugby title. In Europe, so far, that has counted for frustratingly little: “You’ve just got to realise the way you play in New Zealand isn’t necessarily the best way over here. There’s not a right or wrong way, it’s just different.” How different? “Very. For eight to nine years I was at the Highlanders and I learned a way of thinking I thought was best for me. Here it’s not what they do.”As a youngster he used to make the mistake of checking out social media when he endured a lean patch. Nowadays he goes home to his partner Miriam and 14-month-old daughter Milla and counts his blessings. “When I come home they don’t see Lima Sopoaga the rugby player they just see their partner or Dad. That’s what keeps driving me every day. If I have a bad day at the office I know that people still love me and I’ve got so much to be grateful for. Sometimes it is just football. It’s just a game.”You can only hope things ultimately work out for this warm-hearted, thoughtful new arrival, just as they did for Le Roux. Plenty of All Blacks have found it tougher in the northern hemisphere than they anticipated: satisfaction cannot be guaranteed. Nor does big money buy instant happiness, as Sopoaga knew even before he flew north to help provide for his extended family. “It was a big move. Some people have said maybe I should have stayed. But it’s my own life, I get to decide what I want to do. With the All Blacks and the Highlanders I was probably away for four and a half months of the year. For the first nine weeks my daughter was alive I was away for seven of them. That’s another big reason why I moved over here.”He has also learned one significant life lesson already: it pays not to underestimate English rugby players. “In New Zealand I don’t think we watch enough northern hemisphere rugby to truly appreciate it. It’s out of sight, out of mind. Because we don’t see it we’re like: ‘Meh, whatever.’ Now, being amongst it, you’ve got some very skilled players and some pretty wicked talent. England have a very decent pack, some electric outside backs and a world-class 10. If you can get a fully-fit England team playing with the mindset they did against the All Blacks last month they’re going to give themselves half a chance.”This does not mean, naturally, that he is writing off his good friends Ardie Savea, TJ Perenara and Rieko Ioane in Japan next year, despite their November wobbles. “They’ll come back stronger. I’d be 100 per cent confident that black jersey will be a very dangerous beast come the World Cup.”And Wasps? “I feel the cogs are slowly starting to turn. Once this bus starts to roll I think it’s going to be pretty hard to stop.” Sopoaga has not been an overnight sensation but he is not finished yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f6840abca8aecfb196fced95c29d225c922d321/0_2_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4267b614acceb67c0ba70d88668e731","title":"tour de yorkshire attracts world road race favourites to test out circuit cycling","story":"Next year’s Tour de Yorkshire at the beginning of May will offer male and female riders what is likely to be their only chance to race on the circuit that will be used for the road race world championsips in Harrogate five months later.The announcement of the route for the Tour de Yorkshire on Friday revealed that stage two of the men’s race and stage one of the women’s event on 3 May will both be erted around the hilly, technical 14km circuit – with its twists and turns in and out of the centre of Harrogate – that will provide the climax to the elite women’s and men’s road races on 28 and 29 September.Additionally, an intermediate sprint has been located in Parliament Street in Harrogate where the world championship finish line will be located, enabling a racing insight into what will be required.Among the favourites in September will be the previous Tour de Yorkshire winner and 2015 world champion Lizzie Deignan, who has described the circuit as “very hard, very good, with lots of places to launch attacks.”Each year, pressure mounts on the Tour de France organisers Amaury Sport Organisation – who also organise the Yorkshire Tour - to run a women’s Tour, and Yorkshire continues to provide pointers for a possible future format. This year the women’s race will conclude on a Saturday, 4 May, and both stages will be identical to those on the men’s race, making this the longest and toughest Women’s Tour de Yorkshire.Stage one of the men’s Tour in East Yorkshire finishes in Selby after a day on relatively flat roads stage two of the men’s event corresponds to stage one of the women’s race and concludes in Bedale, again with a mass finish expected.The weekend is far tougher: the womens race will be decided on Saturday on the Yorkshire coast, with the particularly tough ascent up Lythe Bank from the seaside to the moors north of Whitby and two further climbs before the finish in Scarborough. That stage will enable the men’s race to take shape before it concludes on Sunday’s hilly leg from Halifax to Leeds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e23b77b24113cd482046d96ce46ef53fe76e1bb9/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49792aefa5d31c7a48a70a0628554bbf","title":"choose your favourite stage show of 2018","story":"Which plays left you speechless?

All images captured on the Google Pixel 3A decade ago, grabbing a burger was a quick fix, something we did when we were short of cash, time or imagination. For modern diners, going for a burger is a quest. A quest for excellence: gastronomic, ethical and aesthetic excellence. In cities around the globe, dishes that would once have been termed fast food – pizza, grilled cheese sandwiches, tacos and hot dogs – are being taken as an art form, with fiercely loyal cult followings on social media and five-star newspaper reviews by food critics previously accustomed to starchy tablecloths and foamy, fiddly haute cuisine offerings. On Twitter and other social media platforms, diners furiously debate the merits of a Bleecker burger over a Patty \u0026amp Bun burger on the Mexican front, Breddos and DF Mexico vie for the crown of best tacos in London, and the gloves are off between devotees of Pizza Pilgrims and Franco Manca.This is the golden age of flash food – poshed-up fast food – when the most sought-after meals around the UK are sophisticated versions of simple staples.“I think haute cuisine has been put in its place,” says chef Gizzi Erskine, author of Slow: Food Worth Taking Time Over. “We now take comfort in simple dishes that mean something to us, that may have been pushed to another level from technique and ingredients. Plus, we care much more about the ingredients – provenance, breed and how things are farmed – so there’s a new understanding that a great piece of meat cooked simply is enough.”A menu is one of the most telling barometers of any society, indicating our shifting aspirations, economic circumstances, ethical and health preoccupations and how we choose to socialise. “This is definitely a sociological trend as much as about food tastes,” says Damien Gabet, editor of Square Meal magazine. “It’s no longer cool to shout about that Michelin-starred meal you ate off starched tablecloths, but there’s cultural capital to be gained from going out and Instagramming a meal from the most hyped food truck in town.”Social media has significantly fuelled the trend for superlative versions of simple dishes. “Fine-dining fare doesn’t actually photograph that well and generally looks fussy and drab,” says Gabet. “Whereas, dishes such as tacos and burgers have distinct outlines and vibrant colours.”In London, few figures have done more to champion affordable new restaurants, informal supper clubs and food trucks than Clerkenwell Boy, an anonymous food influencer with close to 200,000 followers on Instagram (@Clerkenwell_Boy). “I started Instagramming to try and make food more accessible and less elitist,” he says. “Because, while there is a place for special-occasion fine-dining, on a Tuesday night with friends, we generally want affordable but delicious meals served family-style, in a no-frills setting but with relaxed and friendly service.”And while we might be dining out more, this doesn’t mean we’re lowering our standards. “If we go out for a burger, we want it to be the best burger in town,” says Clerkenwell Boy. “We want to eat simply, but we want it to be the absolute best version of that dish.”As Trish Caddy, Mintel’s senior foodservice analyst, puts it: “Millennials – the generation most likely to consider themselves as ‘foodies’ – have developed an acquired taste for artisanal flavours such as dry-aged meats and smoked cheese, partly out of a desire for visceral, intense experiences that stimulate their senses.”And although consumers are increasingly health-conscious, there’s also been a shift in what we consider an “unhealthy” meal. Burgers and pizzas are no longer demonised there’s a new understanding that excessive sugar, sweeteners, additives and heavy processing are the real culprits in poor health and obesity.“So, instead of eating low-quality processed meats such as fatty pepperoni and sausages, millennials are seeking out functional ingredients like fermented foods that tap into the ongoing gut-friendly food trend,” says Caddy. “For example, sourdough pizzas, which feature purported health benefits that come from the fermentation process, have a distinctive sourness compared to ordinary pizza bread dough. This suits millennials, who have grown accustomed to food with intensive flavours as well as health benefits.”And if diners are rediscovering simple pleasures, the good news is that these dishes are also immensely satisfying to prepare. “Cooking should be about everything from sourcing great ingredients to the therapeutic rituals of breaking down the recipes,” says Erskine. “And everyone should be able to eat, and cook, this way.”The Curiosity Rooms events take place at 55 Regent Street from 15 November to 16 December 2018.

All images captured on the Google Pixel 3 by Stephanie Sian SmithVibrant, arty and home to one of London’s most erse communities, Peckham has cemented itself as a true cultural hotspot – with creative hub Peckham Levels, the legendary Bussey Building and no shortage of galleries and cafes just a few of its draws. But long before SE15 was named by Time Out as one of the world’s coolest neighbourhoods, it was the stomping ground of blogger and best-selling author Chidera Eggerue.With 187,000 Instagram followers, Eggerue is now known globally by her online moniker, the Slumflower – a name borrowed from Street Etiquette’s concept of a rose growing from concrete. Her debut book, What a Time to be Alone: the Slumflower’s Guide to Why You Are Already Enough, is now in its third print run and she has recently published her second, Scribble Yourself Feminist. Growing up in south-east London, Eggerue mirrors the Slumflower message of growing, glowing and flourishing in an urban environment. Here, she presents her very personal guide to Peckham, reflecting on the everyday extraordinary places that fire up her imagination …Taste some proper Nigerian foodI live with my mum and two brothers and I don’t really eat out much as my mum is an amazing cook. She makes jollof rice, egusi (a type of melon seed) soup, beans and yam. She also shops local and buys her meat and vegetables from the market in Peckham.But if you want to know a good Nigerian restaurant in the area, I would suggest 805 Restaurants – I get plantain and jollof rice. Afterwards, stop by Cafe Spice, a small, yellow shop opposite the Bussey Building. Look out for a Nigerian snack called a puff puff, which is very sweet and like a fried doughnut.Kick back with a drinkJohn the Unicorn is really nice, or Prince of Peckham – it does great chicken, and has really good DJ sets and there’s a party room upstairs. It’s quite new but it’s where I’d go with friends now. People do of course go on to club nights at the CLF Art Cafe – known locally as the Bussey Building (during the summer months there’s a rooftop bar and cinema), but I’m like an 80-year-old granny and just go home!Head to the only cinema worth knowing aboutOnce a month I take myself on an evening date to watch a film at Peckhamplex. I’ve been going there since I was born and it’s still the only cinema I go to – at a fiver a ticket, you can’t go wrong. I saw the new Incredibles film recently, which I loved it was so cute. Going there and having time to myself is important. What is now above it – the creative workplay hub that is Peckham Levels – used to be a multi-storey car park. My dad used to park there before we went to the cinema and he’d whizz around the levels, it was so much fun. Frank’s Cafe is there now, on the rooftop, but it’s not really my thing.Look out for inspiring wall artWhen I was younger, there was a wall by Peckham library with photos of famous black actors, who I very much aspired to be. The bus I took to secondary school went past it, so I’d see them every day from age 11 to 16. Now the murals are on the walls of the Peckhamplex, which I love.Hit up my beauty go-tosPaks Hair and Cosmetics is where I get my hair treatments, conditioners and extensions. I also go to Anna’s nail shop once a month to get my nails done. (Find it in Ali Baba’s barber shop on 127 Rye Lane.) It’s £25 and quite expensive. I always get pointy nails shellac all the way. I get the brightest, neon colours I can. My tip? Get Anna’s son to do them – he’s the best.Get a coffee fixI get my coffee at the Costa on Rye Lane every day, but it’s not very Peckham! It used to be a Mothercare. My mum would always go in there with me and just the other day I was looking at an old film of me in there, which we still have on tape. There was more footage of me in my pram and walking through Peckham. There were green buses then – they were so cool – and the McDonalds is in shot, which is still there.Find some headspaceSexby Garden in Peckham Rye Park is my hideout, my reflection spot – my secret favourite place.

From rethinking your routine to noticing art and culture around you, as part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, here are 10 ways to appreciate the magic of the everyday. All images captured on Google Pixel 3Most of us are settled into our routines. Wake up, check emails, grab a coffee, hop on the train, get to work. It’s not our fault, it’s the efficient way that our brains work. “Having this autopilot mode allows the conscious mind to be freed up for other tasks,” says Gemma Griffith, a director at the Centre for Mindfulness Research and Practice at Bangor University.However, autopilot mode can have its downsides. By being so wedded to our ingrained habits and routine we can risk becoming disconnected from other people and our surroundings, and missing out on everyday magic. For Griffith the remedy is simple: “It’s about switching back to ‘being’ mode rather than ‘doing’ mode and focusing our attention on the present moment”. Here are 10 ways to shake up your routine and relish the everyday.Take time outYou don’t have to trek to the top of a mountain to find inner peace. Whether you’re on your commute or taking a lunchtime stroll, take the time to open up your awareness. “Focus on your walking, how your feet feel on the ground, the temperature of the weather at that moment, and the sounds you hear,” says Griffith. Coax your mind into the present moment by taking a different route home or trying out a new lunch spot.Be more basicFashion’s love affair with utilitarian dressing continues, with pared-back basics the lynchpins of Instagram’s most followed fashion icons. “The current appetite for streetwear and the rise of high-street stores that specialise in stocking classic key items, such as brands like Arket, prove that the trend for basics is going nowhere,” says stylist Laura Martin. The humble white t-shirt, the classic hoodie and ordinary gym trainers have never been more on trend. The good news is, they’re probably already in your wardrobe.Rethink your favourite foodsThe internet has turned eating into an art form. While home chefs could once have lived a lifetime using only Mrs Beeton’s Cookery Book for company, today we are googling ambitious dishes then feverishly photographing and hashtagging the results. But have we forgotten the simple pleasure of ordinary meals and ingredients? As the zeitgeist turns towards a balanced approach to eating, bloggers such as the Ugly Vegan are performing the seemingly revolutionary act of sharing unfiltered, familiar dishes. For your next evening in, why not grab a bag of imperfect veg and create something extraordinarily ordinary?Notice art around youYou don’t have to go to a gallery to appreciate great art and design: seek out signs of creativity all around you. If you’re in London, look up Art on the Underground’s Brixton mural map, leading to examples of street art in the area dating back to the 1970s and 1980s. Based in Manchester? Check out the street art tours on offer by writer Hayley Flynn, who set up bespoke tours of the city to put a spotlight on the local landscape of the Northern Quarter, which is packed with rich history. Over in Bristol, the tourist office has published free, downloadable walking tours of Banksy’s work.Discover hidden librariesFrom repurposed old red phone boxes to shelves at the train station, hidden libraries are popping up everywhere. The literary scheme Read Now, Write Now has teamed up to create book exchange shelves along the Wirral train line, and Clapham North tube station in London has a book swap shelf located at its entrance. Over in Crossmichael in southern Scotland and Amberley in Stroud, locals have turned their old phone boxes into mini libraries. The pleasure in these new makeshift lending libraries? “You get to discover new gems,” says Fruzsina Bekefi who runs a monthly book swap out of east London reading nook Libreria. “It’s a great way to widen my horizons and inject a bit of serendipity into my life.”Find a new perspective There are more than 4m posts for #lookup on Instagram and with good reason: from intricate architecture to stunning skies, there’s so much you could miss if you keep your eyes trained on the ground. And as we shuffle along our daily tramlines, our thinking can get stuck in a rut too. Head up a hillside or tall building for a fresh look at where you live, or mix up your commute by getting off a stop or two early and walking the rest of the way.Discover hidden historyWhether you are a fan of poets, musicians, athletes or writers, it’s worth keeping your eyes peeled for the English Heritage blue plaque scheme. The plaques dotted around London point out where notable creatives lived in the city, from children’s author AA Milne to the black composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. The English heritage scheme has also influenced other local areas across the UK to celebrate their histories, too – so look out for blue plaques in Brighton and Hove, South Tyneside and Leeds (thanks to the local Leeds Civic Trust).Shake up your workoutIf your idea of exercise is headphones and a running machine, why not break the habit and explore a more sociable way to exercise? GoodGym hosts running meet-ups across the UK, combining fitness with an activity that benefits the local community. Jog to meet an isolated elderly person, sort out cans at a food bank or pitch in to tidy someone’s garden. A recent study from the University of New England College of Osteopathic Medicine in the US proved that team exercise can lower stress and improve quality of life.Appreciate moreBusy doesn’t have to equal stress – it’s all about how you approach it, says Griffith. “Do a routine activity mindfully, whether that is brushing your teeth or eating breakfast in the morning, by adjusting your senses to what you are doing,” she says. The benefits of mindfulness are worth it. “It’s a practise that lowers the stress hormone cortisol. It encourages those who apply mindfulness to their daily lives to have more compassion for themselves and others,” says Griffith.Get back to natureGwyneth Paltrow’s love of grounding has been well documented (and much maligned), but how about a spot of forest bathing? This new nature buzzword refers to a rising trend in green spaces inspired by a Japanese tradition. Try it by heading to your local forest or woodland trail and soaking up everything you see, touch, hear and smell. Even if you can’t make it that far afield, swap that “al desko” lunch for some much needed vitamin D – it’s the perfect pick-me-up when daylight hours are in such short supply.The Curiosity Rooms events take place at 55 Regent Street from 15 November to 16 December 2018.

We’d like your help in documenting their recoveryEngland and Wales have about 140,000 miles of footpaths, but it is estimated more than 10,000 have been lost from current maps. Volunteers have been working tirelessly to rediscover them and put in legal applications for the recovery of lost paths before a government deadline in 2026 after which claims will no longer be accepted.If you have already found a lost footpath, how did you find and identify it? If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.Below are some tips on how to rediscover a lost footpath:1. The first port of call is the Ramblers, whose website gives clear advice on how to identify a lost path and make an application. The method involves comparing new and old maps, plus examination of historical sources. Walking and exploration is involved, but don’t forget that a lost path has to be proven before you can use it, otherwise you are trespassing.2. It is also important to be sure you are not replicating work already underway. This government website can give you information on current applications.3. You may also know of paths that are used regularly, but are not on the definitive map (you can ask your local council to see that map). Any footpath walked by the public for 20 years without any attempt by the landowner to prevent access can be made a right of way. Check your local walking groups for people actively walking along unmapped routes to help establish this right.You can share your tips and stories with us in the encrypted form below.

We follow in her blood-soaked footstepsPatty Vengeance is really into Mary, Queen of Scots: “She’s seen as this feminist icon. For me, though, it’s more that she’s relatable – as a strong woman and a survivor.”The 29-year-old writer and musician, who fronts the riot grrrl band Fistymuffs, is standing by the edge of the water in Leith, where, according to a plaque set into the quayside, Mary arrived from France in the haar-veiled early morning of 19 August 1561. The widowed teenager – tall, red-haired, an unearthly beauty – was the anointed ruler of Scotland, and she had come home.“She was a tragic figure,” says Patty, who lives in this increasingly hipsterish district of Edinburgh. “But she was determined and resilient. I admire her very much.”How extraordinary that the life and death of this 16th-century queen continues to speak to us, perhaps to women in particular, in the 21st century.A forthcoming film, Mary Queen of Scots, stars Saoirse Ronan as Mary and Margot Robbie as Queen Elizabeth, who in 1587 ordered the execution of her cousin and rival for the English throne. The film is likely to reignite interest in the many castles and other locations associated with her dramatic reign, and has prompted Historic Environment Scotland to revamp its Mary, Queen of Scots trail. A fine opportunity, then, to follow in her footsteps, retracing her extraordinary journey through Scotland.Edinburgh is the place to start. Mary feels very present in Scotland’s capital. On display in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery is perhaps her most famous portrait – ravenishly regal in a black gown, right hand pale on a blood-red cloth – as well as oils of the many powerful men who worked against her interests to advance their own.The National Museum of Scotland (Saoirse Ronan visited in preparation for the role) has a number of objects associated with Mary, including a silver and ebony crucifix that might, just might, have been hers. Many of the queen’s possessions were destroyed or dispersed following her death, lest they become relics – and the focus of Catholic rebellion those that remain throb with haunted glamour.The presence of Mary can be felt most palpably at the Palace of Holyroodhouse. The official residence of the present queen sits at the foot of the Royal Mile the private apartments once inhabited by Mary are open to visitors. They are furnished as they would have been in the 16th century, and a walk within these rooms brings to vivid life a notorious episode: the murder of her private secretary and favourite, David Rizzio, on 9 March 1566.In a small room off her bedroom, Mary and supper guests were disturbed by her second husband, Lord Darnley, and a number of armed nobles. They demanded Rizzio, accusing him of having an affair with the queen. Clutching at Mary’s skirts, he was dragged away and stabbed 56 times.The supper room is tiny: stretch out your arms and you can almost touch both walls. It is easy to imagine the chaos and horror of the scene, the stink of blood and sweat, candlewax and spilt wine. Mary, six months pregnant, is said to have had a pistol aimed at her belly. A brass plaque in the outer chamber marks the spot where Rizzio’s body was dumped. His portrait, hung perhaps as a form of restitution, peers out from the supper-room wall.Scotland’s history often strains to become something deeper and stranger – myth, and Mary exemplifies this. For children of my generation, and perhaps still, she was more like a figure from a fairytale than a real person you might learn about at school. We told her death with dandelions: holding tight to the top of the stem, you would chant, “Mary Queen of Scots got her head chopped off like … this!” On the final word you’d flick forward your thumb and decapitate the golden flower.That little game gave a title to the poet and dramatist Liz Lochhead, whose 1987 play Mary Queen of Scots Got Her Head Chopped Off is a Scottish classic. I meet her in Glasgow, the scene of the Battle of Langside, which Mary fought and lost against her half-brother, the Earl of Moray. The site is marked by a grand memorial column next to Queen’s Park, one of the Dear Green Place’s dearest green spaces from this vantage point Mary is said to have watched the defeat.“She wanted to do an impossible thing,” Lochhead says. “To live the life of a woman, with love and children, as well as being a person of great power. The drama, for me, is about these two queens in one green island – that accident of history where you’ve got two women in power, Mary and Elizabeth, dealing with it very differently.”Mary had fought at Langside after escaping imprisonment in Lochleven Castle, a brutish medieval tower on a small island near Kinross (the short crossing is included in the price of your ticket the castle). On a misty day, Loch Leven is leaden, and Benarty Hill – known as The Sleeping Giant – a dark ogreish hump. This feels an appropriately melancholy time in which to visit. Mary spent one autumn here, during almost a year of captivity. She would have seen the leaves turn and fall. The summer had been a season of withering loss. Pregnant with twins, she miscarried a few days later, exhausted and heartsick, she was forced – on pain of death – to abdicate in favour of her infant son James.Perhaps Mary’s faith kept her going. Her prison is a ruin, but it is still possible to get a sense of daily ritual. High in the tower house is the area where she had her private chapel there is a window, a stone basin for the cleansing of the altar vessels after mass, and a cupboard for their storage.Did Mary feel close to God here? One would not blame her if she felt forsaken. Her pregnancy had been the result of abduction and rape by the Earl of Bothwell, a sexual assault carried out in order to force her to marry him, argues the historian Kate Williams in her new book, Rival Queens. Mary is, for her, a #MeToo monarch: “She could be deprived of her power just by taking her body. She was treated in a way that they would never treat a king.”My last stop in the queen’s footsteps is Dundrennan Abbey, a beautiful ruin in a peaceful valley in Galloway, its gothic arches bright with early sun. Mary fled here from Langside. In this hallowed place, it is said, she spent her last hours on Scottish soil – and made the fateful decision to throw herself at the mercy of Queen Elizabeth, expecting the English ruler would help restore her to the Scottish throne. Elizabeth’s betrayal, as it is sometimes seen, can provoke strong feelings among the admirers of Mary – pilgrims, really – who make the journey to Dundrennan. The abbey’s steward remembers one sweet little old lady provoked by the mere mention of Elizabeth’s name to observe, “Bastard by birth, bitch by nature!”I am visiting with someone who takes a more temperate view. Liz Manson is president of the Marie Stuart Society, an organisation dedicated to promoting understanding of the life of Mary. They laid the plaque in Leith and arranged for a statue to be erected at Linlithgow Palace, the queen’s birthplace. Liz suggests we move on from Dundrennan, as she has a special place she’d like me to see.We drive a couple of miles down a single track (ask at the abbey for directions). Part of a military firing range, this route is sometimes closed look out for a roadside sign telling you whether or not to proceed. The path ends at a rocky beach, a stream flowing into the water. This is Abbey Burnfoot. From this shore – at around 3pm on 16 May 1568 – Mary set sail for England. The Solway Firth, on the morning I visit, is the colour of tarnished silver and cold as vanished dreams. The Marie Stuart Society conducted a ceremony of remembrance earlier this year, marking the 450th anniversary of her departure, laying a red rose in the water for Mary, and 16 white roses for those who went with her.Liz used to feel this was a sorrowful spot, but takes comfort that Mary was leaving in full expectation of a triumphant return. It would be nice to think, she says, that the sun shone on her departure: “It might have made her feel that bit more hopeful.”The queen did not know what lay ahead, could not have imagined laying her long white neck on the axeman’s block 18½ years later. That was both a mercy and a fatal lack of foresight. Mary left Scotland in pride and – given all she had suffered – a strange sort of innocence. She held her head high.• Mary Queen of Scots opens in the UK on 18 January "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/219d17ab5c5b82f800572b47ece6741ce88d7f21/6_125_783_470/master/783.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be5b3d0c9e0081526de43618065dfafd","title":"hawaiian monk seal eel stuck up nose why","story":"Picture of monk seal with eel up its nose shared by Noaa was only latest episode to occur in the past two years, baffling researchersThe Hawaiian monk seal has become endangered due to a range of threats, from fishing net entanglements to disease. Now the beleaguered species is facing an unexpected new challenge – eels getting stuck up their noses.A picture of a monk seal with an eel up its nose was shared this week by a Hawaii-based ision of the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa). The episode was just the latest eel-in-snout incident to occur in the past two years, baffling researchers.“We’ve been intensively monitoring monk seals for four decades and in all of that time nothing like this has happened,” said Charles Littnan, the lead scientist at Noaa’s Hawaiian monk seal research program. “Now it’s happened three or four times and we have no idea why.”Researchers first spotted a seal with an eel nasal appendage in the summer of 2016, emailing colleagues who initially thought it was a joke. It has since happened enough times for the monk seal program to develop guidelines on how to remove the eels.“They get stuck in there really snug, so you have to restrain the seal and give the eel a firm tug to get it out,” said Littnan. “One of them was really far in so it was like a magician’s handkerchief trick, we just had to keep pulling and pulling.”The phenomena could cause potential problems for the seals in terms of infections or even by affecting their ability to e and feed on marine creatures. Seals typically seal their nostrils shut when ing into the water, a process hampered by the presence of a nose-dwelling eel. “Having a rotten fish inside your nose is bound to cause some problems,” Littnan lamented.Researchers have managed to successfully remove all of the protruding eels, all from juvenile seals, but are still trying to ascertain why this is happening.One theory is that seals, which often regurgitate their meals, are simply throwing up eels through their noses. Another is that startled eels get stuck there while attempting to flee the seals as the predators forage for food beneath rocks. Either way, scientists are unsure why this nasal entrapment is only now being witnessed by humans.“If I had to guess, I would say that it’s one of those strange oddities,” Littnan said. “If you observe nature long enough, you’ll see strange things.”Monk seals are endemic to Hawaii and are listed in the US as an endangered species, with around 1,400 iniduals remaining. Threats including fishing and disease, with climate change another looming challenge."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cb3d8b3fefa02bcd97e17dcfc0b6a27acf10bcd/1433_1271_1784_1070/master/1784.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44a85ffb93dcbb0188ef54334ed3fa34","title":"germanys cdu party to vote on angela merkels successor annegret kramp karrenbauer friedrich merz jens spahn","story":"German party to choose between its general secretary, the health minister and a businessmanAngela Merkel received rapturous applause from her Christian Democrats on Friday, after delivering an emotional speech marking the end of 18 years as party leader in which she said she had been honoured to serve them.Merkel, 64, fought back tears as CDU delegates gave her a 10-minute standing ovation accompanied by cheers and cries of “Danke Angie”. Delegates held posters stating: “Thanks boss, for 18 years of leadership”.The vote for Merkel’s successor is due later on Friday following a nail-biting contest and the first open CDU leadership race in almost 50 years.In the running are the party’s general secretary, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, millionaire businessman Friedrich Merz, and Jens Spahn, currently health minister in Merkel’s government.Whoever wins is tipped to become chancellor and take over Merkel’s role as the most powerful politician in Europe.Admitting she had sometimes been an “infuriating” leader, “driving some to distraction with my last-minute decision-making” – a reference to her controversial decision to open Germany’s borders to hundreds of thousands of refugees – Merkel said it was now time for the CDU to “embark on a new chapter”.She urged the party to ensure it was “well-equipped, motivated and united” to face the tough challenges of the future.More than 1,000 party delegates will be eligible to vote on what has been described as the most momentous decision for the party in nearly 50 years and one that will decide the direction not only of the CDU, but also of their country and their continent.Initially described as the frontrunner, Kramp-Karrenbauer, known as AKK, who has 18 years of frontline political experience including six years as leader of the state of Saarland, has faced tough competition from Merz, the CDU’s former parliamentary leader who has parachuted in from his high-powered job as an economics lawyer in the banking industry, insisting he can win back many of the millions of voters the party has lost to rightwing populism.Merkel had refused to publicly endorse any candidate, though Kramp-Karrenbauer is said to be her clear choice, not least because she propelled her to the position of CDU general secretary in February.Kramp-Karrenbauer was seen to fight back tears.The vote is due to take place on Friday afternoon, and unless one candidate wins a clear majority, is expected to continue into a second round runoff between the two most popular candidates. A final result is expected in the evening.Ahead of the trio presenting themselves to delegates, leading party members who have previously been deeply critical of Merkel heaped praise on her in a string of speeches that acknowledged her profound impact on modernising the party almost beyond recognition from a deeply conservative to a solidly centrist force. The party has increasingly turned its back on her since the refugee crisis of 2015 – when she was accused of failing to secure either party or parliamentary backing before her decision to allow over a million refugees to enter Germany – but this was barely alluded to, except by observers on the sidelines.One, a 77-year-old party member, referred to the accolades as “hypocritical”. “These are the very people who will be glad to see the back of her,” he said. “But they will miss her.”For the past few days German television has repeatedly replayed highlights from Merkel’s time as leader, including footage of her acceptance speech in 2000, when she appeared almost embarrassed to be taking on the role of the leader of one of Europe’s most powerful conservative forces. She became chancellor five years later.The CDU now faces a dilemma, to either keep itself on the course set by Merkel – who was determined to secure the centre ground and has turned it into a champion of gay marriage, a minimum wage and a quota for women in politics – or to take it more to the right in an attempt to win back voters it has lost to the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).Kramp-Karrenbauer, variously dubbed mini-Merkel or Merkel’s crown princess, offers a similar path to her mentor’s, although the 56-year-old has been adamant she will carve out her own line.Merz, by contrast, has indicated he would move to the right, and has promised that by the next parliamentary election in 2021, he will be able to cut support for the AfD in half.Spahn, once seen as a frontrunner in his attempt to succeed Merkel, has been considered an outsider since Merz announced his decision to run less than half an hour after Merkel said she would no longer be standing for the CDU leadership on 29 October, after the party suffered a disastrous result in elections in the state of Hesse.Merkel has expressed her determination to stay on as chancellor for the remaining three years of her term in office. Fifty-six per cent of Germans support her decision to do so.Her reason not to stand for re-election as head of the party is seen as strategic, allowing the party – which she joined at the age of 35 following the collapse of the Berlin Wall – to recalibrate and prepare for the next election.But it also allows her to elegantly choreograph her own departure from the political stage, something few top leaders are able to do.The strategy is not without risk. Merkel will have to work closely with the next CDU head, who could attempt to undermine her and could also potentially oust her as leader.Merz, who was pushed out of his position as CDU parliamentary leader by Merkel in 2002 and is said to be still smarting over the humiliation, would be her toughest potential partner. Kramp-Karrenbauer is likely to be less antagonistic and to want to work in tandem with her.Of the delegates selected by region to vote, 150 are MPs. Observers believe that they are likely to be more in favour of continuity – that is Kramp-Karrenbauer – so as not to risk losing their seats if there is a new election.CDU members, more than 1,600 journalists and hundreds of diplomatic observers from around the world poured into the northern port city of Hamburg – where, by coincidence, Merkel was born in 1954.It marks the first time since 1971 that the party has been able to vote for a new leader. Most decisions have been made in backroom deals in which the party members have had little or no say. The longest-serving head of the party was Helmut Kohl, who held the post between 1973 and 1998.Merkel said in her speech that the CDU had produced the chancellor for 50 out of the almost 70 years since the creation of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949.She remains loyal to the small town of Püttlingen in the western German state where she was born in 1962, the fifth of six children, and where she still lives. Those who know her insist that this connection with her origins is the reason for the down-to-earth nature and strong sense of reliability for which she is well known.Married to a mining engineer with whom she has three children, AKK faced the challenge during the leadership battle of both wanting to appear to support Merkel and signalling that she would take the party in a new direction. What she has said about the Merkel era became something of a slogan for her candidacy: “One cannot arbitrarily continue in the same vein, neither can one dismiss it.”While she generally supported Merkel’s open-door policy towards migrants, she has admitted that grave mistakes have been made, and has pushed for a ban on refugees with criminal convictions being allowed back into Germany. She has pledged to listen to the party more than Merkel did, and to be less passive, and more willing to challenge the status quo, repeatedly using the complex phrase “the normative power of facts” (“die normative Kraft des Faktischen”) to argue: “I will be less inclined to accept as immutable fact that things are the way they are.”A staunch Catholic, AKK has spoken out in favour of a ban on doctors who carry out abortions being able to advertise their services, after a court case propelled the topic into the headlines, and is also openly sceptical about the “marriage for all” law campaigned for by her opponent, Jens Spahn, who is married to his male partner. He has accused her of comparing his union to incest and polygamy.Kramp-Karrenbauer says she was taken aback when Merkel announced at the end of October she would not be standing again. They were said to be reasonably close, and the lack of communication between the two raised eyebrows at the time. Merkel has done nothing to show her support of AKK during the campaign.But, as both women will be aware, an endorsement from Merkel – already associated with an era from which the party is desperate to move on – may well have done more to hinder than to help her chances.Nicknamed “two-jets Merz” by some of the German media, the 63-year-old businessman nearly fell at the first hurdle of this campaign after it emerged he has two private planes which he uses to fly between his home town of Brilon in the western state of North Rhine Westphalia and Berlin.He also caused a media row after declaring himself to be a member of the middle classes despite admitting to earnings of about €1m a year. The economics lawyer was a senior member of the party before leaving for a job in banking over a decade ago after being pushed aside by Merkel as parliamentary leader of the CDU in 2002.Many observers described his departure as “sulky” and have viewed his attempts to take over the party as little more than an act of revenge. Unlike the other two candidates, who took a week to announce their decisions to stand, Merz threw his hat into the ring just 29 minutes after Merkel announced she would not stand again.He has repeatedly dismissed the suggestion he was acting out of revenge using a favourite phrase “tempi passati” (past times) and has been quick to dampen fears that the two old rivals, he and Merkel, will not be able to work smoothly alongside each other as party leader and chancellor, and that he might even try to trigger early elections to oust her from office.At the series of rallies staged across the country ahead of the vote, Merz consistently received the warmest support. While many within the party resent his self-promotion as a modernising knight in shining armour, his supporters pushed the image of someone who could renew the party’s flagging fortunes and in one survey of company bosses, 70 out of 114 said they were in favour of him.Merz has been insistent that his years of experience in the world of global business – he is on the board of investment bank Black Rock and HSBC among others – serve him well to make Germany fit for the future. He has angrily denied any involvement in financial wrongdoing for which both of the organisations are being investigated.A Catholic and a clarinet player, Merz is married to a local court director with whom he has three children and three grandchildren, and pushed his image as a family man throughout the campaign. He was constantly flanked by a team of aides and PR advisers, in contrast to his two far more accessible opponents."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e0daaef153fce510be0f378cc3cf8ec0331f03d/0_13_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b683e5f811442f5bb96914573458d4a","title":"macrons arrogance unites us on the barricades with frances gilets jaunes","story":"Grassroots citizens’ revolt against fuel tax rises has morphed into president’s biggest crisisOn the grass verge of a village roundabout north of Toulouse, Céline stood at a barricade built from pallets of wood and old tyres, a bonfire burning behind her. French flags were flying alongside signs calling for Emmanuel Macron’s resignation.“I’m prepared to spend Christmas protesting at this roundabout with my children – we won’t back down and we’ve got nothing to lose,” said the 41-year-old, who voted for Macron in last year’s presidential election. “He gave good speeches and I really believed his promises that he would change France. But not any more.”Céline, a classroom assistant for children with special needs, earns €800 (£710) a month. She cannot afford rent so lives with her four children in a relative’s house in the suburbs of Toulouse, in the south-west of France.“Macron’s first move in office was to slash the wealth tax for the mega-rich while cutting money from poor people’s housing benefits,” she said. “That is a serious injustice. The country is rising up and he’s staying silent, he’s hiding in an ivory tower, that’s what disturbs me, he’s not taking responsibility.”At the roundabout barricade in Lespinasse, 20 people from surrounding villages – builders, nurses, workers in the local aviation industry – protested near a crucial fuel depot, wearing the yellow high-visibility vests that define France’s gilets jaunes movement. Passing trucks and cars beeped in support. Drivers leaned out of their windows and shouted “Don’t give up!”This grassroots citizens’ protest, which began as a spontaneous revolt against fuel tax rises last month, has morphed into an anti-government and anti-Macron movement and is now the young centrist president’s biggest crisis. The demonstrators say that Macron is an arrogant would-be monarch. He presents himself abroad, they say, as a progressive hero who can hold back the tide of nationalism, but at home he symbolises a distant political elite, stoking distrust and pushing people towards populism.“I always feared that there was an element of dictator in the way Macron did things,” said Robert, 64, a leftwing Toulouse carpenter and cabinet maker. “He’s well-presented and he speaks nicely – but he misread these protests because he thought he was the saviour of France. He wasn’t listening, he forgot the human factor.”Last Saturday saw the worst street unrest in central Paris in decades, as fringe elements of the otherwise peaceful protesters fought running battles with riot police and set cars alight. Tourist attractions and museums in Paris will be closed on Saturday, and the government has warned that thousands of rioters might come to the capital to “smash” or even “kill”. Yet gilets jaunes across France are determined to march in towns and cities this weekend anyway.Crucially, the government fears violence not just in Paris but outside it. Local government offices were torched in the small central town of Puy-en-Velay last weekend. In Toulouse, there were running battles with riot police with several injured. Motorway toll-booths have been burned down and vandalised in southern France, and when high-school students staged demonstrations this week against university and school reforms, riot police fired teargas at several demonstrations. The entrance hall of a high school in Blagnac outside Toulouse was burned to the ground.One transport worker in his 20s who took part in a street march in the small country town of Montauban in the south-west said he was shocked by the teargas. “Things will kick off for sure again this weekend, there could be violence anywhere in France,” he said.The roundabouts and motorway toll-booths that gilets jaunes continue to blockade are often near small towns and villages that do not normally make the news. Main cities are often far away, meaning residents cannot work or take children to school without a car – hence their fury at fuel tax rises.Isabelle, 41, a single mother, had never taken part in a protest movement before. She works at a sandwich stand at Toulouse airport for the minimum wage – less than €1,200 a month – and her daily shifts begin at 3am. She was among many who had deliberately spoiled her ballot paper in last year’s presidential election final round, unwilling to choose between Macron or the far-right Marine Le Pen.“This is now about so much more than fuel tax,” she said. “We seem to live in a world gone mad where the rich pay next to nothing and the poor are constantly taxed. We’ve had enough of the elite.”The gilets jaunes movement is unlike any other seen in postwar France because it sprang up online without a leader, trade union or party behind it. Along the barricades there is a broad mix of people, some apolitical, some on the left who feared nationalism, some who had voted for the nationalist Le Pen, some environmentalists. Many were against the European Union, feeling it enshrined rampant capitalism.One 24-year-old philosophy student said: “This feels like a historic moment in France. I’d liken it to the Arab spring – a kind of revolution that started online.”Although the demonstrators have complained that poor people bear the brunt of France’s high taxation, they are still attached to public services. A banner on a building in Lespinasse read: “We want a train station.” Across France, rural areas have complained about depleted public services. There was a sense that public money was being misspent and used primarily to maintain the plush lifestyle of a political elite.“Hospitals are understaffed and under financed,” said a 39-year-old nurse from a Toulouse hospital. “But what has united everyone is Macron’s arrogance. He has made the tension worse, like a little king pitching himself against a whole nation. Macron has held us to ransom saying he was the only one who could hold back nationalism and Le Pen, but he has no credibility at all in France.”Fabien Mauret, a self-employed builder, was cooking sausages on a barbecue for the protesters. “I think we’ve got to the point of no return,” he said. “Before, there were the rich, the middle and the poor. Now it’s the very rich and the poor, nothing in between.”He used to vote Socialist but now he votes Le Pen. “These roundabout protests are jolly. But the government knows that demonstrations could get ugly. I don’t think that’s a good thing, but it’s the reality.”Raymond Stocco, 64, who used to work in aircraft maintenance, suggested the mega-rich should be forced to pay back the tax breaks they had enjoyed over the past four years. “Macron’s big mistake was treating people in France as if we were stupid,” he said.In this corner of rural and suburban south-west France, protesters planned to expand to blockading hypermarkets as a way to force people back to small local shops.Many said the movement will last, in part because of the community feeling it had engendered. Alexandre, a retired trucker who lived in a caravan, was spending his 63rd birthday at the barricade. “I’m less lonely when I come here to talk politics to everyone,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Airline donates \u0026euro25,000 to charity and says sorry for \u0026lsquohurt and upset\u0026rsquoCompanies say 2013 decision could affect 11,000 jobs and bring industry to \u0026lsquoa standstill\u0026rsquoHiqa findings clear way for roll-out of gender-neutral immunisation programmeMedic responds to complaints from doctors that process is being rushedEvidence of the location of Dwyer\u0026rsquos work phone tied him to other phones in the caseHealth professionals have \u0026lsquoserious concerns\u0026rsquo January 1st introduction is being rushedFinal report into Caitriona Lucas\u0026rsquos death finds deficiencies in safety managementAnalysis: Woefully inadequate winter plan and extra funding are coming late in the dayPublic sector bodies saved 667,000 tonnes of \u0026lsquoavoided CO2 emissions\u0026rsquo in 2017Jonathan Bell taped \u0026lsquopersonal and private\u0026rsquo conversation on botched project in 2015Process auditor questioned about his National Broadband Plan investigationMinister for Health says he intends to bring forward stand-alone legislation next yearGarda\u0026iacute issue appeal for information on event in Co Longford that left man injuredUnions hold talks on Irish Water plans with Minister"},{"url":null,"title":"charity prints from the irish times","story":" photographers have produced a gallery of images that will make a unique Christmas gift.

Photograph: Sam PanthakyAFPDespite the country’s crippling poverty, under-nourished population, astronomical levels of urban pollution and rapidly crumbling infrastructure, successive Indian governments have displayed a penchant for grand, attention-grabbing and hugely expensive enterprises.Almost all of them have endeavoured to project India as a global power, but in doing so they have wilfully ignored the myriad domestic economic, environmental, educational, social and medical shortcomings that render daily existence for the ordinary Indian nightmarish.Much hope was pinned on prime minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government that assumed office in May 2014 after an impressive victory at the hustings.In the run-up to the elections it projected itself as different, promised frugality, moderation and above all achhe din or good days to the people, following a decade of venal Congress Party-led rule.But over the past four years Modi’s government too has proved no different than its predecessors, succumbing to populism and erring on the side of extravagance and grandiosity while overlooking India’s stark realities.Modi’s most recent indulgence was the inauguration of the world’s tallest statue.Built at a cost of €355 million in the prime minister’s western home state of Gujarat, the 182m monument honours Sardar Valabbhai Patel, independent India’s first deputy prime minister. Patel, like Modi, was from Gujarat.Patel’s statue, however, will be overshadowed by that of Shivaji, the 17th-century Hindu warrior king that is being built off the Mumbai coast to a height of 210m – up from the 192m planned earlier – at a cost of €561 million. Modi laid its foundation stone in December 2016 and it is scheduled for completion by 2020.Modi also inaugurated a €3 billion Japanese bullet train project last September slated to run 524km between Gujarat’s largest city Ahemdabad and Mumbai at a time when the vast Indian Rail network is beset by obsolescence, corruption and frequent accidents.And if such profligacies were not enough, Modi in his Independence Day address in August declared that India would send a “son or daughter of India” into space by 2022 to celebrate 75 years of freedom.“This government and its predecessors have failed ordinary Indians, year after year,” declared columnist Kanti Bajpai. “It is laughable to talk about a rising India given our sad scabrous state.”On the Life Expectancy Index, it is ranked 163rd out of 224 countries, while the Global Hunger Index ranks it 103rd of 119 countries. In 2017, India recorded the highest number of malnutrition cases globally, in addition to having the world’s highest number of stunted children.Environmentally, India is calamitous. According to the Environmental Performance Index it is 177th out of 180 countries and contains 14 of the world’s 15 most polluted cities, with its capital New Delhi ranked sixth on this scale. Last year, more than two million deaths in India were attributed to pollution and in 2018 this number is projected to rise.The country’s water situation too is alarming. A recent federal government report warned that some 20 Indian cities including Delhi, Bangalore and nearby Hyderabad were likely to run out of ground water by 2020, affecting more tha n 120 million residents, some 24 times Ireland’s population.The report cautioned that Bangalore faced the grim prospect of “day zero”, when its water taps would run permanently dry if drastic measures to avert the looming crisis were not swiftly implemented.In 2018, India was ranked 115th out of 158 countries in the World Human Capital Index and, despite its perceived competence in information technology, it was 134th out of 178 nations in the Information and Communication Technologies Development Index.The situation with regard to journalism too was abysmal, as the Committee to Protect Journalists’ 2018 Global Impunity Index, which measures the dangers faced by media personnel, noted that India was 14th out of 14 countries evaluated. And on the World Justice Report’s Rule of Law Index, the world’s largest democracy was placed 62nd out of 113 nations.“India is a competent event manager, capable of undertaking short-term projects, but incapable of sustaining any long-term developmental ventures,” said Seema Mustafa of the Centre for Policy Analysis in Delhi.It needed to stop competing mindlessly in the international arena and concentrate instead on its innumerable deficiencies at home if it wanted to survive in the 21st century, she warned."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3723681.1544187844!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tears and cheers as angela merkel steps down as party leader","story":"After 6,815 days a tearful Angela Merkel stepped down as leader of Germany’s ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU).

Photograph: Clemens BilanEPAAfter 6,815 days and a final, 10-minute standing ovation, a tearful Angela Merkel bowed out on Friday as leader of Germany’s ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU).Hamburg, the city of her birth, provided the bookends to her political career. It was here, in Germany’s second city, that Dr Merkel’s own East German party joined the CDU in October 1990.And on Friday morning, wearing her trademark awkward smile, Dr Merkel urged the party she has headed since April 2000 to “start a new chapter” and leave Hamburg “well-equipped, motivated and united”.“I wasn’t born as a chancellor or party leader, truly . . . but I’m filled with a great feeling of thanks, it was a joy and an honour,” she said, her voice catching with emotion for a split second.Before the CDU chooses her successor, the outgoing leader delivered a humorous, thoughtful and self-critical speech. She acknowledged her own failings, in particular how staff and party colleagues were “driven demented” by her hesitation over decisions and her conflict aversion towards political rivals.From climate change to globalised trade, her successor faced a long list of challenges. And, in a final riposte to her critics, she said she was “proud” of her controversial decision to keep German borders open three years ago to more than one million refugees and asylum seekers.She mentioned Brexit in just seven words and delivered a double dig at US president Donald Trump. Two days after attending the funeral of George HW Bush, Dr Merkel thanked Bush for resisting triumphalism at the cold war’s end, and warned against abandoning the postwar multilateral order in favour of politics as “deals”.While Dr Merkel stays on as chancellor – for now at least – the party reins of power will be transferred to her successor, to be chosen by delegates on Friday afternoon in Hamburg.Feverish speculation is palpable in the corridors of Hamburg’s trade fair. Over potato soup and bread rolls, delegates drawn from regional parties made final deals over who they would support.Dr Merkel’s preferred candidate is Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, her party secretary general perceived as the continuity candidate. But she faces a strong rival in the liberal-conservative Friedrich Merz, an old Merkel rival, who has promised far-reaching change and has secured the backing of the CDU’s powerful regional parties.“The mood in the party grassroots is extremely tense, we need to unite after this vote,” said one senior CDU official over lunch.The new CDU leader – likely to be Germany’s next chancellor – faces a series of challenges: unite the party after its most energetic leadership battle in 47 years revive support stuck at 28 per cent and beat back a growing far-right challenge and salvage Berlin’s struggling grand coalition with the Social Democratic Party.As a farewell present the party gifted her a baton dedicated to “world politics’ most important conductor”.Halfway through her ovation, a visibly relieved Dr Merkel urged delegates to sit down and get to work, saying: “We have a lot to do.”With that emotional farewell for their seventh leader the 1,001 CDU delegates in a vast Hamburg trade fair hall – watched by twice as many visitors and journalists – moved on to electing number eight."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3723046.1544128301!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit mps hear of laughter in tipperary and galway","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Pro-EU supporters call for a People’s Vote outside the British Houses of Parliament on  December 6th, 2018:   Some claim the backstop creates a problem of democratic control upwards because people in Northern Ireland would be subject to EU rules without any democratic representation in the EU. Photograph: Andy RainAlthough most of this week’s political drama has taken place in the House of Commons, they have also been debating Theresa May’s Brexit deal at the other end of the Palace of Westminster in the House of Lords.On Thursday, former first minister David Trimble complained that the Northern Ireland protocol had been drawn up by members of the French administrative elite of énarques, who were “deeply imbued with a different way of approaching things”.“That protocol is not a democratic one and it undermines the Belfast Agreement.\u0026nbspOver the past year or two, people have expressed concern that this process might damage it. Yes, but it is not the desire to leave the EU that is causing the damage it is what the EU is doing by way of reprisal, aimed not just at us in Northern Ireland but at the UK as a whole,” he said.Historian Paul Bew offered a more thoughtful analysis on Wednesday when he acknowledged the need to address the difficulties Brexit created in Ireland.But he argued that Britain’s cast-iron assurance that it would not create a hard border meant that its efforts in the negotiations were aimed at ensuring that the EU did not oblige Ireland to do so.“Maybe we were right to do it, but we should be absolutely clear that that is what we have been doing. We have put ourselves through a lot of pain to do it, and I absolutely accept it is right to be sensitive to the needs and problems created for Ireland by Brexit,” he said.He said the backstop created a problem of democratic control upwards because people in Northern Ireland would be subject to EU rules without any democratic representation in the EU. This was, he said, inconsistent with the model of North-South co-operation in the Belfast Agreement.“This is a huge difficulty that will have to be attended to otherwise, we lose the template of the Good Friday agreement, which all parties in Northern Ireland accept. Even now, when we cannot make it work, everybody accepts that that is the basic template for a settlement. If we throw it away, which will be the effect of going along these lines, we will be taking a massive risk with the stability of Northern Ireland.”Ulster Unionist peer Reg Empey pointed to the huge preponderance of Irish trade that goes across the Irish Sea rather than across the Border, suggesting that Ireland’s real border with the UK was eastwest rather than northsouth.But in the House of Commons on Thursday, Labour’s Chris Ruane, who represents the Vale of Clwyd, reminded MPs that any disruption to trade across the Irish Sea would hurt parts of Wales almost as much as Ireland.“We have heard about the 17-mile tailbacks that would affect Dover. Seven-mile tailbacks are predicted for Holyhead. We are already seeing sea lanes open from Cork to Santander and from Cork to Rotterdam. If we lose the sea lanes and lose that trade with Ireland, which is as big as the trade with Brazil, Russia and India combined – it is worth over £45 billion – that will be a problem,” he said.The SNP’s Angus Brendan MacNeil noted that Thursday was the 96th anniversary of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, adding that Brexit had shown the Irish they were right to become independent. Casual Irish schadenfreude and aggressive bluster about Brexit has bruised some feelings at Westminster but MacNeil relished it.“The escaped Irish have belly laughs, and their biggest wind-up is to go on television at various points of crisis and tell the UK to stay calm. Back in Tipperary, Waterford and Galway they are laughing, because they know exactly what it means to tell London to stay calm,” he said.Earlier, MPs rubbed their eyes as they watched Labour’s shadow chancellor John McDonnell, who once praised “the bombs and bullets and sacrifice” of the IRA, denounce the backstop as a threat to the union. Almost as improbably, Ian Paisley quoted C Desmond Greaves, the Marxist historian who acted as a muse to IRA chief of staff Cathal Goulding in the 1960s.“All fundamental battles in British politics take place in the Conservative Party, with everyone else having bit parts,” Greaves said.\u0026nbspAn index of selected articles available exclusively to our readers with an  digital subscription "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

Residents have now been asking about why they weren\u0027t consulted.”The lavatory, which did not require planning permission, has been installed to serve drivers on the half-hourly R2 route via Orpington in the London Borough of Bromley, TfL said.But, Mr Bennington, said: “This has never been raised as a difficulty.It\u0027s a totally unsuitable location, it\u0027s entirely residential and the other end of the bus route is Orpington Town Centre so there are toilets there and premises.”It\u0027s been called locally, The Turdis, you can understand the reasons for that. I\u0027m hoping they will get rid of it and adjust the timing on the bus route so drivers can stop in Orpington.”Local resident Stephanie Willis added: “It’s the most ugly thing I have ever seen - it is a monstrosity.“If this is a Dr Who-themed Christmas present from TfL then they should take it back.This is a quiet residential area where people have lived peacefully for years. Now we have a big ugly blot on the community, I am absolutely furious.Just behind my house are lovely green hills, it is a beautiful area ruined by this big metal toilet.Nick Fairholme, director of project and programme delivery at TfL, said that the lavatory had been “installed in agreement” with the local council and that the body was “sorry not all residents were aware”.He said: “Unfortunately our courtesy letters did not reach all residents. We are investigating how this happened to ensure it does not happen again.”However, a Bromley Council spokesman said, “It is not true for TfL to assert that the Council \u0027agreed\u0027 to this.  For absolute clarity, the Council has not agreed to the installation of the toilet facilities. We were informed of TfL’s intention to install the structures and that they were exercising their permitted development rights. It is true that we did not raise a highway safety concern, because there aren’t any, but this does not constitute ‘agreement’.”Councillor William Huntington-Thresher, executive councillor for environment, said, “It does not appear that local people have been consulted and we are contacting TfL urgently to ask exactly who was consulted – whilst neither Bromley’s permission nor planning permission may be required, this does not mean that the views of local people can be disregarded, with the potential for these toilets to attract anti-social behaviour, with vandalism already an issue.We are making TfL aware of the views of our residents to these installations at these unwelcome locations. We will continue to engage with TfL to provide them with the benefit of local knowledge and alert them to local issues. We remain hopeful that TfL will listen more often than at present.”Polly Straight, who lives on the road,  said: “These government bodies couldn’t give a s--- about the people that pay their wages.“The toilet just has to go outside someone’s house and it’s convenient the letters of this imposition didn’t arrive.”Transport for London (TfL)Please review our commenting policyBrexit, the far-right and whether it\u0026#39s time email died - here\u0026#39s what  readers made of the week\u0026#39s biggest headlinesWhen does Parliament vote on the Brexit deal?

One is called Eloise, the other is ViaVan. You might think giving birth could get in the way of doing the top job. Not so for Oppetit. Almost the opposite in fact. The embryonic ViaVan was taking shape at around the same time as her second daughter. And they called her four days after the birth to ask if she would consider being “head of London”. Now Eloise is four months old and her Mum is running the newest car-sharing “corner to corner” setup in the capital. “I still get back to put her to bed at night though,” she says, in a café down the street from the ViaVan base near Liverpool Street. Oppetit has a Lauren Bacall-style huskiness but with an Australian accent. She was born in Melbourne 32 years ago and studied law and commerce at the University of Melbourne. Her first job was on the law side, working on sex-offender cases. “I wasn’t sure I could have defended some of these guys with the appropriate level of neutrality,” she says. Not when there was a high risk of reoffending. “I realised I was more into the commerce side.” Houzz CEO Adi Tatarko on running a $4bn internet startup A View from the Top: Green Man Gaming CEO Paul Sulyok A View from the Top: Jacqueline de Rojas on discrimination in techA View from the top: Will Ramsay, CEO of the Affordable Art FairMelbourne is a lovely city and most of her friends and peers were staying put, settling down,\u0026nbspgetting married\u0026nbspand moving into houses a couple of blocks away from where their parents lived. Which is when Oppetit took off to do an MBA at Harvard Business School, where she spent two years, meeting “incredible and impressive women” and her future French husband who, she says, “was completely not my type – like no one I’d ever met before”.At school in Australia she had had a choice between learning Japanese or French – and opted for Japanese. “I thought it was more likely I’d become a sushi chef than marry a Frenchman.” Despite which they went back to Australia together and ended up in Singapore in 2014, where the now Mrs Oppetit worked for Apple in operations, taking up with Tim Cook’s old team. After a few years in Asia, the Oppetits – all 3 of them – agreed on going back to Europe and settled in London, where her husband had been brought up and had family. Oppetit, whose first daughter was three months old at the time, was adamant about going back to work. It was her sister in New York who recommended Via, which was setting up in Europe. “I wasn’t really a techie startup kind of person, but I thought what the hell, let’s find out more about it.” She went along, got interviewed all day long, and decided she wanted more. “You get a feeling,” she says. “It was a just a massive hit.” She joined Via in June 2017. The original plan was to launch Via in Europe in Amsterdam, which was well disposed on environmental grounds. But then Uber lost its licence in London\u0026nbspat the same time Via was granted a licence and it all kicked off right here\u0026nbspin April 2018. Drivers were queueing around the block to sign up. Literally (for once). The line was six to seven hours long and many had to be sent away to come back the next day. Oppetit would lose her voice every day trying to get drivers registered. “You’ve got a big tummy!” said one of the guys. “You can’t say that!” said another, more sensitively. She was five months pregnant at the time and didn’t object particularly. And she was sympathetic to the drivers. “Uber hadn’t had a lot of competition and the drivers were undervalued and badly treated. They wanted something else.” The projected figures for the end of year two\u0026nbspwere achieved in just one month. Business was exploding. “It felt like I was really using my MBA,” she said. “It felt real. It was madness, but in a good way.” So when she got the call, second-time motherhood or not,\u0026nbspshe knew she had to take the job. “I’m in if you really want it,” said her supportive husband. She specified she wouldn’t come back for two\u0026nbspmonths and had to have a month off around Christmas to show off\u0026nbspthe new baby to family in Australia. Since she came back at the end of August, it’s been “the two best months we’ve had at Via”. They’re now over 3\u0026nbspmillion rides.Maybe you really can have it all. Oppetit sees no contradiction between motherhood and managing a huge operation. “You just have to do what comes naturally.” The fact that she has two daughters makes a difference. “I want them to feel that they can do anything. And the advantage is they’re too young to be able to comment on my lifestyle choices.” The other upside is that now their father “has more opportunity to do what he thinks is right for a change”.Four out of the six senior management at Via are women. And out of 20 staff, 15 are from Australia or New Zealand. “They’re all on the big adventure,” Oppetit says. “And it turns out Australians are good at handling drivers, they have the right bubbly attitude.” ViaVan – born\u0026nbspout of a merger between Via in the US and Mercedes-Benz Vans in Europe – promotes car-sharing (or “pooling”). “It turns out Londoners are pretty happy sharing,” Oppetit says, “especially if it keeps the price down.” And it’s corner-to-corner rather than door-to-door. “You might have to walk a couple of blocks and they drop you off a block or two away,” but it saves on car journeys and cuts congestion. And the ideal model is a hybrid car or all-electric. Oppetit is even in favour of more cycling in the capital too. She sees bikes and Via as part of the same general eco-friendly tendency. ViaVan is now in four cities in Europe, including Milton Keynes. I used the app and took one of their rides to Euston. I had to wait less than two minutes. One share. The driver, like all drivers everywhere, complained about the traffic.A View from the TopShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But the entire industry would be in the knackers yard without gambling. And it isn’t a big draw for the under 18s in the same way that football is.\u0026nbspHow much will it hurt that sport, which has been the main area of focus, although others are covered too? Football has behaved as a magic money tree ever since the launch of the Premiership, fuelled by the ever escalating size of the broadcast rights deals it has been able to secure.\u0026nbspGambling plays an important, but not central, role in making those rights profitable. The industry’s ads peppered the coverage of the last World Cup on commercial TV\u0026nbspand are heavily featured in internationals.\u0026nbspThey provide\u0026nbsprevenue streams for BT and Sky’s coverage of the Premiership\u0026nbspand European club tournaments too.\u0026nbspLosing them will hurt. But it won’t kill the golden goose.\u0026nbspOf far greater concern to them will be the interest in streaming games among web giants, something the Premier League has been doing everything in its power to foster.\u0026nbspAmazon bought a slightly odd looking package featuring two sets of games on bank holidays during the last rights auction. If it likes what it sees\u0026nbspand decides to deploy its big guns, the unhappiness created by the loss of a few gambling ads will pale by comparison. Amazon’s big guns are very big. It can out shoot anyone it wants to.Football’s bosses, its coaches, and its players, can thus be reassured that they’ll continue to be kept in the style to which they have become accustomed for the foreseeable future.\u0026nbspThis should be borne in mind as campaigners gear up for phase two.It has\u0026nbspalready been noted that the deal does not include either shirt sponsorship nor digital advertising around the pitch.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

Property prices in the three months from September to November fell 1.1 per cent compared with the preceding quarter, while prices dropped 1.4 per cent between October and November. Meanwhile, the rate of growth dropped to 0.3 per cent, the lowest rate since December 2012. Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax, said: “High employment, wage growth and historically low mortgage rates continue to make home ownership more affordable for many, though the need to raise a significant deposit still acts as something of a restraint on the market.

Mike Scott, chief property analyst at estate agent Yopa, said: “The usual Christmas slowdown in the housing market has started early this year, as people wait for the outcome of the current political turmoil before making long-term commitments, such as buying a new home.”Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent and a former residential chairman of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said: Looking forward, we don\u0027t expect activity to change much, bearing in mind seasonal and political distractions. On the ground, lethargy is replacing energy.Gary Barker, chief executive of proptech company Reapit, also predicted a continuation of the current subdued performance. “Transactions have been flat for the past 3 years, and caution is likely to remain whilst Brexit remains unfinished. Furthermore, if Brexit stalls, or more significant uncertainty over the government develops, it will be a painful road ahead,” he said. Mr Barker said that there could be room for optimism: “We are seeing house price reduction in some areas, which could make property more affordable and also boost the economy by increasing spending power and buying capacity. “If the Brexit deal passes through parliament, we could potentially see a much more confident market, resulting in more transactions, fewer withdrawals, and increased prices.”However, he added: “If the Bank of England’s forecast of a 30 per cent drop in house prices comes to fruition following a no-deal Brexit, the balance of the market will shift dramatically. “Although transactions may reduce significantly, with depressed prices discouraging sellers from listing their properties, low prices will put buyers back in control. First-time buyers, in particular, could benefit from slashed prices, giving them a leg-up onto the property ladder.”Additional reporting by newswiresShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

We know that the type of university and qualification can make a difference to earnings later in life – so tackling this inequality of access is vital.“Schools and universities need to work together to ensure that bright, state-educated students have a fair chance at accessing the best higher education opportunities.”The Sutton Trust has not disclosed which eight schools and colleges accounted for the huge number of Oxbridge admissions – a condition of obtaining the data from Ucas.However, it is understood the majority are independent, fee-paying schools, with Eton, Westminster School and St Paul’s School all included on the list.In its report, the charity highlighted practices at some of these schools, which are giving students a leg up on their peers.At Eton, where pupils have access to a dedicated universities officer and the school’s own internal higher education guide, between 60 and 100 boys are sent to Oxford or Cambridge each year.Westminster School offers its students bespoke mentoring and university preparation classes, resulting in around 70 to 80 admissions to Oxbridge each year.gofundme fundraiserSt Paul’s School assigns each of its students a university advisor to guide them through the application process – a move that helped over a quarter of their students gain a place at either Oxford or Cambridge in 2016.In its report, the Sutton Trust called for students from all backgrounds to receive admissions advice to help close the admissions gap between top schools and the rest of the country.“If we are to ensure that all young people, regardless of their background, have a fair chance of getting in to our top universities, we need to address the patchwork of higher education guidance and support,” the trust’s founder, Sir Peter Lampl said,“All young people, regardless of what area they grow up in, or what school they go to, should have access to high quality personal guidance that allows them to make the best informed choices about their future.“The admissions process also needs to change. We have made the case for giving poorer students a break through contextual admissions, but we also need universities to make it clear what grades these students need to access courses.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man wearing a storm trooper costume holds a sketchbook belonging to costume designer John Mollo, and showing illustrations for Star Wars costumes, during a photo-call ahead of an auction at Bonhams in central LondonDemonstrators for and against Brexit protest opposite the Houses of ParliamentTheresa May has suffered an unprecedented defeat after the government was found to be in contempt of parliament for refusing to publish key Brexit papers.The Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivering to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal.

Others argue that the context of the song means the word should be interpreted as traditional Irish slang for a lazy person.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialPeople are calling for \u0027Fairytale of New York\u0027 to be censoredThe story behind The Pogues\u0027 \u0027Fairytale of New York\u0027MacGowan\u0026nbsphas now issued a statement to Virgin Media Television\u0027s The Tonight Show,\u0026nbspin response to calls from two RTE 2FM DJs to have the word censored during airplay.Presenter Eoghan McDermott took to Twitter this week to object to the word which he condemned as a “slur” and “insult”, while presenter Stephen Byrne revealed how he felt when he heard it played in a club, “I stood in a room as over 200 people screamed a word thats been used to make me feel like an outsider, with such joy and cheer”.McGowan, who wrote the song in 1987, and who sang it with the late Kirsty MacColl, released a statement explaining why he included the word in the song.“The word was used by the character because it fitted with the way she would speak and with her character,” he wrote. \u0026nbsp“She is not supposed to be a nice person, or even a wholesome person. She is a woman of a certain generation at a certain time in history and she is down on her luck and desperate.”He continued, “Her dialogue is as accurate as I could make it but she is not intended to offend!\u0026nbspShe is just supposed to be an authentic character and not all characters in songs and stories are angels or even decent and respectable, sometimes characters in songs and stories have to be evil or nasty in order to tell the story effectively.”Created with Sketch.Albums of the year 2018 Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms.

Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms.

Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.MacGowan went on to say that he does not want to get into an argument about the song and has no problem with it being censored during radio airplay.“If people don\u0027t understand that I was trying to accurately portray the character as authentically as possible then I am absolutely fine with them bleeping the word but I don\u0027t want to get into an argument,” he concluded.RTÉ yesterday confirmed that the song will continue to be played uncensored on RTE radio as it has for the past 30 years.Fairytale of New YorkShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 717 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.817 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama. It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles.

Property prices in the three months from September to November fell 1.1 per cent compared with the preceding quarter, while prices dropped 1.4 per cent between October and November. Meanwhile, the rate of growth dropped to 0.3 per cent, the lowest rate since December 2012. Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax, said: “High employment, wage growth and historically low mortgage rates continue to make home ownership more affordable for many, though the need to raise a significant deposit still acts as something of a restraint on the market.

Mike Scott, chief property analyst at estate agent Yopa, said: “The usual Christmas slowdown in the housing market has started early this year, as people wait for the outcome of the current political turmoil before making long-term commitments, such as buying a new home.”Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent and a former residential chairman of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said: Looking forward, we don\u0027t expect activity to change much, bearing in mind seasonal and political distractions. On the ground, lethargy is replacing energy.Gary Barker, chief executive of proptech company Reapit, also predicted a continuation of the current subdued performance. “Transactions have been flat for the past 3 years, and caution is likely to remain whilst Brexit remains unfinished. Furthermore, if Brexit stalls, or more significant uncertainty over the government develops, it will be a painful road ahead,” he said. Mr Barker said that there could be room for optimism: “We are seeing house price reduction in some areas, which could make property more affordable and also boost the economy by increasing spending power and buying capacity. “If the Brexit deal passes through parliament, we could potentially see a much more confident market, resulting in more transactions, fewer withdrawals, and increased prices.”However, he added: “If the Bank of England’s forecast of a 30 per cent drop in house prices comes to fruition following a no-deal Brexit, the balance of the market will shift dramatically. “Although transactions may reduce significantly, with depressed prices discouraging sellers from listing their properties, low prices will put buyers back in control.

But, argue\u0026nbspJohn Curtice\u0026nbspand his co-authors in a new book edited by Philip Cowley and Denis Kavanagh, the real Brexit referendum actually happened a year laterClick to followThe IndependentThe social geography of the 2017 general election was shaped by attitudes towards BrexitIf voters agreed with the prime minister that the 2017 general election was about Brexit, then – given that her vision of Britain’s future relationship with the EU was widely regarded as representing a “hard” Brexit (prioritising control of immigration over continued membership of the EU single market) – we might expect her party to have advanced more strongly in places where the previous year a relatively high proportion had voted to leave the EU.Our analysis suggests this is precisely what happened. The higher the estimated vote for Leave in 2016, the more the Conservative vote increased, while support for the party actually fell back on average in places where Leave failed to secure at least 45 per cent of the vote.\u0026nbspThe link between Labour’s performance and the strength of the Leave vote in 2016 is much weaker, a finding that might be thought to reflect the party’s relatively ambiguous position on Brexit.How Europe became the funeral pyre for Tory leadersThere was only a three-point difference between the increase in the Labour vote in places where 60 per cent or more voted to Leave and the equivalent figure for constituencies where less than 45 per cent voted to Leave – far less than the corresponding difference of 12 points in the Conservative performance.Even so, between them these two patterns are sufficiently strong that in seats where more than 60 per cent voted to Leave, there was on average a net (total vote) swing of 0.8 per cent from Labour to the Conservatives, even though everywhere else in England and Wales Labour’s vote increased more than that of the Conservatives.Where did the Ukip vote go?A key reason why the link between the Conservative performance and the strength of the Leave vote is much stronger than that for Labour lies in the impact on the two parties’ performances of the collapse in the Ukip vote.Ukip’s share of the vote in the 2015 election was much larger in areas where Leave did well in the referendum. The decline in Ukip support two years later was almost invariably greatest where the party had previously been strongest. If those who voted Ukip in 2015 (nearly all of whom voted to Leave in 2016) were now particularly inclined to switch to the Conservatives, this could have served to boost the Conservative performance in constituencies that voted heavily to Leave.Indeed, while Labour\u0026nbspappears to have won some of the voters that Ukip lost, the Conservatives apparently gained many more.Ukip in 2017 was almost invariably greatest in areas where the party had been strongest before (Getty)Nevertheless, the collapse in Ukip support is far from being the whole explanation for the strong Conservative performance in areas keenest on leaving the EU. Even when we take into account how heavily Ukip support fell, the Conservatives still performed better where the Leave vote was stronger in 2016.Where did Remain and Leave voters go? The Conservative Party did not do well in places where Leave was strong in 2016 only because of the pattern of switching among\u0026nbspformer Ukip voters rather, Leave voters more generally seem to have been drawn into voting Conservative at this election, while Remain voters tilted towards Labour.Support for Ukip in 2015 and for Leave in 2016 varied substantially by age and educational background. Both were particularly popular with older people and those with few or no formal educational qualifications, while younger people and graduates tended to shun Ukip and vote Remain. This pattern was reflected in the Conservative and Labour votes in 2017.Created with Sketch.EU referendum - in pictures Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A woman in a wheelchair with British and European Union flags shows her support for the United Kingdom to remain in the European Union on the day of the EU Referendum in GibraltarA polling station being used in the EU referendum at Batley Town Hall in the constituency Labour MP Jo CoxPeople arrive to vote in the EU Referendum at the Library where British MP Jo Cox was shot and fatally wounded last week in BirstallA man arrives to vote at a polling station for the Referendum on the European Union in north LondonVoters queue to enter a polling station at Trinity Church in Golders Green in LondonBritish Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha Cameron leave after voting in the EU Referendum at Central Methodist Hall, Westminster Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn cast his vote at a polling station at Pakeman Primary School in IslingtonChelsea pensioners arrive at a polling station near to the Royal Chelsea HospitalA woman wearing an I\u0027m In t-shirt, promoting the official Remain campaign, leaves a polling station in LondonPeople queuing outside a polling station on Amott Road in LondonScotland\u0027s First Minister and Leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), Nicola Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell, react as leave after casting their votes at a polling station at Broomhouse Community Hall in east GlasgowA man wearing a European themed cycling jersey leaves after voting at a polling station for the Referendum on the European Union in north LondonUkip leader Nigel Farage arrives to cast his vote at Cudham Church of England Primary School in Biggin Hill, KentJustice Secretary and prominent \u0027Vote Leave\u0027 campaigner Michael Gove poses with his wife Sarah Vine after voting in the European Union referendum at their local polling station in KensingtonNuns leave a polling station after voting in the EU Referendum in LondonPeople arrive to cast their ballots in the EU Referendum in Gibraltar.

There is a corresponding, though much weaker tendency in the opposite direction for Labour. At the same time, the Conservatives performed less well and Labour better in seats with more young adults – though once we take this into account, there is no indication, despite the prominence given to Labour’s manifesto promise to scrap tuition fees for students at English universities, that constituencies with large numbers of students were particularly likely to swing towards the party.The social geography of Conservative and Labour performance at this election was primarily, albeit not entirely, a consequence of the role played by attitudes towards Brexit in shaping how people voted.What about the economy?Traditionally, the state of the economy has played a central role in how people vote. In 2015, for example, the Conservatives clearly performed worse where unemployment was highest or had increased most, and where household incomes were relatively low. At this election, however, if anything the opposite was the case.Revolutionary study into voter \u0027clans\u0027 holds key to 2022 electionThe worse local economic circumstances were, the better the Conservatives did and the worse Labour did. For instance, Conservative support increased on average by 5.8 points where the constituency unemployment rate increased between 2015 and 2017, compared with 4.9 points where it fell. The equivalent figures for Labour were 9.8 points and 10.4 points respectively. Moreover, despite a continued squeeze on public spending and a promise from the Conservatives of more austerity to come that could mean cuts in public sector jobs, there was, in contrast to 2015, no particular relationship between Conservative or Labour performance and the local prevalence of public sector employees.Did the antisemitism row hurt Labour?Not that the focus on Brexit meant that nothing else mattered. Jeremy Corbyn’s views on the Middle East have attracted particular controversy, with critics accusing the Labour leader of being too sympathetic to iniduals and groups opposed to Israel, including some widely regarded as extremist. There were related accusations that, under Corbyn’s leadership, the Labour Party had dealt inadequately with allegations that some party members have made antisemitic statements. These issues appear to have made a difference. On average Labour’s vote increased by 11.6 points in constituencies where more than 4 per cent are Muslim, compared with an average increase of 9.6 points elsewhere in England and Wales. This difference is not accounted for by the tendency of the Leave vote to be lower in seats with more Muslims. Meanwhile, and by contrast, the Labour vote only rose by 8.8 points on average across the 10 constituencies with the largest Jewish populations, even though seven of these 10 seats are in London, where Labour generally performed relatively well.Did social class drive the voting?However, the fallout from the EU referendum was most important in shaping the geography of Conservative and Labour performance. In so doing, the contest served to reduce some of the traditional isions in British elections. For example, although working-class voters had traditionally been the bedrock of Labour support, they had also been more likely to vote Leave and to vote for Ukip. Thus, thanks to its gains among such voters, at this election Conservative support increased by as much as 9.4 points in seats where more than 13 per cent are engaged in a routine manual occupation, compared with just 1.3 points where fewer than 10 per cent have a routine job. Conversely, Labour’s support increased by just 9.1 points in relatively working-class seats, but by 10.7 points where relatively few have a routine job.\u0026nbspWhat happened to the northsouth ide?Equally, the northsouth ide in Britain’s electoral geography also narrowed somewhat, the first time it has done so since 1997. A relatively weak Conservative performance and a relatively strong Labour performance across the largely more pro-Remain south of England\u0026nbspmeant that on average there was as much as a 3.9 point swing from Conservative to Labour there.In contrast, the swing to Labour was only 1.3 in the north of England and 0.7\u0026nbspin the heavily pro-Leave Midlands. One striking consequence of this ergence is that Conservative support is now higher in the Midlands than in the south of England, not least, but also not solely, because pro-Remain and ethnically erse London has now become something of a Labour citadel.Paxman returned to Newsnight to interrogate May and Corbyn (Getty)Despite initial appearances, therefore, this clearly was not an election that heralded a return to the familiar patterns of two-party politics.Do constituency boundaries hold the key?But what about the notion that the makeup of parliament is as much to do with the way constituency boundaries have been drawn as anything else? That question is particularly topical, given current proposals for boundary reform. \u0026nbspThe present constituency boundaries are biased against the Conservatives, but this is compensated for by the more efficient distribution of their vote.Surprising though the failure of the Conservatives to win an overall majority last year might have seemed, was the tally of seats won by each party significantly different from what we might have anticipated given the shares of the vote each of them secured?\u0026nbspThe traditional way of addressing this question has been to compare the actual outcome in seats with what would have happened if in every constituency each party’s share of the vote had increased or fallen in line with the change in its overall share of the vote across Britain as a whole – that is, uniform change.However, applying this method becomes difficult when, as happened in 2015 and again in 2017, there is a substantial change in the level of support for a party, such as the SNP, that only fights elections in one part of the country but wins plenty of seats there. In these circumstances the change in that party’s share of the Britain-wide vote will inevitably be but a pale reflection of the actual rise or fall in its support in the part of the UK where it stood.It is therefore better to use as our initial benchmark what would have happened if support for all of the main Britain-wide parties had increased or fallen in every constituency in England and Wales in line with the overall change in their support in those two parts of the UK combined. For each seat in Scotland, meanwhile, we calculate what would have happened if the rise or fall in each party’s support had been in line with the change in its share of the Scotland-wide total.On the basis of these assumptions, the Conservatives would have won 323 seats (instead of 318), Labour 259 (262), the SNP 37 (35), the Liberal Democrat nine (12), Plaid Cymru three (four) and the Greens one (one), while, of course, there would be 18 other MPs from Northern Ireland. None of these figures are\u0026nbspvery different from what actually transpired and, above all, the Conservatives would still have failed to secure an overall majority – albeit they would have been only three rather than eight seats short.What about Scotland?That projected Conservative tally includes 11 seats in Scotland. However, if the increase in the Conservative vote north of the border had been in line with the lower increase in England and Wales – and the fall in SNP support had not happened – the Conservatives would have won only two Scottish seats. Thus, in the absence of the distinctive outcome in Scotland, the Conservatives would have won only 314 seats. To that extent, the distinctive result in Scotland proved to be crucial to the arithmetic of the new House of Commons.SNP only fights elections in one part of the country but wins plenty of seats there (Getty)What were the other factors?However, although the overall tally of seats for each party was more or less in line with what might have been expected given the changes in their overall shares of the vote, there were lots of seats where the outcome was at variance with what would have happened if the movements in party support had been the same everywhere.What if Nick Clegg had gone into coalition with Labour in 2010?No fewer than 36 seats changed hands that would not have done so under those circumstances, while 16 constituencies were held against the tide. Most of these outcomes can in fact be accounted for by one or other of the systematic patterns of variation our analysis has identified, including the tendency for the Conservatives to perform better in seats with a relatively large Leave vote and Labour to do likewise in seats where Remain polled relatively well, the Conservatives’ ability on occasion to squeeze the other unionist parties in Scotland, and the willingness of some of those who might otherwise have voted Labour to make a tactical switch to the (pro-Remain) Liberal Democrats. In short, much of the significant variation in party performance was linked in some way or other to the fallout from either the 2016 EU referendum or the 2014 Scottish independence referendum.Dem leader Tim Farron narrowly retained his seat with 8.4 per cent swing to the Tories (Getty)This still leaves us with the observation that for the third time in a row, the electoral system failed to deliver the winning party a substantial overall majority (and, indeed, on two occasions any majority at all).The system’s ability to generate safe overall majorities has long been regarded as a hallmark of the single member plurality system (often referred to as “first past the post”) and the resulting clarity of the link between the outcome of an election and who forms the government is often cited as a major justification for its continued use.It might be thought the explanation is that, at 2.5 points, the Conservative lead over Labour in terms of votes across Great Britain as a whole was a relatively narrow one. It was certainly much narrower than the seven point leads that the Conservatives enjoyed in 2010 and 2015. Yet it was larger than the leads (in Great Britain) that the Conservatives enjoyed in 1955 (1.9 points) and 1970 (2.3 points) or Labour did in 1964 (1.9 points), yet those three contests all resulted in an overall majority, including in two instances a relatively safe one.Historical precedent apparently suggests that the Conservative lead should have been sufficient to give the party an overall majority.What about variable constituency sizes?One consequence of the prime minister’s decision to secure a Commons vote for an early election is that the contest had to be fought on the same constituency boundaries as in 2015 and not on the new boundaries the various parliamentary boundary commissions were in the midst of preparing in readiness for an election in 2020.The resulting inequality in the sizes of constituencies was certainly a disadvantage for the Conservatives. The average electorate in constituencies they won at this election was 74,451, whereas in seats won by Labour it was 70,529. The difference of some 3,920 people was around 520 bigger than it had been two years previously.The gap may have been increased somewhat by the government’s decision in 2015 to speed up the introduction of inidual electoral registration, which resulted in particularly sharp drops in registration in some typically Labour-held constituencies with large numbers of students. But the gap was then narrowed somewhat by the applications to be added to the register many (and especially younger) voters made after its initial compilation in December 2016. These added 2,300 names on average to the register in constituencies that Labour won, compared with just 1,600 on average in seats won by the Conservatives.Did voter turnout make a difference?However, inequalities in the registered electorate are not the only consideration that we have to bear in mind in considering the sizes of constituencies. Bias might also arise if turnout is lower in seats held by one party than it is in those won by its opponents. Indeed, turnout was on average some four points lower on average in seats won by Labour at this election (66.5 per cent) than it was in those won by the Conservatives (70.7 per cent).\u0026nbspAFPGetty)That said, this was a noticeably smaller gap than in 2015, for turnout increased on average by 3.8 points in seats Labour won, but by only 2.0 points in those won by the Conservatives. As a result, at 5,675 votes, the difference between Conservative and Labour-held seats in terms of the total number of votes cast was actually smaller at this election than it had been in the same two sets of seats two years previously (6,541).To this we need to add one other consideration. The relative success of the Conservatives in seats with a relatively high Leave vote meant that the increase in the party’s vote was often greater in more working-class seats outside of London and the south of England, whose populations have grown less rapidly and thus tend to have lower than average electorates.For example, Conservative support increased on average by as much as 7.3 points in seats in which fewer than 72,000 people were registered to vote, compared with just 4.3 points where more than 77,000 names appeared on the register. Similarly, while the Conservative vote increased on average by 9.7 points where turnout was less than 65 per cent, it increased by just 3.2 points where turnout was above 71 per cent. As a result, there was a noticeable reduction in the extent to which the Conservative vote was concentrated in constituencies where more people turned out to vote.Created with Sketch.

The Labour Party was ahead of the Conservatives by more than 40 points in 27 per cent of seats that it won, while the Conservative Party was that far ahead of Labour in just 12 per cent of the constituencies that it won.\u0026nbspIn short, whatever disadvantage the Conservatives suffered as a result of inequalities in the sizes of constituencies tended to be compensated by them having a more efficiently distributed vote.John\u0026nbspCurtice, Strathclyde University, Stephen Fisher, Trinity College, Oxford, and Robert Ford and Patrick English, University of Manchester, are authors of The Results Analysed, in ‘The British General Election of 2017’, edited by Philip Cowley and Dennis\u0026nbspKavanagh, from which this article is extractedShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

We work hard to ensure that our customers can limit the impact and restore their services as soon as possible.”Ericsson says O2 data will be coming back ‘as soon as possible’The company said most of its affected customers had got back online, but that some – presumably including Tesco – were still not working, and that it was continuing to work with them.On Thursday evening, O2’s\u0026nbspchief executive said\u0026nbsphe was “sorry because we have let our customers down”.\u0026nbspMark Evans told Sky News restoration of the network had started and it would be completed by Friday morning.\u0026nbspPressed\u0026nbspby Sky News host\u0026nbspDermot Murnaghan\u0026nbspif the company would compensate customers, Mr Evans would only say it would “find a way of making an apology in an O2 way”.\u0026nbspMr Evans admitted, however,\u0026nbsphe did “not know yet” what “an O2 way” meant.The problems with the service provide\u0026nbsphave hit as many as 30 million people in the UK, affecting not only O2 customers but users of the networks that borrow their infrastructure, such as Tesco\u0026nbspMobile and GiffGaff.It also hit transport networks and other systems that rely on O2’s\u0026nbspinternet connections to transfer data.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It still appears to be affecting every customer\u0026nbspof O2.As well as the network\u0027s own users, customers of other carriers that rely on O2 – such as Tesco\u0026nbspMobile and GiffGaff\u0026nbsp– are also unable to get online.O2 said the problem was affecting only internet\u0026nbspconnections, and some texts. But many customers said they have no signal at all, and calls are not getting through either.The problems have also hit systems that seem entirely unrelated, such as live updating bus arrivals boards, which rely on O2\u0027s\u0026nbspdata network to report where they are.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

They will be informed about when that is available.O2 data network restored after millions hit by day-long outageAnd pay as you go customers on O2\u0027s mobile broadband will also be given a 10 per cent discount on a Bolt On purchase in the new year.All of O2\u0027s\u0026nbsp30 million customers are thought to have been hit by the outage, and so will be receiving the free package.Customers do not appear to need to do anything to get the refund, and will either be contacted to alert them to it or will just receive the additional airtime added to their bill.It is not clear whether customers of the networks that were also offline because they rely on O2\u0027s infrastructure – such as GiffGaff\u0026nbspand Tesco\u0026nbspMobile – will also be getting refunds from their carriers.The outage caused problems across the UK, including in some unusual places, such as live bus arrivals at bus stops, which rely on O2\u0027s\u0026nbspdata connection.It lasted for almost a full day, going down early in the morning and with service only being restored overnight the following evening.O2 said the issues were caused by problems with software provided by Ericsson. It also caused problems elsewhere in the world, such as at Japan\u0027s Softbank.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightThe company has posted a series of messages making clear that it is working to fix the problems – though without explaining what is wrong.Our technical teams are investigating reports of issues when using data, O2\u0027s status page said.\u0026nbspVoice calls are working OK. Our technical teams are investigating.We apologise for any inconvenience. Updates will be shared here as soon they are available.A similar explanation was tweeted by O2\u0027s official account.We are aware our customers are unable to use data this morning, it posted.\u0026nbspOur technical teams are working on the issue with high priority. We are really sorry and working as hard and as fast as we can to fix this.It then posted a follow-up explaining the problem.Outage Update: One of our 3rd party suppliers has identified a software issue in their system, it tweeted.\u0026nbspOur technical teams are working extremely hard to resolve this. We\u0027d encourage you to use Wi-Fi wherever you can and we are really sorry.If you have been hit by the issues, there may be\u0026nbsplittle you can do. But here are some things to try in the meantime.While many people switch to GiffGaff or O2 for the deals, it is far from the most reliable of the data networks.According to Which, EE has the most reliable 4G, with people being able to get faster connections 87 per cent of the time. It also has faster mobile web connections than O2, according to the same survey.WiFi\u0026nbspconnections are still working, which might be little consolation if you\u0027re already out and trying to connect to the internet.But it is worth trying to see if you can get online using one: remember, for instance, you can get online at Tube stations by using their WiFi connections, and there might be open networks available if you are near a business. O2 customers may even have access to BT Openzone, which borrows people\u0027s in-home WiFi connections to allow you to get onto the internet.Once you\u0027re at work, you might also find there\u0027s a WiFi connection for employees that you\u0027ve never had to use because you can usually\u0026nbspget data. Now that you can\u0027t get data, it might be helpful to use that instead.When you\u0027re trying to fix your own data, there\u0027s not a great deal you can do. Sometimes, switching the connection on and off sometimes fixes problems like these – but isn\u0027t working this time around.Instead, you might just have to stay glued to The Independent\u0027s coverage for notification of when the network gets back up again.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That makes life challenging for us.OnePlus aims to go mainstream as it launches its ‘iPhone killer’“5G is going to open up a lot of new ways people use their smartphone – the increased speed combined with the increased capacity mean your smartphone can now truly be the centre of a connected experience, for everything from fitness to home automation.”The announcement that OnePlus’s\u0026nbspphone will be the first available in Europe comes despite the fact that other manufacturers – including giants like Samsung – have promised to bring their own devices to the network as soon as possible.Asked whether he was concerned that rivals would beat OnePlus to market despite its claim to being the first, Mr Lau said that there are “obviously no guarantees” but that his company were best positioned to be ready with the cutting-edge technology first.“We started working on 5G in 2016, and developed an R\u0026ampD lab with Qualcomm in 2017,” he said. “OnePlus has always used Qualcomm 800 series chipsets as part of our flagship-only strategy, and this is part of the reason for the excellent relationship we have with one of the world’s leading chipset providers.“No-one is better positioned than OnePlus to take the lead with 5G. We don’t really look at what others are doing in the industry, we’re focused on providing the best possible experience for our users, and we recognised early on that 5G would be a huge opportunity for revolution.”Others, such as Apple, are rumoured to have sat out the decision until at least 2020, allowing other companies to take the first leap – and deal with the potential for the kinds of major infrastructure problems that have blighted similar rollouts in the past. Mr Lau said that OnePlus would work hard to ensure those problems didn’t hit this time around.Created with Sketch.iPhone XS launch in September 2018 Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Tim Cook speaks about the iPhone XS and XS MaxTim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks about the iPhone XS and XS Max at an Apple Inc product launch event 211 Tim Cook speaking at the iPhone launchTim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks on stage at the end of the Apple Inc311 Tim Cook speaking during the event411 Phil Schiller, Apple\u0027s senior vice president of worldwide marketingPhil Schiller, Apple\u0027s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, speaks about the Apple iPhone XS and Apple iPhone XS Max511 Phil Schiller speaks about the new iPhone XRPhilip W.

Those early adopters know that, as with the launch of 4G, there won’t be 5G coverage everywhere at first but it’ll be a rapid rollout from networks.”Proponents have regularly suggested that 5G could change the way that people use phones, allowing people to take advantage of instant and reliable connections to create new forms of experience. Mr\u0026nbspLau\u0026nbspechoed those claims,\u0026nbspsuggesting they may be transformative in ways that the company has not even expected.“When you look at the history of smartphones, they’re used in ways today which no-one had designed them for originally,” he said.\u0026nbsp”5G will be the same – the possibilities will open up in front of us as people experiment with how to combine speed and capacity – everything from gaming through to work or fitness will change.

If plague evolved in the mega-settlements, then when people started dying from it, the settlements would have been abandoned and destroyed.”As the plague evolved, it would have spread around the continent along newly developed trade routes made possible by wheeled transport.\u0026nbspUltimately, it would have arrived in the northernmost parts of Europe, and the small village in which the woman sampled by this study lived.The plague has devastated Europe for millennia, from outbreaks in the Bronze Age through to the Black Death pandemic that killed up to 60 per cent of the continent’s population in the Middle Ages.Dr Rasmussen and his team are trying to track down the\u0026nbspearliest strains of plague to emerge, using ancient DNA strands to trace its lineage from the relatively harmless bacteria that preceded it.The strain still in existence today erged from other varieties around 5,000 years ago, and the 5,700-year-old specimen is likely a closer representation of those implicated in the first outbreaks.Though Dr Rasmussen says they are yet to find a “smoking gun” for their theory about early mega-settlement outbreaks, they would like to test remains from those sites in order to test the idea.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Tory MPs don’t like it because we can’t get out of it except by signing a permanent trade deal that guarantees the same thing. Even Jeremy Corbyn has criticised it because we have no way out of it except with the agreement of the EU.\u0026nbspNow she could tell her MPs that avoiding a hard border in Ireland is something to which the UK should be committed anyway. But a lot of them don’t agree. They think it would be a price worth paying for a “real” Brexit – although they tend to argue in public that a hard border could be managed by technology so no one would notice it.\u0026nbspSo, instead, Theresa May is telling her rebels that they can have a veto over the backstop, should it ever be needed.\u0026nbspTheresa May’s backstop veto plan ‘would rip up withdrawal agreement’This is spin. She has written into the withdrawal agreement a choice at the end of the transition period, the end of 2020. If the long-term trade deal with the EU has not been negotiated by then, and it seems likely that it would not have been, the UK would then face a choice between the backstop or a one-off extension to the transition period. It would be inconceivable that any government would make that decision without consulting parliament, so May’s “offer” is no more than a statement of the obvious.\u0026nbspAnd it does not get round the fact that the backstop will still be the fallback option. If, in 2020, the UK opts to extend the transition period, at most by two years to the end of 2022, and if when that expires there is still no long-term trade deal, then the backstop will come into effect anyway.\u0026nbspThe only way out of it would be for the UK to repudiate the withdrawal agreement. This is an international treaty and we have a sovereign right as a nation to pull out of any treaty, but that would have serious consequences. Any country that goes around binning international agreements would become, in effect, a rogue state, and other countries will be wary of signing new deals with it. If we did that, it would not be possible to negotiate any kind of trade deal with the EU.\u0026nbspThis was what many journalists and Brussels officials thought the prime minister meant by her offer: she would be giving MPs the chance to repudiate an agreement to which they had just agreed. That is the trouble with spin. If you are trying to pretend something is what it is not, people might assume you mean something else altogether.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

Under a “condorcet”\u0026nbspsystem which would see voters rank all options in order of preference, Ms May’s deal has the backing of 370 constituencies while remain has the backing of 262.\u0026nbspUK to water down EU citizens’ rights if there is no-deal BrexitThe poll comes as Ms May faced pressure to delay the so-called meaningful vote on Tuesday over the prospect of a\u0026nbspdevastating defeat at the hands of Tory rebels and her DUP allies.Senior Conservative MP Sir Graham Brady, who chairs the backbench 1922 committee, said he would welcome the 11 December\u0026nbsp“meaningful vote” being deferred if no solution could be found to differences within the party over the backstop.He told Newsnight: “I think the most important thing is to have clarity about how we might remove ourselves from a backstop.“It’s having the answer to that question of substance that is most important, not the timing, so if that question can be answered in the course of the next few days then all well and good.“If it can’t then I certainly would welcome the vote being deferred.”Created with Sketch.

Ministers touring U.K. flogging this dead deal are engaged in worst miss selling since PPI.”Ms May has faced calls to postpone Tuesday’s vote, with senior Conservative MP Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, saying he would welcome the vote being deferred if no solution could be found to differences within the party over the backstop.However the prime minister appears to be pressing ahead and has dispatched\u0026nbsp30 ministers including Philip Hammond and health secretary Matt Hancock across the UK on Friday in a final push to sell her Brexit deal.Created with Sketch.

Whether the UK had this power or not has been disputed, and campaigners had asked judges to rule.This isn’t a final legal ruling by the court, but judges usually endorse what the advocate general suggests. We should find out if this recommendation is confirmed within the coming weeks, with 17 December one date that is being talked about in Brussels.\u0026nbspIf it is confirmed, an accidental no-deal Brexit is effectively taken off the table – the government would be able to stop it in all circumstances if it wanted to.\u0026nbspThis is significant because the government’s main argument to remainer MPs to get them to support Theresa May’s deal has been that if they don’t, a disastrous no-deal Brexit could happen without anyone wanting it to. In one respect, the decision makes it harder for May’s deal to pass, because she won\u0027t be able to scare them into backing it.Meanwhile, in WestminsterAs the news from the Luxembourg court broke in the morning , MPs were settling in for a big day in Westminster. By the time they went home for the night, the Government had been defeated in three votes – a record bad day for Theresa May’s minority administration.One of these votes was about whether the Government was in contempt of parliament for refusing to release its legal advice about its Brexit deal. MPs decided that ministers were indeed in contempt – effectively forcing the government to release the legal advice. This is significant because the advice is expected to provide more ammunition for opponents of the deal, especially Brexiteers.But another vote lost by the government will likely have even bigger implications. MPs – including 26 Tory rebels – voted to give parliament more power if Theresa May’s deal is voted down.If the deal is voted down next Tuesday the Government has 21 days to come back to Parliament and lay its plan for what happens next. But under the successful amendment tabled by Tory Remainer Dominic Grieve, the Commons will also be able to vote on what it wants the Government to do. Though that vote wouldn’t technically be binding, it would be politically incredible for the Government to ignore it.\u0026nbspTaken together with the likely ECJ ruling that the UK has the power to stop Brexit if it wants, MPs would be expected to take no-deal off the table. They might also call for a so-called ‘plan B’ – a call for Theresa May to go back to Brussels and negotiate a different deal. Whether that would be successful is another matter.So what are the implications for Brexit?The overall effect of the events of Tuesday 4 December are to make a no-deal Brexit significantly less likely. Nobody thinks there is a majority of MPs in favour of a no-deal, and they will now control the Government’s response to its deal being defeated.\u0026nbspIf the ECJ decides that the UK does have the unilateral power to revoke Brexit, then no-deal is effectively off the table. But even if it doesn’t it’s unlikely member states would stand in the way and push Britain off the cliff.In one sense, the deal is also less likely to pass because of what happened: Remainers were being encouraged to vote for it on the basis that a no-deal might happen.\u0026nbspBut in a strange way, the deal might win more support – if Brexiteers decide that the defeat of the deal might mean Brexit not happening at all, they could swing behind it. A large number have already publicly said they will vote against it, however – so whether that will be enough remains to be seen.Is that everything that happened?No, that’s just the main thread. Plenty more happened that would have been big news on any other day.\u0026nbspNigel Farage also announced he was leaving Ukip – the party he has long been synonymous with – because of its increasing closeness to far-right activist Tommy Robinson.\u0026nbspThe BBC dropped out of plans to host a debate on Brexit between Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May after the three sides couldn’t agree on a format.The Pound fell to an 18-month low after the Government lost the contempt vote, but then rebounded.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, former Bank of England governor Mervyn King wrote an article in which he likened Theresa May’s Brexit deal to the appeasement of the Nazis. All in a day’s work!\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The key issue that we’re\u0026nbspsaying\u0026nbsptoday, and that’s why we’re delivering a petition signed by a million people in this country, is that those choices are ones that should be made by the British people.“Parliament is gridlocked ... This is no way to decide the most fundamental question facing Britain for the next 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years.“It is time that we now put the clear choices to the British people and allow them to decide.”Thornberry contradicts Jeremy Corbyn and insists Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumThe two documents were handed in to officials at 11am by Ms Greening, politicians from three other parties and The Independent‘s editor Christian Broughton.\u0026nbspLabour’s\u0026nbspChuka Umunna, a champion of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “The biggest issue that we’ve had since the Second World War is being left to MPs. And the problem we have with MPs\u0026nbspin parliament, is\u0026nbspthat they can’t come to a view of what should happen in this situation.“The bottom line is how else are you going to resolve impasse in Westminster if not by referring it back to the people. I don’t know anyone who has come up with a viable alternative.”\u0026nbspLiberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the “let’s-just-get-on-with-it”\u0026nbspattitude is a “fallacy”, because “even if we accept the government’s deal we’re not just getting on with it”.“We’ll be spending years in negotiation of what kind of arrangement we’d want with the European Union – the problem isn’t going to go away,” he said.The prime minister has repeatedly said that she will not countenance a further referendum on Brexit. But with no option carrying a majority in the Commons, a new vote has become\u0026nbspa more likely way to break the political deadlock.\u0026nbspReferring to calls for a new referendum on Monday, Ms May said: “People are talking about a second vote when we haven’t even delivered on the first vote.“I think we need to deliver on the first vote. We asked people to vote. We said ‘please decide whether we should leave or remain’.“People voted to leave and I think there’s a, sort of, democratic duty on us as politicians, having had that referendum, and having said it is your choice, to actually deliver on it. So, let’s deliver on the first vote.”Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

In recent days she has outlined how her proposals will deliver on the\u0026nbsppublic’s desire to end EU free movement.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

There is no point in the Government trying to hide that fact.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.At the start of a key debate in Parliament on her Brexit plan, the Prime Minister said the backstop was not a trap for Britain.The backstop is not a trick to trap us in the EU, said Mrs May.It actually gives us some important benefits of access to the EUs market without many of the obligations and that is something the EU will not want to let happen, let alone persist for a long time."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000452464646.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"winter solstice 2018 when how celebrated","story":"Along with the shortest number of daylight hours it is also when the Sun is at its lowers point in the sky, in the northern hemisphere.This year’s winter solstice is on December  at .pm.The world solstice comes from the Latin solstitium meaning Sun stands still because the apparent movement of the Suns path north or south stops before changing direction.It is the shortest day of the year.Across Europe it is known as Yule, from the Norse word Jul , meaning wheel.In the northern hemisphere it is when the North Pole is pointing away from the Sun.The day has been celebrated by ious cultures around the world for thousands of years.Most notably it is associated with the druids who mark the start of the solar year with a celebration of light and the rebirth of the Sun.The Feast of Jul was observed in Scandinavian countries around the solstice.Fires would be lit to symbolise the heat and light of the ing Sun and a Yule log was gathered and burnt in the hearth as a tribute to the Norse god Thor.Pagan homes are often decorated with supposedly sacred herbs and red, green and white colours.Holly, ivy, evergreen boughs and pine cones are usually put around the home, especially in places where socialising takes place.A sprig of mistletoe is put up above a threshold and is meant to be left there until the next Yule.Pagans see it as a charm for good luck throughout the year but has now taken on a symbolic meaning for kissing beneath it and the opportunity for romance.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We must be duly punished.EU leaders can see — apparently more clearly than our own abject leaders — just how well we might do and how much of a threat a prosperous, independent Britain would pose to their Grand Project.Nobody can be certain what will happen after next Tuesday’s crunch vote.A snap election or a second referendum are unthinkable but possible.Returning to full EU membership is both unthinkable and impossible.There are alternatives... the Norway Option, Canada Plus... but they are fraught with complications.Yet there is a way we could avoid Mr Gove’s “turbulence” and leave in an orderly fashion without any deal at all.We don’t have to “crash out” or drive off a clf like Thelma and Louise.Neither option would be good for Britain — or the EU.It should be possible to negotiate a  to -month window to prepare a deal which suits both sides — and pay an appropriate sum to Brussels for the extra time.First, of course, we need a new leader and a new Prime Minister.That is almost as complicated as Brexit.DISGRACED Labour MP Kate Osamor has finally quit Jeremy Corbyn’s team, but only after proof she lied about knowing her son Ishmael was a convicted drug handler.Ms Osamor told a Times reporter who confronted her with the evidence: “I should have come down here with a bat and smashed your face in.”“F*** off,” she added and chucked a bucket of water.Two questions. Is it any surprise Ishmael grew up with contempt for the law And what would have happened to a Tory MP who behaved like that to ahack Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And because it keeps us in a customs union preventing us enacting our own trade deals.Despite the persuasive efforts of Attorney General Geoffrey Cox yesterday, we just don’t believe the EU will seek to avoid the backstop — or let us leave it.It will do anything to prevent an independent free-trading powerhouse on its doorstep. And once we’ve paid our £billion “bill” our leverage is gone.Why did our negotiators not demand a way to exit this trap  Because they didn’t think Brussels would agree. Such has been the feebleness of our efforts since David Cameron first had a go.Mrs May is now reduced to claiming we CAN do our own trade deals before the backstop kicks in. And yes, we can sign them . . . but they may never come into effect.The PM should not waste a week trying to sell this bad deal to the public.She shouldto Brussels and tell them it won’t work.GIVEN how many terror attacks MI has helped foil in Europe, you’d think Brussels would want the UK’s security and military might onside.Instead, out of spite, they are freezing us out of the Galileo satellite project we have invested £.billion in.Theresa May still insists we “will remain committed to Europe’s collective security” after Brexit.Pity the Brussels pygmies can’t say the same.IMAGINE the outragea Tory MP abused and threatened areporter with a savage beating for asking questions.That politician would be toast.Yet somehow Corbynista Kate Osamor is still a Labour MP.She employed her son in Parliament despite his serious drugs conviction, then lied about when she knew of it.When a Times reporter challenged her she swore at him, threatened to beat him with a bat and threw a bucket of water over him.She’s even banned from editing Wikipedia for doctoring her own entry.For now, she’s off Corbyn’s front bench.

Most are keen and eager to learn. That’s why teaching can be a really rewarding job, but there’s no doubt it is also a tough one.Today I will be launching my annual report, which will show that, overall, schools in England are doing a good job.The vast majority of children are attending good or outstanding schools, which is as it should be. Young people get just one shot at childhood — leaving no room for complacency.Yet in recent years it feels like more and more is being asked of schools and teachers, which could put this improvement at risk.They are being asked to do things that should be done at home by parents, as they used to be.This is making the job of schools harder. It takes up too much precious time and stops teachers from doing their actual job — teaching.One of the most shocking examples I hear about is the growing number of children beginning their reception year still in nappies.I’ve asked about this in primary schools this year, and each time I’ve asked I’ve been told it is a real problem.This is dficult for teachers, embarrassing for the children concerned and disruptive to their classmates.Quite simply, it is wrong. Toilet training is the parents’ job. It should not be left to schools. Only in the most extreme cases should parents be excused from this most basic of parenting tasks.And this isn’t the only area that concerns me.We all know about the growing problem of childhood obesity. By the start of primary school, almost a quarter of children in England are overweight or obese. This is at the age four or five.This rises to more than a third by the time they go to secondary school.It is estimated that nearly , young people in the UK are now suffering from type  diabetes, an unpleasant disease normally only seen in people over the age of .Schools have an important role to play, teaching children about the importance of healthy eating and exercise. Kids need to get out of breath during PE.But schools can’t do it all. It is lazy for us to rely on schools to change kids’ habits.And the reality is, that as Ofsted research shows, schools on their own can’t make the dference. The answer to the obesity crisis, particularly among younger children, lies in the home, and parents need to make sure their offspring eat healthily, go outside, and don’t spend all day playing on electronic devices.There is no point in teaching about healthy choices, making sure school meals are healthy or having rules about what goes into a packed lunch,for breakfast, dinner and all weekend children have a supply of junk food.One of the saddest things I’ve heard about recently is cases where children have leftover fast food, cold chips or chicken nuggets, in their packed lunches the following day. With the best will in the world, schools cannot fight this single-handedly.Sadly, in some parts of our country, schools are also at the forefront of tackling a very dferent kind of risk: kne crime and gang culture.Thankfully most schools are safe, and of course they can help educate young people about the dangers of knives and how to avoid being drawn into gangs.But they cannot be expected to solve the problem alone. Preventing kne crime requires people working together — police, youth services, health services — to protect children and to do everything to bring those who cause harm to children to justice.However we must not forget the role of parents here either. This is about taking responsibility for your child. I accept that many families are busy and that some children have dficult and complex problems to deal with.But that doesn’t excuse parents from the basics of teaching their children right from wrong, giving them proper boundaries and security. And that means not trying to be their “best friend”.One answer may be to introduce more parenting classes. We know these can work and help parents who might otherwise be struggling.These shouldn’t be for schools to run, but perhaps to run in schools. Maybe now is the time to look again at the ambitions of the Le Chances strategy or the ideas behind the Sure Start programme.But parents must recognise they cannot off load their responsibilities at the school gate.Every minute we ask teachers to spend on these issues is time children aren’t learning the Rs, studying our nation’s history or the scientic forces that shape our world.I want schools to be able to do their proper job, and to let them do that, parents have got to step up.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So why the apparent change of heart The popular consensus seems to be it’s a charm offensive to counteract the negative coverage of an alleged rt between her daughter Kate and royal newbie Meghan Markle — a laying out of the “Team Catherine” stall,you like.But as the fallout rumours are fairly recent and most glossy mags are laid out six weeks in advance, may I humbly cynicallysuggest that the stall she’s laying out might be more monetary than motherly In other words, building up traffic to her and husband Michael’s Party Pieces website for Christmas in preparation for potentially flogging it off to an overseas billionaire in the pre-Brexit New Year.But I digress. On Christmas Day I will be enduringour annual family fallout over a game of Monopoly. ButI wasn’t, I’d be straight round to Middleton Towers in Bucklebury, Berks, for what sounds like an idyllically festive few days.In a Christmas walnutshell, it goes something like this: Wake up whenever, pop in to the local church, go for a walk, open a few pressies, smoked salmon and champagne for lunch, more pressies, some games, then the main meal early evening.Oh, and all the grandchildren will have a small tree in their bedrooms that they can decorate themselves. The rest of the year, she says, “is really normal most of the time”. Which, to Prince William, who has grown up amid the pomp and circumstance of stuffy royal traditions, must feel like a slice of sheer heaven.Instead, poor love, he and Kate are expected to join the rest of the royalsat Sandringham, where the Queen et al stick to the German tradition of opening gts on Christmas Eve before dressing for a “formal dinner” from which, oh dear, the women eventually retire to another room while the men enjoy a port or brandy.Then it’s off to the highly publicised visit to St Mary’s Magdalene church on Christmas morning, followed by a turkey lunch and a communal viewing of “Granny’s” speech at pm.It’s unclear when William and Kate will head off to see her family, but what’s the betting they get in the car with fixed grins before mumbling “thank God that’s over for another year” the second they hit Norfolk’s A  And that’s why, whatever the truth behind the rumours that Kate and Meghan aren’t getting on, it won’t matter one jot to the admirably grounded Duchess of Cambridge who, thanks to her idyllic childhood, knows exactly who she is.Meghan, on the other hand, has no such cosy alternative to retreat to. Her parents orced when she was just six years old and it’s no secret that she’s now estranged from her father Thomas and his highly vocal, deliciously off-message side of the family.So, however well meaning she is, all her charitable grandstanding and repeated declarations of being “an independent woman” suggest she finds validation from being regarded as a, yawn, groundbreaking feminist role model rather than, as Kate is dismissed by some, a dutul we and mother, who toes the royal line and doesn’t make waves.But Kate has no need to virtue signal because she’s rooted in the love and respect of her tight-knit family — a set-up she’s replicating with William, who, after his own fractured childhood, clearly adores the normality of le Chez Middleton.And of course, they’re both equally secure in the knowledge that, post-“King Charles”, the top job is theirs.Harry, on the other hand, has chosen a bride who, despite her efforts at reinvention, has a chequered pastand a burning desire to be seen as more than just a pretty appendage to the sixth-in-line to the throne.That’s understandable.

If you’re like Danny and able to be with almost any woman you want, that becomes really boring so he finds other ways to get a kick.“Just being with somebody for a night is not enough for him. He doesn’t get the same sort of thrill.”Hope, who is completing a master’s degree in neuroscience, told the pal that Cipriani made her so reliant on him she questioned her own sanity.In a message she said: “My relationship with Danny is the most unhealthy I have ever had.

The online system is riddled with faults, complications and delays.There can be no doubt, continuing with this roll-out will leave many of the most vulnerable families destitute by Christmas, and I am asking you to intervene as a matter of urgency.His area is currently seeing the full roll out of Universal Credit.But Amber Rudd blasted the letter as scaremongering.She said tonight: Theres no requirement for a UC claimant to have ID, butyou do purchase one we can actually reimburse you.Where people wont have ID our terric work coaches use many methods to identy someone and get their claim started right away.Many Brits have said they are finding the verication process online dficult - and hundreds of thousands of people have abandoned the online application because they couldnt finish it, recent figures revealed.Only half of claimants said they were able to make a claim online for benefits without help.IF youre experiencing trouble applying for your Universal Credit, or the payments just dont cover costs, here are your options:Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.To apply for the new flagship benefits system you do need a form of ID - this can be a passport, credit card or a driving licence.ButBrits dont have this, there are other forms of ID that can be used - including evidence of your address, bills, a birth or marriage certicate, a National Insurance card, or council tax documents.Claimants can also be asked security questions too to try and very identities.Today it was revealed that the DWP has spent £million on adverts for Universal Credit.A DWP spokeswoman told The Sun: Having ID is not a requirement for those making a Universal Credit claim but it does make the process easier.

Suddenly, every berk thinks that the phone in their hand gives them the right to publish anything they see.Either they have some gung-ho fantasy of being a war correspondent, responsible for recording a fracas without doing a damn thing about stopping it. Or  in their head they are suddenly Quentin ­Tarantino, recording a particularly tasty bit of violence.So we get incidents like last week’s, at a Towie-favourite nightclub in Gants Hill, North East ­London. A young woman was filmed being sexually assaulted as onlookers, some of them women, jeer at the “fun” and point cameras up her skirt.Were these people scared of intervening and pulling the thugs off her, and filming it in order to pass the footage on to club management and police  Nope, they just put it up on the internet for the world to share the jeering. The weird and wicked idea that this is somehow OK is growing.Incidents on planes, in clubs, in the street, in schoolyards, are filmed by bystanders who don’t even try to shout or intervene. They are then plonked online, just to get some strange kudos for the person filming it.From the US and, increasingly, here there are cases of onlookers recording the humiliation of other people, not responsibly and ethically in order to give it to the authorities — managements, police, teachers — but just to put it online and “go viral”.Take the coward who last month filmed a policewoman being violently kicked in the head, then posted the footage online with the caption “LOL.” Or the bully who posted a video of a drunk teen ­giving oral sex to more than  men in Magaluf, for the “banter”.And last week, a shocking video of a -year-old Syrian refugee boy called Jamal being dragged to the floor by his neck went viral. Then, because the poor boy has not been humiliated enough, his ordeal was shared online by “disgusted” celebs and MPs who proclaim to care but are, of course, unwittingly ­contributing to his suffering.Some may vaguely think they are activists exposing bad ­behaviour, but in cases like this they are no such thing. They are voyeurs, cowards, and exhibitionists. Because it’s the victim of the attack, not just the attackers, who gets humiliated.Anyone half-decent understands that only disgusting ­people go in for “revenge porn”, sharing intimate videos of someone they broke up with. Whether dumped or cheated on, that is a horrible thing to do and can make the victim suicidal. Young girls live in terror of it, on one hand encouraged to be sexy and on the other scared of having their most unguarded moments exposed to the world.It has, a few times, led to ­prosecution and so it should. But personal vengeance and associated “slut-shaming” is only part of it.The whole business of filming other people without consent needs to be seen for what it is — a form of unregulated, potentially irresponsible and damaging rogue journalism.  Smartphone tech and the internet should be ­governed by the same ethical rules journalism developed.Good editors pixelate faces and agonise about what is responsible reporting, and what is in the ­public interest.If it would be wrong for a news reporter to film, for no good ­reason, a person being humiliated, assaulted, or even just tumbling in the street or falling asleep in an embarrassing position on a train, then it is even more wrong for any selfish git with a smartphone to do it.Journalism has rules because it is public. Now that technology can make anyone’s instant shot just as public, the rules should be the same. And because the technology belongs to the “digital natives” who grew up with it, it is time they applied to it all those pious, ethical modern values which we hear so much about.Not all slut-shamers and gloating video bystanders are young — but a great many are.

But this lot beats them all.Two years ago we had a vote on whether we wanted to stay in the European Union. The outcome was decisive.By  per cent to  per cent we voted to leave. The people had been given a voice.And the people said very clearly: We want to leave.But there was never a majority among our political class for leaving.tp composite more brexitBecause for two years the Remainer majority of MPs has done everything it possibly can to thwart the will of the people.They have undermined Theresa May and the Government when it tried to negotiate with Brussels.That’s the main reason the deal we have before us now is so weak.Because as soon as ministers set off to do battle, the likes of Philip Hammond and Justine Greening would be trying to pull the rug from under their feet.The biggest deceit is this. All the while these politicians are trying to scupper Brexit, they are putting on their sincere faces and saying: “We must respect the will of the people.”This is a downright lie and it has always been a downright lie.When Tory Remainers tell you we must get a good deal, they really mean we must not leave the European Union.When the Labour Party tells you that we must have a “good Brexit for jobs”, they really mean that we must not leave the European Union.When that coffin-faced bore Dominic Grieve, once our Attorney General, puts down amendments which effectively stop us leaving with a no-deal, he is really saying: “We must not leave the European Union under any conditions at all.”When they start lecturing you about how Parliament must be sovereign — they’re saying the same thing. We must not leave the EU.What has happened over the past two years has been a concerted campaign of treachery and betrayal.The Tory Brexiteers — with one or two exceptions, such as David Davis, Priti Patel and Jacob Rees-Mogg — haven’t helped by being a disorganised rabble.Too interested in their own political careers to do the dficult work of leading Britain towards a confident exit from that authoritarian bureaucracy.But it is the Remainers who have done the real damage.If they didn’t tell us, at every step of the way, that “the people’s vote must be respected” then I’d have a little more time for them. But they trot that out every time they open their mouths.All the while trying to wreck any chance of Brexit.God knows what will happen now. Although I suspect even he’s perplexed.What should have been a graceful and confident exit from an unfit institution has turned into a bugger’s muddle.But I do know this. The people of the UK will not forget the names of those who have sold us down the river.And one day, sure enough, we’ll have our revenge.What’s advertised as a glistening winter wonderland is usually five square yards of mud with a plastic donkey and an elf who has just completed a five stretch for armed robbery.I know everybody needs to make a ­living. But I do wonder how the owners of these crap grottos live with themselves.Find eight of the best Winter Wonderlands here.WHAT a fabulous family the Osamors are.A real credit to the country, to the Labour Party and to the House of Commons.Let’s start with Kate, above, the Labour MP for Edmonton and one of Jeremy ­Corbyn’s favourites.She employed her son, Ishmael, below, as a researcher at the House of Commons.And continued to do so even after he had been convicted of possessing lethal drugs including ketamine and ecstasy at a festival.Not only that, but she misled the public and her colleagues.She said she hadn’t known about her son’s conviction until after he was sentenced.When it was absolutely clear that she had.How did she respond when a journalist tried to ask her about this business She screamed “f*** off” at him. Then threw a bucket of water at him.Then said: “I should have come down here with a bat and smashed your head in.”After which, this entitled madam actually rang  – twice – to say the reporter was “stalking” her.Unbelievable.Then there’s  Grandma Osamor, Kate’s mother Martha. Now ennobled as Baroness Osamor of Tottenham and taking her seat in the House of Lords at your expense.A supporter of Labour activists suspended over anti-Semitism.And once considered too left-wing even for the Labour Party, until Corbyn came along.What a great parenting job both she and her daughter have done.And do you suppose that either would be in the ­positions they are now were it not for the colour of their skin THE animal rights activists Peta want us to stop using  certain phrases which are nasty about animals.Such as, “No use flogging a dead horse”.Better to say: “You can’t feed a fed horse.” Which doesn’t sound right at all, to me.Some vegans are also supposedly  objecting to “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”, because it’s unkind to eggs. And “bringing home the bacon”. Which is unkind to bacon.I think we need to create a few new ones to annoy Peta even further. So . . .Too many voles in the blender spoil the smoothie.Riots, confusion, mayhem. They’ve just woken up to the fact that their president is a smirking liberal halfwit who cares not a jot about working-class people.  We could have told you that, mes amis, when you elected him  months ago.Emmanuel Macron has already had to climb down and give in to some of the demands from the rioters.During the election he portrayed himself as a populist, but was anything but. It was a con job.Next time you toddle off to the polls, you lot, get it right.SO, Nigel Farage has deserted Ukip because he thinks the party has become too extremist.Fair enough, he’s probably right. The party looks dead and buried.It’s a shame that because of our first-past-the-post system Ukip were never able to capture many seats in parliament.I’ve never been a fan of proportional representation.Butwe had it, Ukip under Farage, above, would likely be our second or third biggest party by now.And those negotiations over  Brexit would be looking very dferent, wouldn’t they RESPECT to Wrexham driver Kenneth Samuels. He managed to fit ELEVEN people into his Ford Focus.Actually, he’s a Wrexham non-driver now, because the Old Bill caught him.  He was disqualied from driving for  months.I assumed at first that he was ferrying a troupe of dwarves to a panto.But no. There were children involved, which kind of antagonised the magistrates.If the police had looked a bit further I suspect they’d have found the entire Liberal Democrat Party in the boot.  And Speaker John Bercow in the glove box. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

are set to go onto the new benefits system next year, and millions more will be rolled onto it after that.But peers said the current plans were vague and aspirational.And they argued that claimants shouldnt be forced into debt because they werent given enough money to last the changeover period.Many Brits have said they have racked up huge debts waiting for their first benefits payments to come through, which can take five weeks or even longer.The report concluded: We take the view that the House has been given insufficient detail to make an informed decision about DWP’s proposals.Given the large number of unknowns, and the particular dficulty and risks involved in transferring three quarters of a million very vulnerable claimants to Universal Credit, it seems that DWP may have acted prematurely in seeking such extensive powers.Peers said the Department for Work and Pensions might be trying to achieve too much at once, and it raised serious concerns about whether it would be able to cope with all the people going onto the new system.The DWP has insisted it cant use the information thats already in the system for benefits claimants, and argued that the data was often out of date and full of errors.The Department has been approached for comment on the Lords recommendations.Yesterday one MP told how Brits applying for the new system were told they had to fork out £ for a

Both would have taken the Boeing through radar and mobile phone networks.And neither site would produced the debris found washed up on Indian Ocean shores.A third location conforms with the area already searched. But, despite two extensive — and expensive — searches, no trace of the aircraft has been found there.But the fourth probable site has not been investigated.“Our best solution leads to an entirely dferent location agreeing with other data from debris, acoustics and an eyewitness report, providing a clear conclusion where to find the plane,” Kristensen said.The final patch of the Earth’s surface which lines up with all of MH’s flight parameters sits in the Indian Ocean to the southwest of Australia’s Christmas Island.To get there, MH must have done an abrupt U-turn in the Bay of Bengal, and then flown along the south coast of Indonesia.Kristensen points to the unexplained nature of the barnacles found on MHs debris as conforming with a crash in the nutrient-poor but warm waters off Indonesia, before entering the colder West Australian Current.He argues that the course and behaviour of MH points towards a carefully planned attempt to deliberately conceal the aircraft’s course.“There is also something special about the Christmas Island route going through the intertropical convergence zone where satellite detection and long-range radar are hampered by tropical thunderstorms, indicating intelligent planning,” he writes.The engineer then speculates about what happened to the troubled plane.He writes: “Most likely the perpetrator also knew about the handshakes and deliberately directed and timed the flight to get close to the worst possible mathematical data-entanglement with satellite movement through spatial correlation…“…making it almost impossible to find the plane because this allows for a multitude of solutions with similar fitting quality.“The only plausible explanations are that they wanted to land in Banda Aceh or abort the flight by parachute,” Kristensen writes.“Since the aeroplane did not land, the only option is parachuting.“In order to do this they had to fly low and slow … to open a hatch and get out.“They programmed ato normal flying-height into the autopilot before jumping.“Therefore the plane ed to km height after Bandar Aceh without a pressurised cabincausing death for everybody on board who might still have been alive.”A version of this article originally appeared on News.au."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000449596618.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"when is parliamentary vote on brexit","story":"But when is this set to take place  And what happensit fails to pass The Sun can reveal that the meaningful vote in the Commons is December .This means the Government were right by saying it would happen before the new year, but its by no means going to be an easy ride.The five-day debate is actually set to commence on Wednesday, December .For Theresa May, her role in Parliament rests on these crucial  days, with her title hanging in the balance.The UK Cabinet has approved the deal - which was largely seen as allowing it to move on rather than any great vote of confidence or endorsement of it.Because of the Cabinets approval the EU is now planning a special summit in Brussels in late November where leaders will approve it.After the summit, final versions of the withdrawal agreement will be presented to the UK Parliament.The UK is set to leave the EU on March , , at am.Many have cast this is the day of reckoning, when Britain faces the ultimatum of a new deal, or crashing out with a no-deal Brexit.MPs will be voting on the withdrawal agreement that was approved by EU leaders on November , .Parliament has demanded that the Brexit treaty can only be ratied by the Government after it has been “approved by a resolution of the House of Commons on a motion moved by a minister of the crown”.The vote will be a straight yes no format, in a bid to make a decisive and unequivocal decision on the PMs deal.It is expected that MPs will be able to vote on amended versions of the deal too.The outlook doesnt look good.Theresa May has already had two Ministers resign over the deal, and her own Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab, also quit as the draft deal was presented to Parliament.Labour and factions within her own party have declared their intention to vote against it.Then there is the prospect of a vote of no confidence in the PM, which would likely derail the whole process.Some MPs are calling for the vote to be postponed so that the government can avoid an embarrassing defeat but May is adamant that the vote go ahead.If Mrs Mays withdrawal agreement makes it through the Parliamentary vote, it becomes a bill, which means even more voting.This is arguably even harder, because MPs will have all the details, and every element will be under scrutiny - and up for another vote.If the agreement is rejected, Labour has pledged to call a vote of no confidence in the Government in an effort to force a General Election.Hardcore Eurosceptic Conservative MPs could also call a vote of no confidence in Mrs May as party leaderher deal fails to win approval.Other EU leaders tried to help Mrs May by warning there will be no second offer.But France and Spain turned the screw on Theresa May as they vowed to exploit the Brexit deal to extract big concessions on fishing and Gibraltar.The PM has begun a tour of all four corners of the UK to sell her deal, travelling to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.But The Sun can also reveal that Cabinet ministers are planning for Britain to join an EU halfway house, EFTA, with the help of Labour rebels after giving up hope that the deal will pass.Writing in The Sun, former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab calls on the nation to “steel ourselves” to reject Theresa May’s Brexit deal and make the EU one final offer instead.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

What does that tell you ”He added: “I don’t see what the point is in going down to a huge defeat.”Instead he said the PM must “understand” that she can’t get a majority of MPs to back a single Brexit plan and the only other option is to hold a second referendum to settle the issue “for a generation”.Mr Blair blasted Mrs May for trying to sell a deal that was “half-in, half-out”, declaring: “Do Brexit or don’t”.

Ex-soldier Leanne Maguire began to feel ill on day three of a two-week holiday in Mexico and spent the rest of it in bed. When she got home doctors diagnosed viral gastroenteritis caused by food poisoning, said Leanne, . She was later rushed to intensive care, put in a medically induced coma for a week and her family were warned she could die. On awaking, she said, medics revealed that the bug had given her septicaemia, e-Coli and pneumonia as well as liver, lung and kidney failure.   Leanne, who spent nearly two months in hospital, began legal action against travel giant Thomas Cook, which finally settled out of court after five years – just before the case was to be heard. The accounts supervisor, who has a -year-old son Rhys, said: “I could not grasp how a bout of food poisoning led me to death’s door. Then I realised how nasty this condition can be. “I lost more than st in weight and lots of my hair due to malnutrition. “Also I had to take half a year off work and needed counselling to get my le back on track. I looked so dferent that I found it dficult to accept myself.”   Her nightmare started when she booked a pound, holiday at the Temptation Cancun Resort in August . “I spent two weeks in severe pain and kept being violently sick everywhere,” said Leanne, of Runcorn, Cheshire. “My holiday was completely ruined and a waste of money.” After flying back to Britain she was admitted to Warrington Hospital for five days of tests.

The marking on the Svinesund Bridge shows the border between Norway and Sweden. And the UK effectively has one foot out of the EU now too – but where it is heading is far from clear. With Theresa May’s Brexit plans at risk of defeat in next week’s vote, all eyes are on what comes next. The two extreme options – a no-deal Brexit or a second referendum – would be highly isive.   But one gaining support is following Norway’s lead, so we visited to see what it might mean. Norway is a big export market for British goods and supplies % of our gas. The Norway option can seem complicated but would essentially mean us being part of the European Economic Area through the European Free Trade Association. The EEA is made up of all EU countries, plus three EFTA states: Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. All EEA members have full single market access and with it accept the free movement of goods, services, capital and people. Under the Norway option, the post-Brexit UK would join EFTA and a big plus is that the EU seems up for the idea. Other EFTA shycountries also seem keen, while not discussing it formally.   Norway’s trade minister, Torbjorn Roe Isaksen, said: “Our goal always is to maintain as much of a well-ing, no-hassle relationship with the UK as possible.” Yet he admitted Norway’s set-up was not ideal – and Prime Minister Erna Solberg recently warned we would lose trade “bargaining power” outside the EU. “The main advantage is we have full single market access,” said Mr Isaksen. “The disadvantage is we are part of so much EU regulation but don’t have a seat at the table.” This switch to being a “rule taker” is concerning for those who fear its impact on our financial sector. However, it is estimated EFTA countries have to abide by % of EU rules and are not bound by the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy. Norway claims by controlling its own waters, it better manages fish stock levels. But the EU charges import duties.   Another criticism is Norway has to pay into the EU budget – pound per head, compared with pound for us as a full member. The Norway route could cut our bill % to %, depending on who you believe. Another big issue for critics of the option is freedom of workers. Supporters say the EEA Treaty has opt-outs that could limit EU immigration. And one argument for ditching the EU is escaping the European Court of Justice, as disputes could be dealt with by an EFTA Court. But EFTA members are not part of the Customs Union, meaning border checks. Norway says it uses technology to avoid long hold-ups. When we crossed the border by car, we had no checks. But holding areas contained large numbers of lorries.   Doing these at a busy port like Dover could be a big headache, which is one reason why some argue for a “Norway for now” route until we shynegotiate a long-term trade deal with Brussels. But any resolution would need to address the key issue of the Irish border, which is why ministers are talking about Norway Plus, which involves staying in the customs union. Staying in the single market would mean firms retain free access to the EU, which makes up % of our exports. We would not benefit from the EU’s trading bloc clout but could – unless we opted for the customs union in addition – strike new deals with countries like India. The ultimate truth is the Norway option will keep neither Remainers nor Brexiteers happy. Former Labour PM Tony Blair said: “Norway’s not going to work. It’s going to be subject to an even greater degree of attack from people who voted Brexit. It’s very hard to look at that Brexit vote and say they mandated Norway.” Norway voted against EU membership and people we spoke to in fishing port Alesund backed us getting out. Waitress Khawla Al-Sahli said: “We feel we are fine the way we are.”   Taxi driver Borre Haljelsvik said: “Together the UK and Norway would be better at standing up to the EU.” And Professor Carl Baudenbacher, a former president of the EFTA Court, said: “If you compare Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement with the EEA, you are better off with the EEA.” The Bank of England rates the Norway option one of the best and it may have enough support for us to avoid a no-deal exit. It must therefore be taken seriously. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\""},{"url":null,"title":"former ukip leader paul nuttall","story":"NewsFormer Ukip leader Paul Nuttall quits party over Tommy Robinson jobThe ex-Ukip leader has followed Nigel Farage, David Coburn and other senior figures in resigning in protestShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical reporter:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC News \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFormer Ukip leader Paul Nuttall has resigned from the party in protest over leader Gerard Batten making Tommy Robinson an advisor. Nuttall, who was a Ukip MEP, has become the latest figure to quit over the appointment, along with Scottish leader and MEP David Coburn, who also announced he was parting ways with the party this morning. On Tuesday, Nigel Farage sensationally stepped down from the party he co-founded. Farage blasted his successor’s “obsession” with the convicted criminal and English Defence League founder, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon. Mr Batten has come under fire for his association with Robinson - including making the EDL founder an adviser on grooming gangs and prisons, triggering fury among UKIP moderates.  In a statement, Mr Nuttall, the MEP for North West England, said: After much soul-searching over the past week, I have concluded that I must, as of today, resign as a member of Ukip. I do this with an immense amount of reluctance and regret, as I have worked tirelessly for the party for the past fourteen years. I am resigning because the party is being taken in a direction which I believe is harmful to Brexit. The association with Tommy Robinson will simply appal many moderate Brexit voters and inevitably be detrimental to the cause. The Tommy Robinson issue should have been shelved and debated within the party following Brexit in line with the sensible decision taken by the National Executive Committee last month. The party leadership and my MEP colleagues have been aware of my views on this issue for some time. Putting Tommy Robinson front and centre, whilst Brexit is in the process of being betrayed is, in my view, a catastrophic error. To conflate Brexit and Robinson at this crucial moment is to put the Eurosceptic cause in danger and I cannot and will not be party to that. I will continue to serve the North West of England in the European Parliament until my term expires.Announcing his decision to quit, Farage said: Mr Batten’s obsession with Stephen Yaxley-Lennonand fixation with the issue of Islam makes Ukip unrecognisable to many of us. While Robinson may hold an appeal to some members of society who feel they are disenfranchised, I believe he is entirely unsuitable to be involved in any political party. The fact is that his entourage includes violent criminals and ex-BNP members. Many Ukip members - including Ukip’s NEC – urged that Robinson should not become an advisor to Batten. Sadly, these pleas fell on deaf ears.  Senior officials Patrick O’Flynn and Suzanne Evans have resigned in the past week - and today Mr Farage joined them in walking away. Last Sunday, Ukip said the NEC had voted overwhelmingly against a motion of no confidence. But a statement also said that the party does not endorse the appointment of Tommy Robinson in any advisory role. It added: He is not a Ukip member and through his associations he is barred from joining Ukip. Mr Batten previously defended his decision to give Mr Robinson, real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, a role advising him on rape gangs and prison reform, describing the English Defence League founder as courageous. He denied moving Ukip to the extremes or opening its doors to racists, and told the BBC Mr Robinson would help him turn the party into a mass movement... a party for ordinary people. Mr Robinson is expected to feature prominently in the Brexit march on Sunday two days before the Commons votes on the UKs EU withdrawal deal.

A Mirror investigation reveals the UK has lost , grass pitches, swimming pools, sports halls and athletic tracks during the past two years of austerity. It comes as a Sport England report yesterday revealed . million children and young people – .% – do less than  minutes of physical activity a day. And NHS figures showed the proportion who are severely obese has gone up by more than a third since . Commonwealth gold medal winner Conrad Williams, , said: “People talk about an Olympic legacy, but it is six years later and we are already cutting off people from joining the conveyor belt that leads to big success.”   Figures discovered by the Labour Party revealed England has been stripped of  swimming pools at a time when nearly half of -year-olds leave primary school unable to swim. Some  inidual sports halls,  athletic tracks and  grass pitches have been scrapped. Shadow Sports Minister Rosena Allin-Khan said the stats “cast a truly dark cloud over how seriously the Government takes fitness and well-being”. Sprinter Conrad, who won gold with England in the xm at Glasgow , fears closures will deprive the UK of the next generation of athletic stars. He trains teenage runners at Crystal Palace Arena in South East London, which is currently at risk. The arena, the home of British athletics until the Olympic stadium opened, was where Conrad used to train – and he is campaigning to save it.   He said: “If we don’t have facilities which are open and near people, then we are not going to see success and we’re going to lose our reputation as a great sporting nation.” The former European m shychampion also said closures made sports like athletics harder for people from ordinary backgrounds to break into. He said: “There is so much talent in this country in the inner cities and in deprived areas. Butthey don’t have places near then to train, or see people who are like them achieving success, then they won’t get involved.” Not only are kids more likely to be obese than ever before, but just one in  are getting their daily recommended exercise, a study by the universities of Exeter and Plymouth found.   Experts studied  year five children from  schools in Devon and discovered one in  children in their last year of primary school is so severely overweight they are considered obese. The number of children being treated for Type  diabetes is  times larger than previously thought, the study said. The UK has lost , grass pitches, swimming pools, inidual sports halls and athletic tracks since  and gained just , – a net loss of ,. They include Sansome Walk swimming pool in Worcester, which closed in , bringing an end to more than  years of swimming at the site.   Other facilities under threat include Pontllanfraith and Cefn Fforest leisure centres in Caerphilly, South Wales. Hundreds of locals campaigning to save them were joined by ex-Labour leader Neil Kinnock as they took to the streets. Dad-of-four Dean Jones, of Pontllanfraith, said: “This is about quality of le for my kids – they get exercise and they are getting to be part of a team. “We can’t seem to get the importance of that over to the council. It doesn’t seem to matter about the consequences for their health. “Keeping these centres open doesn’t cost that much compared to the massive benefit it has for our children - I don’t know why politicians don’t get that.” In Somerset, eight swimming pools are going to be transferred to nearby schools to cut out the cost of paying a company to manage them. And in Pendle, Lancs, the council is reviewing its support for leisure centres in Barnoldswick, Colne and Nelson. Labour says the lack of facilities makes it especially dficult for the less well-off to get the exercise which doctors agree is essential to a healthy lestyle. It blamed the Government for slashing funding for councils, which own many of the pools and playing fields, by % since .   Cash-strapped town halls are having to take tough decisions when it comes to leisure facilities, with many handing them to private companies to push the cost off their books. Dr Allin-Khan said: “We know the positive impact good fitness levels have on physical and mental health, but the Government have not listened to the experts. The Olympic legacy is in tatters – there is no way for ministers to get away from this. “Hundreds of millions of pounds of investment in local sports facilities are being ruined by cuts to local authorities. “While some members of the public can afford expensive gym memberships and access to private adventure parks, these perks are often financially out of reach for the most vulnerable in society.” The Government insists many of the grass pitches have been replaced by more modern all-weather articial grass pitches –  of which have been opened between  and . A Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport spokeswoman said: “We are completely committed to helping people get active and are investing poundbillion in grassroots sport. “Since , Sport England has also invested poundmillion to help build new state-of-the-art health and leisure shyfacilities across the country.” "},{"url":null,"title":"grieving mum spends fortnight living","story":"NewsGrieving mum spends fortnight living with dead baby girl - even walking her in pramWARNING - UPSETTING CONTENT: Emma Woodhouse, , from Lancaster, Lancs, gave birth to twins Jessica and Bella in June this year by an emergency C-section carried out at  weeks - but Jessica was tragically stillbornShareCommentsByJames SomperAbigail OLeary:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video grieving-mum-spends-two-weeks-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA heartbroken mum spent two weeks living with her dead baby daughter - even taking her for walks in her pram. Emma Woodhouse, , gave birth to twins Jessica and Bella in June this year. An emergency C-section was carried out at  weeks after Jessica’s umbilical cord ruptured in the womb. Bella miraculously survived the traumatic birth, but Jessica was tragically stillborn despite medics battling for  minutes to resuscitate her. But thanks to a cooling cot, the mum-of-five was able to bring Jessica home and spend a fortnight caring for her daughter, bathing her, taking her for walks with her husband Paul and even introducing her to her other children before her cremation. Emma, who believes Jessica died in order to save her twin, even plans to buy Christmas presents and a stocking for the tot this year.  Emma, from Lancaster, Lancs, said: “From the moment Jessica was born I just fell in love with her, she looked so perfect. “Spending that fortnight with her and her sister was so, so wonderful. “We want to show people that it’s possible to spend time with your baby after they’ve passed and to make memories with them. “This shouldn’t be such a taboo subject. “Her face was so perfect, I didn’t want to leave her on her own. “Although she had passed away she’s my daughter and I wanted to spend as much time with her as I could.” Emma had a high risk pregnancy because she has a rare heart-shaped womb, meaning her twins were at risk of being born prematurely. After going into labour at home at only  weeks, Emma was rushed to Royal Lancaster Infirmary for an emergency c-section. Doctors were able to safely deliver Bella, but failed to be able to resuscitate Jessica.  Emma was given the heartbreaking news by husband Paul that one of her girls hadn’t made it. She said: “It was amazing to find out that I was going to have twins as I’d always wanted them. “But I felt weird for four weeks after I found out I was pregnant, which was very, very early. “The pregnancy felt dferent and all along I was panicking that something was wrong. “During the c-section it was very scary, my husband wasnt even allowed in. “Straight away afterwards I asked himshe was OK. “Paul looked at me and said that they’d saved Bella but couldn’t save Jessica. “Being told that she was gone was terrible, it felt like it wasnt real and that I was in a nightmare. “It’s the strangest feeling. You have all the joy of a newborn but also the devastation of the loss of a newborn. “I was in shock for a long time.” After hearing the tragic news, the couple were moved to a bereavement suite in the hospital with a cold cot.  Emma and Paul were able to spend a precious fortnight visiting their daughter every day, spending time with her and taking her for walks in the hospital grounds. They even introduced Jessica to twin sister Bella while she was still in an incubator, placing the two of them side-by-side. The couple were also able to introduce their other children, brothers Jack, five, and Mikey, four, and sister Nicole, two, to their baby sister. During the second week, nurses allowed Emma and Paul to place Jessica in a Moses basket in the hospital mortuary in order to prevent her skin from deteriorating. Emma said: “We kept in her a Moses basket in the mortuary so she wouldn’t turn blue. “The staff were amazing, they were all specially trained and tried to give us as many opportunities as possible to make memories with her. “They gave us much as time as we wanted. “We brought Jack in to meet her.  “Jack is very grown up but I don’t really think he understood that I was in hospital. “I told him that Bella and Jessica had come early and then explained to him that she’d gone to heaven. “He got upset and then he held her, cuddled her and played with her hands and feet. It was beautul to see. “We werent sure about the other kids and the midwe said to bring them to play near her “It was lovely, the kids played and ran around her and leaned in and looked on her.” Two weeks after her birth, the couple dressed Jessica for the final time before her cremation. Emma and Paul picked out a special gown for their baby girl and washed her. Emma said: “I washed her skin and her hair and it was like washing any other of my children.  “We took some pics of Jessica and Bella together and then the woman from the funeral director came to collect her. “It felt complete putting them together when I got to hold both of them. It felt right.” The couple have placed Jessica’s ashes in their bedroom and said she’s in their thoughts constantly. They have also had all of their children photographed with their sisters urn and are even going to buy her a stocking this Christmas. Emma also thinks Jessica died in order to save her sister Bella due to Jessicas ruptured umbilical causing Emma to go into labour early. Without this, Bellas deteriorating umbilical cord would not have been found by doctors and she may have died too.  Emma said: “Not a day goes by when I don’t think about her. “We include her in everything that we do because we want to keep her memory alive. “We want to keep her included in everything. “Jessica gave Bella le and we see so much of her in Bella. Whenever I see Bella I see Jessica as well.” "},{"url":null,"title":"how cash strapped single mum","story":"NewsHow cash-strapped single mum-of-three turned £ into £MILLION businessKat Spencer, was struggling financially while looking after her three children - but an online advert changed her le and fortunesShareCommentsByErin Cardf:,  DEC NewsThe £ investment has changed Kats le \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum-of-three has revealed her incredible rags to riches tale of how she turned a pound investment into a poundmillion business. Just six years ago, Kat Spencer, , was a single mother, struggling to provide for her sons Ethan, , Harrison, , and Luke, . However, her le changed when she forked out a tenner on a selling kit from Gumtree - and she hasnt looked back since.She now enjoys the trappings of wealth - including exotic holidays - and is set to marry fianceacute Michael Knox, , in . Kat says everything changed for her when she spotted an advert about becoming a consultant for The Body Shop At Home- which involved selling products from home.   Incredibly, since parting with the pound needed in  for a starter kit, the mum, of Aghalee, Northern Ireland, says she is on track for a poundmillion year. She said: “Back then, pound was a lot to me. I didn’t have much at all, I was a single mum, starting from scratch with my three boys. “Still, I decided to go for it and haven’t looked back since. “It’s amazing to be able to support my sons and show them the stronger side of me. It’s instilled that work ethic in them, too.My eldest even tells me he wants to start his own business, just like his mum.” Coming from a business-owning family, Kat has always had an entrepreneurial streak - training as a beauty therapist at  and going on to open a salon two years later. Taking a career break in her twenties after becoming a mum, when her sons were a bit older, her mind turned to her work again.  And when she was around , through a mother and baby group, she heard about direct selling – a method of marketing that targets customers directly in their homes. “I was more or less a full-time mum, but I started doing that on the side for a bit of extra money,” she said. But it was not until March , when The Body Shop launched in Northern Ireland, that Kat says her sales career really took off. Divorced from her childrens father and struggling financially, it was completely by chance that she spotted a post on classied advertisement website Gumtree asking people to sign up as TBSAH consultants. Deciding after much soul-searching to take the plunge - parting with the pound needed for her starter kit, which included around pound of products, brochures and order forms - she set to work. “It was things you can sell with no experience – all their bestsellers which speak for themselves,” she said. “I still remember the kit coming through the post, all wrapped up like a Christmas present.  “The pound I paid was a special offer, so the kit is usually pound, but it’s still worth every penny.It’s not like you sign your le away, and nobody is asking you to quit your day job tomorrow, but you can be your own boss, work when you want and build your very own business.” With her business head firmly in gear, Kat began to organise parties, visiting customers’ homes and demonstrating products, before taking orders. She added: “Once I’d gathered feedback from my friends and family about the products, showcasing them from my kitchen table, I started organising parties. “I’d do themed ones – things like skincare parties, spa parties, even Christmas parties. “I’d lay on fizz and nibbles, too. It’s such a fun girly night in.” Making more and more money through selling, Kat then added to her kit by ordering extra products before turning her attention to recruiting consultants, in order to earn a cash bonus.  Within just four months, she says she had built up a team of seven, which then allowed her to qualy as an area manager for The Body Shop - within two more months, overseeing four managers, working under her. “The beginning was all a bit of a roller coaster, learning the ropes and how it all worked,” she said.“But, as I started that second year with The Body Shop, it was amazing to look back on how far I’d come. “I’d gone from worrying about how to provide for my boys and having to start all over again from scratch, to suddenly having this money coming in. “I could finally treat my family and do things like decorate my house -whereas before, I’d barely even had any furniture.” But in , Kats beloved dad was diagnosed with dementia and she juggled caring for him with raising her children and signing up  new recruits to her business.  Despite being frantically busy, her calm demeanour under pressure caught the attention of The Body Shop bosses. “They told me thatI could handle all that, I could handle anything,” she said. “They’d been looking for someone at the time to look after the whole of Northern Ireland and ended up choosing me.” Since then, Kat has gone from strength to strength.She now looks after a team of almost  consultants, and has just received the news that, by the end of the year, the business will be worth around poundmillion through retail sales. Her le is now unrecognisable from her early days post-orce. As well as cash bonuses, she has also enjoyed lavish incentive holidays to places like Thailand and Mauritius. “I want to keep building and make even more next year,” she smiled, adding that she hopes to use the money she has earned to get on the property ladder in  and start planning her  wedding.   “It’s amazing to be able to bring other people into this, too, and give them a shot at a better quality of le for their families, she said.“I literally started from scratch and now here I am, able to see all these amazing business women. “It’s especially helpful for mums to be able to work for themselves, as you don’t have to shell out for childcare. “But this is for people from all walks of le, from students to retirees. Evenyou’re just making pound extra a week in your pocket, every little helps – but stick with it and the results can be phenomenal.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kids upset after christian charity","story":"NewsPupils made to smash chocolate Santas in assembly where kids as young as  were told hes not realEmily Taylor of The Mary Bass Charity is also said to have asked pupils at Fleet Wood Lane Primary in Lincolnshire to smash up chocolate SantasShareCommentsByLaura ForsythLouie Smith:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsEmily Taylor of the Mary Bass Charity also invited a youngster to smash up a chocolate Santa \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrimary school pupils were left upset after a Christian charity worker told them Santa was not real during an assembly.

But Ms Taylor stunned pupils at Fleet Wood Lane Primary in Lincolnshire while giving a speech in the school hall, after telling them Father Christmas does not exist. She even invited two girls to smash chocolate Santas and reindeer with hammers in front of their classmates. School bosses have apologised for the inappropriate assembly and say the charity involved will never be invited back.  One parent, Ella Bowring said: I was asking my six-year-old this eveninghe was planning to write a letter to Santa. He said there is no such thing as Santa, he is just a made up thing...

The bizarre assembly took place last Thursday and many parents have told how their children ed home from school saying they no longer believed in Santa. Fleet Wood Lane, which does not have a religious denomination, has apologised for what happened. Head teacher Mrs Rachael Cotton said: “We have apologised to parents and children and totally sympathise with their concerns. I have written to parents stating that some of the presentation by the Mary Bass Charity in a school assembly was inappropriate and assured them that we will not be using representatives from this charity again.  The school’s senior leadership team and the chair of governors met with a church representative to discuss concerns. The letter continues: I have spoken to the children today to help them understand the theme of the assembly in an appropriate way and apologised for how some of it was delivered. “We discussed our core values of respect and tolerance and how parts of the assembly did not uphold those beliefs.” The school, was praised in its last Ofsted report, which was published in January. The Mary Bass Charity, based in Peterborough, carries out its work across seven parishes in the local area. A spokesman for the charity said: “The Trustees will be meeting before Christmas to discuss the situation.” The furore comes as the school is due to have a long planned Santa’s Grotto in school yesterday. Mrs Cotton added: “The children are really looking forward to meeting Santa in his grotto organised by our wonderfully supportive PTA. “We have so many exciting plans to make Christmas magical for the children this year as we do every year.

Brave Leah Smith is repeatedly losing the use of her arms and legs and feels constant numbness in her tongue, mouth and nose. The -year-old, from Prestatyn, Wales, can’t even support her own head or turn it without losing movement in another part of her body. She says she now fears for her le most days as her heart struggles toproperly and her breathing is deteriorating by the week. “To fear for your le on a daily basis rocks you to your core, it strips your security, your mental health, your personality, your relationships and so much more, she told Wales Online. “I don’t know who I am anymore. I’m in a big and scary mess.”  Leah’s problems all began in February  when she started experiencing stroke-like symptoms. She called her mum who dialled  for an ambulance to take her to Ysbyty Glan Clwyd in Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire, Wales. “I was alright sat in AE and the symptoms went away,” she added. “They kept me in overnight and ordered a brain MRI to see whether I had multiple sclerosis.” Leah was discharged, but needed repeated visits to the hospital over the next few weeks as new symptoms began to emerge. “My legs would go from underneath me and I would get numbness in my ribs,” she added. “Then one day I ended up being admitted because I lost the ability to swallow. That was incredibly scary.”  After taking high doses of steroids, Leah said she began to suffer with terrying hallucinations, seeing “evil zombie faces” wherever she went. And following a lumbar puncture which took fluid out of her spine, she said her condition took another turn for the worse and left her unable to stand up. Doctors diagnosed her with cervical cord compression, spinal fluid leak and, according to a private neuroradiologist, a condition which causes instability of the spine called AAI. “AAI can’t be dealt with in Wales and potentially not the UK at all,” Leah told Wales Online.“It requires dangerous surgery that takes an experienced - and probably crazy - surgeon to undertake. “I’ve come so far on this journey already and there’s no way I’m giving up now. “My children deserve more than a mummy who’s just about existing.” Leah, whose children are now being looked after by her ex-husband and her family, has to permanently lie down as the pain in her head is too severe when she sits up.  “You can’t even call it a headache. It’s the worst head pain you can imagine,” she added. “It feels like my brain is being pulled every time I’m not lying down.” She has now set up a GoFundMe page in a bid to get more private appointments and to find out more about her debilitating conditions. She believes a specialist team in Barcelona, Spain, may be able to help with her AAI. I’m  years old with no medical training, yet I find myself having to be my own doctor, my own researcher, she said. I have to work out what scans, what specialists, who might be able to help, what move to make next and in what order while being as accurate with funds as possible so as not to waste any money that will hold up the next needed appointment.

Billie said: My lips swelled that big within half an hour of the beautician leaving, they looked like they were going to pop. My top lip was a lot bigger while my bottom lip was touching my chin - I looked like The Elephant Man. My lips were stinging and felt really sore from the stretching, I felt like crying as my neck, jaw and throat were hurting too. She claims Belissimo Rivington Aesthetics told her the reaction was too fast for it to have been caused by the filler, and insisted she must have been allergic to the numbing cream applied beforehand.  But she fiercely disputed the cosmetic companys reasoning, pointing out that she had used numbing cream in the past for her tattoos and other lip fillers. I messaged [the beautician] the pictures and she said shed never seen anything like that before, suggested I may have been allergic to the numbing cream and advised me to go to hospital, said Billie, an axillary nurse. My mum looked after my little girl who was two at the time while I went to hospital, as I was putting her in the car she was a bit scared and just stared at me. I went to AE with my hands over my face. When the receptionist asked what was wrong I couldnt talk so just showed her. I was really upset when I was checked out by the doctor as he told me he couldnt promise that it would go down, I thought I was going to be stuck like that forever.  Belissimo Rivington Aesthetics said there is always a risk that a client could suffer an allergic reaction to dermal fillers and that it always makes sure the client is aware of this before undergoing treatment.It added that it takes its clients health very seriously.The lip filler procedure was on offer and advertised on Facebook. Administered by the mum and daughter team from Belissimo Rivington Aesthetics, the treatment cost just pound - nearly half the price of the average clinic charge. But Billie said her lips quickly began swelling up.She said: I had really thin lips and had tried lip-plumping lip gloss with no luck. A lot of young people have lip fillers, like people on Geordie Shore, I just wanted to plump them up a bit.I saw someone had shared an offer shared on Facebook post, she came to my house did it in the living room while I was lying down on the sofa.  She added: She wore gloves, I signed a consent form and she put the numbing cream on. She did the top lip first and my eyes were streaming. After they were done I put Vaseline on my lips and was told thatthere was any swelling I could use hot and cold flannels. The next day the skin was peeling from my lips as they arent meant to be that big. When Ive shown friends the pictures, at first they think theyre fake. Billie claimed that within  minutes of her having the filler, her lips ballooned and began to hurt. After a seven-hour stay at Bolton Hospitals AE, she was given a steroid injection and a course of painkillers. When she woke up the next morning, Billie was relieved to discover her lips werent as big as the night before but she still experienced some facial swelling. She claimed: When I was in hospital I started to see them going down and when they went down fully they went back really thin, it was like Id never had them done. After all that, the filler didnt even stay.I got up to go to work the next day and noticed my lips had gone down but my cheeks still looked like a hamster.  All the skin was peeling as lips arent meant to be that big. I ended up getting what looked and felt like cold sores and blisters - they were tingling and itching. The mum has since got her lips filled again, but this time, she said it all went to plan. Billie said: It was a risk getting my lips done again, but I knew it wasnt the numbing cream as Ive had it before with my tattoos. I went to a clinic and showed them pictures of what had happened before, they couldnt believe it. Billie had the original procedure in January  and is sharing her ordeal now to urge people to do their research before going under the needle. A spokesperson for Belissimo Rivington Aesthetics said: There is always a risk that a client could suffer an allergic reaction to dermal fillers, this can happen once and may never happen again. We always make sure the client is aware of this before treatment and clients do sign a dermal filler consent form. At Belissimo Rivington we take the health of our clients very seriously. Prior to any treatment being carried out, our clients are made fully aware of any possible risks or side effects that might occur.  Each client is made to acknowledge this by signing an informed consent form, along with a liability waver. All clients therefor take responsibility for any adverse side effects where they may be unfortunate enough to suffer from. As such, Ms Roocroft was well aware of the possible risks and accepted liability for them prior to her treatment. Co-founder of The Plastic Surgery Group and member of The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic SurgeonsDan Marsh said: Lip fillers dont have to be prescribed, were [BAAPS] lobbying the government to try and change the rules so they do have to be prescribed. People giving them are not trained to deal with any complications that can arise so thats the reason that you should have it done by a medical profession who has all the equipment with them that can treat any problem. If you dont treat people quickly and appropriately it can be catastrophic. Its terrible that people who are not trained are just allowed to just inject filler into the face. You wouldnt go to just anyone to have a vaccination jab or your insulin injection, you would want to go to someone whos trained to know what theyre doing.

Tests revealed brunette ex Page  girl Peers - who appears as a soccerette on TVs Soccer AM and was in the top  sexiest babes for former lads magazine Nuts - was  points over the alcohol limit. She claimed to have drunk two bottles of beer before getting behind the wheel. At Manchester magistrates court, Peers, of Swinton, near Salford admitted driving with excess alcohol and breach of a lane closure - but she pleaded for clemency saying she was having to embark on a new career as her modelling work was drying up. The pin-up girl previously enjoyed a successful career - and once deemed to have the best boobs in Britain in a study.   According to The Sun, Dr Patrick Mallucci, one of Britain’s most famous cosmetic surgeons, found her boobs to be the best of the UK in a study called The Perfect Breast.

The am incident occurred on November  this year after Peers who had been out with friends was driving home along the M when she was spotted at Junction  at Salford. David Morgan, prosecuting, said: “Two lanes were closed and an electronic sign directed drivers that the lanes were closed. A police vehicle was in attendance and had its lights flashing and in those lanes themselves road workers were carrying out work on them.  “But the defendant was seen driving into the lanes by police officers who pulled her over and she admitted she had consumed some alcohol. “She told officer she had consumed two bottles of beer before driving the vehicle. The police officers conducted a roadside breath test, which she failed and she was driven to custody. She has never been convicted before, she has never been before the courts before.”   Tests showed Peers had  micrograms of alcohol in  millilitres of breath. The legal limit is mg Her lawyer Stephen Connor said: “This is a sad day for the defendant. She has no convictions against her, she is  and entered a timely guilty plea, and sadly now has lost her good character. “This lady cooperated fully with police both at the road side and the police station. She confirms to me she consumed two bottles of beer and she thought she was OK to drive that day. This was not a particularly high reading.  “She told the officer she saw other people doing the same thing, and it was being pulled over for the road side breath test which brought her before this court. “She has a genuine level of remorse. This has been an unpleasant experience for her as well as going to the police station. This has been a a dficult lesson for her to learn and one she has learned. “She comes before this court expressing genuine remorse, which is clear today from her guilty plea at the earliest opportunity.   “She is a self employed model, but work is drying up and she is struggling. She is currently undertaking a makeup course and will be self employed in that venture. “The loss of her license is inevitable and will dramatically affect her course and job opportunities. This was not a high reading. I ask you to be as lenient as possible.” Sentencing her JPs said: “The drink drive rule is there for a purpose as you know.

But fortunately, the surgery was a success.Little Alexander and Harris managed to reach  weeks and, despite being born prematurely just five days later, are now adorable tots. Their parents, from Surrey, have shared their story ahead of World TTTSAwareness Day tomorrow.They are warning parents of identical twins not to be afraid to challenge the care being giventhey suspect the le-threatening condition.“Dont be afraid to speak up about the care, especiallyit falls below the standards set out by NICE and Tamba, said Duncan, referring to the UK charity, Twins And Multiple Births Association.And dont feel afraid to seek support from other parents who have been through TTTS. We feel very lucky to have received the care that we did.Angelina was  weeks pregnant when she was diagnosed with Stage  TTTS, which affects the flow of blood from the placenta to each baby. The condition means one twin - the recipient - receives too much blood, with the higher blood volume putting a strain on their heart. Meanwhile, the other twin - the donor - receives too little blood. This baby often becomes smaller and anaemic - and can suffer from a reduced amount of amniotic fluid, according to Tamba.The condition is potentially fatal, leaving both babies at risk.Angelina was monitored and she and Duncan enjoyed some normality - but by  weeks, the TTTS was found to have progressed. It was just hours before this scan, while driving, that the concerned mum-to-be had felt something wrong with her bump. She recalled: “It felt swollen and hard but also uneven making me almost hunch over which looking back was obviously the result of one of the twins having too much fluid around him. “My advice to all expectant twin mums is to keep an eye on your bump and get these things checked. We were lucky we had a scan the next morning,we didn’t it could have been a very dferent outcome.” The scan revealed one twin had no visible bladder and was stuck due to having no fluid around him, while the other had an enlarged heart due to the strain of the additional fluid.  The couple were told that without surgery they would lose both boys. And even after the procedure, they could still lose them.“I was absolutely devastated and terried. I felt a failure as a mother because my body wasn’t protecting them like it should,” said Angelina. “We’d read all the statistics about survival rates and felt so scared and nervous for the future of our unborn children. “But then reading all the information on the Tamba website really helped us and helped me stay away from the general Internet too much.” The surgery, carried out by Dr Asma Khalil at St Georges, went well. However, the worried couple were repeatedly warned that the twin left with a small placenta share may not make it. They lived in constant fear at each follow-up scan. Not long after, they celebrated reaching  weeks, knowing that one of the twins was now more than lb and the chance of survival was increasing day by day. But just five days later, Alexander and Harris arrived into the world via emergency C-section as Angelina suffered a placenta abruption and lost more than a litre of blood. The boys were in hospital for  days in total. They came out at what would have been  weeks gestation.  Duncan said: “We had many ups and downs during our stay including Alex getting very poorly with e-coli and needing ROP surgery, as well as many transfusions and Alex on and off oxygen.“Our care was split between St Peter’s in Chertsey, which we were lucky is the highest level neonatal intensive care unit in Surrey, and St George’s in London where the surgery took place. “The best thing St Peters did was to know where their knowledge finished and when it was right for us to referred to the specialists at St Georges. “This was NHS care at its best as consultants at both hospitals were amazing at treating the boys and at ensuring we were both OK and took the time to answer the many questions we both had. But he claimed: We know this isn’t always the case which is why Tamba’s research and QI programmes are so important. What is TTTS Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndromeis a rare condition that occurs in about  to  per cent of identical twin pregnancies. If left untreated,  per cent of these babies will die, Tamba says. And even with treatment, there is only up to a  per cent chance of both babies surviving.Of those that do survive, there is a chance they will suffer from a disability or health condition. Tamba says: TTTS occurs when there is an imbalance of blood supply from the placenta to the twin babies.One baby receives less bloodand often becomes smaller and anaemic. They can also suffer from a reduced amount of amniotic fluid and become stuck to the side of the womb.The twin who receives more bloodbecomes bigger and the higher blood volume puts a strain on their heart. The charity adds: A common way to help treat TTTS is laser ablation.This is where a camera and laser are inserted into the womb and some of the shared blood vessels are coagulated using the laser. After this surgery, excess amniotic fluid in the recipient twin’s sac is also removed to achieve a normal volume. Only a handful of clinicians across the UK are able to perform laser ablation surgery on twins as it is a highly specialised procedure. Tamba’s TTTS Registry, set up in , helps specialists learn more about the potentially deadly condition. The charity is raising money to fund vital research. To donate to the cause, click here.

John Ellis, , downed two bottles of wine before passing out in a bedroom where the boy was asleep. But when a woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, tried to get into the bed Ellis punched her. The woman fled but ed with her phone set to record over fears the brute could strike again. A further argument broke out which saw Ellis repeatedly punch her before he picked up the basket and threw it with the child inside. It landed on the bed but the force caused the youngster to fall to the floor as the woman screamed for him to stop. As she tried to help the baby, she was punched again and fell on top of the baby who was left with bruising on the head. Door salesman Ellis, of East Kilbride, Lanarkshire, appeared at Hamilton Sherf Court and admitted assaulting the woman and the baby at his home in March this year. He was jailed for two years by Sherf Daniel Kelly QC who told him it would have been longer had he not pled guilty. Depute fiscal Paula Russell said: Throughout the course of the night two bottles of wine were consumed and he became intoxicated. He retired to bed and was later joined by the woman who made efforts to get into bed but couldnt because of the position the accused had fallen asleep in. She made several attempts to move him but he remained asleep and eventually she lay on the edge of the bed at which time he sat upright and punched her once on the left eye. She left the bedroom but when she ed she was fearful of the accused and placed her phone on record.  A shocking audio recording of the incident where the woman could be heard repeatedly asking him to stop hitting her before she became hysterical as the baby was thrown across the room was played in court. Miss Russell continued: There was some disagreement between the pair which escalated and he stood up and began to punch her repeatedly on the head. When he stopped he picked up the Moses basket containing the baby and threw it across the room. It landed on the bed but the basket tipped over and the baby fell to the floor. He then proceeded to punch her again as she tried to get to the baby causing her to fall on the child. When with police, the accused asked why are you even here, it was just an argument, it was a bad argument to be fair and he was cautioned and charged. Tom Watters, defending, said: The room was taken up almost entirely by the double bed and the Moses basket was between it and the wall when he picked it up and threw it no more than a foot. That caused it to fall and the baby came out of it and it is perhaps fortunate that the baby did not require any medical treatment. But nothing is lost on him on the seriousness of what happened and he knows his behaviour cannot be excused. When he heard the recording in my office he asked for it to be stopped. Sherf Kelly said: The charge you have pled guilty to is a very serious one and while there may have been a disagreement between you and her as she came to bed, it is unthinkable that this could develop and involve a -week-old child. Your actions that night took it out on him and clearly he deserves protection. You have no record for crimes of violence but it does seem that there is no alternative to a custodial sentence for what on any view is a very unfortunate incident. An allegation the baby had been injured to the danger of its le was deleted by prosecutors.

Our main image shows a floating  of bottles, branches, tin, and barrels clogging up Salford Quays, yards from a sports centre where children and adults regularly go boating. Another shows a swan – head down, feathers back – swimming through a filthy flotsam of discarded plastics plaguing the River Lea in Bow, East London. But these are just a couple of examples of how our canals, lakes and rivers are becoming the shycountry’s dumping ground.   They are blighted by the deluge of plastic bottles simply thrown away before joining the estimated eight million tonnes of plastic entering the ocean each year. Today the Daily Mirror has joined forces with environmental charity Hubbub to give you the chance to make a dference to your area and to quash the myth that plastic can’t be recycled. Thanks to a vessel built by the Queen’s boat maker from % recycled plastic, community groups will be able to clean up canals, rivers and lakes through “plastic fishing trips”. This is funded by the p charge from disposable coffee cups at Starbucks introduced in July.   Trewin Restorick, chief executive and founder of Hubbub, said: “We all know plastic is a threat to our oceans but the issue can often start much closer to home. “Some % of plastic in our oceans is from land, and shockingly has been found in fish we eat such as mussels and mackerel. “Rubbish blights rivers and canals across the UK and is being eaten by birds, fish and other species, harming wildle and entering the food chain. “Not only have we got to change consumer behaviour, we need to create infrastructure to recycle all the plastics we produce. “Hopefully projects like this can show it is possible.”   Last year Hubbub launched the world’s first % recycled plastic boat, called Poly-Mer, made from , plastic water bottles. Parent Christine Armstrong at Canary Wharf College, East London, had heard about the activities of a Dutch organisation called Plastic Whale, which cleans up Amsterdam’s canals. College principal Sarah Counter adapted the idea and encouraged her students to clean up their area. Inspired by their story, Hubbub collected , plastic bottles from cycling event Ride London and set out to make the world’s first shyrecycled plastic boat. Since then they have taken more than , people “fishing” in London’s Docklands, collecting more than , plastic bottles and generating nearly pound, in shydonations for the college. These bottles will be turned into a new boat, which will be given to the winner of a competition, details of which are below. After the plastic has been collected it is sent to a factory in Dumfries, shyScotland, where it is shredded, washed and melted down before it is reshaped into plaswood – planks made up of shyrecycled plastic. Craig Gamble said: “Plaswood allows dferent types of plastics to be recycled. It is waterproof and it can be recycled again when it reaches the end of its le.” From here the planks will be sent to maverick boat maker Mark Edward, who built the Queen’s barge in , at his workshop in Richmond, South West London. “There is a real lack of dignity in recycled plastics and that really needs to change,” he explained. “It’s been a challenge to turn these plastic planks into a shypractical punt. I’ve had to forget shytraditional techniques and search on Google for shyadhesives. “But the durability of this plastic outlives timber, which requires protection and maintenance, whereas plastic requires virtually none.” Trewin added: “We’re hoping to see a range of inspiring entries, from schools to local businesses. “If you want to make a positive dference to your local environment, simply enter.” Robert Lynch, of Starbucks, said: “Reducing our impact on the shyenvironment has always been incredibly important to us – whether it’s incorporating it into the way our business operates, looking at the materials we use or making it easy for our customers to reuse or recycle. “That is why we are so pleased to be able to support this project through money that has been donated from the p charge we levy on disposable coffee cups. “We encourage everyone who wants to help clean up their local river or canal to enter. By working together, we can make a bigger impact. Good luck.” From bottle to boat . Plastic bottles dumped into the waterways are collected. . The bottles are sent to a factory in Dumfries, Scotland, where they are shredded, washed and melted down, then reshaped into plaswood planks. . They are sent to boat maker Mark Edwards in Richmond, South West London, where they are made into a punt. . Boat is launched for school trips and corporate team-building days to collect more plastic. How you can enter We want to hear from local community groups, schools or clean-up volunteers who believe having the new boat will make a huge impact on their area – and to see your photographs. The competition is open from now until midnight on January , .

Butyoure one of the millions of us who struggle to hold back from the temptations of the festive season, you should also be applying some to your wrists. Thats the verdict of leading psychologist Jo Hemmings. Jo - who is a regular on TV shows including ITV’s Good Morning Britain and This Morning - reckons a chilly dab can be the perfect foil to our biggest festive desires. She explains: The reward centre sends out an initial positive message when we give in to these cravings and so it becomes incredibly dficult to resist.  One idea is to rub a few drops of iced water into your wrists - especiallyyou are beginning to feel jittery - as its known to reduce the temptation! Jo was giving her top tips for not giving in to temptation over the busy Christmas period - and speaking in particular about avoiding the urge for cigarettes. As the festive season approaches, it can feel increasingly dficult to go smoke-free or stay on trackyou have recently decided to give up smoking. There are many ways to give up smoking cigarettes - here are some suggestions to try and personal stories to watch for inspiration... QuitWillpower – many smokers succeed in quitting smoking by willpower alone. For inspiration on using willpower, check out Helenas story here. Cessation products include patches, gum or tablets – you can buy many over the counter but some are only available with a prescription from your doctor. For inspiration on using cessation products, check out Teris story here.Switch Switching to a smoke-free alternative is a route that millions of smokers have already used to give up smoking for good. There are more alternatives than ever before.Click here to see Kathleens story. Click here to see Vaughans story. But fear not! Below, Jo has given five key strategies you can put in place that will help you cope with the increased pressure of picking up a cigarette during the upcoming festive period...  - Make a ‘goal focused’ plan Jo says: Reward yourself with a small treatyou give up for a week, then another after a month and perhaps a big one, maybe a holiday or break away,you manage six months or a year. Holdmylight is a new and exciting approach to help smokers give up cigarettes for a month with the added help of incentives from friends. Its ideal for those looking to create a goal focused plan.  - Avoid triggers Jo says: There are definite trigger points that reduce our resistance and willpower, so often the key is to either adopt coping mechanisms that will make those situations a little easier to deal with or change your habits and create a new routine. Triggers can range from smoking shelters and too much alcohol to simply surrounding yourself with friends who smoke. When friends or family go outside for a cigarette, have an escape route planned. For example, call a friend or go to the loo to top up your make-up and break that routine of heading to the designated smoking spot. It’s also not the easiest time of year to regulate your alcohol intake, but given that booze is the number one reason people succumb to having a cigarette, it’s worth monitoring your drinking, by maybe having a soft drink between glasses of your tipple, to help keep your resolve. Your head might thank you for it in the morning too! - Quit together with a smoker friend  Its been well documented that one-to-one support is the most popular tool for quitting smoking.* Jo says positive moral support from family and friends can be invaluable and feels having someone gently encouraging in a non- judgmental manner, will be incredibly beneficial through the Christmas period. The Hold My Light campaign is centred around enrolling friends, family or colleagues to help you give up cigarettes and provides smokers with a choice of ways to go smoke-free. More information can be found on the Hold My Light website. Hold My Light has been designed to break down a big challenge into more manageable steps – maximising your chances of going smoke-free.Decide – to go smoke-free for  days Choose – your best way to give up cigarettes Start – Hold My Light and ask your friends to help Stay – on track and enjoy your successVisit Holdmylight for more information Jo says: Those words of encouragement and ongoing empathetic support, especially from former smokers, really help, as it resonates with those trying to give up cigarettes, as they know their supporter has been in the same position and succeeded. With support from those around you, you can go completely smoke-free either through sheer willpower or by using smoking cessation aids such as nicotine patches and gums.  - Get rid of all smoking paraphernalia Jo says: Throw out all of your lighters, old packets of cigarettes and ashtrays. If you’re struggling to stay smoke-free even after your attempts to quit using willpower or cessation products, look for smoke-free alternatives.  - And dont be afraid to say no to invites If you have to turn down a few party invites over Christmas to make going smoke-free a little easier, then do it. You are not being a party-pooper and can go to them next year when they will feel much more manageable.

Silverfish are ancient bugs which survive by eating pretty much everything, but they particularly like to tuck into dead skin cells and hair. They thrive in moist and damp conditions, which means homes across the UK face the risk of an invasion this winter as it gets wetter outside and we crank the heating up. The little bugs, which can jump up to two feet and live for eight years, have also been known to eat through wallpaper, books, curtains and cereal boxes. Leading property maintenance expert Ranjen Gohri, from | Home Rescue, said: Silverfish are actually the oldest known pests on earth.  Andyoure spotting tiny holes in your clothes or curtains, you might have an infestation without even realising it. Theyll eat anything. But skin cells are a delicacy to silverfish. And they like to leave their calling card - in the shape of tiny yellow stains wherever theyve been. As we dont tend to open windows and doors during the colder months, moisture from cooking, showering and drying clothes indoors cant escape. But thankfully the team at | Home Rescue have some advice on how to keep them away from your home. How to spot them There are a few easy to spot signs that you might have silverfish in your homw. Ranjen says: Theyre quite secretive, but you may see them scurrying away in the middle of the night when youre making a loo visit. Keep your eyes peeled. You might also see droppings that look like smell pepper corns or pellets, or holes in your wallpaper, books or clothes. You might also find their shedded skin. Yes, throughout their long le they shed their skin - especially when going through adolescence. How to avoid getting them There are a few things you can do to keep your home free of the little bugs.  These include: Keep a clean home Ensure there are no food residues. Daily cleaning to keep on top of things and then a weekly good going over means silverfish wont have a good reason to stick around. Keep dust off books, and keep the bathroom floor mopped so theres no dead skins cells around. Chuck out your old newspapers mags so youre not leaving them things to chomp at. Make your own repellent You can make a homemade cleaner using equal parts of vinegar and water, plus a squirt of washing up liquid, then add  drops of peppermint oil and eucalyptus oil. That should have them turning away. Make a honey trap or use salt You can make a mixture using equal parts of baking soda and honey. Place the mixture on a piece of cardboard and put the cardboard in places youve seen silverfish.  The creatures also love salt but it causes dehydration so will kill them. Sprinkle it in areas where you have spotted them. Try garlic and essential oils They hate the smell of garlic, lemon, lavender, basic and oranges.Fix leaky pipes and taps Theyre not called silverfish for nothing. Leaks are magnets to them so do regular checks on taps and pipping throughout your home. Get a dehumidier If you house is damp, a dehumidier can keep the moisture down. But you should also have a damp house thoroughly checked as damp can cause a number of health issues. Have food on lockdown Keep everything in sealed containers. Silverfish have a penchant for pastas and cereals especially. Put cinnamon in your draws and cupboards too, it acts as a deterrent.

Bakhtiyer Sindrov suffered serious burns when a blaze broke out at his familys home in Uzbekistan when he was a baby. This Christmas he has asked asked Santa to give him a new face so that he could be like other children and go to school. The tragic young boy - now living in Talgar in south-eastern Kazakhstan - cannot write yet so he dictated the letter to his dad. The letter was sent to a charitable organisation in the city of Almaty in Kazakhstan which is holding a Facebook charity campaign called Letters To Santa. The boy wrote: Hello Father Christmas! I was burned when I was a little boy. I lost my face in the fire and since then I have to hide from people because they are scared of me.  I am scared of myself when I am looking in the mirror. I do not have a nose, ears or hair. My mum says that I will not go to school. I am often in pain, but I do not cry. My mother does. Father Christmas, give me a new face, please, I will never cry in my le then. I just want to be like other children.  Over the last year, Bakhtiyer has received medical treatment at the MedIndia clinic in India. Reconstructive surgery has given the boy new lips, teeth and eyelids. In July this year, doctors inserted implants into the boys neck to stretch his skin. His neck skin will be used to replace his facial skin that had been completely burned off. Bakhtiyer will undergo surgery in late December this year.  He is from a poor family and his treatment started several years after the blaze when the NGO learned about his situation by chance. Bakhtiyer was a baby sleeping in his cot beside the fireplace when a blaze broke out and caused the terrible injuries. For several years he could not open his mouth and he was fed through a tube that caused his teeth to rot.  Family friend Olga Ryabeva, who helps to raise funds for the boys treatment in India, said: He was very little when his face, head, neck and shoulders got burned. He was basically melting alive. The boys face is so badly disfigured that his parents cover him with a blanket when they go out with him."},{"url":null,"title":"france riots children young 12","story":"NewsFrance riots: Children as young as  among  arrested at one high schoolFootage shows youngsters from the Lycée Saint-Exupéry, in Mante-la-Jolie - around  miles west of Paris - lined up kneeling on the floor with their hands behind their headShareByPeter AllenAbigail OLeary:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video child-rioters-young--among-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailChildren as young as  were arrested for rioting at just one high school in France as the country’s law and order crisis continued. Footage shows youngsters from the Lyceacutee Saint-Exupeacutery, in Mante-la-Jolie - where  were arrested - lined up kneeling on the floor with their hands behind their head. Others have their faces pressed up against a wall as police in riot gear guard the huge group. Some of the young hooded rioters were caught with heavy clubs, baseball bats, and teargas cannisters. Officers can be heard barking out instructions after telling the children that they all faced violent disorder charges including ‘participation in an armed crowd’.   All had allegedly taken part in a nationwide day of action aimed at blockading schools and colleges in opposition to reform of the education system, and in support of so-called Yellow Vest demonstrators. The Yellow Vests are named after the high visibility jackets all motorists have to carry in France, and their primary aim is to see petrol and diesel prices slashed. President Emmanuel Macron has dropped planned green taxes on fuel because of riots in cities such as Paris, but the Vests have pledged to carry on demonstrating. Cars and bins had been burnt at the Mante-la-Jolie school, and there had also been threats to burn it down, according to police. An Interior Ministry source said: Some  school pupils were arrested across France in connection with high school protests on Thursday.   The most arrests were at the Lyceacutee Saint-Exupeacutery in Mante-la-Jolie, where there were a total of  arrests of pupils born between  and . At one point the police ran out of handcuffs, before all the arrested pupils were taken to a ‘holding area’ near the school, before being transferred to nearby police stations. It is not known who shot the video at Mante-la-Jolie, but it will cause extreme embarrassment and shock to Mr Macron as he tries to deal with the mounting crisis. Nearly  schools were disrupted on Thursday,  of which were blocked, according to the Interior Ministry. There was widespread rioting in Paris last Saturday, with national monuments including the Arc de Triomphe vandalised and more than  people arrested. Now Mr Macron, whose popularity rating is currently just  per cent, has said: ‘We have reason to fear a great violence’ this coming Saturday.   Horrying images of French police beating up protesters have emerged, and these have inflamed an already hugely tense situation. Mr Macron’s prime minister, Edouard Philippe, said: What is at stake is the safety of the French people and our institutions. I call for responsibility. All the actors in the public debate – politicians, union leaders, journalists and citizens – will be accountable for their statements in the coming days. Social media is currently full of appeals for people to mass around the Champs Elysees in Paris on Saturday, so as to create disorder.

The woman, her husband, daughter, son and his girlfriend were enjoying champagne on their pleasure cruise when disaster struck. The luxury boat flipped over after being hit by a monstrous gust of wind as the group came in to the dock in Cape Town. Terried, the family and crew plunged into the icy water and desperately tried to swim to safety. But panic struck when they realised that the mum was missing. The family suddenly remembered that she had gone down to the galley shortly before the incident. In a remarkable act of bravery, the yacht skipper removed his le jacket and free-ed into the freezing water, finding the terried woman stuck inside an air pocket of the galley.   He instructed her to e down through the freezing water and guided her out through the galley doors and back up to the surface to his two waiting crew members. The petried mother was in agony with a broken shoulder and had to be helped and guided to safety through the choppy seas. The NSRI leboats based inside Cape Town harbour had been alerted and they launched two sea rescue craft Spirit of Day and Spirit of Vodacom who raced to the scene. They were backed up by the Cape Town Fire and Rescue Dive Unit and a Police Dive Unit and they found the five UK tourists and three crew safe on the upturned hull. The mother had suffered a fractured shoulder and two of the crewmen had suffered non-le threatening injuries. Waiting paramedics took them quickly to hospital. National Sea Rescue Institute spokesperson Craig Labinon said all eight of those on board suffered mild hypothermia as well, so all were taken to hospital for checks. Mr Labinon told how the catamaran skipper rescued the British mother-of-two. He told News: “She was trapped in the galley where water was rising as the cabin filled with water causing a fast diminishing air pocket that had provided some relief.  “From what we understand we believe the skipper of the catamaran free ed under the catamaran after she capsized and he was able to bring the mum up from below deck. “Eight persons – three local male crew members and five tourist passengers from the United Kingdom – were found on the upturned hull of the boats when we arrived. “All were wearing le jackets and they were rescued off the upturned hull and brought by the NSRI sea rescue craft to their base at the V  Waterfront for treatment”. The South African Maritime Safety Authority has been alerted and is investigating the cause of the accident to ensure that tourists using the sunset catamarans are safe. The daily trips and pound-a-head sunset cruises are popular with British tourists and whales and dolphins are often seen on the trip that heads out towards Robben Island. It capsized at .pm on Monday near the breakwater and was due to dock at pm as darkness fell.   Fellow sailors said they thought sailing in such strong winds was unwise. Tourism officials are assisting the UK family and the British Consulate was alerted to render assistance to their traumatised countrymen, the NSRI said. The catamaran was towed to nearby Granger Bay just outside the Port of Table Bay in the capsized position and it was anchored to await recovery, It is hoped that salvage experts will be able to right the catamaran. Kevin Knight, who owns the catamaran, told News that he was awaiting the outcome of the investigation and that their focus now was getting the boat out of the water. The boat operators did not comment and said they would release a statement at a later stage. NSRI Table Bay station commander Quentin Botha told the news station: “One female suffered a fractured shoulder in the ordeal and she is being treated for that in hospital. “They were bruised and shaken up by the catamaran ordeal but full of praise for the NSRI and the emergency services rapid response and subsequent after care” he said.

Rashed Sa Belhasa lives in the UAE, in a property so huge the family has to use a golf cart to get around the groundsAnd even more bizarre is that the billionaire family have their very own private zoo - with a number of animals named after celebrities that often frequent their home. The -year-old sneakerhead, showed off his unique house in a new documentary called The Worlds Weirdest Homes, which aired on Wednesday night. Presenter Charlie Luxton travels to destinations including Arizona in the US, Dubai and Rio de Janiero to discover a number of unique homes in the Channel  show, which included an interview with Rashed.  The super-rich teen is known as his name of Money Kicks on Instagram, an account which boasts over .million followers and showcases his extravagant lestyle. In the documentary he spoke of his aspirations to follow in his billionaire construction mogul father Sa Ahmed Belhasas footsteps by creating a fortune of his own. From the giant living room, a private zoo is visible which holds big cats such as lions, tigers, panthers, leopards and cheetahs, as well as giraffes and bears. A-List celebrities often visit the zoo - and the teen has even named some of the animals after his VIP guests. The animals have names like Versace the lion, Gucci and Dior the orangutans, giraffes called Bert and Ernie, Armani the chimp . Some of them are invited inside the mansion for snuggles on occasion.  Celebrity visitors include Mariah Carey, Ronaldo, Floyd Mayweather, Rihanna, Paris Hilton, and Jackie Chan - and all of them have animals named after them. When the filmmaker askedhe is the only child in the world with his own private zoo, Rashed replied: You could say that. I don’t like to show off. Rasheds father, billionaire UAE businessman Sa Ahmed Belhasa, owns over  exotic animals which he collected from other private zoos that were neglected. As the zoo is not open to the public, the family does not make a profit and he shut down any suggestions that the animals are mistreated. He said: We take care of all our animals. When I went to Kenya, I see a lot of lions dying because they eat once a month and here they eat every single day.   The fashion conscious teenager also owns a huge shoe collection with luxurious styles including limited edition Yeezys, Bapes and Air Jordans. All of which are kept away in bespoke cases, with the massive collection thought to be worth an estimated million . Rashed has a whole room in the mansion dedicated to his vast trainer collection.

However, Ms Short believes that as more of the Central Waterfront takes shape, the public will come round.“A lot of people didn’t like the VA when the construction first started – but then took to defending it,” she said.“There will be a time with these buildings, too, that people start to take ownership of them. I think as it all takes shape people will start to feel more comfortable with it.”Last month, the Tele revealed the council plans to invest £m in the hotel directly opposite the VA.

At times it was scrappy, Hamilton had a couple of opportunities as well which flew by the post, and shows games at this level are dficult to win but we got the breaks at the right times.“I thought in some of our play you could see a confidence appear when we got the second and third goal, we started to knock the ball about and created opportunities.“First and foremost we just wanted to win the game, it didn’t matter how but to score four goals was fantastic.

win at Dens Park against Premiership Dundee, where the Honest Men completely outplayed the top-flight side, and a - home win over a Dunfermline side that had started the campaign strongly, too.Then, however, came their own shuddering halt to the form that had seen them sweep almost all before them on September  at Palmerston.Queen of the South had enjoyed a fairly up-and-down beginning to the season and weren’t expected to be the first team to stop Ayr’s momentum.A first-half blitz, however, shocked the rest of the Championship as Queens rattled up a four-goal lead inspired by their main man Stephen Dobbie and his partner-in-crime Gary Harkins.A hat-trick inside  minutes had the Doonhamers cruising before Harkins curled in against his old side with  minutes on the clock.Dobbie added a fourth in the closing stages to seal victory and give the Honest Men their first real test of the campaign.Many expected the wheels to come off at that point, as has happened to plenty of teams before, and for the newly- promoted Honest Men to fall back down the table.That looked the case the following week, too, as Falkirk, under new boss Ray McKinnon, raced into a - lead within  minutes at Somerset Park.However, that’s where the rot stopped – something Dundee United will be keen to emulate this coming Saturday, though they’d prefer not to give hosts Morton a lead first.The second half saw Lawrence Shankland find the net before a quickfire double from Andy Geggan and a Leo Fasan own goal gave Ayr the kind of response Robbie Neilson is desperate for.From there, McCall’s side have lost just the once – to Ross County – and drawn with Queens and Morton to regain top spot in the table.And they more than cemented that on Friday night at Tannadice.The question now for Dundee United is whether they can emulate their title rivals by getting back on form as quickly as possible.Victory against Morton would be one step closer to the manager’s goal of promotion while anything  would allow both Ayr and Ross County to open up a sizeable gap above the Tannadice club.However, Ayr have shown the Tangerines how to recover from a hammering – the test for Robbie Neilson and his men is whether they can do the same to get that “boulder” out of their way, starting on Saturday at Cappielow."},{"url":null,"title":"neil mccann claims outside influences led to dundee sack","story":"Former Dundee manager Neil McCann has defended his time in charge of the club, claiming ‘outside influences’ had a part to play in his dismissal.McCann was relieved of his duties at Dens Park in October – leaving the Dark Blues marooned at the foot of the Premiership table with just three points to their name after eight games.And asked why he feels he was let go, despite talk of an experienced No  coming in to help him which never came to fruition, he said: “I don’t know. I could say ‘I’m going to change things’ and the team knew that, the coaching staff knew that and the club knew that as well but ultimately it comes down to results.“Outside influences can be strong and the club felt they wanted a change.

an application from Persimmon Homes for permission to build up to  homes at the former Stewart’s Cream of the Barley plant on Kingsway East was rejected at the city council’s planning committee meeting. vw, px\"  Councillors had been asked to reject the application by Mike Galloway, then executive director of city development, who said the proposal would result in the loss of allocated economic development land.Recommending refusal, Mr Galloway said: “The principle of residential development at this site fails to comply with the relevant provisions of the development plan and there are no material planning considerations of sufficient weight that would justy approval of the application.”He said the council had identied the site as employment land to support the growth of the economy and a erse range of industries.“The proposal would result in the loss of allocated economic development land which is in close proximity to the Port of Dundee and Kingsway,” he said.“Residential development at this site would have a detrimental impact on the supply of employment land in the locality.”A spokesman for Persimmon Homes North Scotland said it would submit a fresh application for the site next year should councillors agree to the development plan changes.“We welcome the Scottish Government reporter’s recommendations and hope that Dundee City Council will accept them and move to adopt the Local Development Plan as soon as possible,” he said.“If this happens, we would then submit a planning application, following further public consultation, in the new year.“From the inquiries we have received, it is evident that this area is in need of new family homes and we would look forward to meeting this demand as quickly as the planning process allows.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c0916765d93f-e1544118794200.jpg ","title":"perverts using facebook snapchat and houseparty to target dundee

dangers our children are exposed to through the internet and social media.”Earlier this year, Sgt Mann revealed that she was leading a drive to increase internet safety and warned that youngsters were

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"south argyll schools reach bowl final","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowSouth Argyll Schoolstravelled to Eastwood High School in Glasgow on Tuesday November  to play in the Scottish Schools Bowl semi-final.The game was played in good conditions and the team were looking forward to building on their recent quarter final performance.The game started with an early converted try for SAS but they were pulled back to - by half time.

No wonder he looked nervous.The boys got to grips with the dferent handling characteristics of Willie Senior#s car and started to up the pace in the afternoon bringing the car home in a respectable th overall and third in class three. This result was enough to secure second position in the overall championship in class.Jamie Miller continued the learning process with the little Citroen C-RMax with Ian McCulloch pointing him in the right direction. A very neat rally from Jamie with very few mistakes saw him finish a creditable th overall and second in class two, only beaten by the Scottish Tarmac Champion for  Michael Harbour in his similar Citroen, who was only one place above him after seven stages.Innes Mochrie was once again out on the stages in the Mightyand this time he had someone whom he might listen to in the co-driver#s seat. His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta. This was a fitting finish to the Championship at Leuchars with very fast stages and a good test of manand machine in equal measures.Photographs by West Coast Photos."},{"url":null,"title":"speedy kirsty points the way ahead for dad","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAt the age of , Kirsty Mochrie made her first outing as navigator for Innes Mochrie at the  Kingdom Stages rally.Seasoned campaigner Innes, who happens to be Kirsty#s dad, was well guided around the course in their Kilmory Coachworks .Kirsty#s gran Libby told the Advertiser: #She just loved it.

Darren Boyd, of Thornyflat Street in Ayr, admitted to assaulting David Mackie on July  this year at McLean Street in Ayr. He also owned up to uttering threats of violence towards him. Boyd appeared before Sherf Scott Pattison at Ayr Sherf Court last week. The court heard how the -year-old ‘repeatedly punched’ Mr Mackie on the head. Depute Fiscal Andrew Lazzarin explained: “At around pm, the complainers were at their home when they heard a noise and went to see what it was. There was a household item lying in the garden. They went to speak to the neighbour about why this was there. “The accused was in the neighbour’s house and assaulted the complainer by repeatedly punching him on the head. “The complainer then went home and the accused went back into the neighbour’s house. The police were contacted and the complainer had a small cut on his lip - he was taken to AE. “Police were unable to find the accused as he had left the neighbours house at that time. “On another occasion, it seems that the complainers were driving to the locus and the accused was shouting towards them saying, “I am going to kick your c**t in”.  “Police were contacted again about these matters.” Defending Boyd, Tony Currie added that Mr Mackie was the neighbour of his partner and there had been “ongoing issues” between them. He said: “These incidents were because of his partner’s ongoing issues with the complainer. “She was receiving ongoing complaints from them. “He had been at his partner’s house at the moment the complainer came to the door, who was kicking the door and was challenging towards his partner. “She was heavily pregnant at the time.” Mr Currie added that there has been no further issues in the interim and the couple are hoping to relocate. Sherf Pattison said: “I was considering sending you to jail - you need to know that this type of violence cannot continue.” As an alternative to custody, Sherf Pattison ordered Boyd to carry out a community payback order with  hours of unpaid work to be completed in nine months.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrshire swimmer 67 proves age","story":"NewsAyrshire swimmer, , proves age is no barrier after scooping medal on debutHe finished the ‘swimming marathon’ at Tollcross in Glasgow in a very impressive .:.ShareByGary Fanning:,  DEC NewsDundonald swimmer Sandy Mavor \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSwimmer Sandy Mavor proved age is no barrier as he claimed a bronze medal on his competitive debut at the Scottish National Masters m Championships. The -year-old finished the ‘swimming marathon’ at Tollcross in Glasgow in a very impressive .:. Sandy trains with the Masters squad at North Ayrshire Swimming at the Portal in Irvine after taking up the sport again when he retired seven years ago. “I swam at school a long time ago,” he explained. “I did the Loch Lomond  mile swim, and the Cumbrae to Largs in August, so I thought I’d try a pool swim. “The coaches here were brilliant here when I arrived. They couldn’t have been more welcoming and helpful - especially for refining my e off the starter blocks! “I think Masters is not quite so competitive so you can just go along and enjoy it. It’s good exercise and you get a good community and it keeps you fit and ticking over.” His first pool race didn’t go entirely to plan, it seems. “I got this racing ‘bullet cap’ and they told me to put another one underneath to stop it coming off, but it didn’t seem to work,” he laughs.  “I don’t know at what point I lost it but apparently I was in the lead for the first eight laps so maybe that was when it happened  I managed to retrieve it from the bottom of the pool at the end of the race, though, and I was very proud to be wearing the North Ayrshire cap.” Sandy’s success shows that swimming is a sport for all ages, with the benefits increasing as we get older as an ideal form of resistance training which is also kind to the joints. “It’s never too late,” said Sandy from Dundonald. “I speak to a lot of people who’ve never done crawl and they say ‘I could never do that’ but I’ve heard of beginners starting really quite late on in le. Initially they can’t swim onebut before they know it they’re swimming a mile. Once they’ve cracked the mental barrier they’re away.” Masters swimming is increasing in popularity, according to North Ayrshire’s head coach, Jess Wilkie. “It’s good for all ages to come down and meet new people and learn new skills, which you can’t beat,” she says. “We like to keep it ied and try and do a bit of everything to suit everyone from distance swimmers to those who want to come in and do a bit of technique work. “What we always say is that there’s a lane for everyone – it doesn’t matter what speed you swim, you can still participate. “I think the oldest swimmer we have is in her s and she’s still firing up and down the pool and matching younger guys.” “There are plenty of sessions to choose from whether you’re a morning person or prefer to exercise in the evenings.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13689315.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS170228854.jpg","title":"ayr uniteds somerset park football","story":"NewsAyr Uniteds Somerset Park football ground damaged as car ploughs into turnstilesThe vehicle smashed into historic Somerset Park shortly before pm last night.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsSomerset Park damaged after car crashes into ground\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA football clubs stadium has been badly damaged after a car ploughed straight through its turnstiles.

However, when the fall of communism led to the break-up of Yugoslavia, war came to Bosnia in , driven in part by Serbiarsquos desire to create a lsquoGreater Serbiarsquo, including large parts of Bosnia, from which they planned to remove Croats and Muslims in what became known as lsquoethnic cleansingrsquo.Our delegation leader Resad Trbonja was , living in Sarajevo. On April , , he woke to find his city under siege, surrounded by Serbian artillery and snipers on the mountains overlooking the city. The siege would last four years, the longest in modern warfare, longer than Stalingrad. An average of  mortars landed in the city every day, , on the worst day.Resad, who lived through, and fought in, the siege, explained that Sarajevo regressed two centuries overnight ndash no water, no electricity, no phones. The Serbian army allowed minimal UN aid into the city sporadically but nothing .The survival of the siege is a story of human courage, spirit and defiance.Our first visit was to the remnants of a tunnel, dug under Sarajevo airport to reach Bosnian-held territory on the other side. This tiny tunnel was the only way in or out for four years.Through this tunnel extra aid came, for example from Edinburgh Direct Aid, who drove lorries of supplies from Edinburgh to help Sarajevans. My own predecessor, John Home Robertson, then MPfor East Lothian, spent several Parliamentary recesses as a volunteer lorry driver. It was dangerous work and one of his colleagues died on the notorious road known as lsquoSnipers Alleyrsquo.Perhaps the most affecting visit in Sarajevo was to the War Childhood Museum, where those who grew up in the siege display the things they kept to remind them of what it was like, and tell their story.A homemade cardboard knightrsquos breastplate made by a brother who later died a cuddly toy from a UN delivery, cuddled threadbare because it was the only toy a homemade lsquounormrsquo for a childrenrsquos choir which rehearsed and performed in defiance of bombs and bullets the remains of a playpark lsquojungle gymrsquo kept to remember the day a mortar tore it apart and killed your friend ndash no one who visits this museum will forget it.That is true too of Srebrenica. This was supposedly a lsquosafe havenrsquo protected by UN troops. Yet on July , Serbian paramilitary units overran it. Thousands of Bosnian Muslims sought refuge in the UN base at a disused factory.When we visited the museum now sited there, survivor Hasan Hasanovic explained to us how UN soldiers stood by as women and children were herded onto buses and deported, while their men were separated and removed in lorries. They were systematically murdered nearby. Thousands more who tried to escape through the forest were hunted down, shepherded into a meadow, and shot. In all, , Bosnian Muslim men and boys were slaughtered at Srebrenica.Finally, the international community acted. In a matter of days, air strikes lted the siege of Sarajevo, drove Serbian paramilitaries out of much of the territory they had occupied, and forced agreement to a peace deal signed in Dayton, Ohio.Srebrenica was not the only genocide in this war, but it is emblematic because it happened under the noses of the UN and because of the bravery of the Mothers of Srebrenica, who ed home to find out what happened to their husbands and sons, refused to be silenced, and demanded justice.This led to the International Commission on Missing Persons and the forensic anthropology unit in Tuzla, where we saw the incredible work done to identy remains using DNA. More than , victims of genocide have now been identied, allowing their families to grieve and to bury them at the final stop of our visit.We arrive at the cemetery at Potaceri, outside Srebrenica, as the sun sets. On the hillside, , stark white tombstones bring home the enormity of what was done over only a few days a mere  years or so ago.More than , died at Srebrenica , perished in Sarajevo , women suffered rape as an act of war millions fled their homes, some even finding their way to the refugee reception centre at Cheylesmore Lodge in North Berwick.All the survivors I met asked the same question: why did so much suffering have to happen before the international community acted to stop it  In telling us their story, they relived their own pain. They did so in the hope that we learn the lessons of Bosnia. We need only look at Syria or Yemen to know that we have not.That is why we must remember Srebrenica.If any local groups would like to hear more about the work of Remembering Srebrenica, please contact my office on  ."},{"url":null,"title":"the-best-fortnite-gifts-for-christmas-2018","story":"Fortnite is the most popular video game of the year and has taken over not just everyonersquos console, but Christmas lists up and down the country too.If you have family members, big or small, who are mad for Fortnite but find yourself utterly clueless as to what itrsquos all about or what to get someone who loves it for Christmas, we can help out with this guide to everything Fortnite from the game itself to presents you should buy this year.*On some occasions, we earn revenue from content.

For a start, the section on anatomy alone spanned an eye-watering  double-column pages and filled more than six issues.Its scientic approach to nature and medicine prompted some to brand the new book as the ldquogospel of Satan, its graphic depictions of dissected female pelvises and foetuses in its articles on childbirth were so controversial that an enraged King George III demanded the offending pages be ripped from every copy.But for those hardy Scots who stuck with it from A to Z, the result was a formidable wealth of knowledge, an essential three volume weapon in the armoury of the great minds of the Scottish Enlightenment, and an encyclopedia that would go on to become one of the best known of its kind, found in homes and classrooms across the world.The th anniversary of Britannicarsquos publication is now set to be marked by a series of events organised by the National Library of Scotland in Edinburgh.These include a sell-out talk by Professor Stephen Brown of Trent University in Ontario, who plans to unravel the roots and spotlight the often very eccentric characters behind the launch of one of Scotlandrsquos most extraordinary publications.It was Saturday, December , probably late in the day and in Stairs Close just off the Lawnmarket in Edinburghrsquos Old Town, when the first copies of Encyclopaeligdia Britannica made their way from the publishersrsquo offices into the eager hands of the capitalrsquos society.It was the idea of printer Colin Macfarquhar, who driven by a determination to produce a book of knowledge by Scots and for Scots, had joined forces with the diminutive ft ins figure of engraver Andrew Bell.Neither, according to Mr Brown, had any formal education to speak of ndash Macfarquhar had just been released from his apprenticeship, Bell was the son of a baker ndash but both had spotted a niche in the publishing market for a weighty tome that would offer the Scots in the age of enlightenment an up to date and informed source of global knowledge.The pair engaged William Smellie, who had edited the Scots Magazine for five years and who had used Bell as an engraver.However large parts of the first edition were ndash by Smelliersquos own admission ndash an th century version of todayrsquos ldquoctrl-C ctrl-V, and simply chopped from other publications using a trusty pair of scissors, and pasted on to the pages, errors and all.Perhaps to avoid the risk of the learned establishment of Edinburgh pouring scorn on their credentials as authors of an encyclopedia, the group referred to themselves simply as ldquoA Society of Gentlemen in Scotland.The first edition was published in instalments between December  and , at a time when the dodo still thrived, freshly-cut onions were recorded in its pages as a cure for baldness and Calornia described as located in the West Indies, ldquounknown whether it is an island or a peninsula.According to Mr Brown, Britannica was heavily promoted for its Scottishness. ldquoIt included many Scottish sources and had a long treatise on Scots Law, he adds. The adverts also encouraged subscribers to be patriotic and purchase this first ever encyclopaedia by Scots.ldquoThe three founders were not Jacobites. They were typical of the Edinburgh business and intellectual community who promoted a strong Scottish identity within a healthy Union. They recognised the benefits of peace to commerce. Thus the Britannica within the title.A novel early feature was Smelliersquos inclusion of treatises, some of which, like anatomy left readers with an astonishing amount of content to consume and sparked complaints from some who simply couldnrsquot cope with the extreme verbosity.As a result, while the first volume covered just the first three letters of the alphabet, leaving the second two volumes to hurriedly handle the remaining .ldquoThe illustrations amounted to  engravings and several thousand figures, all executed by Andrew Bell, adds Mr Brown. ldquoThe most notorious were his engravings of a foetus in the womb in the treatise on midwery.ldquoThey were copied from the other William Smelliersquos book on midwery aimed at medical specialist. But the Britannica was the first book intended for public consumption to include such graphic medical illustrations.Perhaps the adverse publicity and wrath of royalty helped. The first edition sold enough copies to enough to warrant an updated second edition.However, a row between Smellie and the Duke of Buccleuch, a major subscriber, over biographical information sparked his resignation.Perhaps it was no surprise that the chore of writing the next volume would go to an equally unusual character, James Tytler, the first man to successfully fly a hot air balloon in Great Britain and whose personal fortunes had already careered from whaling ship surgeon to debtorsrsquo prison and a love affair with the bottle.He penned , pages and increased the encyclopedia from three volumes to nine, mostly writing hunched over his washerwoman landladyrsquos upturned washtub and locked in his room by the publishers who feared he might escape.Tytler was paid a pittance for his work, but supplemented his income by writing a guide to Edinburghrsquos prostitutes which rated their looks, performance and teeth.Incredibly,  years later, several first edition copies of the encyclopedia are still in circulation.Mr Brown added: ldquoThere are  sets are currently listed in the English Short Title Catalogue in libraries around the world, and there are others in private hands."},{"url":null,"title":"dream-of-refloating-the-maid-of-the-loch-lives-on","story":"ldquoIt is going to take some time to absorb this news and the reasons behind it\", said John Beveridge, chairman of Loch Lomond Steamship Company, which has been restoring the vessel since .The charity, however, promised that the decision ldquois not the end of the road and said it still firmly believed in the project.Yesterday it learned that a pound, capital grant funding award by the Scottish Government had been confirmed, meaning that the goal of ing the ship to sail lives on.The package from the Regeneration Capital Grant Fund , awarded earlier this year, hung in the balance following the \"disappointing\" news from Heritage Lottery Fund .The charity said the Scottish Government announcement meant that the Maid could look forward to  \"with a renewed focus, with work already confirmed including repairs to the shiprsquos hull, creation of an on-board education facility, refurbishing the mainsuite, and overhauling the engines to enable them to turn with steam.\"Mr Beveridge said: ldquoThis is a huge boost to the project and will transform the Maidrsquos attraction to visitors.

Its going to have a big impact. People now realise itrsquos not just the employees that are going to be affected, itrsquos all their friends and families as well as many local businesses.\"And its not just Dingwall where this will be felt. I have been told that people are coming from all over and from as far away as Ullapool to work there.\"This was echoed by fellow ward councillor Angela MacLean. She said: \"This is extremely sad news for all the staff who have been loyal employees of the Edinburgh Salmon Company for many years. The business has had a long association with Dingwall and this closure will have a knock-on effect on many of the local businesses in the area.\"There is never a good time to be made redundant but in the run up to Christmas this is a double blow for many local families.MSP John Finne said: \"This is bitterly disappointing news from the Edinburgh Salmon Company, and will come as a blow to all those workers on site. I have sought assurances that the Scottish Government will continue to make every possible effort to assist the workforce of Edinburgh Salmon Company in light of this closure.\"There are fears that some families of Eastern European origin who have contributed to the local economy for upwards of a decade are now considering cutting their losses and leaving the area.\"I know because of this loads of people will go back to Poland,\" said a Polish national who has friends working there. \"Its going to be a dficult time for those people. Some of them have worked there for  years.\"Another member of the Polish community, who also did not want to be named, said: \"My partner used to work there. I feel sorry for my friends and their families. I know how people are feeling, but nobody will speak about it. There are loads of people working there and people are scared.\"In a statement, Europeacuteenne de la Mer, which has cited challenging market conditions and is understood to have registered losses in excess of poundmillion, said it regretted \"no feasible alternative solution to closure was found during collective consultation\" and the factory will close at the end of the year. It will meet its obligations until the turn of the year when the factory will close.It said: \"We would like to thank all employees for their commitment to the company to date and their professionalism during this dficult time.\"Next Fridays jobs fair in Dingwall will run from pm to pm at the Town hall. MP Ian Blackford said: \"Dingwall and the surrounding areas have many opportunities waiting to be explored let us all work together to make these readily available to the people who live and work here.\"Friday  Dec  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It has been a gradual build-up over the years but I think the way the Highland Council has been dealing with issues has not helped and it has not helped any of you whatsoever.Mrs Manson promised a ldquolistening council when she took the reins from Steve Barron last month. That has included a y series of drop-ins across the sprawling Highland Council area inviting people to share what they feel the local authority does well and where therersquos room for improvement.The council faces a massive budget gap against a backdrop of simmering public discontent over areduction in services as belts are tightened.She said she was willing to look at all issues raised. She said: ldquoI need to think about how we structure staff in the council so that people feel there is an equal service out there.The planned introduction of parking charges to a town which boasts freely available space prompted warnings. Councillor Margaret Paterson said: ldquoI can tell you that the majority of people in Dingwall want you to stop imposing parking charges. And as a council you donrsquot care how the High Street will go down the plug hole because of it.Mrs Manson said she would consider the concerns raised during the drop-ins and would report back in January.What do YOU think  We welcome feedback.

In the past, people in such a situation would have been struggling to make ends meet on benefits. But the survey, by the Citizens Advice Scotland, found that  per cent of people who had a job had either skipped meals or reduced the amount of food they eat because of a lack of funds.Derek Mitchell, the group’s chief executive, said: “For some people going hungry is the norm ... this study shows that many working people in Scotland are struggling to afford to buy food and in , this is simply unacceptable.”: % of Scots worry that the food cupboard may become barePeople do have a tendency to underestimate how much they eat, forgetting about snacks during the day, so polls on this subject may not be entirely accurate. The most recent Scottish Health Survey found  per cent of people in the poorest areas had gone hungry because of a lack of money.However,the picture is anything like as widespread as either survey suggests it should act as yet another a call to arms to add to others this year.In July, Holyrood’s Education Committee published a report saying they were “appalled by some of the evidence it heard, including the amount of evidence received about children in Scotland going to school hungry”. And only yesterday Action for Children said that every day its staff “see first-hand the impossible choice that families living in practically Dickensian levels of poverty have to make”.: MSPs shocked by poor and hungry Scottish pupilsSuch problems cry out for Scotland’s politicians to do something. But, as The Scotsman said yesterday, suggestions that the answer is to raise taxes should be treated with caution because of the risk of damaging the economy and making poverty even worse.However, politicians have other weapons in their armoury. For example, companies that use illegal or unethical working practices or find ways to avoid paying the minimum wage should face a further clampdown. A fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work is an idea that politicians of all parties should support.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4840499.1544122439!/image/image.jpg","title":"scotrail scores another spectacular own goal alastair dalton","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Scotland#s Railways: The Story That Keeps On Giving was the title of a presentation I gave to a rail group this summer.Of all the types of transport I cover, it provides easily the most plentul source of news – good and bad. That’s perhaps because the rail network occupies a separate environment,not, with its many quirks, a parallel universe.I explained to the audience, who included ScotRail Alliance managing director Alex Hynes, that while there will always be negative stories about the railways, there have been some spectacular own goals by the industry in generating its own bad publicity.The examples I gave included current ScotRail operator Abellio instructing its staff in  to cut its predecessor’s logos from their unorms because new ones weren’t ready.I also highlighted the row over previous operator First shrinking its coffee cups because it could not meet the demand for hot drinks. The then managing director was livid to hear this had happened without his knowledge.I’m sorry to say ScotRail has done it again.You’d think that just after announcing a fares increase, amid dozens of daily cancellations because of staff shortages and industrial action, and while suffering the worst punctuality for years, would not be the best time to create more bad news.: Alastair Dalton: The vested interest blocking cuts to air pollutionBut no, the train operator confirmed on Monday it was scrapping its Kids Go Free promotion for five to -year-olds travelling with an adult. It will be replaced from next month by Kids for a Quid, a flat-fare £instead.ScotRail said the number of eligible children would increase from two to four per adult. It will also be extended to season ticket and flexipass holders, some of whom had apparently complained about having to buy another ticket so their children could travel free.Opposition parties and unions had a field day – Labour launched a petition while the Transport and Salaried Staffs’ Association accused ScotRail of “totally Scrooge-like behaviour”.Apart from the ill-judged timing, loss-making ScotRail’s decision appears to something of a gamble financially.It may prompt season ticket holders to take their kids by train, but introducing a charge – even £ – could equally dissuade others from going by rail. That could be particularly so on shorter trips around Glasgow, where most ScotRail journeys are made, and where even adult fares cost only a few pounds.: ‘Best railway Scotland’s ever had’ delayed by wrong type of threadHowever, the biggest issue with the change is that it flies in the face of Scottish Government policy of getting people out of their cars.Transport secretary Michael Matheson regards taking the train as “active travel”, along with walking and cycling, because it also involves at least one of those.Signicantly, he did not defend ScotRail when questioned about the change by MSPs on Tuesday – and said he understood people’s concerns.Children should become familiar with public transport as potential future users. I know of primary school teachers surprised to find few of their pupils have travelled by train, even at a school close to a busy Glasgow station. Some at a recent ten-year-old’s birthday party had never been on a bus.A decade ago, First ScotRail became the first UK train operator to offer free accompanied child travel daily.

RBS said no UK business would be affected.Britain is expected to leave the EU on  March, but businesses have grown nervous around the uncertainty surrounding Britain’s departure.MPs are set to vote on Prime Minister Theresa May’s EU withdrawal agreement on Tuesday, but this could be voted down and the country could leave the EU without a deal or a transition period. A disorderly Brexit could see banks lose passporting rights that allow direct access to clients in the EU.Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: “There has never been a Conservative government more hostile to British business. RBS couldn’t be any clearer – Brexit is a bad idea and a no deal Brexit will have homegrown companies running for the hills.”The news follows reports that €bnof assets are to move to Frankfurt in preparation for ­Brexit. Frankfurt Main Finance, the German city’s lobby group, previously said  out of  financial institutions which have applied to the European Central Bank for new licences, or to extend existing ones, have chosen Frankfurt for their European headquarters. Several London-based banks have indicated they will sht jobs to Frankfurt or other financial hubs in Paris and Dublin, which are also vying to take some of London’s business.Earlier this year, RBS said  staff had been deployed to Amsterdam to set up a new operation serving the bank’s European customers ahead of a no-deal scenario.Chief executive Ross McEwan said the bank was “preparing for the worst”.In an interview at the time, he said: “If there is no agreement and we fall out of Europe, we have to be ready for our customers.“So we’re setting up an operation in Amsterdam, awaiting final approval for the correct licences. “We’re having to put a number of our senior team and our systems and processes to move our European customers across into that entity for our markets business and our corporates.”“If we don’t get the right licences ... that could create major problems for our customers.”Last month the Bank of England warned a disorderly Brexit could see Britain plunged into recession. However, seven major banks – RBS, HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds, Standard Chartered, Santander and Nationwide Building Society – passed a stress test said to be two-and-a-half times more severe than the Brexit scenarios.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4840308.1544108311!/image/image.jpg","title":"scotland weather gale force 80mph winds batter scotland today","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Gale-force winds of up to mph are battering Scotland#s west coast as heavy rain descends on the country.A yellow warning for wind for much of Scotland remains in place until midnight.The Met Office said inland gusts of up to mph were likely.Stronger winds of up to mph were expected to hit exposed locations across north-west Scotland.Glasgow, Inverclyde, East and South Ayrshire, and North Lanarkshire were expected to be among the hardest-hit areas.Edinburgh, the Lothians and the Scottish Borders are all expected to be affected by the storm front as the day progresses.Tay Bridge leading into Dundee has been closed to double-decker vehicles in both directions due to the high winds.Friarton Bridge on the M near Perth also has a high wind warning in place.A majority of Calmac Ferries services have either been cancelled or disrupted today.Routes between Tobermory-Kilchoan, Oban-Colonsay, Ullapool-Stornoway and Mallaig-Armadale are among those cancelled, leaving a number of passengers stranded.Weather warnings currently in placeA yellow weather warning for wind is currently in place for Scotland from am to .pm on Friday.The Met Office advised, “A deep depression will move eastwards across northern Scotland on Friday bringing widespread gales.“Inland gusts of - mph are likely quite widely, with gusts of - mph in exposed locations across northwest Scotland.“Heavy rainfall may be an additional hazard across parts of northern and western Scotland.”What to expect from this weather warning:-Some delays to road, rail, air and ferry transport expected-Some bus and train services affected, with some journeys taking longer-Delays for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges-Some short term loss of power and other services-Coastal routes, sea fronts and coastal communities affected by spray and or large waves©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4840739.1544180355!/image/image.jpg","title":"scotrail fares should be frozen in scottish budget labour says","story":"Scottish Labour is calling on finance secretary Derek Mackay to include a freeze on rail fares north of the Border in next week#s Holyrood Budget.Richard Leonard demanded the Scottish Government work with ScotRail bosses to prevent planned price hikes from kicking in on  January.The Scottish Labour leader insisted this was “the right thing to do” in the wake of “worsening” performance by the rail operator.He made the plea ahead of Mr Mackay unveiling his Budget for - to Holyrood on Wednesday.

It is the right thing to do and they should get on and do it.”A Transport Scotland spokesman said: “While any fare increase is unwelcome, calls for a fares freeze underestimate the impact of these on the public purse.”The spokesman added: “In Scotland, two-thirds of the cost of running the railway is already met through government subsidy, with the remainder through rail passenger revenues.

Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh #  she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too. I want the whole thing investigated by the proper authorities so this does not happen to another family.#Miss MacLeod, who said the case was #a clear abuse of Eilidh#s human rights#, was not interested in any apology from the council. The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway.

While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers.

The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1295009.jpg--.jpg?1544181922000\n","title":"new york concert date for kells flautist","story":"A Kells teenager has been selected to join the prestigious National Youth Orchestra.Jake Houston has been playing the flute for eight years and is set to take his place in the world’s greatest orchestra of teenagers in December.The -year-old will join  other teenagers from all over the country as part of the Youth Orchestra, which is also planning its first ever tour to the USA in .The members of the orchestra were selected following  days of auditions held in  cities across the country.

She explained: “Normally the Council erects blue plaques at the birth place of famous people from the area but this would be dficult seeing Rosie McCann was a fictional character in a song. “I would suggest the page creator contacts the shadow council.” The song set near Banbridge was written by Cathal McGarveyfrom Ramelton, County Donegal and is sung from the point of view of a young man who chances to meet a charming lady by the name of RosieMcCann, referred to as the “star of the County Down”.

This puts the whole of the United Kingdom in prime position to seize new opportunities as we leave the EU.As we establish our new relationship with Europe, the Industrial Strategy will help us to build the foundations behind our withdrawal agreement. Our prosperity and ability to build a strong economy is dependent on how we encourage innovation, develop high quality jobs and skills, and support businesses throughout the UK to thrive and grow.Northern Ireland has a world-leading reputation in key sectors, including construction and automotive, as well as future industries such as Articial Intelligence , cyber security and le sciences.The Industrial Strategy has led to specic partnerships between the government and these industries, which will help these major employers in Northern Ireland face the future outside the EU with confidence.Today I am pleased to announce, with the Business Secretary Greg Clark, £, of funding from the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund for the County Antrim-based le sciences company Randox. This will pay for the research and development of cutting-edge technology to enable diagnostic tools to be manufactured more quickly and effectively.Eventually, this will lead to more manufacturing jobs as a result.Northern Ireland is also benefiting from UK-wide funding programmes under the Industrial Strategy, including Armagh City, Banbridge  Craigavon who have successfully bid for £.m and Belfast for £.m as some of the  areas benefiting from the £m Full Fibre Networks Challenge fund, designed to increase connectivity across the UK.The UK has a strong economy, with eight straight years of economic growth, over  million more people in jobs, and higher employment and lower unemployment in every region and nation of the UK - we should be proud of this.We are open and enterprising, founded on invention, innovation and competition.In Northern Ireland, employment levels are almost at a record high, and the UK government is determined to build on this progress.We are at the forefront of scientic invention because we embrace change and use regulation to stimulate an environment for creativity.We have globally admired universities and research institutions, such as Queens and Ulster University, because we have nurtured our intellectual powerhouses with public investment. And we have a deserved reputation for being a dependable and confident place to do business because we have high standards, clear regulation and great partnerships.The UKs businesses can take on the world because they have access to a skilled workforce and modern infrastructure, and Northern Ireland is an important and growing part of that. The Prime Minister, the rest of our Cabinet colleagues and I will continue working to secure the best Brexit deal for the whole of the UK.At the same time we are delivering our long-term plan to support businesses throughout the UK to thrive and grow.Building on the great strides the Industrial Strategy has already taken so that after we leave the EU, our businesses and institutions are in the best possible position to build on our strengths and lead the world.Karen Bradley MP is Secretary of State for Northern Ireland"},{"url":null,"title":"suzanne breen unionists united in opposition as remainers rally around backstop","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Unlike the pro-Remain parties, there was no joint press conference. But in separate statements, the DUP, the Ulster Unionists and the TUV insisted that no unionist worth their salt could sign up to the deal and called for the backstop to be binned. Sometimes, a secret document doesnt live up to the speculation. This was not such an occasion.Geoffrey Coxs advice set off alarm bells in even moderate unionist circles. No wonder the Government wanted to keep it under wraps. It said the whole of the UK would form a single customs territory with the EU, but Northern Ireland and Britain would be there on dferent legal terms.Only Northern Ireland would be legally part of the customs union, following the full EU customs code. The European Court of Justice would continue to have jurisdiction over its compliance with those rules. DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: \"Goods passing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be subject to a declaration process.\"Northern Ireland will remain in the single market for goods and the EUs customs regime, and will be required to apply and comply with the relevant rules and standards,up regulatory ergence in the future.\"Britain would be \"essentially treated as a third country by Northern Ireland for goods passing from GB into NI\".The DUP is livid that despite all Mrs Mays pledges, economic and trade barriers would be erected within the UK - something it branded \"unacceptable and economically mad\". The legal advice said the backstop could continue indefinitely and that the drafting didnt provide for a mechanism that is likely to allow the UK to exit lawfully.Despite promises to the contrary from Mrs May and Secretary of State Karen Bradley, the TUV said Northern Ireland would be \"annexed permanently into the EU\".The Attorney Generals full advice, released yesterday, was \"more emphatic and plain than that dressed up for the summary\" in the House of Commons on Monday, Mr Allister said.\"The trap is clear. All of the UK for now is held in a customs territory with the EU but only Northern Ireland is legally part of the EU Customs Union, where we would stay indefinitely evenGB was released,\" he added.\"This is utterly incompatible with the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK.\"Mrs May had previously stated the very arrangement that she ended up signing up to would be unacceptable to any UK Prime Minister.Mr Swann said while the Government tried to downplay unionist concerns as recently as last week when he met the Prime Minister and Cabinet Office officials, legal advice reinforcing those fears was actually sitting on their desks.\"What was the point in them spending the best part of a year saying that they shared our concernsall the while they were negotiating a deal that contains everything we were concerned about \" he asked.The UUP leader said Mrs May must stop \"flogging this dead deal\" and pursue alternatives. But nationalist parties and Alliance want her to do nothing of the sort. Sinn Fein MLA Conor Murphy said the backstop had been agreed by the Government and the EU, and the Attorney Generals advice changed nothing. \"It must be maintained and protected. It cant be derailed or undermined by the votes of Brexiteer MPs,\" he stressed.An SDLP spokesperson added: \"There will potentially be minor dferences between GB and NIthe backstop is required, but they will be minimal.\"This is not a secret, but any ergence is a consequence of Brexit and the extreme version of Brexit that the DUP insisted on pursuing. If the DUP cannot accept this consequence of Brexit, they should do the honourable thing and support a referendum on the deal.\"Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said nobody should be shocked at the legal advice on the backstop, because \"its nature and purpose should have been evident to anyone following the negotiations over the past  months\".The backstop was needed to protect the Good Friday Agreement and to avoid a hard border, he insisted. Mr Farry didnt see it undermining the Union - it \"may create comparative economic advantages for this region\", he said."},{"url":null,"title":"taoiseach insists fresh brexit negotiations not an option","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In her statement published last night, she admitted she may have been wrong in her initial claim.\"Given the febrile atmosphere, made worse by the fact that, prior to my interview with Stephen Nolan, I had been given no clear understanding of what MrBell had said in his interview, it is possible that I am wrong about the sequencing of Dr McCormick telling me his view that Dr Crawford delayed the scheme.\" She continued: \"However, regardless of when Dr McCormicks belief was communicated to me, I was already aware of the contents of Dr Crawfords emails and would have taken the view that there was insufficient evidence at that time to draw any conclusions about the reasons for delay in the scheme, hence my reply to Mr Nolan that I had no idea.\"Mrs Foster said she would not have publicly voiced \"an unsubstantiated comment\" of that nature anyway.\"Indeed, I remain of the view that to repeat this unsubstantiated allegation to Mr Nolan, particularly in the circumstances that prevailed at the time, would have been inappropriate,\" she said. \"I did have no idea as to the facts of what took place and therefore I do not believe that my reply to Mr Nolan was contrary to the principle of openness within the seven principles of public le.\"Dr Crawford, who was Mrs Fosters right-hand man in three Stormont departments, denies trying to delay cost controls.In her statement to the inquiry, Mrs Foster called for a \"fundamental appraisal\" of the Northern Ireland Civil Service. She also raised the possibility of extending the home civil service to Northern Ireland.The DUP leader apologised for her partys role in the scandal at its annual conference last month.She told the inquiry: \"I believe that there is a strong argument for a fundamental appraisal of the Northern Ireland civil service. \"With advances in technology, the increasing complexity of policies, and the emergence of new approaches within the private sector, there is a need for greater specialism and expertise within the civil service. Mrs Foster added that the Department for Energy and Climate Change at Westminster had more than  people working on the RHI scheme in England. In Northern Ireland there were just two.\"That level of resource is simply not available to a Northern Ireland-specic civil service,\" she said. \"There is therefore merit in giving strong consideration to how the expertise and resource available in Great Britain could be extended to cover Northern Ireland.\"To applause from delegates at the DUP conference, Mrs Foster said she was \"deeply sorry\" for her partys handling of RHI."},{"url":null,"title":"jonathan bell handed secret tapes to stephen nolan after recording him","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

And when Jonathan Bell came down to my house Sam he was telling me how much he trusted, he was telling me how much I was the man for the job. \"And there was just something in my mind, I don’t know what it was, it was a sixth sense.

A yellow weather warning has been issued for the most northerly parts of the province from am until midnight.The public have been warned of potential power cuts, large waves in coastal areas, localised flooding, fallen trees, damage to property and a risk of flying debris.Motorists are also being advised that their journey times could take longer and the spell of strong winds is likely to bring some delays and disruption to air, bus and rail transport. Met office meteorologist Alex Burkill told the Belfastthat a very unsettled weather pattern can be expected over the next few days due to a strong jet stream. This will move in from a northerly direction, turning things colder into next week. Mr Burkill said: \"After a fine evening on Thursday, we have seen conditions turn cloudier and wetter through the night. Its during the early hours of Friday morning that the winds will really begin to strengthen. \"Wind speeds could reach in excess of mph in the most exposed places. \"Even outside of the weather warning area its going to be windy. We are likely to see some travel disruption, short-term power losses, delays for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and coastal communities affected by spray and or large waves. \"Along with the strong gusts developing, we might see some sunny spells during the day but there is also the risk of several heavy showers and the possibility of some thunder and hail, falling as sleet or snow on higher ground.\"After a stormy day, Mr Burkill says weather conditions will gradually become much calmer over the weekend. \"Saturday is looking pretty cloudy and were likely to see outbreaks of showery rain pushing in from the west, which will be heavy at times. It will still be windy but the gusts wont be as strong as on Friday. \"Sunday looks set to be a much quieter day, still cloudy with some rain towards the west but generally drier than Saturday.\"Next week will be predominantly settled but cold with a few wintry showers.\"Northern Ireland will stay relatively cloudy into the start of the week with less rain but it will be turning much colder in the northerly wind,\" he added.

Rather than taking back control, under the Prime Ministers Withdrawal Agreement, the United Kingdom would be trapped..pushThe Northern Ireland Protocol, set in international law, could not be exited unilaterally by the United Kingdom.It would continue indefinitely until superseded by another agreement.The Attorney Generals legal opinion is a devastating blow for the Prime Minister and those Cabinet ministers who are trying to sell the Withdrawal Agreement as a good deal.The publication of the legal opinion is a clear vindication for those of us who campaigned for it to be published.It is regrettable that we needed to use the Contempt mechanism to secure its publication. It did not need to be this way.Nonetheless, we now fully understand why the Government did not want to publish the Attorney Generals legal opinion.It flies in the face of what the Prime Minister told us on February  in the House of Commons.She said: \"The draft legal text that the Commission has published would,implemented, undermine the UK common market and threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK by creating a customs and regulatory border down the Irish sea, and no UK Prime Minister could ever agree to it.\"I will be making it crystal clear to President Juncker and others that we will never do so.\"Yet the Attorney Generals advice to the Cabinet confirms that the Northern Ireland Protocol would mean very dferent trading arrangements for Northern Ireland than the rest of the United Kingdom.A customs and regulatory border is precisely what the Government now propose.The Prime Ministers public and private commitments lie in tatters.Of course, it is important to rewind  months. It was this week last year when Arlene Foster telephoned the Prime Minister while she was in Brussels and urged her to bin the backstop.We pointed out the folly of the arrangement. We insisted on Paragraph  being added to the Joint Report to safeguard frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.Twelve months later, the Withdrawal Agreement has hundreds of detailed legal clauses about the Northern Ireland situation and the backstop, but there is not a single line and not a single word in relation to paragraph  of the Joint Report.That provision was inserted specically to allow that the final say in and decision on any regulatory dferences between Great Britain and Northern Ireland should rest with the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive.It is deeply regretful that we have received no satisfactory explanation as to why Paragraph s commitment has been deleted.Conceding a fallback position to the EU before even starting talks about our final exit arrangements was always a bad idea.Too much time has been spent on negotiating this awful backstop. Even the ministers selling the deal dont like it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, said on ITVs Peston on November : \"I dont think this backstop is a good arrangement for our economy. I dont think it is a good arrangement for our Union.\"So, its bad for the economy and the Union.And then the Attorney General, the Rt Hon Geoffrey Cox MP, said in the House of Commons on December : \"It has unattractive and unsatisfactory elements for us. I would have preferred to have seen a unilateral right of termination in the backstop. I would have preferred to have seen a clause that allowed us to exit.\"The words of the Prime Minister, EU commissioners and Cabinet ministers will come and go.They can be twisted and contorted to mean whatever one wants them to mean, but the legally binding text of the Withdrawal Agreement will remain.Our grandchildren will live with the outworkings of that international agreement.The Withdrawal Agreement will commit Northern Ireland to large swaths of EU single market rules for goods and agri-food.Of course, there are already regulatory dferences between GB and NI, but those were set for health reasons by our Parliament or NI Assembly, not because we were in a dferent single market regime.In such circumstances, our core industries would have their rules set by the European Commission and be subject to the European Court of Justice, yet we would have no say over them.It is utterly unacceptable, to me as a unionist, that Northern Ireland, in trade terms, would treat the rest of the United Kingdom as a third country.The Attorney General has confirmed this as being his legal opinion.We were told by the Prime Minister in her six declarations to the people of Northern Ireland last December that she would ensure that Northern Ireland left the European Union with the rest of the United Kingdom.She assured the public that no part of the United Kingdom would be left in the single market or the customs union and that no part of the UK would be left subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.These pledges have now been broken.We want a deal which works for the entire United Kingdom and delivers on the referendum result.We want Parliament to be sovereign for the entire United Kingdom.Rather than go through the process of debating and voting on this flawed deal, the Prime Minister should work for a better deal and bin the backstop.Nigel Dodds is the DUP MP for North Belfast"},{"url":null,"title":"andy burn em greater manchester mayor goes viral with response to pay jibe","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The print industry is developing very fast and becoming increasingly technologically advanced, so the future will require staff with a strong background in STEM subjects.“While my male colleagues are great, it would be fantastic for all companies to engage with more women. I’m glad I work for a company which encourages me as a young woman in STEM. It’s very rewarding to be part of a business which is always changing, adapting and expanding. There are always opportunities to train and progress.”Although initially involved with Nuprint’s design team, developing artwork and ordering equipment, Lauren’s talents soon saw her chosen to be part of the company’s new digital department.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshHaving invested heavily in a state-of-the-art HP Indigo digital printing press, Nuprint sent Lauren to Barcelona, where she learned to use the artwork pre-press software and received press operator training. She now works in Nuprint’s HP Digital Department, producing high-spec labels, sleeves and wraparound labelling for a wide range of commercial clients.Keen to raise awareness of STEM careers and companies supporting young people like herself into employment, Lauren recently helped to develop Derry City  Strabane District Council’s Business Youth Charter. The initiative highlights those local businesses helping young people into work as well as informing young people about the companies and industries.Gavin Killeen, Managing Director of Nuprint, said Lauren was a “shining example of a female in a male-dominated print industry excelling and embracing STEM.”He added: “Eager to learn new skills and increase her expertise in print, Lauren is undaunted by the challenges we constantly throw her way. With her positive attitude, ability to work under pressure and her clear thinking, she embodies Nuprint’s values and has now set a high standard for all our apprentices, both female and male. Everyone at Nuprint is very proud of Lauren and we’re delighted her hard work has been rewarded with her success at the Irish Print Awards.”"},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOFxcXC8xMlxcXC8wNzA5MzkzM1xcXC9NQy1EZXJyeS1UVi1zaG93LTEwMjR4NzY4LnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjo2NDcsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjozNDAsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3d3dy5kZXJyeW5vdy5jb21cXFwvYXNzZXRzXFxcL2lcXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nP3Y9MVwifSIsImhhc2giOiI4YzcwOGI4NDY4ZGM4YmU3OTc0ZmEzMzQxNGI3MWU0ZDM1YTk4NzJiIn0=/mc-derry-tv-show-1024x768.png","title":"watch festive episode derry sitcom mccraic ens christmas cracker","story":"Local writer Irene Melaughs latest instalment of the McCraic-ens shows a very Derry Christmas and is already getting plenty of positive feedback online.The bawdy humour and caustic one liners have raised plenty of laughs.Click below to watch.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe first seven episodes of the ‘McCraic-ens’ are available on Facebook and feature the adventures of a mad cap Derry family.Writer and director Irene Melaugh, who is best known to local audiences for her plays such as the ‘Dumped Divorcee Support Group’, saw a gap in the market for a home grown drama that showed cased our unique sense of humour."},{"url":null,"title":"council streamline senior management roles from 24","story":"County Hall, Powys County Council Offices, Llandrindod Wells.\" \"   typemchtype\" \"\"Powys County Council: Eight senior management roles axed to save £. millionMohammed Mehmet, acting chief executive.\" \"   typemchtype\" Skip to next image raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"hunt for entrepreneur to create major mid wales tourism attraction","story":"Surfers in action at Surf Snowdonia.

Politicians are also conscious that dog fouling is a problem which does nothing to enhance the districtrsquos image.The new campaign is reminding dog owners that they should never allow their pets to foul on the street and that when out in public to carry a bag with them so they can collect dog dirt and dispose of it properly.Council chairman Mark Murnin said all councillors were unanimous in their support for the new awareness campaign.ldquoWe intend to monitor and extend this initiative over the coming months, he explained. Dog fouling is a serious matter and we need to remind dog owners that not only is it unacceptable, but also can potentially cause disease.ldquoIt is important that we develop and promote a culture of responsible dog ownership and are asking all dog owners to help us keep the parks and open spaces in the Newry, Mourne and Down area clean and welcoming for all users.As part of the new campaign, notices about dog fouling will be displayed prominently across the district to ensure that the local authorityrsquos message to pet owners is clear to all..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Classy Campbell seals victory  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH secured an excellent away win on the articial surface at Old Wesley as a strong second half performance was enough to get them over the line in a match strewn with penalties.lsquoHinch lost Rory Butler, James Simpson, Stuart Morrow to injury during the extremely physical encounter with Banbridge and, coupled with the unavailability of Johnny McPhillips, their midfield had to be rejigged completely with Callum McLaughlin and Robin Harte starting in the centre, outside fly half Hilton Gibbons.Tom Martin came in at lock to replace Simpson and the pack was bolstered by Tommy OrsquoHagan, who made his debut at tight head prop.

The goal I am working towards now is to get as much usage back in my arm as I physically can.Damien said the air ambulance costs pound, per day to run so every penny really does go a long way to making sure this vital service can continue.He added: ldquoI was delighted when Carryduff Building Supplies nominated the Air Ambulance to benefit from its annual fundraising breakfast.

Then came his sudden realisation of what the meaning of the word lsquoOmertarsquo was ndash the code of silence.He didnrsquot see it coming or expect it. Colm arrived into the Shimna Suite to a tumultuous welcome ndash the sort of welcome only heroes get, the standing ovation, the shy bow of the head and of course the irreplaceable smile.He was among friends and worshippers. He spoke to his adoring audience and we lapped up every word. He spoke of his unease at the inidual honours he achieved as Gaelic football is a team game and that he achieved much on the shoulders of giants both in size and sheer ability. They gave him the  to achieve what he did.Colm said It wasnrsquot about Colm ndash itrsquos what others did for him. The unglamorous work, the blocking, the chasing ndash all the stuff we, as footballers do.The first video, mist and rolling hills ndash the early strains from the film many years ago ndash yip local hero.We all canrsquot be wrong. Wersquore all thinking the same way. In true lsquoThis is your lersquo style our compere for the evening, the classy one and only Austin OrsquoCallaghan eased Colm into his throne.He didnrsquot sit easy. Hersquos in the spotlight. Itrsquos not like the chair at home from which he was supposed to be watching the Late Late Show . As Colm said himself, before Mickey Cole got his tuppence in, saying it was about Colmrsquos level of viewing.There was laughter from the hall. Now, like all his years on the field, he is being watched once again. The evening will unfold. There will be surprises. He will forget himself, the nervous tension will go.He will relax into the throne ndash on one which he will wear a virtual crown. There was one thing missing ndash the big red book. This was duly delivered by Colmrsquos grandchildren, Eimear and Senan adorned in the Castlewellan and Liatroim Fontenoys colours.He got his biggest hug of the night from them. They probably whispered lsquowe love you grandarsquo to him. He would have known that.And so the story of his le began and it began with family. His sisterrsquos Mary, Nuala, Una and Dympna talked warmly of their brother. They spoke of the early days in Dublin, the near emigration to Australia and ultimately theirto Liatroim.In later years one newspaper headlined ldquoColm McAlarney ndash Dublinrsquos gt to Downrsquo ndash which we all know now is so fitting and thank God for that.The next sign of the hero status revealed itself though not a sporting one. Dympna told of how as a four year-old she misbehaved at Mass. As children wersquove all got the ldquowait until I get you home remark from a parent. When she got home, Colm being the big brother. gave her a big protective hug and all was forgiven by her parents.Stories of his early playing days were laid out by his friends Tommy Armstrong, Brian Malone, Gerry and Noel McCabe.Those days as young lads where they played in a field, set up goals and the youngesttold they were in goal. The humorous story of those times set the evening up well.We also heard from Willie Doyle and Colm Shields of those days in the mid-sixties when the young Colm was starting to make his mark on the Gaelic field. And so the flow of old playing colleagues from St Patrickrsquos High School, Downpatrick, with MacRory Cup memories, Down Minors and U-s of the day.In  Colm played for Down in three Ulster finals in the space of eight days mdash for the seniors, minors and U-s. A quite unique feat and a sign that perhaps greater things would come.Another unique fact was revealed. Colm played in four consecutive minor county finals, one with Loughinisland, one with Annaclone and two with Castlewellan. The great and the good continued to file passed.They told their tales of opponent, rival, colleague and what makes the GAA tick ndash friendship. We all know the headline stories, but it will always be the anecdotal tales behind the stories which give us all the biggest chuckles.Of course there was the glory years where we had Paddy Doherty, Sean OrsquoNeill, Gerry Dougherty, Kevin McIlroy, Donagh OrsquoKane, Barney McAleenan, Liam Sloan, Peter McGinnity, Sean og McGourty, Ray Carolan to name but a few.The little story from Liam Sloan, when back in , he received a call from the Ulster Council to seea trophy Colm won the previous year could be ed to be presented to the next recipient. Liam called to Colmrsquos house where Colm went looking for it. Imagine the scene, Colmrsquos backside sticking out from under the stairs, arm reaching back with each trophy saying ldquodo you think itrsquos that one.There were video messages from Kevin Moran, the great Mick OrsquoDwyer, Sean Cavanagh, Mickey Harte and then of course there was Joe Brolly, who wants to sit down and have a pint with Colm sometime.Colm could turn his hand to any sport. Basketball was always a preferred past time. What was revealed also was when he was at St Josephrsquos Training College was how he became involved in a wee bit of boxing.When members of the Immaculata Boxing Club came over from Divis to lsquoThe Ranchrsquo Colm took up the gloves. They were impressed by his skills. They wanted him to join the sport and even came to watch him play.The young Colm simply did not have the time to fit it in. The one good thing was that, as many of you will remember boxing skills came in handy in the Gaelic football arena back then. Better with the skill than without it.I cannot tell everyonersquos tale but perhaps one of the greatest footballers of all time, the great Kerryrsquos Jack OrsquoShea, paid Colm the greatest of sporting accolades by telling everyone he modelled his game on Colmrsquos.The second Gaelic football, box to box player, learning from the first and had Colm been a Kerry man ndash well you know how many All-Ireland medals hersquod have. This comment met with huge applause and nodding approval for our hero.Another milestone in Colmrsquos illustrious career, sometimes forgotten, was his foresight back then in  to introduce Saturday morning coaching sessions in Castlewellan for potential footballers between six and eleven years of age, a true testimony this practice is still thriving within the club some thirty three years down the road, all due to Colm McAlarney.The most touching tribute of the night came from his daughter Grainne. Hersquos dad and not the hero we know.He is the hero that is her dad. It was only in her early twenties she appreciated the GAA star her dad is. Sometimes, whenever she mentioned her surname, through the medium of her work with Danske Bank, there was then the silence and the pause, then the question, ldquoAnything to Colm  which she would answer with pride and a smile ldquoyes thatrsquos my dad.Hersquos first and foremost a dad. Sitting quietly and elegantly through the evening, watching the proceedings unfold and Irsquom sure bursting with pride, was Theresa, Colmrsquos we. Along with the family she kept the secret of what was months in the making.Her smile and perhaps a quiet reflection on a sporting le which she supported all through the years deserves recognition. Though, I suspect she would be like Colm in that that recognition doesnrsquot sit easy with her either.The final video of the night was delivered to the tunes of My Way and Simply the Best. This was a reflection of a career which spanned four decades. Perhaps most poignant of moments was the final montage from the  Down Senior Championship final where we saw a very proud Michael McAlarney with his son Colm and Colm Og with the Frank OrsquoHare Cup he spoke of bursting with pride of the two men beside him.Colm did it his way, but never to the detriment of others and he is simply the best. All the guests rose to their feet, once again, when the red book was handed over. The evening wasnrsquot over yet. There was another award. One from within his own club. Castlewellan chairman Kevin Sweeney, came to the podium and announced that Colm was the worthy recipient of the Castlewellan Hall of Fame award.Some of our previous proud winners were there to see Colm presented the Johnny OrsquoNeill Trophy by Johnnyrsquos son, our vice-chairman, John OrsquoNeill. Colm is now among a special group of people within our club.Well done to Kevan Owens, Kevin Sweeney, Gerry Dougherty, Liam Sloan and Barney McAleenan. This is the team who put the night together and they deserve our praise and appreciation.So, there you have it - the word hero ndash you know by now itrsquos a big one.Kitty Kelley said that a hero is someone we can admire without apology. I use the word unashamedly. By the way, that  year-old I mentioned at the beginning was the late Gerry Rushfrom the Bann Road. He was a very proud Fontenoy, my friend and a McAlarney man.JR went to his eternal rest in October , but his spirit was there on Friday night to pay tribute to a very special local hero..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"McNamara and Murray strikes send Olympic into raptures  ","story":"TWO goals in a mesmeric three-minute first half spell proved decisive as Ballynahinch Olympic secured their place in the Christmas showpiece final against Crumlin Star.Strikes from Niall Murray and Chris McNamara had Olympic purring, but they took their foot off the gas after the break and nearly threw it all away.Orangefield huffed and puffed for most of the second half, but a determined Olympic restricted them to a solitary strike from Vitalis Ogunwa in the th minute.There wasnrsquot much to write home about in the opening exchanges, but Olympic looked the more comfortable in possession with their fluid and ambitious -- formation.Orangefield had the first shot in anger when William Gracey had a shot from the edge of the box well blocked by the impressive Chris Magee. Owen Peden then had a header blocked as Orangefield had penalty appeals for hand ball waved away.Stuart Nelson had a shot comfortably saved by Ryan Walsh as Orangefield probed for an opening, but Olympic were nor for yielding.However, the east Belfast side committed a cardinal sin by ping their guard and affording the roaming Murray and Nathan Jones far too much space and time on the ball.Jones served notice of intent in the rd minute when he was picked out totally unmarked on the right side of the box, but he contrived to screw his shot badly wide.Three minutes Ryan Molloy instigated one of Olympicrsquos trademark moves when he released Murray. Without even having to look up to see his options, Murray immediately fed Jones, but Glenn Taylor denied him with a parried save.With  minutes gone and Olympic in the middle of a power play, Jones again found space down the right and played an angled pass in behind centre half Jonathan Doey that was latched on to by Murray and he beat Taylor all ends up with a sweet strike.It was - three minutes later. A sweeping pitch- move, started out on the left by the immaculate Dalton Tate, ended with Chris McNamara, who was involved in the build-up, converting a sublime pass from Jones.Jones could easily have made it - in the st minute, but his well-struck shot was tipped round the post by Taylor. Jones then played a brilliant ball into the path of Murray, but he was denied by an alert Taylor who rushed off his line to interceptTaylor saved from McNamara at the start of the second half, but Olympic strangely retreated into a defensive shell with Jones being starved of possession and Murray and McNamara being forced to live off crumbs.It was at this stage of the game that Ryan Noade really started imposing himself on proceedings and he revelled in providing protection to his back three with numerous, telling tackles and interceptions where it mattered.Orangefield were seeing much more of the ball, but they were never able to hurt Olympic.If anything, Olympic still carried a greater goal threat with Jones having a free kick blocked and Stevie Noade flashing one wide after Jones threaded the ball into his path.Orangefield managed to reduce the arrears in the th minute when Ogunwa beat the offside trap inside the box and drilled an unstoppable effort past Ryan Walsh.Despite applying intense pressure, Orangefield never looked like equalising and with the  minutes almost up, Olympic hit them on the break only for Murray to blast wildly over the bar with only Taylor to beat.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Chris Magee, Ryan Noade, Conor Reid, Jason Noade, Dalton Tate, Stevie Noade, Niall Murray, Nathan Jones, Ryan Molloy, Chris McNamara.

The scale of the crisis is quite simply breathtaking and the figures speak for themselves.Mr Savage said an estimated , applications had been made for social housing district-wide, with almost , of applicants placed in the urgent need category.He continued: ldquoThese figures highlight the terrible extent of the housing crisis in this district. Enough is enough, it is time for us to take action and time for everyone to put their shoulder to the wheel to tackle this mounting problem.ldquoThe conference is the first step in getting sustainable solutions at a time when the people we represent cannot get a place they can call home. The Department of Communities has an obligation to come and play a lead role because it oversees the Housing Executive and needs to hear first hand the level of need in the district and work with us all to provide collaborative solutions to the problem.Cllr Savage added: ldquoWe need to explore all the options. Access to a home is a fundamental human right and we need to act swtly so the current generation is not left without a place to live.Cllr Billy Walker said all elected representatives are approached about the lack of social housing on a daily basis and that not one of the part of the district is not affected by the current crisis.ldquoWe need this conference to pull all the key players together and we must be robust with them on this issue. We need solutions going forward and this conference is the perfect opportunity to do just that, he added.Cllr Davy Hyland said the council needed to do what it could to find solutions for people in desperate need of housing, while Cllr David Taylor said a lack of resources was not helping the housing crisis which had left people on the waiting list for several years in some cases.He added: ldquoWe need a new social housing strategy and need all the key players to buy into this. We also need funding to meet the demand which exists.Cllr Andy McMurray said he was ldquoacutely aware of the trauma associated with being on the waiting list for social housing, describing the waiting list figures as ldquopretty shocking, while Cllr Jarlath Tinnelly suggested the social housing crisis ldquohas gone well beyond crisis point.Cllr Willie Clarke described Newcastle as a priority area and warned that the current social housing shortage has the potential to get worse in the months and years ahead.He said there is a particular need for accommodation for small families, highlighting the problems social housing providers face when they have to compete with private developers to secure building land.Cllr John Trainor said that while work on a major social housing scheme was underway at the old Downe Hospital site in Downpatrick, it was important to plan for the townrsquos needs over the next five to  years..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Murlough runners in full flow  ","story":"ON a wet Saturday morning, some  Murlough AC members made their way across the province to Loughgall in Co Armagh to complete the third race in Born  Runrsquos Run Forest Run series.There is no other way to describe the day other than it chucked it down, our feet were well and truly soaked before the race began.

Children who are educated together create friendships which last for the rest of their lives, she continued.ldquoWe believe that there are more opportunities for children in integrated education which can provide them with a broader experience a safe, neutral environment where people can mix with each other and help us create a genuine, shared future for everyone.Mrs McAlpine explained the aim locally is to create the new steering group to take the post-primary project forward and write to existing controlled schools to testthey would be interested in transforming to integrated status.She said this would be a ldquofundamental change which may be dficult for some, confirming that existing schools preferred to maintain the collective status quo, the Mid Down steering group would adopt a greenfield approach for a new school.ldquoNICIE will be delighted to support parents in favour of new integrated post-primary provision as in all consciousness we cannot allow the current situation to continue as it is. You have around  children not being able to secure a post-primary place in the integrated sector and I think there is something we can do to redress the imbalance, she said.ldquoWe want to provide provide a much better future for post primary integrated education in the Mid Down area and hope to form a new steering group before Christmas and then contact controlled schools in the New Year to testthey wish to transform to integrated status.ldquoI have asked the Department of Educationwould it start a site search for me and I have an idea where a new school could be located but not a specic site. We currently have an integrated school at Blackwater in Downpatrick which I believe has never had the chance to reach its full potential as its site is quite restricted.Mrs McAlpine added: ldquoI am trying to get something that will enable us,the children would like to transfer, to get everybody on the same site and we would hope to have new post-primary integrated provision in the Mid Down area by , either in an existing school or via a new-build project..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New principal at Knockevin Special School  ","story":"THE new principal at Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick is looking forward to her new role with relish.While Sara Liddell has been acting principal since the start of the new school term, her appointment as Mrs Anne Cooperrsquos successor was only confirmedrecently and she says she is delighted to be at the helm of a school which has a special place in the heart of the community.Sara always wanted to work in special education and feels privileged to head up a school where work on a much-needed new extension is expected to start next September.The former Down High School student worked at Tor Bank Special School in Dundonald before moving to Knockevin, where she was a teacher and vice-principal for four years before taking over as principal.From Downpatrick, the new principal has a close link with Knockevin as her brother Jamie was educated at the school.ldquoI always wanted to work in special education and wanted to be here in Knockevin because it really is such a special place, said Sara. ldquoWhile I was studying at Stranmillis I did my teaching practice here which was lovely for me.ldquoThere is such warmth in the community for the school which has such a lovely, family feel about it. I obviously knew the school because Jamie came here and know how special it is. I wanted to work in special education because I saw what Jamie was able to achieve.ldquoJamie came through Knockevin and while he has his challenges, he was able to leave school and secure a job a few days a week which is great. My brother learned so much because he was educated here.ldquoThere is so much warmth about this place and I am fortunate to work with a wonderful staff team. Everyone, including pupils and families were so supportive to my family when Jamie was a pupil here. That sparked my interest in special education and was why I always wanted to work in this field, Sara explained.Knockevin is split across two sites, with an Early Years centre in Dundrum catering for  children and  pupils based in Downpatrick with a - strong teaching staff across both locations.ldquoWe are the only special school for a wide geographical area and have pupils coming from as far away as Kilkeel and Newry, with others closer to home coming from the Downpatrick, Ardglass, Strangford, Crossgar and Killinchy areas, the new principal continued.ldquoI am looking forward to my new role and already knowing the staff, pupils and families has been a big help. Knowing I have their genuine support is really wonderful.Given that it is the only special school in the local area, Knockevin is oversubscribed, with Sara explaining her appointment coincides with what she described as a ldquochallenging time.She continued: ldquoWe have a good reputation which has been enhanced with the new early years centre in Dundrum which is a real centre of excellence and we have huge numbers coming through, she continued.ldquoWe are pushed for space in Downpatrick, but Knockevin is in the school enhancement programme and work on a new extension will hopefully start next September, replacing mobile classrooms with a new permanent structure and it is a really exciting time to be part of this.Tendering documents are currently being prepared ahead of the start of building work which is expected to take  months to complete to meet what the new principal described as a ldquohuge need in the area.As Sara settles into her new role, she admits the fact she was vice-principal for four years has made the transition a smooth process.ldquoThere is so much love and warmth for the school across the community and local people are fantastic. May aim moving forward is to harness that warmth to give our pupils lots of new opportunities, she explained.ldquoWe already have a fantastic work experience programme where seniors go out and so many businesses have been so supportive. This is something I really want to build on, strengthening our school links.ldquoWe have been involved in a few projects with the Assumption Grammar in Ballynahinch and St Patrickrsquos Grammar in Downpatrick which produced benefits for everyone involved. As a former Down High student I have been able to establish a link with its student council which is really beneficial.Sara believes that linking Knockevin with other schools is important as it provides young people with an insight into what a special school is ldquodemystying the issues around it. She is also pleased her students can attend other schools to use a range of specialist facilities which provide access to art and drama, science and technology in particular.ldquoIt is amazing how other schools have opened up to us. We are delighted with their support which I believe says a lot about this area. Our staff and parents are also very committed and we are involved in a shared education project with Sacred Heart Primary in Dundrum.Sara added: ldquoOur neighbours at St Colmcillersquos Primary School are also supporting us with the P pupils selecting Knockevin as their chosen charity and when some of the pupils visited us recently they used makaton signing to communicate with some of our students.ldquoI am lucky to be the principal of a school which enjoys the warmth and support of so many people.

Organisers say the service is open to all, not just those who have a relative who took their own le.Ailish Teague, who helped establish Le Change Changes Lives with her husband, Manus, said the service will be held in the charityrsquos new home for the first time.ldquoIt is a joint service organised alongside PIPS and it will be the third we have organised. PIPS initially came up with the idea and asked could they use our new premises which we were delighted to make available, she explained.ldquoThere has been a very good response over the past two years, with the service an evening where people can join together in their grief and remember loved ones collectively. Relatives are alongside others who have experienced the same pain and there is a lot of empathy and understanding.Ailish said the service is open to people from across the district and explained that there will be an opportunity for people to place the names of their loved ones on a Christmas tree.ldquoPeople are given as much time as they need and this can, for some, be a cathartic experience.

It is always a very emotional service and there are very few people who donrsquot know some family that has been touched by it.Ailish explained that all the names placed on the tree this year will be kept and placed alongside those gathered over the past two years with the intention of placing them in a time capsule at some point in the future which will be buried locally.She continued: ldquoChristmas is a dficult time for families and that is why we do not decorate our tree located at the front of our building which looks out on to Market Street. There is no tinsel or lights.ldquoThis time of year can be troubling for many families and we choose not to decorate our tree which is much like the empty chair in many peoplersquos homes as their loved ones are no longer here.Ailish said the tree is decorated by those who have lost their lives, not through suicide, but due to mental health problems and addictions, highlighting the importance of people recognising this.She added: ldquoIt is depression that kills, not the selfish act of an irrational mind. People think suicide is a selfish act, but it is not.ldquoWe are extending an open invitation to next Thursday eveningrsquos service and people who have lost loved ones, regardless of the reason, are welcome to join us.ldquoWe would like them to join us and place a small decoration on the Christmas tree in memory of a loved one.

For the past few years we have been unable to tell Tourism NI or Bord Faacuteilte when our festivals were likely to take place as the local authority does not even have a calendar of events looking forward.ldquoMost festivals run at the same time each year in the Down area and it would not be a dficult task to publish a calendar that would cover a five year period to include both council tourism and community-led events.Cllr Enright believes the introduction of such a calendar would have several benefits, ensuring there would be no overlapping of festivals in the same area, allowing Tourism NI to be aware of them well in advance and local festivals and events appearing in their brochures and in tourism offices at home and abroad.Gerry Casey, from the Ardglass Festival Association, described the current funding mechanism in place for community festivals as ldquoinadequate.He continued: ldquoVillages cannot plan ahead with such short-term annualised funding. The process in the new council makes funding for these festivals precarious and uncertain from year to year and inhibits festival organisers booking in advance to get best prices or being able to secure match funding from where.ldquoThe Ardglass festival has been running for  consecutive years and been funded for  of those. Over the past two years, ours was one of the community festivals that had been unsuccessful in securing council funding.Mr Casey added: ldquoAs we approach our th anniversary, it would be a boostwe knew we had funding in good time, allowing our festival to be included in tourism brochures next year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/9130741.jpg","title":"yacht club claim proposed new boathouse site by rnli would be a waste of donations","story":"Lough Erne Yacht Clubhas accused the RNLI of changing its mind over a proposed site for the building of a new boathouse and have claimed that the project would be a ldquowaste of donations.The LEYC has hosted the RNLI temporary boathouse on its site for the past  years but says that the proposed new site would ldquohave a detrimental effect on the club and sailing in the bay.Now, however, the RNLI has made a planning application for a new leboat station at Gublusk Bay and in a letter to members, seen by the Impartial Reporter, the LEYC has said that it will be objecting.In its letter, by Commodore John Carton, the LEYC has said that it is ldquodisappointed that the RNLI have decided to go ahead with their application to build a boathouse on the shore of Gublusk Bay.The letter goes on to say that the situation is ldquoespecially disappointing since the RNLI were originally given a site one mile away which would give them more visibility.In a statement the RNLI said: ldquoThe RNLI have submitted a planning application for the building of a new leboat station for Enniskillen RNLI, comprising a boathouse and associated facilities, including the erection of slipway, installation of holding tank, landscaping and associated site and access works on a site at Gublusk Bay. It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

that an important segment of her sworn evidence to the RHI Inquiry is #wrong#, relating to when she was told about the belief that her Spad delayed RHI cost controls.The DUP leader’s admission comes in one of  new witness statements which the inquiry published last night ahead of its final oral hearings next week.Arlene Foster had told Stephen Nolan that she had no idea why cost controls were delayedIn October, senior Stormont civil servant Andrew McCormick told the inquiry that Mrs Foster’s account of what happened on the night of Stephen Nolan’s seminal interview with the DUP leader where she responded to Jonathan Bell’s allegations simply could not be accurate.Under pressure from the BBC man’s questioning in December , the then-First Minister told the public that she had “no idea” why cost controls on the out-of-control RHI scheme had been delayed.The inquiry has heard several pieces of evidence which show that her closest advisers – who spent hours preparing her for the huge interview – had been told by Dr McCormick of the allegation that it was her special adviserAndrew Crawford who had worked in the shadows to delay cost controls.However, Mrs Foster’s version of events – which like Dr McCormick’s evidence was given under oath – was that Dr McCormick had never said that directly to her until after the interview during a conversation which she seemed to recall clearly, describing his demeanour as “sheepish”. Her account was endorsed by DUP minister Simon Hamilton, who was also in Stormont Castle that night.However, Dr McCormick said thatthat conversation did occur it could not have been after the recording – and therefore would have to have been before Mrs Foster told the public she had “no idea” why cost controls were delayed. He set out in detail how and why he had left Stormont before the interview even began and did not speak to Mrs Foster over the following days.Now Mrs Foster has rowed back from what she told the inquiry, saying in a fresh written statement that Dr McCormick may be correct – but evenhe is, she stands over her claim at the time that she had “no idea” why cost controls were delayed. She said: “Given the febrile atmosphere...it is possible that I am wrong about the sequencing of Dr McCormick telling me his view that Dr Crawford delayed the scheme. “However, regardless of when Dr McCormick’s belief was communicated to me, I was already aware of the contents of Dr Crawford’s emails and would have taken the view that there was insufficient evidence at that time to draw any conclusions about the reasons for delay in the scheme, hence my reply to Mr Nolan that ‘I had no idea’.“I would not have voiced publicly an unsubstantiated comment of that nature. Indeed, I remain of the view that to repeat this unsubstantiated allegation to Mr Nolan, particularly in the circumstances that prevailed at the time, would have been inappropriate.“I did have no idea as to the facts of what took place and therefore I do not believe that my reply to Mr Nolan was contrary to the principle of openness within the seven principles of public le.”Dr Crawford has also taken issue with a claim from Dr McCormick that the DUP spad told him at a dinner in October  that he thought RHI funding was coming from the Treasury and therefore it was possible to “fill our boots”.Loughinisland: Ex-officers lodge appeal over Justice Keegan judgement‘Children who witnessed brutal killing could be at risk of PTSD’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Dr McCormick said: “This statement is not true. At no time did I make this or any similar comment, I believe that Dr McCormick made this misleading and inaccurate comment to deflect any criticism of his role in relation to the RHI scheme and this has resulted in a great deal of negative publicity towards myself.”Dr Crawford pointed out that Dr McCormick had been asked about the conversation on several occasions by the inquiry and had not used the phrase “fill our boots” until his final appearance before the inquiry.In oral evidence to the inquiry Dr Crawford had been asked about the conversation and said that he could not recall what had been said.But in a statement to the inquiry last month Dr Crawford said that he now believed the conversation could not have been at the October  dinner because he does not believe he attended it.However, when the inquiry put fresh evidence to Dr Crawford, in a fresh statement on Tuesday he accepted: “It appears I did in fact attend the  NIFDA dinner. “I did not remember having done so and am grateful to the inquiry for giving me the opportunity to correct the evidence in my last statement on the issue.”try catch  TrendingSnow forecast for N.I. this week - tonights temperature to drop to -degCFatal shooting: Man gunned down outside schoolWhat we know so far about the man shot dead outside N.I. schoolGunned down in front of terried school kidsNI youngster, ,rushed to hospital after taking white powder          ..

of a generation from the rural community of Magheramorne, outside Larne.The local woman, who passed away peacefully on November  at her son’s home, was in her th year and had spent her working le in farming.Formerly of Watchill Road, Straid, she is believed to have been the last of her generation of classmates from the Mullaghmossin School at Magheramorne to have now passed away.Mrs Beattie was the only child of James and Mary Millar of Aldfreck townland, Ballycarry, and she attended Mullaghmossin Public Elementary School at Magheramorne, where the principal was Mr DA Hawthorne and Miss Poag was another of her teachers.The family lived close to the main shore road through Magheramorne and she would walk a few miles up the braes from the Millar farm to Ballyedward townland, where she reached the county road which led to the school.It is a sign of the passage of time that the Mullaghmossin School she attended has long since closed down and Magheramorne, which once had at least three schools, no longer has any.The photograph of the classmates of  includes many of her neighbours Jack Millar, Tom Stuart, Tommy Liddle, Margaret Workman, Nancy Smyth, Mary Blair, Adam Semple, Alex Liddle and Sandy Hunter among them.After her school years, Cissie worked on the farm at Aldfreck and, in , she married Hugh Beattie , and moved to Ardboley near Straid, where the couple would raise two sons.Over the years she still maintained friendships which had been forged while she was growing up and living in Magheramorne and she always had a keen interest in the area.She was a former member of Glynn Women’s Institute, but her abiding interest was in the loyal orders, in which her two sons, Arthur and Thomas, were deeply involved over the years.Mrs Beattie was a member of the Old Orange Hall ladies committee at Magheramorne for many years, helping with events such as the installation dinners of the lodge, and also a keen supporter of Magheramorne LOL , RBP  \u2028and Magheramorne Silver Band. Among those who attended her funeral were many members of the local lodges and the Larne Black District Chapter, of which her son Arthur is Worshipful District Master.The funeral service from her son’s residence at Carrickfergus was to Raloo Presbyterian Churchyard, and was conducted at both locations by Rev Ricky Montgomery. A piper led the mourners to the graveside.Mrs Beattie was predeceased by her husband Hugh and her son Thomas, who died in .

This visit, however, seems to be more about telling us what we should do rather than listening.“Rather than a roadshow selling the fundamentally flawed Withdrawal Agreement, I would prefer the Government would listen to MPs all on sides of the House Commons and finally acknowledge the backstop is dangerous for Northern Ireland and the entire United Kingdom.”He continued: “The Withdrawal Agreement is an international legally binding Treaty which would place a customs and regulatory border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain contrary to the direct pledges of the Prime Minister. It leaves the entire United Kingdom trapped in the backstop arrangements until the EU decides to release us.“These are not just my observations but also the view of the Government’s Attorney General as stated in his recently published legal advice to Cabinet.“I understand why businesses want certainty about the future trading relationship with the EU but this is not the best of both worlds for Northern Ireland.Even the Chancellor of the Exchequer has had to admit the backstop is a bad arrangement for the economy and the Union.And the Prime Minister herself now says no one likes it!”Mr Dodds adsded: “I want to see a sensible deal and we can get one.This is not a binary choice between this Withdrawal Agreement and no deal. It is time for the Government to recognise the genuine opposition to this Withdrawal Agreement and seek fundamental change by getting rid of the backstop. With London, Dublin and Brussels all stating categorically that they will not build a hard border in any circumstances, there is no need for this backstop arrangement.”N.I. war graves attacked by vandals using I.R.A. graffiti Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingSnow forecast for N.I. this week - tonights temperature to drop to -degCFatal shooting: Man gunned down outside schoolWhat we know so far about the man shot dead outside N.I. schoolGunned down in front of terried school kidsNI youngster, ,rushed to hospital after taking white powder          ..

contrary to what M#irt#n # Muilleoir told the inquiry.Aidan McAteer was removed as a special adviserunder a law passed by the Assembly which barred him from that post because of a past IRA conviction.Mairtin # Muilleoir told the inquiry that Sinn F#in paid Mr McAteers salaryHowever, Sinn Féin set up a system whereby he was given even more seniority than a normal spad, and was managing not only the party’s spads but the party’s ministers as well.The system was not made public at the time.Under close questioning at the inquiry in October, former Sinn Féin Finance Minister Máirtín Ó Muilleoir accepted that the party had disagreed with the legislation and – regardless of the fact that it failed to stop it becoming law – it had consciously acted to ensure that it would have no effect.Referring to Mr McAteer, he said that “of course, Sinn Féin paid that wage” and that “we would’ve much rather he was paid from public funds but public funds were not allowed to be used for his employment”.However, Sinn Féin has now accepted that Mr McAteer’s salary was funded by taxpayers through a little-known Assembly funding stream intended for staff who assist the work of MLAs in the legislature rather than the Executive.In a written statement published by the inquiry last night, Sinn Féin MLA Caral Ni Chuilin said that Mr McAteer’s salary “was paid through public funds, specically the FAPPScheme to carry out related to the Assembly and to work with myself as chief whip alongside carrying out other duties identied by the deputy First Minister and authorised by myself”.But even though he was paid by the Assembly, and nominally employed by Ms Ni Chuilin, Mr McAteer said that he was “directed by the deputy First Minister”.Mr McAteer said: “My status as a party apointee was well known within the government system both at civil service and political level... the issue of my role and position was never raised or presented as a problem.”Foster accepts some of her sworn RHI evidence may have been wrongLoughinisland: Ex-officers lodge appeal over Justice Keegan judgement Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingSnow forecast for N.I. this week - tonights temperature to drop to -degCFatal shooting: Man gunned down outside schoolWhat we know so far about the man shot dead outside N.I. schoolGunned down in front of terried school kidsNI youngster, ,rushed to hospital after taking white powder          ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey. Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/les_1.jpg","title":"a word from the wise les mccracken","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business Name: Les McCracken Position: Managing director, McCue Crafted Fit How did you get to the position you are in today I’m a big believer in work ethic. When I was young,  or so, I had a summer job on a farm. I would have milked  cows, morning and night, in addition to general duties around the farm. I was probably working  hours a week at that time, plus cycling five miles back and forth. It has stood me in good stead throughout my le. If you apply yourself, you can do anything.What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  In short, people. They are the greatest assets to a company but they can also be the biggest challenge. I’ve been fortunate enough to build a fantastic team around me at McCue but that has taken time. I’ve been here over  years and we’ve organically grown over that period from  employees and a turnover of £, to  employees and £m. It is also worth noting that in our sector there is a lack of skilled people, when you train them up some leave, which is disappointing but you have to train them and hope they stay. More must be done to engender the younger generation in to these skilled jobs. Too many are still going aimlessly in to third level education not knowing what they want to do, whereas they can earn as you learn in a trade, and that is much needed across the manufacturing sector.How would you describe your management style  I like to think I have a good management style, most of the time I’m very easy going and I do believe in autonomy. I expect those with responsibility to be capable and willing to do their job to the highest of their ability. I also have an open door policy allowing anyone to come and discuss problems but please bring with you a solution too.This allows my team to complete projects around the world from Vienna to Milan to Stockholm. We’ve been very fortunate to work with great brands, both in retail and hospitality, and on some fantastic projects from Ten Trinity Square in London to Danske Bank in Belfast and around Northern Ireland.What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  Of course, who wouldn’t say things could be done dferently, and better  Nobody is perfect, there’s always room for improvement. If I was to work until I was  years old, I would still learn something new every day.Have you done it all on your own  No, of course not. Who does  After  years I’ve a fantastic team who are very competent and trustworthy. But it has taken hard work and graft to get here. Today is very dferent to  years ago and for me I chose the right path. Today, you can enter this sector via a trade, an apprenticeship or a university background it’s about the right fit and enjoying what you do.How would you like your business to be remembered  McCue Crafted Fit is bigger than I. It’s been going for  years and providing unquestionable quality work. Like Jimmy McCue, who set this company up, when I choose to go, I hope to be remembered as a good leader who left the company in the best possible shape. Thirty years is a long time to be managing director and I have seen many changes in skill base, technology from hand drawn floor plans to full colour D fully explosive plans. It certainly has been an interesting three decades or so. I’d also like to note that McCue weathered the recession very well. I took some strategic decisions in  and , which ensured we not only held our own, but grew as a company.What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you Be patient. Time will come. Don’t think you know everything, as each day you’ll learn something new.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/k11.jpg","title":"kainos sees profits and sales surge","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT firm Kainos has seen a sales and profits surge with revenue rising by % to £.m for the first half of the year. And boss Brendan Mooney says it is “disappointing” that a political argument around Brexit is “over-shadowing” the business case, which is largely supportive of the withdrawal deal currently on the table. The company, which has it headquarters in Belfast, saw adjusted pre-tax profit rising % - from £.m to £.m, in the six months to the end of September. It says much of the increase is down to the expansion of its Workday business throughout Europe. It says “to support the continued expansion with our Workday-related business, in Europe we continue to grow from our recently established offices in Frankfurt and Copenhagen, alongside our existing offices in Amsterdam and Gdansk”. “In North America we continue to expand our presence in Boston and Atlanta and we will open an office in Toronto in the next few weeks.” Brendan Mooney, the firm’s chief executive, told Ulster Business “There is no single reason or new reason .” He said the firms government commercial work was still a very strong part of the business, with a move towards digitalisation. “In Workday, as it rolls out across the world, there is great demand for the service as well. “There is underlying geographical expansion and signicant revenue outside the UK – we are seeing growth across Europe.” The company has grown its workforce to , – up again on the previous year, and has continued to grow. Of that,  workers are based at its Belfast and Londonderry offices which Brendan says “are a very important part of our business, and that trend will continue”. On Brexit, from a company perspective, Brendan says the services it provides to government are “not linked to Brexit”. “For us, it doesn’t get impacted by the Brexit direction – we are pragmatic on that. “In terms of Northern Ireland, the reality is… conversations about a political impact, they are over-shadowing what businesses are talking about and that’s disappointing.” He said looking forward at the next five years, the rise in demand for areas such as machine learning could form a much bigger part of the business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/223.jpg","title":"lunns opening m rolex store in city","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by Ulster Business Luxury watch and jewellery business Lunn’s is opening a new £m Rolex store in Belfast city centre. The family-owned firm is taking on an empty unit at the front of Queen’s Arcade at Donegall Place. It already has its flagship store at the arcade. It comes as the company has unveiled a new Rolex workshop at its Belfast base, which means it can carry out servicing of the watches in-house. Earlier this year, it was announced that Queen’s Arcade would undergo a major £m facelt. Peter Lunn, chairman of Lunn’s Jewellers, said the decision by Rolex to open in Belfast is “a huge endorsement for the city”. “Rolex is one of the world’s true super-brands and to have their store on Donegall Place, the city’s main retail thoroughfare, is a major expression of confidence. The store will offer customers a truly immersive experience of the brand. “We are also very excited to be opening a fully accredited Rolex workshop, which will help owners to maintain the value and ensure the quality of their watches by having them serviced by skilled technicians on site at Queen’s Arcade. It represents a big investment in Rolex parts and machinery, but we believe it is an essential part of the authentic Rolex experience.” Richard de Leyser, managing director, Rolex UK, said: “I’m delighted that Lunn’s continues to invest in our partnership and excited at the prospect of expanding the Rolex offering in Queen’s Arcade. “The plans to extend the space dedicated to Rolex and provide a new and engaging customer experience will perfectly position Lunn’s to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing retail environment. “The contemporary space will complement the historic architecture of Queen’s Arcade and provide a fitting home for Rolex.  We are proud to partner Lunn’s in this new development which will further enhance the unrivalled service to our customers in Northern Ireland.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said. Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”.

A deal is on the table, though.Nick says that, aside from issues around getting staff, a transition must be in place after March  for export certicates, otherwise he can’t sell product outside the UK.“I have an ambition to get it to the mid-s . We are growing our EBITA from the £m average to about £m.”Pre-tax profits have cracked the £m mark in the last year, while turnover has soared by almost £m to £m.Nick says he turned his attention to attracting back some of the farmers which it has lost to other competitors.“At one point we had a billion litres of milk, now it’s around  million. We hadn’t been paying a particularly good milk price. “What ithad done is invested in itself quite heavily, and invested in the future, and had made a really brave strategic decision in , long before I came here, to get out of producing milk powders, and getting in to cheese and whey.“Now, that cost them £m to do that. That was really brave.“The first thing we did was get out to farmers, and explain to them what their business was.“We have paid a leading milk price, and that has brought genuine pride.“We needed to get into the business. The most fundamental change – it’s a people agenda. We were a very centralised business and all decisions came from the top, and went out.“Now, we have put the business into seven strategic business units and we are getting more adept with strategy, day-to-day, and developing people within the business to take ownership.”Nick says it’s about getting the right people into the business, and helping mentor and develop strong teams to ensure Dale Farm’s success.“We have spent a lot of money on additional people in the business. It’s not about numbers, it’s not about capacity, it’s about capability. We are really trying to find world-class people. gtHe said the firm will spend another £m on its people this year. Meanwhile, data and decision making is another area it’s expanding and developing. gt“We have a little bit of latency in the business, and I’m saying how do I get live information to those people ”That includes looking at new markets and products. Nick says the business had been focusing on the macro, and perhaps missed potential opportunities.“We have massive opportunities for growth,” he said. “The EBITA growth isn’t necessarily about growing your top-line, although it will grow a bit. We process  million litres of milk. Are you making sure you are making products which will give you the most profit from that – the answer to that is no.“We can switch categories and products, and we can make a whole lot more money with the  million litres. “It’s looking at consumer trends by getting out of commoditised type products and getting in to more value-added products. That’s about understanding your consumer.”He said the business has made “serious traction” in the last two years, as a company. As for growth in the future, with March  around the corner, Nick says it will continue “as long as there isn’t something mad and disruptive from Brexit”.“That could happen. A ‘no deal’ and no transition Brexit is mad and disruptive and changes everything. I don’t think people have really looked at it, and really understand what it means. We have looked at it, and it’s very challenging.”For Dale Farm, Nick’s Brexit concerns centre around staff and people – with around % of the workforce EU nationals.Nick says the company has struggled to get lorry drivers when milk supply is at its peak.But for Dale Farm, and other food processors, there is a concern over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says.“For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t.“It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate.“I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now.”“Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.”Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy output goes to the EU and the rest of the world. “In milk, milk keeps flowing. We can’t say to farmers ‘we can’t sell the product, can’t get the certicates, tell the cows to take a break for a few weeks’. It doesn’t happen.“I’m going to have to reassess... ‘how long can I survive not selling my % of dairy off the island ’“If there is a no-transition no-deal Brexit it will be really bad for business. Supply chains will be severely disputed and you’ll have a shortage of products everywhere.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sk_123.jpg","title":"more than  of business group members back brexit withdrawal deal","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s business community has overwhelming thrown its weight behind a withdrawal agreement on Brexit – with almost % of one major lobby group’s members in favour, it can be revealed.The CBI, Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce, Federation of Small Businesses and IoD are among the groups which have backed the deal on the table. Meanwhile, farming unions in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK have also issued their support for the deal.It would essentially provide a backstop, and create a deeper customs union between Northern Ireland the EU, along with a closer alignment in the single market.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI says that the agreement is “the only show in town.”He said a poll of its members showed .% of those who replied were in support.“This is the only show in town. The rules are clear – in order for the UK to move to the most productive discussion on what the future relationship will be, we need a withdrawal agreement. The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before.
