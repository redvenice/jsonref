This could include simplifying tariffs and removing them completely on goods where Britain has no or limited domestic production, it said.\u0027It is vitally important that we now move away from the complex tariff schedule imposed on us by the European Union,\u0027 Truss said, adding that special arrangements would apply to goods entering Northern Ireland.The government also said it would also begin reviewing 43 EU trade remedy measures which were considered important to British industries, including anti-dumping duties of up to 36.1 per cent on imports of ceramic kitchen and tableware from China. "},{"url":null,"title":"Flashing spectator does best golfers PGA tournament Arizona","story":"Share this article The woman then does it again before the spectator adds: \u0027No wonder he misses this putt.\u0027  Fans were quick to react to the woman\u0027s antics, which ided opinions online.  Welshman James quipped: \u0027Are the playing for the Ry-DD-er Cup?\u0027Mint Crow joked: \u0027FORE-play.\u0027               he video - which has gone viral on social media, getting over 600,000 views and 15,000 likes - then pans around the golfers as they prepare to puttBut others were left unimpressed, with one Twitter user saying: \u0027No place on the golf course for that type of behavior.\u0027US golfer Webb Simpson, 34, won in a play-off on Sunday after he birdied the final two holes of regulation to force a playoff with Tony Finau, then won with a 10-foot birdie putt on the first extra hole.Two strokes ahead with two holes left, Finau missed an 18-foot birdie try in the playoff on the par-4 18th after driving left into the church pew bunkers.Simpson two-putted from the fringe on the short par-4 17th and made a 17-footer from the edge of the green on the 18th.

Armed police shot dead terrorist Sudesh Amman, who was wearing a fake suicide vest, after he grabbed a knife from a shop and a female nursery teacher and another man          The father-of-one, originally from Birmingham, had previously served long sentences for drugs supply offences and moved to the North East to make a break from gangs.Meanwhile, Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, head of UK counter-terror policing, said the \u0027threat is, despite our best efforts, not diminishing\u0027, after a third attack in as many months.The UK\u0027s terror threat level is currently set at \u0027substantial\u0027, meaning an attack is likely. It was downgraded from \u0027severe\u0027, the second highest rating, in November, shortly before the London Bridge attack.Convicted terrorist Sudesh Amman wore a fake suicide belt as he grabbed a knife from a shop in Streatham High Road, south London, on Sunday, before stabbing two bystanders.The 20-year-old had been jailed for possessing and distributing terrorist documents in December 2018, but was freed automatically halfway through his sentence less than a fortnight ago.He was put under 24-hour police surveillance on his release after it is understood security services regarded him as an \u0027extremely concerning inidual\u0027.Mr Basu said: \u0027Police and the security services knew the attacker posed a significant risk and we were, unfortunately, proved right in our decision to place him under surveillance.\u0027But with 3,000 or so subjects of interest currently on our radar, and many convicted terrorists soon due to be released from prison, we simply cannot watch all of them, all the time.\u0027He welcomed plans announced on Monday by Justice Secretary Robert Buckland, who said the urgent legislation was needed to make sure that offenders serve two-thirds of their sentence before they are considered eligible for release, at which point their case would be considered by a panel of specialist judges and psychiatrists at the Parole Board.There are 224 terrorists in prison in Britain, with most thought to be holding Islamist extremist views, according to the latest published figures to the end of September.As many as 50 terrorists could be freed from jail this year, figures suggest.         Met Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu (pictured) said the sheer scale of the challenge meant that officers needed the public\u0027s help to stop future terror attacks         Police investigate at the scene on Monday following the terror attack in Streatham on SundayThe Whitehall official said the attack in Streatham highlighted an issue surrounding terrorists with relatively short prison sentences.\u0027There aren\u0027t many terrorist offenders who will be in that similar kind of scenario but if there are any then that\u0027s too many and that\u0027s what we are looking to fix,\u0027 the official said.The Government plans to introduce the legislation in the Commons on Tuesday next week, with the aim of clearing the House by the time it rises for recess on Thursday.The Bill will then go to the Lords on February 25 with the aim of getting royal assent on February 27.\u0027There are no terrorist offenders who are due to receive automatic release before that date,\u0027 the official said.The source said the Lords, where the Government does not have a majority, should \u0027wish to carry out its scrutiny quickly\u0027 as \u0027we cannot continue to be in a position where the state has no power to block the release of terrorists who continue to pose a threat to the public\u0027.         Streatham terrorist Sudesh Amman is pictured as a young boy while holding a vacuum cleaner in his living roomAccording to right-leaning think-tank the Henry Jackson Society, a number of convicted extremists may be due for release in March.They include Mohammed Ghani, from Barnet, north London, who was sentenced to two years and four months in prison in May last year after threatening to kill police officers.There is also radicalised chemistry teacher Jamshed Javeed, who was jailed for six years in March 2015 for planning to travel from his Manchester home to Syria to join the so-called Islamic State (IS) and Mohammed Khilji, from north-west London, who posted beheading videos on WhatsApp.According to the Times, Britain\u0027s youngest terrorist, a boy known only as RXG who plotted to murder police officers in Australia, is due for release this month.He received a life sentence with a minimum term of five years in 2015.The newspaper also reported that Atiq Ahmed, from Oldham, who was arrested after hurling abuse at staff at a school in the town and was later found to have IS propaganda on his phone, is due to be released in March.The Government has not ruled out derogating - effectively suspending - the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in order to apply the new measures.Lawyers have warned that the move would open the Government up to legal challenges from those already behind bars who were sentenced under the current rules.But officials said they are confident they have the flexibility to change how an offender serves their sentence, by extending the time they spend behind bars rather than on licence.

It is “the pinnacle of the ‘gin palace’ form of pub”, according to its Historic England listing.Features include elaborate carvings, mahogany fireplaces, mosaic-clad bar counters and art nouvea elements, including metal gates by designer Henry Bloomfield Bare. There are also stone sculptures of musicians and musical instruments in low relief, a nod to the nearby Philharmonic Hall, as well as references to Liverpool’s maritime history.The gentlemen’s toilets also survive from its original Victorian design, the imitation marble urinals proving one of the most Instagrammed conveniences in the UK. The ladies’ loos are somewhat less stunning: they were added some years after the pub opened, being superfluous in what started life as a men-only establishment.The Beatles used to drink at the “Phil” in their early years and Paul McCartney returned there in 2018 with comedian James Corden to play a surprise gig.Two other Liverpool pubs have also had their listings upgraded. The Vines on Lime Street, another Thomas design, is now Grade II* listed, thanks to its opulent Edwardian interior, featuring rich, original mahogany woodwork and plasterwork, and a large stained-glass dome in the former billiards room. The separate lounge bar, public bar and smoke room survive in good condition, as do a number of striking fireplaces. The rather eccentric Peter Kavanagh’s, named after its landlord and inventor, includes various unique features including carved ‘corbels’ (wall brackets) thought to be caricatures of the pub’s regulars, and original tables designed by Kavanagh, with channels for spilt drinks and in-built ash trays.Historic England is working with the Campaign for Real Ale pub heritage group to protect the best pubs for the nation. Together they have so far given 51 pubs a Grade I listing – but none of those began life as a “pub” in the modern sense in the same way as the Philharmonic.Although the term “public house” can be traced back to the 1600s, the “pub” as a distinct building type emerged in the mid-1800s. It brought together and developed three earlier types of building –\u0026nbspthe inn, tavern and alehouse.There are examples of Grade I listed inns which include the late 15th century George Hotel and Pilgrims Inn (Glastonbury) and the 17th century George Inn (Southwark).

Passengers and pilots remain worried about the Max and the grounding of Boeing’s best selling airplane has had a negative impact on the US economy.Speaking at an airline industry event in London, Dickson said that international regulators including European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) broadly agreed on what needed to be fixed.“On the design approval, from everything that I have seen I think we’ll have very solid alignment,” he said. “There is no timeframe, I don’t think it’s helpful to get out there with timeframes or timelines,” he told reporters at a briefing.“For Boeing’s part, what I have been encouraging is to not make public announcements.”Boeing told investors recently that it expects the aircraft will not be back in the air until mid-2020 and that regulators will determine the timing.Initial investigations into the Max found issues with anti-stall software, known as Mcas, has contributed to the fatal crashes of a Lion Air flight in October 2018 and an Ethiopian Airlines the following March.But in January the FAA and Boeing they were also reviewing a wiring issue that could potentially cause a short circuit on the grounded 737 Max.Officials said the review was looking at whether two bundles of wiring are too close together, which could lead to a short circuit and potentially result in a crash if pilots did not respond appropriately.“They have not given us a proposal on the wiring yet,” Dickson said.“I wouldn’t say I’m worried. I want them to take whatever time they need to give us a fulsome and a data-driven proposal.”Reuters contributed to this story"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf96f8c6e2da27f1ba64ac3c8713b2a4923a7f1a/0_479_7263_4358/master/7263.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61edd45071d053d76e222f65a8b47e27","title":"uk import tariffs trade brexit","story":"Trade secretary will consult firms over move to simplify regime rather than axe itThe government is preparing to reverse plans put forward last year to cut import tariffs on most goods coming to the UK under proposals for post-Brexit trade agreements.The Department for International Trade has opted to simplify the current regime rather than abolish large parts of it, as Theresa May’s government planned under a temporary scheme to follow a no-deal Brexit.The trade secretary, Liz Truss, said she would consult business groups on whether the government should simplify its tariff policy, which she said would ensure greater choice and lower prices for consumers.Ministers are also seeking views on whether to remove tariffs on components used in factory production to try to reduce costs for UK manufacturers.Truss called on UK businesses to help shape Britain’s import tariff policy, which will apply from next year as the country prepares for life outside the EU. She said she wanted to hear from businesses during a four-week consultation from 5 March before replacing EU tariffs that remain in force for the rest of this year.Import tariffs on goods under the latest scheme will apply to countries where the UK government has so far failed to put alternative trade arrangements in place.But Truss immediately ran into criticism from the Institute of Directors for reviewing trade policy while the government and business groups were involved in trade negotiations with the EU and the US.Allie Renison, the IoD’s head of trade policy, said: “The consultation comes at a fraught time as we seem headed for simultaneous negotiations with both the US and EU. This will leave business scrambling to work out how one set of negotiations will affect terms of trade with the other, and underscores the need for maximum clarity across all negotiating objectives to allow firms any hope of preparing in advance.”Truss said submissions from business groups would help shape the government’s new “most-favoured nation” tariff regime, which would be known as the UK global tariff. This could include simplifying tariffs and removing them entirely on goods where Britain has no domestic production.“It is vitally important that we now move away from complex tariff schedule imposed on us by the European Union,” she said. “This is our opportunity to set our own tariff strategy that is right for UK consumers and businesses across our country.”The Department for International Trade wants to radically simplify the tariff system inherited from the EU, which has mushroomed over the past 50 years.In a separate written statement to the Commons, Truss said the UK would “drive a hard bargain” in its trade negotiations and was “prepared to walk away if that is in the national interest”.She said it was one of the government’s key priorities to deepen trade and investment relationships with “like-minded partners, starting with the US, Japan, Australia and New Zealand”.

The National Institute of Economic and Social Research reports today that the amount suggested so far gets nowhere near: it is probably generous in thinking the process could be anywhere near done in a decade. Every government talks of doing it, but Johnson’s capture of so many northern seats gives him a mighty new incentive to “level up”, as the Tories now call it.What would it take? Ask around the thinktanks and the list of requirements is encyclopaedic. This is akin to running up a down escalator as, due to the lost austerity decade, the century-old north-south gap continues to widen. The economies in the north and Midlands rely more on public services, so cuts hurt them particularly badly. Add to that the £12bn cuts to benefits, especially to tax credits, and low-wage areas suffered most.Local government is drained of funds, and the places worst hit are the very same now promised investment: Liverpool has lost the most, West Dorset the least. Unless there is a screeching U-turn, the so-called “fair funding review”, which has been delayed once again, is set to take “deprivation” out of the measurement, substituting it with “rurality” and “sparsity of population”. That means taking cash out of poor towns and city districts and giving it to Tory shires. The same is already happening to schools.Here’s the challenge. Andy Haldane, head of the government’s Industrial Strategy Council, warned in a report this week that regional inequality of income is at 1901 levels. Other European countries face similar regional problems, but ours are worse. Yet as a small country, in geographical terms, with most “left behind” towns within 30 miles of a hub city, we are better placed to correct this.Symbolic, in a bad way, was Grant Shapps grandly announcing £500m to reopen the Beeching lines closed in the 1960s – that’s enough for 25 miles of track. Too many cities, meanwhile, Leeds and Bradford being the biggest examples, have no metro or tram network. Rectifying this will be costly. But now we know that HS2 will cost around £100bn, no sum can ever be dismissed as too expensive.Rhetoric and promises are already running dangerously far ahead of any “levelling up” that people will ever actually see. Local funds to revive high streets, and fleets of fast, frequent buses could be quick wins, funded by taxing the online companies that destroy shops.Of course, one easy way to narrow the north-south ide beckons. The south’s wealth relies on the glittering gold of financial services. Brexit plans risk dealing it a hefty blow, sacrificing bankers (unpopular, but a huge chunk of our economy), for fishermen (popular, but negligible economically). The City sent up distress flares after Johnson’s Brexit speech on Monday, reminding him finance is “critically important”. Without it, expect empty Treasury coffers for all this levelling up. Levelling down may be what we get."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eea90c4e92c59009fac259c170708f83e823de78/346_401_3880_2328/master/3880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fdfd80f5e4ea73e9b161e3711557ac7d","title":"share your photos and stories of early signs of spring","story":"We want your help documenting the situation as record temperatures bring early signs of spring across EuropeWith warmer winters and seasonal changes we would like to know about any early signs of spring you have spotted near you.From joy at seeing beautiful scenes to concern about what it means for the environment, you can see what  readers told us last year.Tell us what the situation is like where you are in the encrypted form below.

If declines continue at this pace, many of these species could vanish forever within a few decades.”The team used data collected over a 115-year period on 66 bumblebee species across North America and Europe to develop a model simulating “climate chaos” scenarios. They were able to see how bumblebee populations had changed over the years by comparing where the insects were now to where they used to be.Dr Tim Newbold, of University College London’s Centre for Bioersity \u0026amp Environment Research, said: “We were surprised by how much climate change has already caused bumblebee declines. Our findings suggest that much larger declines are likely if climate change accelerates in the coming years, showing that we need substantial efforts to reduce climate change if we are to preserve bumblebee ersity.”Bumblebees play a key role in pollinating crops such as tomatoes, squash and berries. The researchers say their methods could be used to predict extinction risk and identify areas where conservation actions are needed.Prof Jeremy Kerr, of the University of Ottawa and the study’s senior author, said: “This work also holds out hope by implying ways that we might take the sting out of climate change for these and other organisms by maintaining habitats that offer shelter, like trees, shrubs or slopes, that could let bumblebees get out of the heat.“Ultimately, we must address climate change itself and every action we take to reduce emissions will help.”The research is published in the journal Science."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0762fd43b844d92de49c7c116864573f02fc0989/47_0_2832_1700/master/2832.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f99a0e4cc1b1d1c6e9b89235a9202649","title":"modern ark designs for the new climate reality in pictures","story":"Floating villages and an ‘amphibious house’ are among some of the solutions as architecture adapts to the growing problem of urban flooding• Sea Change: flood resilient architecture for the 21st century is at the Roca London Gallery, 1 February–16 May 2020"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a932c0bb9119a0d278d8684f7714341196b458f/0_98_3088_1852/master/3088.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1a738e288f57da917c0d23bca460b1a","title":"choose vintage avoid stretch how to wear jeans sustainably","story":"The environmental impact of denim makes buying jeans problematic for eco-conscious shoppers. But more and more brands are developing innovative ways to lessen the damageWhy are jeans so controversial? Is it the estimated 10,000 litres of water needed to grow the cotton for every pair? The dark blue lines of toxic pollution in China’s Pearl River that can be seen from space? The potassium permanganate, widely used to make new jeans look old and distressed, that may cause lung damage in workers? Or is it because there is no guarantee that those workers are paid a living wage, never mind being paid for the overtime they are forced to do?“The denim industry is at a pivotal moment,” says Roian Atwood, senior director of global sustainable business at Kontoor Brands, which owns Wrangler and Lee, when we met at ART (Alter Repair Transform), a denim upcycling and mending workshop at the Copenhagen international fashion fair (CIFF) last month. Lee are among the 30 brands contributing to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Jeans Redesign project, a new initiative governing all aspects of jean production from regeneratively farmed fibres to washing and finishing techniques – potassium permanganate, for example, is not allowed. Jeans must be made with rivets and hardware that can easily be removed after the jeans are no longer fit for purpose, allowing them to be recycled into something new. The first products bearing the Jeans Redesign logo will go on sale in the autumn.The industry is working hard to make itself cleaner and more sustainable, investing in new technology such as the innovative dry foam to dye Lee’s Indigood jeans – the use of water is pretty much eliminated, as well as reducing energy and chemicals and hopefully ending the rivers of toxic blue effluent. Already in operation at three denim mills in Spain, Mexico and India, Lee is also launching “compostable” jeans this spring. “They will fully decompose,” says Atwood. “We believe it will take 200 days.”There is still a long way to go. According to Atwood, there is “a new and emerging environmental issue we are not quite ready to talk about yet, which is that denim has become integrated with a lot of synthetics. The comfort and the stretch movement, athleisure and the omnipresence of the yoga pant have given rise to a lot more stretch in denim. It’s plastic,” he says. And as such, your skinny jeans are responsible for shedding microplastics.Appropriately enough, we meet in the “confessional booth” designed for visitors to confess their fashion sins and record them for a podcast. “If we are confessing our sins, I am here to say I like to wear light jeans,” he says. “A dark pair of denim uses less water in the wash-down process.” The lighter the denim, the more washing processes it has been through and the more water it has used.The designer Duran Lantink, who was commissioned to work with Lee’s deadstock to create a small collection of upcycled denim, wears jeans every day (he switches between two vintage pairs) but is aware of the issues. “I think that, by buying a pre-washed jean, it is ruin in reverse,” he says. “I don’t get that.”Lantink is part of a growing band of designers who are not just concerned about the environmental impact of the industry but also its waste. Bethany Williams, who has perfected the art of unpicking and upcycling unwanted jeans, has grown a cult following. Brands such as E.L.V. Denim (short for East London Vintage), which is sold at a range of stockists including Net-a-Porter, are building healthy businesses using secondhand denim as their raw material. “There are more jeans than people in the world,” says founder Anna Foster. At her studio and showroom, clients can choose from off-the-peg or custom-made jeans, ingeniously spliced together a few miles away at the Blackhorse Lane Ateliers in Walthamstow. But slowing down production is not on the agenda for the big denim brands, who would prefer to cut their environmental impact by reducing water and chemical consumption while continuing to produce at the same levels. However, there are some smart and potentially highly disruptive initiatives coming from smaller independents. Netherlands-based Mud Jeans offers a subscription system that allows you to lease your jeans for €7.50 per month, including free repairs. Once you are finished with your jeans, you send them back and they will be recycled. Hiut Jeans, which has revitalised the denim industry in Cardigan, Wales, makes just 100 pairs of jeans per week. “We are here to try and make the best jeans we can and not the most jeans we can,” it says. It also offer free repairs for life.Whether you are a denim aficionado or a student on a budget, you can find jeans to suit your budget and your style if you shop secondhand.Raw denim hasn’t been washed and treated multiple times. This is what denim used to look like before we started to sandblast, bleach and rip it to make it look old. Buy a pair of unwashed jeans and let them age with you.Let leggings be leggings and jeans be jeans. One hundred per cent means the denim in your jeans can eventually be recycled.One of the biggest sources of water impact and energy use is during the consumer use phase.

The message is: don’t give up, it’s not too late, the cause could not be better. In fact, you could argue that any film or media event that is not about the climate emergency is a waste of valuable time. And yet, bafflingly, the metaphor at the heart of this film is hackneyed and nonsensical. On its own figurative and dramatic terms, it doesn’t work. Those squeamish about spoilers had better look away now.We are in the operating theatre of a hospital A\u0026ampE department. A crowd of doctors in masks and green scrubs – with Phoenix at the centre – are bringing in a patient on a gurney, firing off technical-medic dialogue at each other. The patient has become seriously injured after “wildfires”. There is “systemic damage”. The heart is no longer pumping. Frantically, the doctors work to bring the patient back to consciousness. They fetch the shock paddles to kickstart a pulse. No good. The nerve-jangling beeping from the machine to which the patient is connected slows down and stops. There’s a flatline. In the traditional, sombre manner the senior physician (played by Matthew Modine) “calls it” and having gloomily recorded the time of death – midnight – everyone begins to troop out. But wait. One valiant medic, played by Peruvian-American actor and campaigner Q’orianka Kilcher, refuses to admit defeat. She climbs on top of the patient, carries on pumping and the beeping triumphantly recommences.Now the camera moves in for the big reveal. Surely, we’re not just going to see a bloodstained planet lying on the gurney? A symbolic beachball-sized Mother Earth – like the smiley-face globe that bursts into flames in the episode of 30 Rock featuring Al Gore?At first, it doesn’t seem like it. The closeup reveals what looks like a big lump of coal, glowing red. It’s as if the doctor has caused some dying embers to catch light once again. Has the flame of life burst forth once more? That’s the happy ending? But then we pan back to see that this is the continent of Africa, on fire, and the globe spins around a bit to show Australia, hideously aflame.But our planet bursting into flames is what we don’t want to happen. A successful operation, in these metaphorical terms, would surely show the continents cooling – which is difficult to convey within Motson’s flatline-versus-beeping scenario. It is a disconcertingly muddled and ineffective image, when this important campaign needed something clear and compelling.Phoenix is not the star. That is Kilcher, and she is a dramatic presence. But for this film to burden itself with such a messy and ineffective conceit in such a short film was a misstep.• s of Nature has been made by Extinction Rebellion and Amazon Watch.

Top chefs from Yotam Ottolenghi to Tom Kerridge reveal what they would buy for under a fiverIt is cold. It is dark. It is winter. And post-Christmas, we all feel skint. How do you lift spirits and put some sizzle in your cooking without spending much? We asked some of Britain’s best chefs: if you had a fiver or less to spend – what would you buy??The Dutch East India company listed soy sauce in 1737. It has a long history in Europe, but I don’t think British people understand how powerful it is. It’s liquid umami for a couple of quid and, used judiciously, it’s amazing in bolognese, chilli, stews and marinades. If you’re frying mushrooms and want a real flavour boost, bung a tablespoon in and reduce it down. Hat tip on this to Tara Wigley, who I write with. Buy as many green and red chillies as you can, finely slice and salt them (one tablespoon per 250g). Refrigerate in a sealed container for three days, then blitz with cider vinegar (3 tbsp) and lemon juice (1 tbsp). In a new container, seal the paste with olive oil and keep in the fridge. Spoon over and into anything savoury to ramp up its flavour.The Too Good to Go app helps fight food waste. Customers buy a magic bag from a listed cafe or restaurant – maybe a chain like Yo! Sushi or an indie like us – filled with food that would have been binned. You can’t be too fussy. You might get meat, veg or a bag of cakes, and sometimes the bags are cancelled and refunded if places get busy. But you do get excellent deals. Our bags cost £3 for £9- or £10-worth of food. If you need inspiration for the contents, you can pick up some brilliant cookbooks second-hand for under a fiver. For example, Merry White’s Cooking for Crowds, Claudia Roden’s A New Book of Middle Eastern Food or Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall’s reliable River Cottage Veg Every Day.I was born in Manila, and Filipino cooking is a real combination of sweet and sour, often in the form of vinegar-based dipping sauces. At Bong Bong we use 7 Up (some Filipinos think it should be Sprite) in a sweet 24-hour pork-rib marinade. I presume this came from Americans in the Philippines during the second world war, who used Coke in BBQ marinades and that kind of thing. Ours is half-and-half 7 Up and soy sauce, plus garlic, ginger, chilli, sugar and fresh lemongrass, which creates good caramelisation and sweet, citrusy, fragrant ribs.I used expensive Japanese knives for years before an Aussie chef put me on to the Thai-brand Kiwi knives. They’re my go-to knives for daily prep – ultra-sharp, super-lightweight and with a very thin blade you can quickly put an edge on. You can pick them up for about £5.Buy 200g, ide into 10 cubes and freeze them inidually. As needed, stir one into a casserole, chilli, puy lentils or even a curry to give it a massive enhancement. At 40p a pop, it’s an incredibly cost-effective way to drive flavour into dishes.A squeeze of lemon will transform almost any food you can think of you need that balance of acidic tartness, even in a bolognese. A lemon is what, 30p? That’s the kind of cooking that real chefs do. You’ll notice the difference.I’m salt-obsessed, and this salt takes things to the next level. I add it to salads, roasted veg and cooked grains. Sprinkled over cauliflower roasted in curry powder, its smokiness makes the soft, charred cauliflower almost meaty-tasting. I’m French and both my grandmas use parsley all the time. It’s about 70p a bunch on Kirkgate Market and you can do amazing stuff with it. We use a lot of parsley sauce made with garlic, vinegar, mustard, oil, salt and pepper. You can put this vibrant green sauce on eggs, sandwiches, pasta or with fish. It keeps for five days in the fridge. I use this to jazz up pasta sauces. It’s pretty punchy. Blend a tin of chopped tomatoes with one heaped tablespoon of harissa until smooth, cook for 30 minutes on a medium heat, season with salt, add pasta, parsley and feta and you’ve got a delicious dinner.If you have a decent carbon-steel wok, ditch that wooden spoon and get a proper 14in plastic-handled stainless steel wok spatula, also known as a wok chuan or turner. Chinese supermarkets have them for about a fiver and because this shovel-like utensil is designed to fit the wok’s curves, it’s like having your own hand in there. It’s much easier to move things around and char them properly. I stock up on every type of lentil and pulse I can to make dhal. LSD, life-saving dhal, as the great Madhur Jaffrey calls it. I never get bored of it. Hodmedods’ British lentils and pulses have become a cheap, reliable store-cupboard essential for me. I love to fry onion, garlic and dried mint, then braise the lentils with a punctured dried Iranian lime and veg stock. Add tons of parsley and dill at the end. It’s such a nourishing, flavourful meal with bread or rice.My secret weapon. A salty, savoury sauce made from chillies and fermented soy beans, which I use instead of salt in a lot of food. I put it on everything. It tastes delicious stirred into cooked rice. I would recommend this to any home cook. After cutting freshly made gnocchi, you roll it softly across the board to score it, not just to make it pretty but also to create a better surface area for your pasta sauce to coat. This little board can also be used for different pastas as such garganelli and conchiglie.Marmite is essential in my cooking. Controversially, perhaps, I always add a teaspoon to the chicken broth in which I cook my goat meatballs. A dollop of this pungent, salty sauce in any meat or veggie dish, stock or stew adds a flavoursome punch.I buy my vegetables at Church Street Market, near Edgware Road, London. The traders sell bowls of veg for £1. You might get five aubergines in one or a couple of white cabbages, which I use to make sauerkraut in the winter. For £5 you can get a grade-A French black-legged chicken. On Fridays, there is a chap who sells squabs for £2.50. It’s first class.Most non-stick pans last three months if you’re lucky and might cost £35. We buy 50 Ikea ones at a time for £2.75 each. The non-stick only lasts weeks in a professional kitchen, but then we just use them as normal pans until they die. I’ve been doing this over 10 years. They used to be 79p!Just a teaspoon of Gentleman’s Relish can elevate a simple tomato sauce into something really special.

It is a bewildering state of affairs given they have been largely terrible this season but also testament to the job Carlo Ancelotti has done since becoming manager, with the high point undoubtedly being last week’s 3-2 win at Watford. Everton triumphed after going 2-0 down and having lost Fabian Delph to a 71st-minute red card, showing a level of resilience that has been lacking for some time. It is that quality, perhaps more than any other, that the Goodison faithful would like to see on Saturday. SNThis year’s Bundesliga title race has been one of the most exciting for years, with the four sides battling it at the top separated by just three points. RB Leipzig’s trip to Bayern Munich on Sunday will be the acid test for whether their young head coach, Julian Nagelsmann, can help secure a first championship in the club’s history. Two defeats to Eintracht Frankfurt, first in the league and then in the cup in midweek, ended a 12-match unbeaten run just as Bayern have hit form, with the Borussias – Dortmund and Mönchengladbach – also in the mix as they enter the business end of the season. Timo Werner, who has 20 league goals this season and hinted this week that he may fancy a crack at the Premier League, will go toe-to-toe with Robert Lewandowski, with both aiming to become the league’s top goalscorer, or the magnificently-named Torjägerkanone. EASunday’s Derby della Madonnina will be the first Zlatan Ibrahimovic has contested since he left Milan for PSG in 2012. It’s fair to say that plenty has changed since then at both of the Milan clubs, with neither having come close to winning the Scudetto in this era that has been dominated by Juventus. Ibrahimovic is expected to return after missing Milan’s draw with Verona last week due to a bout of flu, and Milan will need the 38-year-old to be at his vintage best if they are to win this league fixture for the first time since 2016. Romelu Lukaku is certainly looking forward to facing his former Manchester United teammate, who has scored six times in the derby, having also represented Inter between 2006 and 2009. “In Manchester I could train every day with him, that was the most beautiful thing for me,” said Lukaku. “It will be nice to play against him. He is a great champion and professional.” EA Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200206-55221-gnl.fw.20200206.jf.helicopter.mp3 It was reported this week that Pep Guardiola intends to use Phil Foden as David Silva’s replacement next season, with the manager viewing the 19-year-old as the natural heir to arguably Manchester City’s best-ever midfielder. If true, then surely it makes sense to start preparing Foden for that responsibility now. He has played a total of 900 minutes this campaign and, one suspects, needs much more game time if he is to hit the ground running as a prominent first-team player in August. That process could start this weekend. City face West Ham knowing they have close to zero chance of stopping Liverpool winning the title, so why not use the remaining league fixtures as an opportunity for forward planning? Guardiola is rotating his squad anyway and playing Foden, alongside a few other youngsters, would also allow him to keep key senior players rested and ready for the Champions League, which should be City’s priority now. SNWe go again. That will surely be the message Sabri Lamouchi delivers to his Nottingham Forest players ahead of their biggest game of the season so far. Last week’s 2-1 defeat at Birmingham City was an unexpected setback for Forest given they travelled to St Andrew’s on a run of seven league games without defeat, propelling them to third in the Championship and fuelling belief of securing an automatic promotion spot. Forest are now down to fourth but remain only four points off second. Leeds also lost last week, at home to Wigan, and are in the type of slump that suggests they are again running out of gas when it matters most. If Forest are to return to the Premier League for the first time in more than 20 years, they simply have to take full advantage on Saturday. SNThis season’s title race in Portugal has turned into something of a procession as Benfica have won 18 of their 19 fixtures so far, with the home defeat against Porto back in August the only blemish so far for Bruno Lage’s side. Saturday’s meeting between the two sides at the Estádio do Dragão therefore could be the last chance for Porto to stop Benfica from retaining their title, given that the Lisbon team are already seven points clear at the top before O Clássico. Having strengthened their squad with the £18m purchase of Julian Weigl from Borussia Dortmund, Benfica also look well equipped for a decent run in the Europa League. Domestic concerns will take centre stage this weekend in a fixture that is never for the faint-hearted. EABournemouth have won their last two league matches but are still a good bet to go down. Their remaining 13 games include jousts with all of the current top nine, starting with Sheffield United on Sunday. The Blades are going to have a significant say in the relegation race over the coming weeks, but not in the way that most people expected pre-season. After Bournemouth, they play Brighton and Norwich and will also contest a re-arranged fixture with Aston Villa. With January signing Sander Berge likely to feature in midfield, where Bournemouth will be deprived of the suspended Jefferson Lerma, it is hard to see Eddie Howe’s side springing a surprise and taking a point off United. That’s not something anyone was saying before these teams met on the opening day of the season. PDThe dramatic second half against West Ham that saw Brighton rescue a point despite twice trailing by two goals heaped the pressure on David Moyes’s struggling side this week as they prepare for a devilish run of fixtures. Potter’s side remain perilously close to the bottom three before Watford’s visit to the south coast on Saturday. Two wins from their last 14 matches is the kind of form that saw Brighton dragged into the mire last season, when Chris Hughton’s side only survived by the skin of their teeth. Watford, whose momentum has stalled of late after their blistering start under Nigel Pearson, are also in desperate need of the points. They will offer a stern test of whether Potter and his players are up for the fight. EAIf you need to find a new manager quickly, then go for the one you have on speed dial. The day after sacking Gary Bowyer, Bradford drafted in Stuart McCall for his third managerial spell at the club. He takes over this time with Bradford just one point outside the League Two play-offs but in need of a reversal of form, having failed to win any of their last seven matches. McCall’s latest reign begins this weekend at home to Grimsby, whose recent form has been the opposite of Bradford’s, with the seven matches since the appointment of Ian Holloway bringing the sort of improvement Bradford hope to enjoy under McCall. PDThe last time Taylor Moore played at Bloomfield Road, he scored a 96th-minute own goal to give Blackpool a 2-2 draw with Southend. This weekend Moore could make his Blackpool debut against none other than Southend, whose luck has been getting no better since that game in March. Manager Sol Campbell, who took charge of the Shrimpers in October when they already looked sunk, has presided over a remarkable upturn in form recently. They have taken more points in their last six League One matches than they did in their previous 22, but last week’s win over Lincoln City came at a cost. Both Ben White and Harry Phillips suffered injuries that are expected to keep them out for the next three months. Southend are still 12 points from 20th place if Campbell’s good work can inspire them to safety, it truly would be the greatest of escapes.

These factors, combined with growing uncertainty around the recent coronavirus outbreak, have led to the decision to cease operating services.”American Airlines and United Airlines, the two biggest US carriers, said on Wednesday they were suspending flights to Hong Kong until at least the end of the month.Conditions were as grave now as during the 2009 financial crisis, said Cathay Pacific. “I am appealing to each and everyone of you to help,” said CEO Augustus Tang Kin-wing. “Preserving our cash is now key to protecting our business,” he said.Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, is under pressure to close all routes into Hong Kong from mainland China in order to stop the spread of the virus, which has killed more than 560 people, one of them in Hong Kong.She has already ordered all entrants from China to be quarantined for 14 days and has closed two cruise ship terminals after 30 crew on the World Dream vessel anchored in the city’s port on Wednesday were suspected of having the infection. Port health authorities were screening the 3,600 people onboard for symptoms on Thursday.The measures have caused anxiety in Hong Kong, where memories of the devastating 2003 outbreak of Sars – which is similar to the new coronavirus – are still fresh in people’s minds.Hongkongers have begun forming long queues in shops and supermarkets amid panic buying for toilet rolls and tissues, largely due to a rumour spreading online on Wednesday that China was going to stop manufacturing toilet paper for the next two weeks.There was also a run on face masks, vitamins, rice and packet noodles, leaving supermarket shelves empty.Neil, a British teacher who has been living in Hong Kong for 25 years, said the news of the first death of a Hong Kong citizen on Tuesday would add to the high state of anxiety being felt there. He said nearly everyone on the island was wearing a mask and there were shortages of some goods in the shops.“There’s been panic-buying of rice and noodles and eggs are off the shelves. I go to the supermarket and get what I need but I haven’t got any masks and I’m not going to queue for five or six hours to get them, so when I walk around without one I get looks,” he said.But the loss of visitors from China, who spend millions of dollars in Hong Kong’s many upmarket shops, and from the outside world risks a “double devastation” for the economy, according to retail chiefs.“We are facing a double-hit devastation,” said Annie Yau Tse, chairwoman of the Hong Kong Retail Management Association. “The loss we are facing is tremendous. It’s about survival.”“Although the protests seem to have lost momentum amid health concerns, the 2019 novel coronavirus would further weigh on the economy,” they said in a note on Tuesday. “Moreover, we believe that the political outlook in Hong Kong remains fragile, given that the ‘Five Great Demands’ of the protestors remain unmet, which suggests that large-scale protests would easily resume once the coronavirus epidemic subsides.”Only government spending would make a positive contribution to the bottom line, they said, as consumer spending and tourism faced huge falls.The tourism sector would be particularly badly hit, they said, as the closure of 11 out of 13 border crossings and the new quarantine measures would see a “significant” reduction of Chinese tourists, who make up three-quarters of holidaymakers.Business investment has also “taken a pounding” Fitch Solutions added, and could get much worse if the virus spreads more widely within Hong Kong, resulting in a Wuhan-style lockdown. Trinh Nguyen, senior economist for emerging Asia for the investment bank Natixis in Hong Kong, said the wider Asia Pacific economy faced a gloomy outlook if the coronavirus crisis was not brought under control quickly.“Beyond tourism, the slowdown of China will curb import demand and also disrupt supply chain as many economies in Asia depend on China for imported parts for final production as well as lower Chinese demand for commodities pushing down prices. Vietnam, Singapore, South Korea, Malaysia and Australia are very impacted by this,” she said."},{"url":null,"title":"digital railcard duy online download app","story":"I purchased the Network Railcard online but it wouldn’t load on the app – and there’s no fixAfter reading a  article about the new digital railcard, I purchased a Network Railcard from railcard a month ago.

In 2019 there were 15,277 such machines in the UK, compared with 11,120 in 2018, according to figures from the network operator Link.It can cost up to £2 to withdraw money from a fee-charging ATM. Behind the surge in the number of charging machines is the switch to contactless payments for small purchases and a shakeup in how the network is funded. There have been cuts in interchange fees payments made by banks to cash machine operators every time money is withdrawn, making free ATMs less viable. There are 60,291 cash machines in the UK, down from 63,160 the year before.While consumers are being charged more, banks are saving money through branch closures and reducing the numbers of ATMs they operate. Which? says this has resulted in £120m of savings for the banks since the beginning of 2018.The consumer group estimates that more than 8,700 free ATMs have closed in the past two years, with rural communities worst affected. The closure of bank branches – about 1,200 in the same period – has reduced access to ATMs and can force people to use fee-charging machines or face having to travel further afield to find a free-to-use one.Gareth Shaw at Which? said: “Banks must take greater responsibility for ensuring customers are supported to make the transition to digital if branches close and that those who are reliant on cash are not left behind by changes to the banking landscape.”The group has called for the government to introduce legislation to protect access to free withdrawals. Natalie Ceeney, who chaired the independent Access to Cash review on the need for cash in society, said the rising number of fee-charging ATMs was a “tax on the most vulnerable in society”.She said: “The startling fact that a quarter of all ATMs now charge consumers to access their own money should worry us.”The chief executive of Link, John Howells, said he was keen to see initiatives in which retailers were incentivised to provide free cashback for customers. “As people use less cash, many ATMs will become less economically viable, which means some ATMs will switch to charging,” he said. Link operates the largest cash machine network in the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15c8b2dbd8b1fc7f41ed3885f08ff185303b1dc7/0_0_3500_2329/master/3500.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94f98807451c08b8299801a3b956223e 700w","title":"daniel kawczynski tory mp told by party attendance at far right event unacceptable","story":"Backbencher Daniel Kawczynski apologises after conference appearance in Italy The Conservative MP Daniel Kawczynski has received a formal warning for attending a conference with notorious far-right political figures.The Shrewsbury and Atcham MP apologised for attending a conference alongside nationalist leaders in Rome earlier this week after party bosses branded his behaviour unacceptable.He had previously argued that the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, and Matteo Salvini, the leader of Italy’s far-right League, who had also been scheduled to speak at the event, “represent serious ideas and concerns, some of which are shared by many citizens of the UK”.In a blog on the Spectator website, Kawczynski criticised the  for breaking the story about his involvement in the conference.“Clearly, offence archeologists have done a thorough job in finding historic remarks from some of the participants that jar with the liberal world-view.”On Thursday, the Conservative party confirmed in a statement that it had issued the backbench MP with a formal warning for attending the event. “Daniel Kawczynski has been formally warned that his attendance at this event was not acceptable, particularly in light of the views of some of those in attendance, which we utterly condemn, and that he is expected to hold himself to higher standards,” a spokesperson said.“Daniel has accepted this and apologised.”Orban has been Hungary’s prime minister since 2010, and has been accused of promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories and far-right tropes. Other speakers at the conference included Italian leaders closely associated with Benito Mussolini’s fascism and a far-right member of the Le Pen family.Kawczynski’s decision to attend was criticised by Muslim and Jewish groups. Marie van der Zyl, the president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said the party ran the “serious risk of the public assuming that they share his views” unless they disciplined him.“Mr Kawczynski’s defence, that ‘it is only common sense to talk with parties and politicians that are either leading their respective countries, or will perhaps take power in the next few years’, is a specious one, for the simple reason that the MP for Shrewsbury and Atcham is not any sort of government representative,” she said.In Rome on Tuesday, Orbán closed the National Conservatism conference with a debate championing national sovereignty.Salvini sent his apologies for not attending the event after suffering an embarrassing defeat in regional elections.

But to historians, “Holy Island” also has immense significance as the site, in AD793, of the first major Viking raid in Britain or Ireland, launching almost three centuries of destruction and occupation that dramatically shaped English history.The exact location of the early wooden monastery is not known – ruins visible on the island today are from a later priory – but recent excavations on the island by archaeologists and volunteers from DigVentures have located a cemetery and at least one building.The gaming piece, discovered last summer, came from a trench that has been dated to the eighth to ninth centuries, according to the project’s lead archaeologist, David Petts, putting it squarely in the most notorious period of the island’s history, around the time of the raid. Even if the game was being played by wealthy monks or pilgrims before the Vikings attacked, he says, it shows the influence that Norse culture already had across the north Atlantic.“We often tend to think of early medieval Christianity, especially on islands, as terribly austere: that they were all living a brutal, hard life,” says Petts, a senior lecturer in the archaeology of northern England at Durham University.In fact, he says, Lindisfarne at the time would have been a bustling place peopled with monks, pilgrims, tradespeople, and even visiting kings. “The sheer quality of this piece suggests this isn’t any old gaming set. Someone on the island is living an elite lifestyle.”It is particularly valuable as an artefact, he says, because “we are starting to get an insight into the actual lives of the people who were in the monastery, rather than just their cemeteries and their afterlives”.The gaming piece is unusual not only as an artefact but because of the manner of its discovery. DigVentures excavations are crowdfunded and staffed substantially by volunteers, and the find was made by the mother of one of the team members, who was visiting the site for a day to celebrate her birthday.“Several of the most significant finds from Lindisfarne have been made by members of the public,” says DigVentures’ managing director, Lisa Westcott Wilkins. “The big argument is that you can’t do real archaeology with members of the public: you can, as long as it is properly supervised.”When the piece was discovered, she says, “my heart was pounding, the little hairs on my arms were standing up. As a scientist, you have to train yourself out of having an emotional response to things like this. It’s a piece of evidence, bottom line.“But honestly, it’s just so beautiful and so evocative of that time period, I couldn’t help myself.”• You can explore a 3D interactive model of the hnefatafl piece here.

He holds the greatest winning streak in athletics for, as a two-times Olympic champion over 400m hurdles, Moses was unbeaten for nine years, nine months and nine days.From August 1977 to June 1987, he won 122 consecutive races but the worldly American, who is also a physicist and the chairman emeritus of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, has spent enough time in other countries, such as Britain, to know 999 is also the number to call in an emergency.For much of his life the struggle against doping has felt like an emergency to Moses. It explains why he has been at the forefront of anti-doping for 32 years and why, even now, he is such a vocal proponent of clean sport.Moses has helped lead the clampdown on Russia’s state-sponsored doping programme. He continues to monitor the situation in regard to a likely blanket ban on all Russian athletes competing in this summer’s Tokyo Olympics, even as “authorised neutrals”, and he is heartened that last week World Athletics hardened its stance. Real changes and genuine contrition need to be shown by the Russian Athletics Federation to avoid the ban on all its inidual athletes. This is a fight Moses has waged for decades.“That’s why I worked out three times a day,” he says when asked if he felt the shadow of doping among his rivals even when he seemed invincible as an athlete. “I ate properly. I had a great stretching programme. I had a great physical therapist. I did all kinds of innovative training exercises. I swam. Did weights. But I also did it because I knew it would make me the best.”This was not the template used by cheating athletes. “We all knew it was happening,” Moses says. “We knew doping was wide scale because there was no drug testing – beyond being able to detect drugs for three or four days. It was unabated.“I’m a physicist. I’ve got a biology and chemistry background. I wanted to be a doctor. So I was shocked when I went to the 1976 Olympics and saw some of the eastern bloc women. They were much more manly than me.“Then, in the 1980s, more athletes used performance-enhancing drugs because out-of-competition testing did not exist. There was no test for testosterone or growth hormones then. EPO was brand new. So there was unabated use of these drugs all over the world.“A few athletes spoke up but many made comments out of expediency. It was a dark period in my sport and it’s continued for a long time. It’s finally changing now but I was one of the few who spoke out at the start. People who protest, and do the right thing, usually don’t have anything to gain. I was winning anyway so there was nothing for me to gain. I could have done nothing and track and field would have been worse than it is today. I made a difference. That’s why we have out-of-competition drug testing – because of what I and a few others did in 1988.”Athletics has never recovered from its loss of legitimacy in the aftermath of the dirtiest race in history, the 100m final at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, when Ben Johnson, the initial winner, failed a drug test. Serious questions, at the very least, have been raised over the other seven finalists. Moses, who won bronze in the 400m hurdles at those Games, when he was 33 and competing in his final Olympics, felt an even sharper desire to clean up his sport.Does he expect Russia to back down and apologise? “No. I doubt it.”Moses is justifiably proud of his role in toughening up Wada – as the anti-doping agency seemed subservient to the International Olympic Committee. Moses and Beckie Scott, the chair of Wada’s Athlete Committee, became embroiled in a row with the organisation. Scott said she was “bullied” in 2018 over her opposition to reinstating Russia’s anti-doping agency. Moses supported Scott and he was told to “shut up” by some Wada officials.“I’m proud that – alongside Beckie and others on the athletes’ commission – we forced Wada to look at its governance,” Moses says. “Hopefully we’ve been able to fix some of Wada’s problems. Changes were made to bring an ethical balance to the way Wada is run internally. The Russians got caught red-handed and the evidence was clear from two investigations.Is the war against doping being won? “Our deterrent model is very important. New software packages mean we’re able to buy the right tests that can withstand the legal, analytical and statistical scrutiny required to prove a test is conclusive. Drugs are being detected for longer periods of time. They’re now looking at proteins in the body that change immediately upon use of growth hormone, testosterone, EPO. We can detect more because we’re looking at protein chains, 200 or 300 segments long, in the DNA. That’s brought in a whole new way of testing.”Moses is also a passionate ambassador for Laureus – the group that celebrates the power of sport to transform the lives of millions of people. He cites the moment when he was on stage with Nelson Mandela at the inaugural Laureus awards in 2000 as “one of the big moments of my life. What he said that night, about the power of sport, was so pertinent. I saw people crying in the audience. From then on I applied all the hard work, the discipline, the winning – all the positive things I learned from sport – to Laureus and helped build a great organisation. It’s been as satisfying as sport itself.”Stressing the wider social and political power of sport, Moses encourages athletes to protest openly against racism, homophobia and other forms of injustice. He talks knowledgeably about football’s enduring problems with racism and supports those England players who have discussed walking off the field the next time they are subjected to racial abuse. “I would agree with them. If that’s what it takes, that’s a small price to pay for the indignity human beings suffer. I would have walked off the track if I had seen something like that.”Moses also backs American athletes who have taken a knee against police brutality and racism in the US. In contrast, when asked about Donald Trump, Moses says: “I don’t even want to talk about our president.”The IOC has said it will ban political protest at the Tokyo Games but Moses rejects this aim. “I don’t think you can stop it. It’s an inidual discretionary endeavour and history shows you can’t stop protest.”Sporting history confirms that, for those nine years, nine months and nine days, Moses was also unstoppable. Before he races off to his next meeting in Atlanta I ask him about the astonishing streak that began after he lost a race in Berlin against the German 400m hurdler Harald Schmid. A week later in Düsseldorf, Moses beat Schmid by 15 metres. Did the pain of defeat drive him for the next decade?Was it particularly painful when he finally lost a race, to Danny Harris? “No. When I first started I lost all the time. Losing is part of the game. If you lose you figure out what you did wrong and fix it up. If it had been another five metres, I would probably have caught him. I’d been suffering from food poisoning and nearly pulled out but I was paid my money and I ran.”A few months later, Moses beat Harris to gold at the world championships. “I was happy and the fact I had lost to him was beside the point. Most people lose.”Moses almost always won but is there a danger his remarkable sporting record may be forgotten? “No. Just last week Tiger Woods said he believed mine was the streak of all streaks. As time goes on, it becomes more meaningful and significant. It’s been 33 years since I quit. No one’s even come close to my record. And it’s doubtful anyone will.”• The 20th anniversary Laureus World Sports Awards take place in Berlin on 17 February, honouring the sporting triumphs of 2019, and celebrating the power of sport "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82b49843d0fdf5e160630772ebb916f4ef12756c/0_281_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08d653cff0c92a0f8da86a5f62d77aad","title":"wales first start nick tompkins for six nations match with ireland rugby union","story":"Wayne Pivac is preparing for the biggest match of his coaching career on an afternoon in Dublin when the weather is forecast to do its worst. The new Wales coach, who succeeded Warren Gatland after last year’s World Cup, started with a comprehensive victory over Italy last Saturday but knows that was a tea party compared with what his side will face against the last side to defeat them in the Six Nations two years ago.Pivac has fond memories of the Aviva Stadium, the ground where the Scarlets team he coached won the Pro12 final against Munster 46-22 in style in 2017, but Saturday will be markedly different in terms of exposure and intensity. He has made one personnel change from the side who defeated Italy 42-0, Nick Tompkins starting at 13 after making a try-scoring debut from the bench and George North moving to the wing in place of Johnny McNicholl, who joins the replacements.“It will be a step up and a stern challenge in Ireland’s backyard,” Pivac said. “It will be a real test to see where we are at and how much work we’ve got to do to be able to play the game under pressure. We will have a positive attitude: you do not score points without one.”Pivac will be speaking to Romain Poite, a referee with a reputation for rewarding the dominant scrum, after raising concerns with World Rugby about some of the decisions that went against Wales in the set piece last weekend, when the Pontypool-born official Luke Pearce was in charge. Wales felt they should have had more reward for scrummaging straight, a reason why the front row remain unchanged.“We have had clarity after sending clips to World Rugby,” Pivac said. “I will speak to the referee and it is important we understand where he is going to come from in the scrum and at the breakdown. We are just asking for a square scrum.”Pivac said he resisted the temptation to name an unchanged side because of the impact Tompkins made from the bench against Italy, first when he came on for 11 minutes at outside-centre when McNicholl was having a head injury assessment and then at 12 for the final 28 minutes when he scored the try that reinvigorated a side who had lost their way.“We felt we could not leave out Nick and George also played well,” Pivac said. “Nick reproduced what we had seen in training. He conducts himself well off the field and is a true professional. He is very impressive.”“Owen did not understand what he was going on about until it dawned on him that Alun Wyn had got my name wrong so Neil is sticking now, unfortunately. I wasn’t expecting to play for Wales, or international rugby at all, as England had never contacted me. When it came along, there was no chance I would say no and to start is a dream.”Ireland’s last defeat in the Six Nations was against Wales last March. They arrived in Cardiff with a chance of winning the title but left well beaten as their hosts celebrated a grand slam and that experience still vexes their captain, Johnny Sexton, who said: “Any time you lose playing for Ireland it never leaves you. You think about it a lot and that was one of those days.“We are playing against a team coached by someone different so that means it is new. We got used to Warren Gatland’s way of playing: it posed us problems and we had some great battles over the years. We know Wayne Pivac from when he coached the Scarlets, so we have some idea of the way they are going to play.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dd989f70bc471a8dd2970d87c5338501bb88af1/142_217_3250_1951/master/3250.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d74e39b2a86fff22cee1f7f9a1452e65","title":"world athletics foot down nike running shoe regulations","story":"World Athletics has insisted it will not let running-shoe technology spiral further out of control despite the release of another “gamechanging” Nike marathon shoe on Wednesday.A World Athletics spokesperson told the : “We spoke to several shoe companies, including Nike, a few days before we released our new shoe regulations to let them know what we were planning.

Is there a quick way to do it?Over the years, I have been backing up files to writeable DVDs. I probably have around 1,400 of them. Now I want to transfer their contents onto a single 10TB USB hard drive. Can you and your erudite readers recommend the quickest solution?Is there a DVD recorder that can load 10 to 20 DVDs at a time and automatically copy them onto said 10TB hard drive? Also, are there any issues with the formats needed to ensure access to my data for another 10 years or more? HarryI expect many of us still have lots of optical discs stashed away, because CDs and DVDs were the most economical way to store data for 20 to 30 years. Just cutting one disc a week could get you over the 1,000 mark, though I assume most of them would have been recopied and recycled before now.The CD-R recordable format, storing 702MB, was launched in 1982, when my IBM PCXT’s hard drive stored 10MB. We didn’t get DVD+RW discs storing 4.7GB each until about 1998, when 4GB was a reasonable size for a hard drive. A decade later, an Amazon receipt tells me I bought a 500GB Western Digital My Book for £62.20, so I was probably switching from optical to digital disks some time around 2008, if not before.In theory, we might have switched from DVD to the new Blu-ray discs instead, because a Blu-ray can store either 25GB (single-layer) or 50GB (dual-layer) on archival discs. However, by the time Blu-ray writers became affordable, we already knew that external hard drives were going to win the storage wars. They were getting bigger and cheaper at a rapid pace. Today’s 8TB and larger drives confirm that we were right.Schofield’s First Law of Computing says: Never put data into a program unless you can see exactly how to get it out. I didn’t think to mention storage, or the effort it might take to retrieve it. Technically, your data is accessible, but the sheer volume of DVDs means it’s not very practical. Moving it to a hard drive makes sense, but there’s no obvious way to do it. Buying specialised hardware would be expensive while doing it manually could take a long time.Multi-DVD systems usually targeted either the disc duplication or data sharing markets. Products aimed at the first enabled companies to create lots of identical DVDs at once. Products aimed at the second were file servers, somewhat like giant jukeboxes. They enabled companies to share data from large numbers of DVDs or BDs, or create “cold storage” backups that could last for 50 years. Facebook, for example, developed a server to store 10,000 Blu-ray discs, and demonstrated the system in a three-minute YouTube video.MF Digital’s Ripstation 7000 Series CDDVDBD ripper should do what you want, but it costs $4,595, including the built-in PC. It uses a robot arm to pick up discs and drop them into a DVD tray. Products like this are aimed at radio and TV stations, publishing empires and educational institutions that needed – perhaps still need – to convert a lot of old discs into digital format. They are not expensive compared with the cost of humans doing it manually.I’m not sure if MF Digital’s cheaper Music CD Ripping Station would do the job because you don’t need to rip your discs, just copy them to a hard drive. However, I suspect £1,699.56 is more than you want to pay for a one-off job.That leaves you with one fast option: find a company that owns a Ripstation 7000 or similar device and offers file transfer as a service. I didn’t manage to find one – the search terms are tricky – and the price might still be prohibitive. I’d guess it would cost from 25p to £1 per disk, and 50p doesn’t sound too unreasonable. Even with a bulk deal, moving your data might cost £500. You’d also face the problem of shipping a very big box of discs at least one way.If anyone knows of an affordable DVD-to-HDD copying service, please let us know in the comments, or email me at the address below.If there’s no quick fix that you can justify on price, you will have to copy every DVD by hand. You could tackle it as a holiday project, but it’s a tedious way to spend your free time. Alternatively, set yourself a target, such as copying five to 10 discs per day, every day. Even with some breaks, you should get it done in a year. If you don’t set a target, you might never finish the job.Perhaps you could speed up the process by using two DVD drives, but it depends on the hardware you have available. A PC tower could take two internal DVD drives, but you would probably have to buy and install them.After that, it would be a boon to have some software to detect discs and copy the files automatically. This avoids waiting for the file directory to appear, highlighting the files you want, and dragging them to your hard drive.Perfect Automation has a utility that does the job well. You check the box for “Copy a lot of CDDVDs automatically” and start feeding it discs. It copies each one to a new folder that it creates on your hard drive (CDDVD1, CDDVD2 etc), then pops out the DVD tray for the next disc. It’s a small (219K), free program and doesn’t need to be installed, so it’s worth a try.I also tried Averk’s free AutoCopy 2, which is even smaller at 184KB. Averk had much the same problem as you – he wanted to move more than 100 CDs to a hard drive – and wrote a little utility to do it. Unlike Perfect Automation’s program, AutoCopy 2 includes a countdown timer. While its copying took longer than Perfect Automation on my system, I found that both were faster and more reliable than doing it manually.The first task is to copy all the DVDs to a hard drive and, obviously, to a backup hard drive: you don’t want to do this job twice. You can worry about file formats later.Over the long term, the best choices are usually the most common formats, especially if they are ratified international standards. Given the cost of storage nowadays, it’s not worth converting files to more efficient, space-saving formats, because this takes time and may involve some loss of quality. I’m leaving my jpg and png images, mp3 music, avi videos and other files in their original formats.Even DVD-quality movies are rarely worth the effort, unless they are of holidays, weddings, or your kids’ birthday parties. DVDs have a resolution of 720 x 480 pixels (American NTSC) or 720 x 540 (UK PAL). Today, we live in a 1080p world (1920 x 1080 pixels) on the way to 4K (3840 x 2160). You can probably watch the same videos in much higher quality on Netflix, Amazon Prime, BritBox, YouTube or some other streaming service.Have you got a question?

We’ve taken five of the most common EV questions to the experts to help you make an informed decision ...Are electric cars cheaper and easier to maintain than internal combustion engine (ICE) cars?In short, yes. An electric motor is much more simple than an ICE, with fewer moving parts. As a result, the battery pack and motor need less maintenance than the equivalent parts in an ICE vehicle.“There’s no oil or oil filter to change, no engine to maintain and fewer parts to wear out, so an EV will be cheaper to service,” explains Emily Rice, product manager at Renault Electric Vehicles. “Some drivers also find they drive more economically as the instrument panel indicates how you are driving and shows you, in real time, the energy being consumed by the battery. This can mean drivers are lighter on the accelerator and brakes, therefore extending the life of brakes and tyres too.”Renault has also adopted an energy recovery braking system: every time the vehicle slows down, part of its kinetic energy is converted into electricity. The battery is recharged when the driver lifts the foot off the accelerator or slightly engages the brake. This helps preserve or even increase your driving range, and of course save you electricity charges.How far can electric cars go?This varies from electric car to electric car, but almost all will do more than 100 miles on a full charge, with most newer models going past 200 miles.Even EVs with smaller battery capacities can be charged quickly, though. Using a rapid charger, just 20-30 minutes of charging will give more than enough juice to complete most everyday journeys.Do electric cars pay road tax?Yes and no … depending on the age and price.All EVs registered prior to April 2017 pay zero vehicle excise duty (VED, often called “road tax”), as it’s all based on tailpipe emissions – and as EVs generate 0 gkm of CO2, they’re exempt.However, the rules around VED changed in April 2017, and a premium tax was introduced. Now, any car over £40,000 when new has to pay an annual supplement (£310-320 a year depending on the model year of the vehicle) for the first five years, regardless of its emissions.Fortunately, it’s possible to bag a brand new EV for far less than the £40,000 threshold. For instance, New Renault ZOEs start at £25,670 – no VED is just one of the reasons it’s the ideal first electric car.Are electric cars automatic?Not exactly. Like automatic cars, electric cars don’t have a clutch or gear stick, but that’s where the comparison stops. Unlike automatic cars, electric cars don’t have a gearbox at all, which results in a smoother ride and nippy acceleration.Confused? Rice explains: “ICE cars need gears as they can only generate powertorque in a narrow band of engine speeds and the gears help keep the engine within those bands. In an electric car, maximum torque is available instantly and at low speeds so there is no need to have multiple gears.”Can I charge my electric car at home?Not only can you charge your electric car at home, it’s the preferred option for most EV owners.When it comes to charging at home, you have two options. By far the most efficient is using a dedicated home-charging point – something Renault provides for free with every retail purchase** of the New Renault ZOE. These are wall-mounted, weather-proof units that you connect to your car to using a dedicated charging cable. It’s best to charge your car at night – when electricity rates are often cheaper – and then top up in smaller bursts throughout the day, if needed.The second home-charging option is to charge your car using a normal three-pin socket. This is a great solution if you’re away from home and need a top-up, but shouldn’t be your only, or primary, charging solution. Charging this way is much slower than using a wall-mounted unit, and gives eight miles of range an hour of charging compared with a 7kW home charger that will give around 30 miles of range an hour, according to WLTP testing*. You can also often top up for free on public networks when you are out and about – look for charging points at supermarkets and public car parks. Rapid DC charging at 50kW available on the New Renault ZOE will give an estimated 90 miles driving range in 30 minutes.Curious to learn more about EVs?

Motoring journalist Maria McCarthy explains why they’re more than just a passing trendThere’s no doubt that this acceleration is in part being driven by increased awareness and fears about the climate crisis. But while we know that EVs are greener than traditional internal combustion engine cars, making the transition from the familiarity of fossil fuel to embracing electric can feel daunting, no matter how urgently you feel the climate emergency. Will vast amounts of number-crunching and spreadsheets be required to work out if an electric car will fit your lifestyle? Might you have to draw on vague memories of what Kws are from long-ago physics lessons? Thankfully, that won’t be necessary.“People often worry that deciding to move over to an electric car will be a chore and involve a lot of research,” says Emily Rice, product manager at Renault Electric Vehicles. “But once they get started, they discover there’s lots of independent, accessible information out there, and the process can be very straightforward.”When electric cars first came on to the market, there was a lot of hand-wringing about “range anxiety” – the fear of the battery running out before you can get to a charging point. But it turns out that unless you embark on epic road trips on a regular basis, range anxiety isn’t a cause for concern. “The New Renault ZOE has a range of up to 245 miles according to WLTP testing*,” explains Rice. “And that’s plenty for most of us.”According to the Department of Transport, the average annual mileage for private cars in 2018 was 7,400 – this works out at just over 20 miles a day, so the New Renault ZOE will easily meet most people’s day-to-day needs.And when you do need to charge your battery, it’s as easy as charging your smartphone. Most electric car drivers charge at home – something made even easier by Renault, which provides a free home charge point for new retail customers purchasing a New Renault ZOE**. Once you set off with a full battery, you rarely need to top up on regular journeys. And if you do run out of juice on the go, there’s no need to panic – the UK now has more EV charging points than petrol stations (almost 10,000 locations now offer public charging points, according to Zap-Map).And best of all, the mileage costs are significantly cheaper. Costs will vary depending on your electricity tariff but, according to the Energy Saving Trust, charging an electric vehicle at home will cost on average 4-6p per mile, and 8-10p if using a public charging point. This compares with 13-16p for a petrol or diesel car.But choosing a car isn’t just about drawing up budgets – it’s about how it feels. And if you’ve never driven an electric car before then it’s time to get behind the wheel. “I find electric cars provide a versatile, relaxing drive,” says Thomas Clifton, electrification and new mobility manager at Renault. “As there’s no gear changes, they’re ideal for navigating city traffic. Then out of town, they handle just as well as a petrol or diesel car on motorways and rural roads. Forget the myth that electric cars are like driving a milk float – they give a smooth, powerful drive with great acceleration.”“If you’re curious about electric cars, then do take one for a test drive,” suggests Rice. “And don’t just try it out in town – take the New Renault ZOE out on a motorway or dual carriageway and let it show you what it can do. I would recommend asking to borrow it over night if you can and see how easily it could fit into your lifestyle.”It’s easy to put off making the switch to electric car ownership until some vague, undefined point in the future – but the truth is, there’s really no need to. If you have any reservations about the costs, charging options or drive, a little research and a test drive will quickly allay your fears. Once motorists take the plunge, they quickly become “electrical evangelists” with zero interest revisiting the dark days of internal combustion engine ownership. The only question is: when will you join them and start reaping the benefits of greener motoring?Curious to learn more about EVs?

Jamil, who started her career on Channel 4’s teen programming slot T4 and starred in NBC comedy The Good Place, was announced on Tuesday as the host of a new contest, Legendary, based around the predominantly black and Latinx subculture of drag balls in the LGBT community. The HBO show will focus specifically on voguing, the dance style popularised by the Madonna song Vogue and the cult documentary Paris Is Burning and features rapper and singer Megan Thee Stallion on its judging panel. Dashaun Wesley – from the hit ballroom-culture drama Pose – will serve a commentator.The public response to Jamil’s appointment focused on her perceived lack of ties to its subject matter. On Wednesday, she tweeted a statement in which she came out as queer, saying that she had kept her sexuality a secret “because I was scared of the pain of being accused of performative bandwagon jumping, over something that caused me a lot of confusion, fear and turmoil when I was a kid”. She emphasised that coming out did not automatically entitle her to a place on the show, adding: “I know that my being queer doesn’t qualify me as ballroom. But I have privilege and power and a large following to bring to this show … sometimes it takes those with more power to help a show get off the ground so we can elevate marginalised stars that deserve the limelight and give them a chance.”Jamil, who is in a relationship with singer James Blake, is no stranger to online controversy.

In light of the problems that have emerged in the implementation of the delegate selection plan and in order to assure public confidence in the results, I am calling on the Iowa Democratic Party to immediately begin a recanvass,” Perez said on Twitter.He added in second tweet: “A recanvass is a review of the worksheets from each caucus site to ensure accuracy.”At an event at his New Hampshire state campaign headquarters in Manchester on Thursday, Sanders touted his lead in the raw, popular vote in Iowa, while Buttigieg is slightly ahead in the allocation of party delegate votes, which is the tally that ultimately determines the party nominee.In a disgruntled mood, he also referred to the problems tabulating the results.“That screw-up has been extremely unfair to the people of Iowa,” Sanders said, adding: “I want to thank the people of Iowa for the very strong victory they gave us.”Sanders said his campaign was ahead of the former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg and his rivals by about 6,000 votes.“Our campaign is winning the popular initial vote by some 6,000 popular votes,” Sanders said.Sanders said he expected either he or Buttigieg to lead among delegate statistics by a tiny margin.A new batch of results released just after midnight narrowed the margin between Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and Sanders, the progressive senator from Vermont. Buttigieg has a lead of three state delegate equivalents out of 2,098 counted.However, the controversies that have dogged the vote since results tallying problems emerged almost as soon as polls closed continued on Thursday. The New York Times reported that one tranche of results released by the state Democratic party on Wednesday were “riddled with inconsistencies and other flaws”.The paper said that its own reporting showed that: “In some cases, vote tallies do not add up. In others, precincts are shown allotting the wrong number of delegates to certain candidates. And in at least a few cases, the Iowa Democratic party’s reported results do not match those reported by the precincts.”The deadlocked contest gives both Buttigieg and Sanders a burst of momentum as they seek to pull away from the crowded field. The nearly complete results show them leading the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, with former vice-president Joe Biden and Senator Amy Klobuchar trailing.But the results in Iowa were muddied by the stunning breakdown of the caucus reporting process in a state that traditionally kicks off presidential nominating contests. Iowa officials initially attributed a delay in reporting results to technical problems with an app that precinct chairs were supposed to use to record votes, then to backlogs as those volunteers tried to call the party to submit their totals.Much of the political world has already shifted its attention to next-up New Hampshire, which holds the first primary election in the Democrats’ 2020 nomination fight on Tuesday.Buttigieg and Sanders are separated by 40 years in age and conflicting ideology.Sanders, a 78-year-old self-described democratic socialist, has been a progressive powerhouse for decades. Buttigieg, a 38-year-old former municipal official, represents the more moderate wing of the Democratic party. Buttigieg is also the first openly gay candidate to earn presidential primary delegates from a major political party.Sanders and his supporters raised issues with the primary process after the 2016 election, prompting the Democratic National Committee to make changes that affected the Iowa reporting regulations.The final alignment results are used to determine state delegate equivalents, which is the metric the AP has long used to call the winner of the caucus. Democrats pick their nominee based on delegate totals.Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07bd9cfed4c06316e79dfc27fd11b703cc6c634b/0_167_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=766a597ba78f1c20b7eac06ab8ee4c78","title":"grassroots activism tell us about a local campaign that worked","story":"Share your experience of being involved in a successful grassroots community movement Are you involved in a grassroots community project.

But look, we can’t do anything, we are good strong healthy people and we’ve got good immune systems and fingers crossed that ... we can fight it off.“It’s a frightening situation but it is not a disease where if you get it, it’s certain death. You just have to be lighthearted about the whole situation.”The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the outbreak of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.David Abel, a British man who has provided regular video updates via Facebook, said he and his wife Sally – who are celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary – had accepted they were no longer on holiday.“We’re no longer on a cruise,” he said on Thursday. “All of the luxury of having a steward come into the cabin to make the bed and put chocolates on the pillow, change the towels and facecloths and clean the bathroom – those days are gone. It just ain’t happening.”The endless supply of buffet food and drink, along with activities, entertainment and shore visits, has abruptly dried up, replaced by what to the passengers must seem like relative austerity: one hot drink a day, no-frills meals and, according to Abel, a suspension of laundry and linen services.The cancelled itinerary for Wednesday included a dizzying array of activities, including tai chi and origami classes, Bible study, line dancing, bingo, karaoke, and “Music and Martinis with the Evergreen Duo” in the Crooners bar. Instead, passengers pinned their hopes on finding enough on-demand movies to sustain them during the long days ahead.But there was humour amid the resignation and uncertainty. One male passenger, who opened a Twitter account at the start of the quarantine, said he and his wife’s ninth wedding anniversary had been marked by news of another 10 infections among their fellow passengers. “Happy anniversary!” he wrote.Some celebrated minor victories: expanded lunch and dinner menus, breakfasts delivered at the appropriate time, an internet connection upgrade, a bigger movie selection, and, in Abel’s case, words of thanks from a masked female crew member whose concerned mother had been reassured by his video posts.Others tweeted photos of recently delivered playing cards, as well as sudoku and other puzzles that had been delivered to their rooms.On Thursday, the irrepressibly good-humoured Abel used his newfound online fame to issue a couple of requests. Life would be more tolerable, he said, with a daily banana and a glass of whisky, preferably a Talisker 10-year-old single malt served straight.On a more serious note, he added: “It’s a horrible situation for most passengers onboard, being stuck here, confined to the cabin,” he said, referring to those staying in cabins without a sea-view balcony. “It must be almost unbearable for them.”On Thursday evening, just two days into at least a fortnight of quarantine, they were told they would be allowed on the open deck for 90 minutes under the supervision of quarantine officers. They must stay one metre apart from each other and not make physical contact or form groups.Despite the restrictions, a blast of fresh air blowing in from the Pacific could not come soon enough for Clyde and Renee Smith, an American couple who are on the ship with their two adult grandsons.The couple’s room “is tiny, we don’t have a window, there are four of us – and only one chair”, Renee, 80, said earlier in the day, adding that they had passed the time by watching films.Their 25-year-old grandson, Sawyer Smith, was trying to stay in shape by doing sit-ups now that he was unable to visit the ship’s gym. “It’s not really to the point where we’re getting stir-crazy,” he said. “If they keep us in the rooms for four to five days it might be a little different.”Agencies contributed to this report."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac325c9d31bdc8b904b2b7ddddb6962b3c6d1a9a/0_342_1056_634/master/1056.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59223e8640bcfeb0881dbd4d42815551","title":"coronavirus evacuation flight canada leaves some family members stranded","story":"The evacuation flight is only open to Canadian passport holders – permanent residents and Chinese citizens are not eligibleAs an airplane chartered by the Canadian government departs central China on Thursday, hundreds of evacuees will breathe a sigh of relief as they leave Wuhan, the center of the coronavirus outbreak. But others with close ties to Canada will remain trapped in the quarantined city: the evacuation flight is only open to Canadian passport holders. Permanent residents and Chinese citizens are not eligible for a seat, unless they are the primary caregiver of a child on the flight manifest.It is a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are other examples – severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals.\u0026nbspThe virus causes\u0026nbsppneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.Two members of one family have been confirmed to have the virus in the UK, and a third person was diagnosed with it in Brighton, after more than 400 were tested and found negative. The Foreign Office has urged UK citizens to leave\u0026nbspChina\u0026nbspif they can.The number of people to have contracted the virus could be far higher, as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected. Modelling by\u0026nbspWorld Health Organization\u0026nbsp(WHO) experts at Imperial College London suggests there could be as many as 100,000 cases, with uncertainty putting the margins between 30,000 and 200,000.Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. The\u0026nbspNHS advises\u0026nbspthat people should call 111 instead of visiting the GP’s surgery as there is a risk they may infect others.Health experts are starting to say it could become a pandemic, but right now it falls short of what the WHO would consider to be one. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed in about 25 countries outside China, but by no means in all 195 on the WHO’s list.There is no need to panic. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern, and says there is a “window of opportunity” to halt the spread of the disease. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact.Among those stranded are Canadian permanent residents Danni Luo and her eight-year-old daughter Qinlin Li, who travelled to Wuhan on 19 January to celebrate Chinese lunar new year with family.“They’re not on that airplane. And I have no indication from the Canadian government that they will be on any airplane ever,” said Luo’s husband Monte Gisborne, speaking from the family home in Coquitlam, British Columbia.Gisborne said he feared the virus was “closing in” on his family.“Their neighbours are dying. My wife’s mother’s best friend has died of the coronavirus,” he said. “There are reported infections in the buildings around them. It’s like everything is closing in on them.”Canada will send a second flight to help those unable to board the first plane on 10 February, and the United States has also offered seats on an evacuation flight later on Thursday. But it remained unclear if the offers will be open to non-citizens.Luo and Li initially planned to return home on 15 February. But as news of the virus spread and panic seized the city, Luo changed their tickets to 28 January as a precautionary measure.Days later, however, Chinese authorities shut down transportation to and from the city, rendering the tickets useless.Gisborne said he had struggled to get answers from Canadian officials as he waits for his wife and daughter to return. “I’m so frustrated. I’m so fed up with this lack of communication, lack of planning, lack of direction.”Wayne Duplessis and Emily Tjandra, who work as teachers in Wuhan, initially welcomed news an aircraft would be taking Canadians out of the locked-down city.But they soon realized an evacuation would separate their family. Duplessis and his 15-year-old son Wyatt are Canadian citizens Emily and her older son Adryan, 38, are not.As they weighed their options, Duplessis said that advice from Canadian officials often arrived too late to be of use.“By the time I got the most recent details about the evacuation flight, people were already at the airport,” he said. “I don’t mean to be judgmental … but there are people here that need help – and they need some clear answers.”With roads shut down and no private cars or taxis on the road, just reaching the airport is a logistical challenge, he said.Further complicating matters is that Adryan, also a teacher, is trapped on the other side of the city at one of the school’s campuses.Because of the uncertainty, Duplessis and his wife have decided to stay in Wuhan.The family is “relatively comfortable”, with access to food and water in the high-rise apartment, he said. “Normally, there’s just so much humanity here. It’s wonderful,” he said. “But you’re not seeing that any more. It’s empty. The only reminder there are even people around you is at night, when their lights are turned on.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f3537f35c83722b18776353e44d13c3c0f5be38/0_133_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c1ca361317c2352d49e7c8e4df16585","title":"li wenliang coronavirus whistleblower doctor profile","story":"Li Wenliang was at the forefront of warning about the disease and treating sufferers before the virus took his life in WuhanFor most of his life, Li Wenliang was a successful but anonymous ophthalmologist, father and husband, based in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. But over the past two months, the 34-year-old had become a household name in China, known to hundreds of millions of people as the face and conscience of its spiralling coronavirus crisis.Late on Thursday, after state-controlled media outlets reported that he had died days earlier, the news was met with an extraordinary nationwide outpouring of grief and anger on social media.The response was an indication of how powerfully his story had resonated around the country as hundreds of millions of people faced the threat of a new disease, of still unknown lethality.Li tried to warn fellow doctors in the early days of the outbreak, posting a message alerting them to a mystery new disease at his hospital in late December. Seven people were in quarantine, the symptoms were similar to Sars, and doctors should consider wearing protective equipment to prevent infection, he said.Security forces came to his house four days after he sent that public health warning and accused him of “making false comments” and acting illegally to disturb social order. He signed a statement agreeing not to discuss the disease further.Yet within a week he would be infected himself, and within two weeks, China and the world would be talking of little else beyond the new disease, now identified as a coronavirus.Li himself was infected when he operated on a patient with glaucoma, who he did not know was carrying the virus. On 10 January he started to feel sick, and his symptoms worsened over the rest of the month.Hospitalised with fever and breathing problems, as he fought the illness, he also decided to fight the government, going public with details of how he had been silenced in the name of stability.He shared documents online and carried out interviews via text message, helping reporters piece together an alarming picture of official incompetence and negligence in the very period when containment might have been most possible.Almost overnight, he became a public figure – and a particularly rare one willing to take on the government in a system designed to muffle or crush dissent.Local authorities did eventually apologise to him and seven others investigated for “spreading rumours”, as public anger about the cover-up spread, and the central government admitted that the crisis had been mishandled in its early days.But it came too late for hundreds who have died, tens of thousands who have been infected, and Li himself. His stance, and his illness, seemed particularly poignant to many because he is father to a young child and his wife is pregnant with their second baby.His parents have also been reported as having contracted the virus. The health status of his wife and children is not clear.After several negative tests, on 30 January he was finally confirmed as one of thousands of coronavirus patients, he said on a social media post, along with an emoji of a dog with its eyes rolled back and tongue hanging out, the BBC reported. “Today nucleic acid testing came back with a positive result, the dust has settled. Finally diagnosed.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Vehicle underbody tests were suspended last week when fractures were found in equipmentMcDonald not allowed to voice support by \u0026lsquocabal in West Belfast\u0026rsquo, Jim O\u0026rsquoCallaghan saysPeadar T\u0026oacuteib\u0026iacuten would look to \u0026lsquorevisit\u0026rsquo legislation when it comes up for review next yearAnalysis: Discourse was low-key, restrained and very quickly faded into the backgroundDr Li Wenliang, who first warned about the virus, is among latest victimsThree arrested during Garda operation aimed at inner city street dealers\u0026lsquoWe are one of the few parties running in every constituency\u0026rsquo, says party leader\u0026lsquoOne of the most difficult\u0026rsquo inquests he has ever presided overResidents in Donegal disability centre living in \u0026lsquofearful environment\u0026rsquo due to violent actsMartin Feehan \u0026lsquoshould never be on a public road\u0026rsquo after \u0026lsquotruly scandalous\u0026rsquo manoeuvreDet Adrian Donohoe\u0026rsquos wife identified his body 90 minutes after he was shot deadFormer SF leader claims broadcaster falsely alleged he sanctioned killing of MI5 spyElection 2020: \u0026lsquoThere are more conversations about the election.

Photograph: Getty ImagesPolitical anoraks and candidates chasing the last seats in a constituency obsess about vote transfers and how they will affect their chance of election.Sinn Féin has become the story of this election given the seismic surge in opinion poll support for it through the three-week election campaign. As a result there is growing interest in its record in attracting transfers and where its own transfers tend to go.However, political analyst Sean Donnelly says that transfers “won’t be that important” in this election for Sinn Féin. If the polls are reflected in the results, he believes a lot of its candidates will be elected on the first count. “Most of their existing TDs will top the polls, and most of them don’t have a running mate,” he says, meaning there will be no splitting of the vote.The party is only running two candidates in four constituencies – Cavan-Monaghan, Donegal, Dublin Mid-West and Louth.Donnelly points out that transfers are completely overrated in Irish elections despite the system being based on the single transferable vote.“People say they play a huge part of our electoral system. They don’t – 90 per cent of seats are won on first count. People have a notion that transfers are like a rescue mission, that somebody’s stuck in a cave or something and we send out this rescue mission called transfers. It doesn’t happen.”He points to two rules that between them account for 97 per cent of seats.“The first is that you have to be in the frame on the first count. If it’s a five seater you have to be in the first five, in a four-seater you have to be in the first four,” and the same applies to a three-seat constituency. “Only 10 per cent of TDs are elected outside this rule.”Rule two is that you must have at least half a quota on the first count. “A half quota won’t guarantee you a seat but if you’ve less than half you’ve no chance,” he says.He said on notable exception was Cyprian Brady, who got less than 1,000 first preference votes – 2.7 per cent – in Dublin Central in the 2007 general election. However, transfers from poll-topping Fianna Fáil running mate taoiseach Bertie Ahern saw him elected in what became known as “human surplus”.Donnelly says “there isn’t a rule in the world there isn’t an exception to, but you can’t judge something on a freak exception like that”.He says transfers made no difference whatsoever in the November byelections. TransfersIn the 2016 general election, just 12 seats out of 158 were affected by transfers. His own analysis in RTÉ’s The Week In Politics Election 2011 guide showed that 11 seats were changed by transfers and in two of those cases the change was within a party – Fine Gael transferred to a different Fine Gael candidate.In 2007, 14 seats (8 per cent of 166) were affected by transfers, and in both 2002 and 1997 some 18 seats were affected (11 per cent).This time around it is estimated that about 12 seats out of 160 will be affected by transfers, which means that 148 will be effectively decided on the first count.Historically, Sinn Féin has not been transfer-friendly but this has improved with each election. In 2011 the party got 7 per cent of all transfers nationally, rising in 2016 to 12.5 per cent. That compares to 23 per cent for Fine Gael and 16 per cent for Fianna Fáil.And as for their surplus votes, 28 per cent did not transfer, 26 per cent went internally to other Sinn Féin candidates, while 17 per cent went to Fianna Fáil, 8 per cent to Fine Gael, and 5 per cent to Labour. One third of votes nationally did not transfer.If Sinn Féin’s momentum is retained on election day it will not be needing transfers, and other parties cannot rely on getting the party’s transfers as a strategy.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"harry mcgee s final seat prediction for election 2020","story":"There is an apocryphal quote that is often attributed to the late US president Lyndon Johnson about the vagaries of elections. After losing a particularly bitterly-fought election, he is reputed to have said: “The people have spoken, the bastards.” Predicting election campaigns in Ireland is a guessing game that sometimes presents itself as an inexact science. Opinion polls and the results of secondary elections such as council elections, byelections and European elections give you the direction of the wind. But the system we have in Ireland of multi-seat constituencies allied with transferable votes makes it a very difficult exercise to carry out with any degree of accuracy.No tally taken prior to voting could have told you that Bríd Smith of People Before Profit would win the last seat in Dublin South-Central in 2016, by less than 40 votes, from Fianna Fáil’s Catherine Ardagh, relying wholly on the distribution of a tiny surplus that had got Joan Collins over the line in a previous count.Usually, there are predictors. For this general election it was last year’s round of local and European elections, as well as the autumn opinion polls, plus the November byelections. But they have all been thrown out the window since the start of the campaign. In Lazarus fashion, Sinn Féin has confounded expectations and become the party for the strong prevailing mood of the electorate: and that is change. Nobody foresaw it, not even Sinn Féin. The party now lacks candidates in constituencies where it might have won a second seat. Fine Gael has tumbled down. Fianna Fáil looks like it’s treading water a bit but there might be a latent support there. Of the rest, only the Greens look stronger, but outside Dublin, they remain niche.The 33rd Dáil will have an extra two seats compared with the outgoing Dáil, bringing the total up to 160. That means extra seats in Cavan-Monaghan, Kildare South and Dublin Central. In addition, Laois and Offaly combine into one constituency, with five seats overall rather than six.Here is my tally, broken down by party and where I see they may gain some seats and lose others.1. Dublin Mid-West: This would be a technical gain as the party has no seat here after losing the byelection for Frances Fitzgerald’s former seat. Emer Higgins should safely take one seat out of four and the party might even consider itself in with a shout for a second seat, although that is a long shot.2. Cork North-Central: This is another technical gain as there is a vacant seat. Fine Gael has no seat there since Dara Murphy’s resignation in December. Colm Burke should easily win one seat for the party in the four-seat constituency.3. Tipperary:  The target is seat held by Independent Séamus Healy. Fine Gael has gone out on a limb by picking two new and relatively unknown candidates. It had a full quota in 2016 but terrible vote management and candidate selection lost it its seat. The party’s strong local election performance should provide it with the basis for a seat here at the expense of an Independent. Was it a mistake by Mary Newman Julian not to contest the local elections, unlike her running mate Garret Ahearn? Could they repeat the mistakes of 2016? The mood has darkened considerably here.4. Cavan-Monaghan: There is an extra seat in this constituency. Fianna Fáíl already has two and is unlikely to win three. Sinn Féin has traditionally been not as strong in Cavan as in Monaghan. But the surge in the poll now means that Pauline Tully could edge out Fine Gael’s TP O’Reilly for the last seat. This would be a big body blow.5. Cork North-West: The target is a Fianna Fáil seat. A one-point increase needed in vote share compared with 2016. John Paul O’Shea ran as an Independent in 2016 and did well. Now under the Fine Gael banner will run Fianna Fáíl close.6. Cork East: Target is a Sinn Féin seat. A two percentage-point increase in vote share is required compared with 2016. Again a close battle with Fianna Fáil looked in prospect to topple a precarious Sinn Féin seat. Pa O’Driscoll is based in the northern end of the constituency and while the teacher has a high profile and is a strong campaigner, he might struggle for transfers in the latter counts. On balance, it’s hard to see Sinn Féin not holding the seat, even though the party is not showing as strongly in Munster.7. Dublin-Rathdown: Shane Ross is the target. A five percentage-point increase in vote share required compared with 2016. Neale Richmond will need to put in a huge performance to create one of the shocks of the day by taking out Ross. And now, it is not only Ross but also Fianna Fáil’s Shay Brennan he has to worry about.8. Kerry: The target is a Sinn Féin seat. A five-point increase is required. The Sinn Féin seat is no longer in such danger. Fine Gael’s candidate Michael Kennelly comes from a well-known Listowel GAA family. Fianna Fáil looks marginally stronger though after the local elections but there is a neater geographical ide between Kennelly and sitting TD Brendan Griffin. May be moot now if Pa Daly can harness all of the Martin Ferris vote.9. Longford-Westmeath: The target is a Labour Party seat. Another ding-dong battle between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael for a vulnerable seat, this time the one vacated by Labour’s Willie Penrose. It will boil down to be a bout between two Longford candidates. Fianna Fáíl is stronger in the constituency overall but Fine Gael is stronger in Longford (it won 39 per cent of the vote in last year’s local elections. Its candidate Micheál Carrigy has a high profile. A bellwether constituency. Don’t rule out Sinn Féin.10. Galway East: A five-point gain is required to take a seat off Seán Canney. This will be a local battle, between the outgoing Tuam Independent and Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil rivals from the same area. Fine Gael’s Peter Roche performed strongly in the local elections but Fianna Fáil had a big day in Tuam, taking four out of seven. Again very, very tight. But on opinion poll evidence you would have to favour Fianna Fáil, or even Canney holding.11. Louth: A two-point increase is required. The target is Independent Peter Fitzpatrick. Fine Gael has only one seat here after Fitzpatrick’s resignation from the party in 2018. Dundalk-based councillor John McGahon will be one of five jousting for the last seat and might just come up short.12. Limerick City: The target is a Labour seat. A five-point rise on 2016 is required. Others, Fianna Fáil and the Greens, look stronger in the battle for the final seat with Jan O’Sullivan.1. Dún Laoghaire: to Fianna FáilGreens. A certainty. Fine Gael holds three seats out of four because outgoing ceann comhairle Seán Barrett was automatically returned in 2016. He is not standing this time. The party won 25 per cent of the vote in 2016. Now it’s looking at the dismal scenario of returning only one seat here.2. Dublin North-West: to Fianna Fáíl. Probability is high. Noel Rock is a very doughty campaigner but he is up against it this time. He narrowly saw off Fianna Fáil’s Paul McAuliffe in 2016 but his rival is in a much stronger position now, and Fianna Fáil had a very strong local election here. Sinn Féin has been on the slide here but it would be hard to see Dessie Ellis’s fall being so dramatic as to lose.3. Galway West: to Greens or Fianna Fáil. Probability is medium to high. Like Clare the party managed to retain two seats with only 24 per cent of the vote, and relied heavily on Labour transfers. Its two TDs, Seán Kyne and Hildegarde Naughton, are high profile but would need to increase the party’s share of the vote against parties whose support levels are rising.4. Dublin Bay South: to the Labour Party. Probability low to medium. The second Fine Gael seat could be in play here if Labour’s Kevin Humphreys gains traction. A strong Green performance could also impact. If the  opinion poll for Fine Gael is correct, this might make one of its seats in this “true blue” constituency vulnerable.5. Wexford:  to Independent or Sinn Féin. Paul Kehoe clung on in 2016 will face a challenge again. Sinn Féin’s Johnny Mythen performed well in the recent byelection and the party is flying in the polls. Verona Murphy’s candidacy could also have an impact on Kehoe.6. Clare: to IndependentFianna Fáíl. The party won less votes than Fianna Fáíl in 2016 but still managed to retain both seats thanks to Labour transfers. Fianna Fáil seems to have a very strong ticket and should win a second seat. The decision by Michael Harty not to run will be a boon to it. Fine Gael’s only vulnerability is losing to another Independent candidate in the shape of Michael McNamara.7. Dublin South-Central: to GreensFianna Fáil. Catherine Byrne has survived here against all the odds but this might be one election too many. Fianna Fáíl looks strong for a seat as do the Greens. Something will have to give and it could be Fine Gael.8. Meath East: to Sinn Féin. Darren O’Rourke was not all that far away in 2016 and will not be all that far away this time either. Many of those who live on the Dublin side of the constituency are commuters who are one of the big groups clamouring for change. Regina Doherty’s seat, in particular, is vulnerable.1. Dún Laoghaire: There is an extra seat. Needs a one per cent increase in vote share compared with the 2016 general election. Last time out this was a three-seater because outgoing Ceann Comhairle Seán Barrett was a TD. Fianna Fáil do have a quota so should pick up a seat. It is running two candidates, Mary Hanafin and Cormac Devlin\u0026nbspand there is a danger they could cancel each other out. The Greens look strong for a seat here.2. Dublin North-West: Target is a Fine Gael seat. Needs a one per cent rise in support from the 2016 general election. Finglas-based Paul McAuliffe topped the poll amid a strong Fianna Fáil performance in the local elections and is current Lord Mayor. Fine Gael’s Noel Rock relied hugely on Labour transfers to pip him last time out and he looks very vulnerable.3. Dublin Central: There is an extra seat in this constituency. Needs a five percentage-point increase since 2016: This moves from a three- to four-seat constituency. Mary Fitzpatrick would need to add five points to her 11 per cent showing in 2016 though she performed very strongly in her own electoral area in the local elections. Mary Lou McDonald will top the poll and the Greens also look as if they they may pip Garry Gannon of the Social Democrats.4. Dublin South-Central: One per cent increase required compared with 2016. Target is Independent or People Before Profit seats, or perhaps Fine Gael. Catherine Ardagh lost out by less than 40 votes in 2016. She has had a high profile since as her party’s leader in the Seanad and Fianna Fáil did well in the local elections. Only seat safe here is Sinn Féin and she is an odds-on favourite to regain the seat once held by her late father, Seán Ardagh. Sinn Féin would have won two seats here if it ran two candidates.5. Clare: Target is an Independent or Fine Gael seat. Two percentage-point rise required since 2016: Fine Gael’s second seat here was very vulnerable until Independent Michael Harty announced he would not contest the election. Fianna Fáil seems to have got its formula right. Cathal Crowe is a strong candidate who did himself no harm with his boycott of the proposed Royal Irish Constabulary event. It had five per cent more votes at 30 per cent than Fine Gael in 2016 but won only seat, while its rival won two. It looks as if Fine Gael will be the loser here, with Independent and former Labour TD Michael McNamara and Green Róisín Garvey in the hunt for the fourth seat.6. Galway East: Target is an Independent seat held by Seán Canney: Six percentage-point increase needed compared with 2016: Tuam is going to be the battleground here. Canney is defending a seat he won handily. The other two seats are in the southeastern Loughrea-Portumna axis held by Anne Rabbitte of Fianna Fáil and in the Athenry-GortKinvara southern axis held by Fine Gael’s Ciarán Cannon. The Independent brand around Tuam, so strong from 2014-2016, receded in last year’s local elections. Fine Gael has chosen a strong councillor, Peter Roche who topped the poll in Tuam. But Fianna Fáil won four out of seven council seats in Tuam, and that might give it an edge. It has chosen Cllr Donagh Killilea, a son of the late TD and MEP Mark Killilea. He’s come late into the race though but at this stage he might be ahead of Roche. Don’t underestimate Canney.7. Kerry: Target is a Sinn Féin seat. An eight percentage-point increase needed here from 2016. Sinn Féin was vulnerable but not any more. Fianna Fáil had very good local elections and the addition of Tralee councillor Norma Foley gives it a very strong ticket and may dent the impact Michael Healy-Rae had in the northern part of the constituency in 2016. Norma Moriarty is comfortably placed in the Iveragh Peninsula in the south while sitting TD John Brassil is from Ballyheigue, geographically close to Foley. Fine Gael has a strong Listowel-based councillor Mike Kennelly as its second candidate. But Pa Daly, seen as a beaten docket a month ago, is now back in the frame for Sinn Féin.8. Longford-Westmeath: Target is a Labour seat. Seven percentage-point increase needed from 2016: Fianna Fáil is the largest party in the entire constituency but the last seat may turn out to be a battle between Fianna Fáíl’s Joe Flaherty and Micheál Carrigy for the “Longford” seat, a county in which Fine Gael is stronger. And now Sorca Clarke of Sinn Féin has moved into view.9. Carlow-Kilkenny: The target is a Sinn Féin or Fine Gael seat and a two percentage-point increase is required. Winning three out of five seats is always a massive task and if Fianna Fáíl pulls it off here, it will be well on its way to government. John McGuinness and Bobby Aylward ided the Kilkenny vote very well last time. Sinn Féin’s Kathleen Funchion is no longer vulnerable. Fianna Fáil’s Carlow candidate Jennifer Murnane O’Connor came very close in 2016 and could get over the line this time. But will it be at the expense of Pat Deering of Fine Gael, or of her running mate, Aylward?10. Cork East: Target is a Sinn Féin seat. Four percentage-point increase required since 2016. Another Sinn Féin TD, Pat Buckley, looked like facing a challenge following a poor local election for the party in Co Cork but now is seen as safe, even though the Sinn Féin vote is not as strong in Munster. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael’s second candidates had only a handful of votes separating them the last time around. The party’s second candidates are at opposite ends of the constituency. It’s now marginal.11. Laois-Offaly: A Fine Gael seat is the target. A four percentage-point increase in required. It is a Fianna Fáil heartland and Fine Gael’s Marcella Corcoran Kennedy had a middling vote in 2016. However, Fine Gael did well in locals and it would be a tall order for Fianna Fáil to win three out of five here. Brian Stanley of Sinn Féin remains strong in Portlaoise.12. Louth: A Sinn Féin or Independent seat is the target. A nine point increase is needed. Fianna Fáil could have a higher percentage of votes than Fine Gael but might struggle with getting enough transfers to bring the party over the line. Its second candidate, James Byrne, is based in Drogheda where there is already a number of strong candidates. Sinn Féin now looks as if it will hold on to two which would make it a tricky proposition for Byrne to join Declan Breathnach in the Dáíl.13. Kildare South: An extra seat. A four percentage-point increase is required. An effective three-seater because Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl was elected here. Fianna Fáil won two out of three in 2016 when it was actually a three-seater but a taller order this time as Mark Wall of Labour could sneak in. Suzanne Doyle is a high-profile running mate for sitting TD Fiona O’Loughlin and there is potential there. But it’s less straightforward than 2016. Fiona McLoughlin Healy and Cathal Berry are two Independents, one of whom might spring a surprise.14. Dublin South-West: The target is an Independent seat. Fianna Fáil got a quota here in 2016 and would need an eight-point increase in first-preference votes plus good vote management to win a second seat. However, candidate Charlie O’Connor had a mammoth local election in Tallaght and could squeeze through in a big field at the expense of Katherine Zappone or Paul Murphy.15. Dublin Fingal: The target is a Fine Gael seat. A five percentage-point boost is needed. On paper the party has a chance here of taking a second seat after getting 1.4 quotas in 2016. However, the Greens will now need to take it in a scenario where Fine Gael is winning no seats. A very tall order.16. Galway West: A five percentage-point increase is required. Fianna Fáil won more votes here than Fine Gael in 2016 but still returned only one TD. One of the Fine Gael TDs could be vulnerable but the disparity between Eamon Ó Cuív’s votes, and his running mates’ have always been too high. Against that, the party had a good local election in the city, and Ollie Crowe is an experienced candidate. His chances are remote though given the crowded field, and the strengths of other newish candidates such as Niall Ó Tuathail of the Social Democrats, Pauline O’Reilly of the Green Party, and (perhaps) Mairéad Farrell of Sinn Féin.17. Limerick City: A Labour Party seat is the target. Fianna Fáil has a strong ticket in Willie O’Dea and James Collins, a cousin of Niall’s. Sinn Féin’s Maurice Quinlivan looked on shaky ground a month ago but no more. Jan O’Sullivan might be more precarious.18. Dublin Rathdown: The target is the Independent Seat. An eight-point increase over 2016 is required. This was going to be the only constituency in the country where Fianna Fáíl had no seat. But in the last week, Shay Brennan has been talked up as a possible challenger for Shane Ross’s seat, which has come as a huge surprise.1. Wicklow: Could miss out to Greens, Social Democrats or Independents. Stephen Donnelly won almost 21 per cent of the vote here in 2016 but as a Social Democrat. With 13 per cent of the vote in 2016, Fianna Fáil would need to add at least 9 per cent to have any chance of taking a second seat. The big unknown is how Donnelly’s vote will be impacted by him being a Fianna Fáil candidate. It will certainly be a negative drag despite his profile as his party’s health spokesman. Valerie Cox’s candidacy will not be a help.3. Sligo-Leitrim: Again Fianna Fáil won two out of four here on 32 per cent of the vote. Fine Gael had a good local election in Sligo but Fianna Fáil is still a little stronger. Marian Harkin’s entry into the race has upset all that planning. If she knocks out a sitting TD, the most likely is one of the two Fianna Fáil deputies. But there is a scenario where Fine Gael – which again messed up its candidate strategy here – could end up with zero seats.4. Kildare North: Could lose to Greens or Labour Party. Fianna Fáil won the second seat here on the back of a lowish first preference. The Green Party candidate, Vincent P Martin, might pose a threat, as might Labourveteran Emmet Stagg. Now Sinn Féin could also be a player here. On balance, it could be a hold, especially if vote management remains as disciplined as it was in 2016.5. Roscommon-Galway: Fianna Fáil is potentially vulnerable to Fine Gael in the only constituency where it has no representation. Fine Gael’s Aisling Dolan is based in Ballinasloe and not widely known in Roscommon. Fine Gael had a poor local election in Roscommon. Besides Denis Naughten is still regarded as proxy Fine Gael. It will be interesting to see if the addition of the high-profile Órla Leyden will affect the dynamic between herself and sitting TD, Eugene Murphy. On balance, a hold.6. Dublin Bay South: Labour poses a threat. Jim O’Callaghan got elected with just over half a quota in 2016. He has been helped by having a high profile but if he fails to add to his first preferences, he might find Labour’s Kevin Humphreys breathing down his neck. He relied a lot on transfers from Chris Andrews of Sinn Féin in 2016 and may not get as many. The absence of Michael McDowell from the slate will help his cause. Very unlikely to lose.1. Donegal: Target is an Independent seat. It needs a one-point increase in vote share over 2016. Pádraig Mac Lochlainn narrowly lost out to Thomas Pringle in 2016 using an ill-advised three-candidate strategy. This time there is just two candidates and the party has high hopes it can win back its second seat. Will be tight though.2. Dublin West: Target is Labour PartyS-PBP. A two percentage point increase needed over 2016. Paul Donnelly has been knocking on the door in Dublin West and was the last remaining unsuccessful candidate in 2016. However, Sinn Féin did not have a great local election but it is in constituencies like this that it has a gale wind behind it. Ruth Coppinger looks in real trouble, as does Labour. A certain win.3. Wexford: Target is Fine Gael. A two-point increase is needed. Another constituency where Sinn Féin came close to winning a seat in 2016. There have been mixed messages this year, a poor local election and a slightly better byelection performance. However, the momentum has returned and Johnny Mythen might be the fit. He is located to the north of the constituency which might be a handicap.4. Cavan-Monaghan: There is an extra seat in this constituency. A six-point increase is needed. This is one of the few constituencies where Sinn Féin has the potential to win a second seat. Cavan has always been a bit of a challenge for it but this time Pauline Tully is highly experienced and has a chance alongside Matt Carthy.5. Mayo: Target is a Fine Gael seat. Rose Conway-Walsh is an excellent Senator but always seemed to be coming up a little short in Mayo. But the surge in party support will certainly make her a contender here, and if she is ahead of the Greens’ Saoirse McHugh, which is likely, her transfers might push the Sinn Féin candidate over the line.6. Longford-Westmeath: A new planet is discovered in the galaxy. Sorca Clarke was seen as a mid-table finisher until a fortnight ago but now Sinn Féin can challenge in this constituency. I still see the final seat going to either Fianna Fáíl or Fine Gael.1. Dublin Mid-West: to Fine Gael. This was almost certain before the campaign started but the party will now be in the mix to retain its two TDs in this four-seat constituency. Its challenge will be to stay ahead of Gino Kenny, the Greens and Paul Gogarty.2. Louth: to the Labour Party. Possibility is medium to low. The party always had a tall order on its hands retaining two seats in Louth following Gerry Adams’s retirement. And while it won more than 24 per cent of the vote in the local elections, it needs a higher volume of number ones to compensate for lack of transfers. A fortnight ago, I would have said No. Now, I would say it has a good chance of holding.3. Cork East: to Fianna FáilFine Gael. This a bit of long shot. Pat Buckley looked a goner last May after the party bombed in the locals. But it’s bounced back and so has he. While Sinn Féin not showing up as highly in Munster, he can ward off the challenge from Fianna Fáíl and Fine Gael.Other constituencies: I had another eight constituencies marked as potential losses for Sinn Féin. But that was a fortnight ago. And the world has changed since then.1. Louth: Target is Sinn FéinIndependent. A two percentage-point increase is needed compared with 2016. Despite coming out of government, Labour very narrowly lost a number of seats and this was one of them. Ged Nash will be buoyed by the party’s strong showing in its stronghold of Drogheda and is in contention to take a seat, although it will be a scrap.2. Dublin Bay North: The party is targeting seats vacated by Independents. A two-point increase in vote share is needed. This constituency is always unpredictable because of the huge number of candidates. Aodhán Ó Ríordáin’s passage to regain a seat is helped hugely by the retirements of Finian McGrath and Tommy Broughan. If he does not win, Labour can pack up and call it a day.3. Kildare South: There is an extra seat in this constituency. A six point increase is needed. The addition of a seat will favour Mark Wall to take a position once held by his father, Jack. However, he needs to spread his support beyond his Athy base and may be vulnerable to Fianna Fáil’s Suzanne Doyle, or an asymmetric challenge from two strong Independents.4. Cork North-Central: Target is Solidarity-People Before Profit. Five per cent increase needed compared to 2016 election. Solidarity’s Mick Barry will struggle to recapture 15 per cent of the vote from 2016 but will not lose his seat easily. Labour’s John Maher performed well in the byelections and has established a profile after winning a council seat. Labour has not really recovered fully here after being floored in 2016. Maher may be in contention for the last seat but confidence has ebbed a little since start of campaign.5. Waterford:  Target is an Independent seat. A four-point increase is required. With John Halligan’s resignation, there will be a spare seat here. The big parties each have one seat and Labour looks the best placed of the small parties to benefit, through John Pratt. He will have to fend off Marc Ó Cathasaigh of the Greens who are growing here but also – more immediately – Cllr Matt Shanahan, the Independent who has led the high-profile campaign to improve services at Waterford hospital. Pratt may be behind the curve a little here.6. Dublin South-Central: Target is Fine GaelPeople Before Profit. A four percentage-point boost is needed. Like Dublin Bay North, this constituency will involve a scramble for the last seat. If Labour stays ahead of Greens and other left-leaning candidates, Rebecca Moynihan could come close. She is a very impressive candidate but it’s a slightly long shot.7. Kildare North:  Target is Fianna Fáil. A four-point increase is needed. Veteran Emmet Stagg was not that far away in 2016. He will need to stay ahead of the Greens and then rely on heavy transfers from them. Marginal.8. Dublin Central: There is an extra seat here. A five-point increase is needed. Another veteran Joe Costello is the Labour standard bearer and will be in the mix in the final shake-up. Might not happen this time though. Unlikely.9. Dún Laoghaire: Cllr Juliet O’Connell has had an impressive breakthrough year after getting elected as a councillor last year. She’s still comparatively new though and might suffer a slight profile deficit, given her late entry into the race. It must not be forgotten Labour held a seat here for many years but to win she would really have to dislodge Richard Boyd Barrett, who holds the sole left-wing seat in the constituency. Very slim chance.1. Longford-Westmeath: Potential loss to Fine GaelFianna Fáil. Possibility is high. Willie Penrose is retiring having defied all odds, and laws of gravity, in 2016. It’s hard to see Labour retaining this seat even though former county footballer, Alan Mangan, has a high profile.2. Dublin West: to Green PartySinn Féin. Possibility is high. The Greens look poised to win a seat here, with Fine Gael seeking a second seat, and Sinn Féin is also poised to take a seat at the expense of Ruth Coppinger. Joan Burton held the seat here in 2016 against the odds but you sense the tide might have run out on her.3. Limerick City:  Jan O’Sullivan looked comparatively safe until Sinn Féin managed to get back on the pitch. If Fianna Fáíl gets a second seat here it could be at her expense. She survived in 2016 and she is likely to survive again.1. Dún Laoghaire: Extra seat. A 10-point boost is needed. If the party does not win a seat here, there will be no Green surge. It had a big local election here and should win its first seat in the constituency.2. Dublin West: Target is LabourSolidarity Party. An eight-point increase is required. Green Party chairman Roderic O’Gorman has been its candidate here for some time now and is expected to win a seat on the back of a really strong local election performance by him and colleagues.3. Dublin Bay North: Target is Sinn FéinIndependent. An eight-point rise is required. The party was nowhere here in 2016 but again the momentum is with it after the local elections in a constituency where it did particularly well. David Healy won’t get it easy though and will have to fight it out with the Social Democrats, Independent John Lyons, and Labour for two seats.4. Dublin Central: Extra seat. A seven percentage-point increase is needed. The party did well in both local election areas with Ciarán Cuffe topping the poll in the north inner city. Its leader on Dublin City Council Neasa Hourigan is the candidate. She is impressive. She seems slightly ahead of Garry Gannon of the Social Democrats in the race for the final seat.5. Dublin South-West: Target is an Independent seat. An eight-point increase is needed. The party will have an impact on Fine Gael and the Independent Minister Katherine Zappone. It elected councillors comfortably in all the middle-class areas of the constituency and Cllr Francis Noel Duffy (the husband of deputy leader Catherine Martin) is favoured to take a seat.6. Cork South-Central: Target is Sinn Féin. A six point boost is required. Lorna Bogue will need to mount a huge challenge to dislodge Sinn Féin’s Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire for the last seat in a constituency of heavy hitters Micheál Martin, Michael McGrath and Simon Coveney are the other TDs. She is very much on the left of the party and will compete for transfers from smaller groups and left-leaning Independents.7. Wicklow:  Target is Fianna FáilFine Gael. A six-point increase is needed. The party is hardly above five per cent in Wicklow but can benefit from transfers in a constituency where there are always multiple candidates. Fianna Fáil (Stephen Donnelly) and Sinn Féin votes are both expected to drop somewhat and the Green candidate Steven Matthews had an impressive haul of votes in the locals last year. With so many candidates, including Valerie Cox, it might be too big an ask.8. Galway West:  Target is Fine GaelIndependent. A six-point increase in vote share from 2016 is required. Pauline O’Reilly is a strong candidate who will be in the mix after the party had a good local elections in Galway City and in Connemara. The question is how strong the vote will be outside the city. She is also competing against Catherine Connolly for votes who is very strong in the city. There is also the impressive Niall Ó Tuathail of the Social Democrats and Sinn Féin’s Mairéad Farrell is now back in the frame. No certainty at all.9. Waterford: Target is an Independent seat. A six-point increase is required. There is a seat for the taking by a smaller party in Waterford with Halligan standing down. Former senator Grace O’Sullivan would have been a strong favourite if she had not run for Europe. Her replacement Marc Ó Cathasaigh will need to battle hard to break through against a strong challenge from Labour and from Matt Shanahan. He might just snatch it.10. Kildare North: Target is Fianna Fáíl. A seven-point increase in vote share is required. A commuter constituency where the Greens made a big breakthrough in the local elections winning three seats on the council. Naas-based Vincent P Martin, brother of deputy leader Catherine Martin, is a smooth campaigner and will give Fianna Fáíl a run for its money in the battle for the last seat.11. Louth: Target is Independent. A five-point increase of vote share is required. There were high hopes a decade ago that Mark Dearey might make a breakthrough for the Greens here. The former senator is a popular figure but would need to double the party’s vote in the constituency.12. Clare: This is another constituency which has seen a candidate or party emerge out of nowhere. There’s definitely a seat for an Independent or smaller party here following the retirement of Michael Harty. Róisín Garvey is a straight-talking west Clare woman who has made a big impact and will be vying with Michael McNamara for that seat.1. Dublin Central: Extra seat. A one-point increase is needed. Gary Gannon changed local electoral areas in the locals and was comfortably elected. He came very close in 2016, enjoys a high profile and will be in a battle with the Greens, Fianna Fáil and Labour for one of the final two seats here.2. Dublin Bay North: Target is Sinn FéinIndependents. Another very solid Social Democrats performer is Cian O’Callaghan. The forward momentum of the Greens and John Lyons might stymie his chances though.3. Galway West: Target is Fine GaelIndependent. A five-point increase in vote share required. Niall Ó Tuathail was another Social Democrats’ star in 2016 with a strong showing in Galway West. Has he maintained the progress? Some would consider it ill advised for him not to have contested the local election. Council seats are seen as springboards for national politics. Still in with a strong chance.4. Wicklow: Target is Fianna Fáil. Jennifer Whitmore had a very good local election and topped the poll in Greystones, Donnelly’s stomping ground. He got 20 per cent last time when he ran for the Social Democrats. But a lot of that was a personal vote. Wicklow can be very unpredictable. Nobody knows how well Donnelly will do flying under the Fianna Fáil banner. Valerie Cox is an unknown quantity. Whitmore could very well be in contention for the final seat if she manages to capitalise on her local election performance.1. Cork North-Central: to Labour Party. Mick Barry had 15 per cent of the vote here in 2016 but the signs in the local elections, and in the recent byelection, were ominous. He is going to struggle but his vote will certainly be higher than the locals suggested. Facing threats from Labour and, possibly, the Greens.2. Dublin South-Central: to Fianna Fáil. Bríd Smith won with only a handful of votes to spare in 2016 and could be vulnerable this time to Fianna Fáil, the Greens, the Social Democrats and Labour. Some see this as a battle between her and Joan Collins in that left-wing space, even though both are based in different parts of the constituency.3. Dubin Mid-West: to IndependentGreens or Sinn Féin. Gino Kenny came from nowhere to win a seat in 2016 and this popular and sincere TD might just hang on, partly on the back of his championing medicinal cannabis, which has given him a national profile. There are two left-wing seats in the constituency, and Sinn Féin is now looking to win a second. Another threat will come from an Independent candidate, possibly Paul Gogarty.4. Dublin West: Vulnerable to Sinn Féin. Ruth Coppinger has been an indefatigable worker and has a national profile. But so do the other TDs, Leo Varadkar, Burton and Jack Chambers. Her seat is under huge threat.5. Dún Laoghaire: To Fianna Fáil or the Greens. There has always been a left-wing seat in this constituency, and Richard Boyd Barrett might just hold on to it. However, that would mean getting in ahead of one of the two big parties, or the Greens.6. Dublin South-West: to Fianna Fail or Greens. It’s very hard to predict how Paul Murphy will fare, in his new role as the sole Rise TD in the Dáil. He did very well in 2016 on the back of the water protests but might find it difficult to maintain his support levels in the constituency. The decision by Solidarity to run Sandra Fay against her former party colleagues sounds ludicrous and could have an adverse impact on him. Both are running under the S-PBP banner.1. Dublin Mid-West (Paul Gogarty): Target is People Before Profit. Gogarty could take the fourth seat on the back of a reasonably good outing in the byelection.2. Sligo-Leitrim (Marian Harkin): Target is Fianna Fáil. The former MEP and TD has a very big cachet in the constituency and was wooed by Fine Gael. That offer might play a bit against her but she will be a threat to Fianna Fáíl.3. Wexford (Verona Murphy): Target is Fine Gael. Murphy is as well-known as she is controversial and early in the campaign was seen poised to take a seat at the expense of Paul Kehoe. However, Sinn Féin’s Johnny Mythen might top the poll and that might put paid to her chances.4. Clare (Michael McNamara): Target is IndependentFine Gael. There is an outgoing Independent TD, Michael Harty, who is retiring. Clare has a tradition of electing Independents and it might prove lucky for the former Labour Party TD.5. Waterford (Matt Shanahan): The “hospital candidate” has a very high profile locally and loss of hospital services is always a touchstone issue. Shanahan is in with a chance and will be vying with the Greens and Labour for the final seat.5. Dublin Bay North (John Lyons): The former People Before Profit councillor has an excellent track record on Dublin City Council and could cause an upset here against one of the three smaller left-leaning parties vying for the final seat.1. Laois-Offaly (Carol Nolan): Laois and Offaly were two separate three-seat constituencies in 2016. Now, it’s a five-seater and former Sinn Féin TD Carol Nolan could be the obvious loser.2. Tipperary (Seamus Healy): to Fine Gael. Healy has been a great survivor but a change of mood might see him struggle.3. Donegal (Thomas Pringle): to Sinn Féin. Pringle has also been a solid vote-getter but Sinn Féin has been working really hard since 2016 to regain a seat.4. Galway East (Seán Canney): to Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. Canney is a Minister of State and a hard constituency worker but will find it hard to resist the two bigger parties. His best hope is to stay ahead of their Tuam-based candidates.5. Dublin South-West (Katherine Zappone): to GreensFianna Fáil.Very hard to gauge how the Minister for Children will do. She benefitted from anti-establishment transfers in 2016 but may be able to trade on her performance as Minister with another set of voters.6. Dublin Rathdown (Shane Ross): to Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil: This is a very fickle constituency and this year’s poll topper is next year’s also-ran. Ross’s star has been waning here and his is under strong pressure from Neale Richmond and (surprisingly) Shay Brennan. However, he seems a little stronger now than at this time last year, having considerably upped his performance as Minister.8. Louth (Peter Fitzpatrick): to Fine Gael. It’s hard to know how the Independent TD, formerly of Fine Gael, will do without a party banner. He is the chairman of Louth GAA this year and that is always a boon. But there are some very big hitters among his rivals and it will be difficult for him to survive.Harry McGee is political correspondent with The The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4164668.1581029356!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"labour leader calls for left of centre alliance in rt%C3%A9 debate","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Ruth Coppinger Solidarity - People before Profit, Róisín Shortall Co-leader Social Democrats, Brendan Howlin Labour Party, Peadar Tóibín of Aontú and Eamon Ryan  of the Green Party at the last of RTÉ’s leaders’ debate. Photograph:  MaxwellsLabour leader, Brendan Howlin, has made a fresh call on the Social Democrats and the Green Party to form a “left-of-centre progressive alliance” in advance of any talks on their possible inclusion in the formation of a new government following Saturday’s general election.Speaking on RTÉ’s Prime Time during the last major TV debate before polling day, which involved representatives of the smaller political parties, Mr Howlin said such an alliance of like-minded parties should be formed rather than allow each to be “picked off” during any talks on the make-up of a future coalition government.The Labour leader said he had already made the suggestion without any pre-condition and would welcome the opportunity to meet with the leaders of the Social Democrats and the Green Party next week to discuss such an alliance.Social Democrats co-leader, Róisín Shortall did not respond directly to the proposal but said the three parties already enjoyed “a high level of co-operation”.With polls showing Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin each capturing between 20 and 25 per cent of the vote, the smaller parties – Labour, the Green Party, Social Democrats, SolidarityPeople Before Profit and Aontú are expected to have considerable influence on the formation of the next government.With the focus moved away from the three main parties, the various representatives availed of their moment in the spotlight to highlight some of their policies which they argued differentiated them from rival parties in a debate that lacked any real clash.Geographic isionsAontú leader, Peadar Tóibín, who criticised RTÉ’s decision to omit his party from the first debate with political leaders at NUI Galway on January 27th, said it aimed to solve the country’s geographic isions of major congestion in the cities while rural Ireland was “emptying out its young people”.Justifying the need for a new political choice for voters, the Meath West TD observed: “There are a lot of political parties but not much political difference.”Mr Tóibín claimed many parties of the left had become distracted by “culture wars and identity politics”.Asked if he would not still be a Sinn Féin TD but for the abortion issue, Mr Tóibín said he believed his inability to influence the direction of that party had led him to form a new party.He said Sinn Féin, like other parties, suffered from a “central groupthink”.Asked about priorities and possible “red line” issues, Ms Coppinger said SolidarityPeople Before Profit wanted to use “wealth and resources for the benefit of the majority” in particular to tackle the crises in housing and health.“Housing is the single biggest issue bar none,” Ms Coppinger said.She claimed one of its proposals was a “millionaire’s tax” which would generate €4 billion but was considered “off limits” by other parties.For the Social Democrats, Ms Shortall said the party was very keen to ensure it brought “integrity and honesty to politics” and that it was straight with people about solutions.She said the party’s focus would be on delivering affordable housing, decent healthcare and allowing families to have a better worklife balance.Mr Howlin said a priority for Labour would be to “end the waste of public money” while the party was also clear that it would not be promising “massive tax giveaways”. Green Party leader, Eamon Ryan said the biggest issue remained climate change and the bioersity crisis which would require leadership, ambition and people working collectively.“Our world is on fire,” he remarked.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4164636.1581027325!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord colour coding is key as canvassing nears conclusion","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Labour Party’s Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, Ivana Bacik and Ged Nash: Mr Nash has just completed his second course of antibiotics having been laid low by the flu.

TDs from the Labour Party, the Social Democrats and SolidarityPeople Before Profit delivered their messages from outside the gates of Leinster House, all hoping to walk back through them again after the election with renewed vigour and enhanced mandates. Up the road from the hopeful also-rans, the Greens held their final press conference in the headquarters of the Irish Georgian Society on South William Street. There was some confusion when the notice went out, as this was also the location of Fine Gael’s national campaign headquarters. Where were the Greens going to be? In the basement? Above in the attic, indulging in strange pre-election coalition with the least attractive of two prospective government suitors? Did they not read the opinion polls?But no. Eamon Ryan and his colleagues were gathered in the same elegant room which served as Fine Gael’s conference centre throughout the campaign. It seems the party cleared out of the building the night before, leaving nothing behind. Not as much as a leaflet. Not a trace of A Future to Look Forward to. Kitchen sinkOf course, Fine Gael would have booked the venue with specific dates in mind. The campaign on its penultimate day went outside Dublin with the Taoiseach and sundry Ministers throwing the kitchen sink at Co Carlow in a last-ditch effort to save the seat of local deputy Pat Deering. The Georgian townhouse was surplus to requirements. But with all the FG paraphernalia suddenly gone, it looked like the party had done a moonlit flit in the face of falling support. Most unfortunate.The Greens though, as ever, were optimistic. “I don’t think this campaign could have gone any better” said Ryan. “I think we’re going to surprise people and I think we’re going to win in constituencies where no one expects us to win.” Confound the commentariat“We’re putting climate action at the heart of every single policy” said outgoing TD for Dublin Rathdown, Catherine Martin. “We have given it our all,” said Ryan, who would dearly love to return to the Dáil with a team of 15 deputies.Because of their strong showing in the local and European elections, the Greens were early front-runners in the race to hold the balance of power. But domestic concerns elbowed out the global. Climate change has not really figured as an election issue, but Ryan believes this will be “the climate change election” and they will confound the commentariat and have a breakthrough moment. “We will no longer be a small party.” The Octagonal Room looked very bare and very green in the absence of all the FG promotional banners and backdrops and literature. The high walls were painted in a shade of heritage green, the posters around the top table were bright green and everyone had lurid green keep-cups in front of them bearing the message “Think Green. Drink Green”. So if the party has a good election and Ryan lands his fantastic 15, presumably they’ll be getting mouldy in headquarters on the crème de menthe.The upshot of this overuse of one particular colour had a curious effect on the pallor of the three TDs (Ryan, Martin and recent Fingal byelection winner, Joe O’Brien) and two candidates (Peter Kavanagh, Dublin Mid-West and Sean McCabe, Meath East) facing the media. The reflection caused by the TV lights didn’t help, but they all looked distinctly green around the gills. The party leader did an interview with Radio Kerry before the final press conference. He has high hopes for their candidate in the Kingdom, Cleo Murphy, as he does for all of their “Wild Atlantic Women” running in the West of Ireland. “I’ll probably be shot for saying that.”He says it’s looking likely that the last seat will be a fight between Murphy and Danny Healy-Rae. “Our first ever Green Party councillor was elected in Kerry. People forget that. Cleo versus Danny? She has a great chance there.”If the numbers are good, how does Ryan, a former minister for communications, fancy the prospect of becoming tánaiste? “The greatest cure for ambition is having been in the middle of it before. It kind of washes it out of you.” Get out and voteBack outside Leinster House, two of Labour’s brightest prospects for seats were urging people to get out and vote tomorrow. Outgoing Senators Ged Nash (Drogheda) and Aodhán Ó Ríordáin (Dublin Bay North) were being very cautious about predicting outcomes. Ó Ríordáin said he got a haircut because voters kept mistaking him for Eamon Ryan. With outgoing TDs Finian McGrath and Tommy Broughan calling it a day and announcing their retirements, he knows he will never get a better chance of making a winning return to the Dáil. Having worked his socks off in the constituency, he says if he doesn’t succeed this time, “I may as well throw my hat at it.” Nash, meanwhile, has just completed his second course of antibiotics having been laid low by the flu. He was holding one of those diamond-shaped election posters which are popular with candidates. “Diamonds are forever. Or until the next election – April,” he half-joked. Inside Leinster House, nobody is betting on the next administration lasting any decent length of time. Before the Labour people rolled up at the gates, SolidarityPeople Before Profit TDs made their final pitch. Richard Boyd-Barrett, Gino Kenny, Paul Murphy and Bríd Smith (plus her gorgeous border collie) urged voters to “break the FFFG cycle”.RBB declared “a political earthquake is under way” and the two biggest parties are on the fault line. There is a real opportunity for voters to choose a left government for the first time. “Keep left, ” he urged, for a different sort of cycle.In the afternoon, Catherine Murphy and Róisín Shortall of the Social Democrats turned up at the gates for a final twirl on Kildare Street with Dublin Central prospect Gary Gannon. Their closing press conference is in Bray this morning. The co-leaders will be delighted to see the end of this campaign, if only so they can start wearing coats and accessories which aren’t in the Soc Dem signature colour purple. And now just one day to go.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4164482.1581019125!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"trompe l oeil of tate art finds reflection in post brexit deal delusion","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Boris Johnson delivers his Unleashing Britain’s Potential speech  at the Old Royal Naval College. He alluded to the James Thornhill  ceiling artwork. Photograph: Jason Alden In his speech in Greenwich on Monday outlining Britain’s approach to the next stage of negotiations with the European Union, Boris Johnson made much of the symbolism of the venue, the Painted Hall in the Old Royal Naval College. He encouraged his audience of officials, foreign diplomats and reporters to look upwards at the ceiling James Thornhill spent 20 years painting.Johnson noted that the painting was completed in 1707, the year of the union with Scotland, and that it exuded national self-confidence.“Look at these well-fed nymphs and cupids and what have you.\u0026nbspThey are not just celebrating the triumph of liberty and peace and tyranny – the official title of the scene.“This is the settlement of a long and isive political question about who gets to sit on the throne of England.\u0026nbspAnd it is visibly resolved, as you can see,\u0026nbspin favour of William and Mary\u0026nbspand the result is stability\u0026nbspand certainty\u0026nbspand optimism and an explosion of global trade propelled by new maritime technology,” he said.“So this is it. This is the newly forged United Kingdom on the slipway: this is the moment when it all took off.”Thornhill’s painting is a spectacular example of the Baroque art of the late Stuart era that served to display the power of the British monarchy after its restoration with Charles II. It is the subject of British Baroque: Power and Illusion, an exhibition that opened this week at Tate Britain (until April 19th).Topical feelThe opening gallery is dominated by Antonio Verrio’s The Sea Triumph of Charles II, which depicts the king as Neptune, ruling the waves from a chariot surrounded by cherubs with the English fleet in the distance. Charles’s queen features among the portraits but so too do his many mistresses, some posing with the children they bore him and one,\u0026nbspLouise de Kérouaille,\u0026nbspstyled as a saucy shepherdess in the countryside.Writing in the Evening Standard, Tate Britain’s director Alex Farquharson said that when he started planning the exhibition some years ago, he had no idea how topical it would feel.“Broader questions about the monarchy and parliament feel freshly relevant, just as they did when Charles II was restored to the throne\u0026nbspor when William and Mary replaced James II,” he wrote.“As well as the Restoration, the era also witnessed the union with Scotland and wars that defined Britain’s role on the European stage. It was an age of mercantile expansion and confidence which led to Britain’s global domination and its sense of being exceptional – a feeling that shaped the following centuries and explains many attitudes today.”One of Johnson’s heroes is Pericles, the general who led Athens during its golden age and launched an extensive building programme that included the Parthenon. He believes in the value of grand projects like those of Pericles as symbols of common identity and he is eager to demonstrate in a visible way the change that Britain’s exit from the European Union will bring.Uninspiring world The problem is that most of the changes have been deferred until the end of 2020, when the transition period ends. Even then, the most important changes are bound up with the uninspiring world of trade negotiations, tariffs, quotas and non-tariff barriers.One of the galleries in the Tate Britain exhibition is devoted to\u0026nbsptrompe l’oeil\u0026nbspoptical illusions, including paintings of flowers that look like real flowers and paintings of furniture that seem like real furniture. The most spectacular is a door from Chatsworth House painted with a hanging violin that looks so real that you want to lift it up.I remembered that violin on Thursday when international trade secretary Liz Truss published details of what Britain will be looking for in a trade deal with the United States, which it hopes to negotiate in parallel with the EU talks. It wants the deal to be “far-reaching and comprehensive” but only up to a point.“The government has been clear that when we are negotiating trade deals, the NHS will not be on the table. The price the NHS pays for drugs will not be on the table,”she said. “The services the NHS provides will not be on the table. We will not agree measures which undermine the government’s ability to deliver on our manifesto commitments to the NHS. As we committed to in our manifesto in all of our trade negotiations, we will not compromise on our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4164656.1581026825!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"democrats top official calls for recanvass of iowa caucuses","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBernie Sanders: “We are now at a point with some 97 per cent of the precincts reporting where our campaign is winning the popular initial vote by some 6,000 votes.” Photograph: Justin SullivanGetty ImagesThe outcome of the Iowa caucuses was plunged into further uncertainty on Thursday after the Democratic Party’s top official called for a “recanvass” of the results. “Enough is enough,” tweeted Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. “In light of the problems that have emerged in the implementation of the delegate selection plan and in order to assure public confidence in the results, I am calling on the Iowa Democratic Party to immediately begin a recanvass.”It was not immediately clear what the impact of his comments would be. According to Democratic Party rules, a recanvass involves auditing the paper records, rather than a full recount of the ballots. The head of the Iowa Democratic Party said that any request for a recanvass must be made by a presidential campaign.More than 1,700 precincts – including a small number of so-called “satellite” caucus sites – took part in Monday’s Iowa caucus to select the preferred Democratic nominee for president. But technical difficulties with an app used to transmit the results from the caucus sites to the state party’s headquarters in the capital, Des Moines, as well as delays with a back-up phone line, have led to massive delays in reporting. A New York Times report published on Thursday found inconsistencies in the reporting of the results, placing further pressure on the state authorities.With 97 per cent of votes announced as of Thursday evening, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders had significantly closed the gap with Pete Buttigieg whom he had been trailing in the race.Fractionally aheadThe latest available results put Mr Buttigieg, the 38 year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana fractionally ahead with 26.2 per cent of the vote compared to Mr Sanders at 26.1 per cent. Elizabeth Warren was at 18.2 per cent, with former vice president Joe Biden well behind with 15.8 per cent of the vote.Speaking from the campaign trail in New Hampshire, Mr Sanders claimed victory.“What I want to do today, three days late, is to thank the people of Iowa for the very strong victory they gave us at the Iowa caucuses on Monday night,” he said. “Even though the vote tabulations have been extremely slow, we are now at a point with some 97 per cent of the precincts reporting where our campaign is winning the popular initial vote by some 6,000 votes.”Though Mr Sanders has been ahead in first preference votes, Mr Buttigieg is still technically ahead in terms of the “state delegate equivalents” – a calculation used to determine the number of delegates Iowa will send to the Democratic National Convention in July. This is the first time the Iowa Democratic Party has pledged to announce the outcome of the first preference votes as well as the state delegate equivalents – an extra layer of reporting that may have compounded this week’s delays.Meanwhile, a new poll put Mr Sanders ahead in New Hampshire ahead of Tuesday’s primary contest, with Mr Buttigieg in second place. The Monmouth poll had Mr Sanders at 24 per cent, followed by Mr Buttigieg at 20 per cent.Mr Biden – who is under pressure to perform well in New Hampshire following his disappointing result in Iowa - was in third place with 17 per cent."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Friend carried out \u0026#39perfect murder\u0026#39 after row over £200, jury toldBank customers pay £100m to access cash from ATMsTory MP escapes suspension for speaking at far-Right event Poverty has increased for pensioners and hit a record 14 million people, says charityJonty Bravery told carer of assault plan months before Tate Modern attackAl-Qaeda leader in Yemen killed by US forces, Donald Trump confirmsRail passengers should be emailed alerts when they are entitled to compensation, watchdog says First time buyers to get 30 per cent discount on new-build homes The public are giving up on police solving crimes, warn official inspectorsBurglar who killed and raped 81-year-old was on a suspended sentence, it emerges as he is handed life sentenceBarrymore: the Body in the Pool, review - a clear case for this story to remain in the spotlightBernie Sanders claims \u0026#39strong victory\u0026#39 in Iowa amid results confusionFinland increases paternity leave to 7 months to match maternity quotaCouncils do not have to fly Union flag to mark Prince Andrew\u0026#39s birthday Government saysAround 50 terrorists could be released early if government fails to enact new legislation, says Justice Secretary Romanians and Poles make up a third of EU nationals seeking to settle in the UK, figures showCabinet backlash over Philip Hammond peerage as minister says he \u0026#39tried to bring down the government\u0026#39Comment: Between Brexit and another scandal, Sturgeon’s run out of roadJohn Bercow has \u0026#39no chance\u0026#39 of peerage as he is rebuked by Commons and accused of using  \u0026#39sexually and racially inappropriate\u0026#39 languageRecord 90 migrants intercepted in English ChannelWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit heroleo varadkar staring barrel defeat irish election","story":"When he became Irish Taoiseach in 2017 Leo Varadkar had a sprinkle of stardust. The gay, half Indian medical doctor was the changing face of modern Ireland.A year after taking office he oversaw the abolition of strict abortion laws and on the international stage he bravely stood up to the British over Brexit. All the while, the economy boomed.But as Ireland heads towards an election this Saturday the 41-year-old progressive -  often mentioned in the same breath as Justin Trudeau in Canada, Emmanuel Macron in France and Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand - is facing defeat.While success on the international stage has won him plaudits, critics at home claim that Mr Varadkar has become arrogant, aloof and not interested in key domestic issues, like healthcare and housing.In Dublin’ cranes swing overhead and the streets are clogged by the movement of hundreds of construction workers employed at what is supposed to be Ireland\u0027s state-of-the-art National Children’s Hospital.Part of a key pledge by Mr Varadkar\u0027s Fine Gael party to fix Ireland\u0027s broken healthcare system, the facility was supposed to open this year for a cost of €650 million.Three years behind schedule and with costs spiralling into the billions, the hospital is one of the reasons that the sheen has come off Mr Varadkar’s premiership.The debacle at the National Children’s Hospital is symptomatic of chaos across the healthcare sector.Hospital waiting lists have reached record levels. There is also a chronic shortage of housing. Young people are unable to get on the housing ladder and quite often cannot afford spiralling rents in Dublin and other cities.Homelessness has also become a major campaign issue. Last year, a photo of a young boy eating his evening meal on a pedestrianised shopping street in the centre of Dublin captured the human cost of the unfolding crisis.In the working class area around the proposed children’s hospital, there is anger at the escalating cost of the project.Maureen O’Mahony, 74, says her main concerns are “jobs for my grandchildren and somewhere they can live”. She used to vote for the Labour Party, but on Saturday she is thinking of going with Sinn Fein or the hard Left.Maureen\u0027s wider constituency is rapidly gentrifying. Cian O’Riordan, 28, a computer science graduate who works in an IT start-up in the area should be the young millennial that fits the mould as a Varadkar voter.Angry about being squeezed out of the housing market by rapidly rising prices, he says he hasn’t made up his mind yet what way he will vote - except that it definitely won’t be for Fine Gael.It has become a rubric of all elections that they are won or lost based on the state of the economy. This is clearly not the case in Ireland.When Fine Gael came to power in 2011 Ireland was in an EU-IMF bailout programme following a spectacular property market crash unemployment was more than 15 per cent, and the national debt had ballooned from 25 per cent of GDP in 2007 to 123 per cent in the space of four years. Also, in 2011, the budget deficit hit 32 per cent of GDP following the rescue of the banking system.Ireland has been the fastest growing economy in the EU for the past six years. Unemployment is at a thirteen year low of 4.8 per cent, national debt is 63.6 per cent of GDP and there was a budget surplus of just under 1 per cent for last year.Mr Varadkar’s handling of Brexit negotiations helped push his popularity to record levels. His implacable resistance to any border on the island of Ireland risked becoming the gordian knot of talks to secure a Withdrawal Agreement. In the end he prevailed.But the Withdrawal Bill was agreed last October. If a week is a long time in politics, then three months is an eternity.Fine Gael traditionally draws its support from urban middle class voters and farmers. But its appeal to these voters has ebbed in recent months. The failure to roll out broadband has provoked a backlash from rural Ireland. The government has also clashed with farmers over beef prices. And even the middle classes are not immune to problems in the housing and health sectors.“On paper the Fine Gael-led Government has done well on key economic indicators,” Eoin O’Malley, professor of politics at Dublin City University, says. “But people have greater expectations of government now, and the housing policy has failed - or it has not succeeded quickly enough. The rent crisis is real and felt by a whole generation.” Mr O’Malley says the other problem for Fine Gael is that it’s been in government for nine years.In a poll released on Monday, Fine Gael was in third place on a rating of 20 per cent, behind Fianna Fail on 23 per cent and Sinn Fein on 25 per cent. If these support levels pan out on election day, then Fine Gael faces a meltdown at the polls.Fine Gael and Fianna Fail have given Sinn Fein a boost, in part by cosying up to other parties such as the Greens as potential coalition partners, Mr O’Malley says. “They’ve taken the edginess off the Greens, and so a vote for other ‘protest’ parties doesn’t look like change, only Sinn Fein does. So I’m not sure we can say Sinn Fein has run a terribly good election, it just became the party to vote for if you are sick of the other lot.”Unless Fine Gael has a Lazarus type recovery in the final days of the campaign before voters go to the polls on Saturday, then Leo Varadkar will be heading to the opposition benches. That is unless Fianna Fail and Fine Gael set aside their historical enmities and form a grand coalition for the first time in the history of the state.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bernie sanders claims strong victory iowa amid results confusion","story":"Bernie Sanders claimed a belated victory in Monday\u0027s state caucus amid calls for a recount as the row over the vote continued to ide the Democratic party.Mr Sanders, the progressive frontrunner, called the delay of results a screw up by his own party as he addressed supporters in New Hampshire ahead of the next primary.Monday\u0027s Iowa caucuses, the first votes cast in the race to find the Democratic presidential nominee, were marred by technical problems and inconsistencies which saw the official result delayed by more than two days.By Thursday afternoon, 97 per cent of the results had finally been released, showing Mr Sanders and moderate candidate Pete Buttigieg virtually neck and neck.However, Mr Sanders insisted he had the clearest margin of victory in the popular vote, which he said put him 6,000 votes ahead of his rivals.Campaigning in Manchester, New Hampshire, the 78-year-old criticised the inability of the Iowa Democratic Party to count votes in a timely fashion.That screw up has been extremely unfair to the people of Iowa, to all the candidates and all of their supporters, he said.What I want to do today, three days late, is to thank the people of Iowa for the very strong victory they gave us at the Iowa caucuses on Monday night.Mr Sanders also took a swipe at Mr Buttigieg, who similarly claimed victory earlier in the week, saying: From where I come, when you get 6,000 more votes you\u0027re strongly regarded to be the winner.Just minutes before Mr Sanders took to the stage, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee called for a review of the results to assure public confidence.Enough is enough, party leader Tom Perez wrote on Twitter. In light of the problems that have emerged... I am calling on the Iowa Democratic Party to immediately begin a recanvass.Mr Sanders criticised the enormously complicated results process, but suggested any recount would not change his lead in any meaningful way.Focus has now shifted to New Hampshire, which holds its Democratic primary on Tuesday. The latest polling shows Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden and Amy Klobuchar trailing behind Mr Sanders and Mr Buttigieg.Once considered the frontrunner in the early voting states, Mr Biden is now scrambling to regain his campaign\u0027s momentum.

This is a bit of what I’ve learned, imperfectly, thus far.\u0026nbspIt is not, for these purposes, a “hybrid”, like the Toyota\u0026nbspPrius\u0026nbspor any other vehicle that also has an internal combustion engine on board (with one of two very particular exceptions).\u0026nbspAn electric car is a pure thing – it runs completely and solely on its batteries. When they run out, you stop moving.\u0026nbspI like to think of it as a cross between a washing machine, a laptop and,\u0026nbsperm, a car. So, your car is driven entirely by electric power – powerful lithium-ion batteries (like in your laptop) sending electricity to an electric motor (like your washing machine) which drives the road wheels (like on your motor car).\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch. Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.210 Prince of Wales Drive, Battersea, London210 Prince of Wales Drive, Battersea, LondonThe electricity stored in the batteries mostly comes from being plugged into the mains (there are various charging options, most commonly a fast charger attached to the side of your home, if you have the space). Some will be regenerated from the car itself, saving power otherwise wasted when braking, for example.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp2 Don’t some electric cars run on hydrogen?Yes, but they are not much more than prototypes, with only a handful of filling stations currently. Critics say using a hydrogen fuel cell to generate the electricity for the batteries simply adds an additional stage of energy accumulation and the manufacture of the hydrogen could be problematic, if it requires a disproportionate amount of non-renewable electricity.\u0026nbsp3 How far will one go on a charge?Well, that depends, but you can count on a modern mainstream electric car these days to bae able to take you 200 to 250 miles (conservatively) on a single charge – a\u0026nbspKia\u0026nbspe-Niro, say, or Hyundai\u0026nbspKona\u0026nbspelectric. In the right hands, 300 miles might be possible. This, by the way is two or three times the usual range you’d experience a few years ago.\u0026nbspFeeling the spark: Drivers learning to love electric carsThe most advanced models, such as the famous Tesla range, will go on and on for near enough 400 miles. Some of the smaller more urban-oriented models, such as the new electric Smart cars will be good for about 100 miles.\u0026nbspThe rest is down to how you drive and when. Winter means the batteries tend to run down faster and you’ll likely get a shorter range.\u0026nbspIf you drive hard and fast you’ll use up more energy than otherwise, just like in a petrol or diesel car. Over along time the ability of the batteries to take and store a charge will deteriorate (just like your smartphone or laptop).Yes. To buy or lease you’re looking at a premium of some thousands of pounds. So, let’s take an example, the Hyundai\u0026nbspKona, a compact\u0026nbspSUV.\u0026nbsp With a conventional petrol engine you can pick one up at a list price of £17,505. For the hybrid version (petrol plus electric power generated on-board) you’ll need to fork out £22,495. For the\u0026nbspBEV\u0026nbspHyundai\u0026nbspKona\u0026nbspelectric, the price jumps to £35,100, or £32,600 when you take into account the government grant for electric cars of up to £3,500. \u0026nbspAgainst the usually higher purchase price or monthly PCP or lease fee you need to balance the savings you make compared t petrol or diesel: far cheaper fuel spending on your electricity tariff) lower running costs (fewer moving mechanical parts and consumables eg exhaust pipe, alternator, engine) and a range of lower taxes and congest and parking charges. Electric cars are exempt from road tax, carry lower benefit-in-kind tax liabilities for commercial users, usually form congestion charges and city bans, and can enjoy cheaper parking. There’s also a government subsidy of up to £500 for a home charger.\u0026nbspWhy have electric cars failed to spark with consumers? Has Tesla hastened the death of Britain’s electric car revolution?Grant Shapps’ plan for electric cars will make China a motoring giantWhether this makes financial sense really depends your pattern of car usage – the number of miles you do a year, and the type of journeys. With a lot of medium range commuting for example (say 60 miles a day) an electric car could pay for itself within a few years for sustained long-distance travelling then a diesel might make more sense.5 What are the advantages of an electric car?Apart from the financial ones it is of course far better for the environment. There are many debates about, say, the cost (in environmental terms) of mining rare minerals for the batteries, or transporting them vast distances to factories, or the energy used in making them. Also obviously an electric car that runs on electricity generated from soar power is better than one where the electricity happens to be generated by burning coal (ins or far as anyone can know this when they plug in).\u0026nbspHowever a reasonable assumption is that all electric cars are greener than any internal combustion engined equivalent, and that any public transport (rail or bus) is usually greener than any private alternative.Don’t forget that electric cars are very refined – being almost silent at any speed, and the acceleration form rest is startlingly fast, though they tend to run out of puff as they approach their top speeds. In other words they can be good to drive and to be driven in.6 What are the disadvantages?Surprisingly few, though it does depend on your circumstances. If you live in a flat or a terraced house, charging from home is obviously impossible or difficult, and the ease of use of an electric vehicle is much reduced. If you imagine that you’ll have to do journeys of more than 400 miles without warning, then an internal combustion engine is a surer way of getting wherever it is you might conceivably wish to go – though you’d need to take a break anyway.\u0026nbspIt’s fair to add that some of the public charging infrastructure leaves a bit to be desired – it could usefully be much bigger, more reliable and easier to use.And of course you do need to balance the financial sums against the clear practical and environmental plusses of being a green driver.\u0026nbsp7 Don’t they take ages to charge?Yes and no. The Tesla is an exception, in many ways, because it has a dedicated network of ultra-fast chargers, as well as being chargeable at home.\u0026nbspMost owners of electric cars have to rely on charging at home – but don’t\u0026nbsp have much trouble charging because they most likely have a home charging point, which does mean off-street parking for the moment. If you take a mainstream option like the Hyundai\u0026nbspKona\u0026nbspelectricity home, using a regular\u0026nbsp7kW\u0026nbspcharging point via its own cable a near-full zero to 80 per cent charge takes around 9 hours.A similar charge with a rapid charger (such as you’d fine at, say, motorway services)\u0026nbsptakes around an hour and a quarter. 75 minutes.\u0026nbspIn an emergency, you can also use a domestic three-pin charging lead, plugged into the mains at home like you’d plug in a kettle. However you’d looking at about 24 hours for a full charge – because the batteries are so big and the trickle form the domestic system so modest.\u0026nbsp8 Will they get easier to charge and go further in future?Yes. Much of the progress in the usefulness of the electric car is coming from improvements in battery “density” – the amount of useful power that can be stored in a an ever-more compact way.The battery pack is usually stored lower in the car, under the floor or the seats, and this can help with keeping the car stable (lower centre of gravity). Given that these units can grow very hot and need ventilation or water cooling for example, and have to be protected from water ingress (if fording a stream say, or just in a heavy downpour) , the progress in engineering in this field is truly impressive.\u0026nbspHowever, eventually the rate of improvement in range and efficiency will slow, and that might well mark an optimal moment to make a purchase or take on an electric car lease. But we cannot know when this will happen.9 What about hybrids?Well, what about hybrids? They are not electric cars. This is because they are, as the name implies, hybrids – a cross between an electric car and a traditional one powered by a petrol or diesel engine. Thus well-known hybrid models such as the Toyota\u0026nbspPrius\u0026nbsphave an internal combustion engine on board, as well as an electric motor and some batteries to boost performance and economy.\u0026nbspIn a hybrid the electric power is “self-generated”, which is to say that it comes from the engine regenerating and recycling power that might otherwise be wasted. So for example some of the power usually lost in heavy braking is instead sent back via the electric motor working “backwards” to the batteries, where it is stored for later use.\u0026nbspI drove 300 miles in an electric car and here’s what happenedMost hybrids pair an electric and a petrol engine because the two units tend to complement each other in use diesel-electric hybrids are rarer. “Mild” hybrids are just that – they have only a small ethic motor and minimal battery storage just to give a slight edge to reduce emissions and improve economy. The green advantage is quite marginal.\u0026nbspPlug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) have the additional option of charging from the mains, as with an electric car, but it is not necessary to do so.\u0026nbspThe drawback with the hybrid technology is the constant trade-offs that have to made between the energy saved through the battery-electric motor system, set against the additional weight of them, which of course tends to raise fuel consumption. Clever software can minimise these trade-offs to more acceptable levels, but they will always be there, as compared to a\u0026nbspBEV. Hybrids, indeed, in their complexity and weight, can represent the e worst of both worlds.\u0026nbsp10 Aren’t electric cars all a bit oddball?They have been, yes, but the next few months year will see the launch of some very well-known models with full-electric versions.\u0026nbsp These will include: the Vauxhall\u0026nbspCorsa-e Peugeot 208 electric Volvo\u0026nbspXC40\u0026nbspRecharge and the Mini electric. They join an already quiet impressive variety of electric cars on sale or soon to go on sale.From the tiny\u0026nbspSkoda\u0026nbspCiti GOe-iV\u0026nbspand Smart EQ through the Renault Zoe to the Nissan leaf to MG ZS and the Jaguar\u0026nbspiPace\u0026nbspthere are already options to match your tastes and budget. And there is also a small market in used models such as the Renault\u0026nbspFluence, Mitsubishi\u0026nbspIMEV, Vauxhall\u0026nbspAmpera\u0026nbspor first generation Nissan Leaf that might also suit.These cars will tend to have shorter ranges, though, while older Renaults may still have their batteries on monthly lease from the company. As always – do your own research, but you can approach an electric car with more positivity than ever before.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That’s almost one a week. Let that sink in for a moment.It wasn’t done intentionally – but, perhaps even worse, completely obliviously. Every other weekend, off I trotted, to Moscow, Doha, Rome and the rest, usually for no more than a weekend at a time. I could say that I excused my high flying lifestyle – pun very much intended – by arguing that it was all for work. With the best will in the world, being a travel journalist was always going to involve a certain amount of travel.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut, sadly, that would be giving me way too much credit. The truth is, I didn’t excuse it at all. It never even crossed my mind that I needed to.\u0026nbspUntil, of course, a previously unimaginable and unprecedented shift in the public perception of flying started to emerge. The first time I really realised that a sea change was coming was Emma Thompson’s much-publicised fall from grace, when she flew 5,400 miles from LA to London in the spring to participate in the Extinction Rebellion demonstrations that were bringing the capital to a standstill. The actor and activist was pilloried by the Right and Left in equal measure (the former labelling her a hypocrite, the latter asserting they didn’t need her carbon-tainted help, thank you very much).Created with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

What was the big deal? She was using her platform to add clout to a much-needed protest demanding action on the coming climate crisis. Surely that was a good thing?It wasn’t long afterwards that I heard of the flygskam (flight shame) and tågskryt (train brag) movements for the first time. Originating in Sweden and publicised by high-profile figures including Olympic athlete Bjorn Ferry and opera singer Malena Ernman, mother of teenage activist Greta Thunberg, the idea was to make the notion of flying something a little unsavoury – something you might not want to admit to doing in polite company. On the flip side, the “train brag” movement is all about celebrating rail travel, with participants posting pictures and videos of their beauty-filled overland journeys on social media.Meet the people who’ve given up flyingThe concept has even made its way over the North Sea, as I discovered when I came across the Flight Free UK movement. Founder Anna Hughes’ original aim was to get 100,000 people to sign up and pledge to stay grounded for a whole year.\u0026nbsp“I haven’t flown for about 10 years,” she said, “but given the situation we’re now in, I felt like it wasn’t enough to reduce my own carbon footprint – I needed to open it up and do more. And it took over my life!”I didn’t really expect to be joining the swelling ranks of do-gooders, to be perfectly honest. As journalists, we can easily become accomplished fantasists, convincing ourselves that we are somehow set apart from reality – here to observe and report, rather than participate.But something changed in me after I spoke to Anna, along with a number of other committed non-flyers. They were, to a fault, impassioned and persuasive yet polite and non-judgemental. They were happy to take on huge personal expense and inconvenience, all in the hopes that it might help save the only habitable planet we’ve got. A seed was planted in my brain which grew – slowly but unstoppably – day by day, and has already led to me significantly cutting down on the number\u0026nbspof flights I took in the latter half of 2019.Now, it’s time to take the next step: a year of keeping both feet on the ground. Far from being some po-faced exercise in restraint, more than anything I hope this experience will prove that travel, in all its adventurous, erse and mind-opening glory, is not only possible with clipped wings, but can even be enhanced by taking it slow.I produced somewhere in the region of 6,000kg of CO2 from flying in 2019. Here’s to it being 0kg in 2020.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The average ratings for the feeling that things done in life are “worthwhile” decreased by 0.5 per cent.The ONS said this was the first time it had recorded a fall in both life satisfaction and feeling that things done in life were worthwhile since it started measuring them in 2011.

The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career. Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars. (HB)Twelve years after Arctic Monkeys released a debut album that shook the British rock scene out of its doldrums, the Sheffield boy wonders came up with this: a concept album about a luxury lunar resort that surgically removed the blues influences on AM and replaced them with lounge jazz and absurdist lyrics. It upset fans who wanted more of the same, and yet, frontman Alex Turner’s musical and lyrical meanderings mark one of the boldest moves by any rock band in recent memory. (RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard. Her pretty, literate vocals spin playful mysteries of faceless lovers in raincoats and strange women on remote shores. “It’s lucidity!” Holter teased. “So clear!” A ludic, lucid dream of a record. (HB)Sky Ferreira did it her way. After years of label disputes about image and musical direction, the Californian finally decided to put her own modelling money towards financing her debut record, 2013’s Night Time, My Time. And what a record it is: melding Eighties pop with alternative rock, it brims with a wild vivacity, as squelching synths come up against gnashing guitars, vulnerable lyrics and often distorted vocals. “Everything is Embarrassing”, produced by Dev Hynes, is one of the songs of the decade. (PS)Combining rumbustious soul-rock with swampy blues grit, this four-piece from Athens, Alabama, were one of the most exciting sounds of 2012 thanks to their humdinger of a debut album. Gutsy and unrefined, Boys \u0026amp Girls is indebted to a bygone era but somehow feels fresh. It’s underpinned by powerhouse frontwoman Brittany Howard’s astonishing voice – capable of both a piercing falsetto or a guttural roar. Barack Obama would subsequently invite the band to play at the White House. (PS)When the documentarians of the future make films about the UK in the 2010s, you can bet they’ll put Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr on the soundtrack. The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain. (HB)After a run of spellbinding singles, the Norse disco maverick released this synthesis of the frivolous and cinematic: an album so casually virtuosic it seemed to have dropped out of an alien supercomputer. From crate digger space-funk to dance floor ecstasy (and a Bryan Ferry feature), It’s Album Time is endlessly replayable: a perfectly formed confection that requires no sequel. (JM)There’s a kind of telepathy that develops when a band spends as much time together as Big Thief. The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)1150 40) Christine and the Queens – Chaleur Humaine (2014)On her electropop-laden debut – the UK release of which meanders between French and English – Heloise Letissier explores the lonelinesses and triumphs of being queer. On “Saint Claude”, she steals glimpses of a feminine boy being mocked on a Paris bus, too ashamed to step in. On “Tilted”, she is newly defiant. “I am actually good, can’t help it if we’re tilted.” (AP)Inspired by the “icy altitudes” of Joni Mitchell’s open-tuned confessionals, the dubstep producer took singer-songwriting into a compelling new landscape of minimalist clicks and autotuned emotion. He sang of “testing sounds For the deaf and the forest cold” and now describes his sparse, graceful debut as “a fractured diary” reflecting “a lack of something”. (HB)In 2016, the UK was in chaos. The EU referendum produced a shock result, David Cameron resigned as prime minister, and the arguing began, as a new harder-right politics emerged. The future felt bleak. In the midst of all this, Skepta – always wary of institutions – poured gasoline over the whole mess and lit a match. Konnichiwa is an album heavy with contempt for authority a sizzling brew of jungle, UK garage and dancehall into which he pours all of his anger, frustration, fear and suspicion. (RO)Where 2008’s For Emma, Forever Ago was an exercise in sparse, solipsistic introspection, Justin Vernon’s follow-up is the sound of a man setting himself free and fully embracing the depths of his imagination. Less hermetically sealed than his debut, it\u0027s exquisite in every way, with Vernon’s soulful falsetto woven into a gorgeous patchwork of jazz, folk, ambient and electronica. He would add more autotune to his voice on later albums here it’s just perfect. (PS)There’s a glorious elasticity of both sound and spirit to the Norwegian singer-songwriter’s seventh album. Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell. (JM)On his 69th birthday, two days before his death, David Bowie released perhaps the most extreme album of his career. Blackstar is more alien than Ziggy as inscrutable as the deepest corners of the universe. He refuses to go quietly, whether making a joyous racket on “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” or adding eerie buzzes and whines to album closer “I Can’t Give Everything Away” where, faced with the nearness of his own death, Bowie engages in a final tussle with his own myth. (RO)Earlier this year, Adele announced that she had split from her husband Simon Konecki. While some sympathised, others rejoiced at the brilliant break-up album that was surely on the cards. “Bunch of f***ing savages,” she joked in response to those gleeful fans. “30 will be a drum ’n’ bass record to spite you.” Cruel though it was, there was a reason for the gleeful reaction – Adele sings of heartbreak like nobody else. And never better than on 21, a sad, soulful masterpiece which on these shores is the best-selling album of the century. (AP)The French electronic pioneers brought funk back for the summer of 2013 with an album drawing heavily on the sounds of the Seventies and Eighties. Pretty much everything you need to know is in the opening salvo “Give Life Back to Music” Daft Punk tend to pop up at times where other artists are grasping frantically for something new. Random Access Memories restarted the party with good old-fashioned craftmanship and Le Daft’s undiluted love for what they do. (RO)It is striking that Lana Del Rey – the greatest artist of her generation – creates art full of meaningful observations about men and women that are deeply unfashionable outside of an Esther Perel podcast. Del Rey desires to be desired she likes it when her man makes her feel like a child she wants to die. The longing for unconsciousness is still present in NFR (I’m the void, she sings on Mariners Apartment Complex) but her most playful record to date is as close to a celebration of her world-conquering status as you are ever likely to hear. (PS)Tiptoeing to the bleeding heart of Steven’s relationship with his schizophrenic, alcoholic mother, this is an album that faces difficult truths with hushed grace. The featherlight folk acquires a remarkable bioluminescence, as the artist finds hope in “signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark”. (HB)ANTI’s botched rollout – Rihanna was teasing the record for years before a leak prompted a hasty free release – seems strangely fitting for an album as joyfully scattershot and unrefined as this. Dark dancehall sounds flirt with hip hop and R\u0026ampB, as the Bajan singer embraces her roots and slyly rebels against the pop tropes du jour. (AP)Having released arguably the Noughties’ defining rock album in Funeral, the Montreal six-piece began this decade with a record bathed in nostalgia. Loosely inspired by frontman Win Butler and his brother Will’s childhood on the outskirts of Houston, The Suburbs has much in common with Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, with its themes of familial responsibility and personal crises. The sound is expansive there are lyrical and musical motifs throughout. If 2007’s Neon Bible was a little portentous and po-faced, this album offers moments of levity in tracks such as the shimmering synth-pop masterpiece Sprawl II. Nothing they’ve done since has been as good.St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, has a tagline for each of her albums. This one, her third, was “housewives on pills”, though that does little justice to a record that marries uncomfortable intimacy with a cool detachment, its obtuse stories of grief, loss and lust told through angular art-rock, frenzied guitar solos and bold melodies. (AP)When his 15-year-old son died in 2015, Cave thought public grieving would be “impossible”. But he found unexpected relief in sharing his feelings with his fans. This ambient double album plays like a warm cloud of solace: direct about the agony and inevitability of loss, in awe of the love that helps us survive it.  (HB)Red is the last album Swift released before it became impossible to discuss her work without mentioning the narrative around her as a person, not just an artist. Her turn of phrase – already impressive for an artist so young – improves immeasurably from opener “State of Grace” and leads the listener to the greatest song of her career to date: “All Too Well”. The analogies and references are less spelt out, too. Then there’s the song structure, the way these songs unfurl as she dissects – with scientific scrutiny – the most intimate details of a relationship, in order to find out where it all went wrong. Red shows Swift with a newfound confidence – and at times, weariness – that can only come with experience. (RO)Brilliantly confounding, Blond keeps the spotlight fixed firmly on its creator’s voice. Tracks are stripped of any unnecessary embellishment, anything that might distract from Ocean’s hypnotic musings on love, sex and death. “Every day counts like crazy,” he sings on “Skyline To” – few lyrics capture quite so well the suffocating feeling of being dragged through life at breakneck speed. Blond is far less cohesive than its predecessor, Channel Orange, but does that really matter? Life is messy and confusing Ocean makes all of it sound beautiful. (RO)A passing comment in a New Yorker profile about being “ready to die” forced Leonard Cohen to tell fans that reports of his imminent death had been hugely exaggerated. Yet the album he was promoting, You Want It Darker, is as powerful a last testament as any artist could hope to release Cohen’s weary utterances – “I’m ready, my Lord” – are delivered in that fathomless baritone, and his meditations on mortality are bleak, even for him. The fact that Cohen did in fact die just three weeks after its release makes those themes, although it didn’t seem possible at the time, even more poignant. (RO)3850 13) Solange – When I Get Home (2019)The decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)The spooky piano and PJ Harvey’s keening howls on the opening, title track of her eighth studio album are enough to signal this album isn’t a barrel of laughs. Yet her finely wrought arrangements – echoing guitars, beautiful melodies and samples that wrongfoot the listener with their cheerfulness – form a superb kind of juxtaposition with the album’s themes. Across 12 brisk tracks, she casts a despairing eye over everything from the conflict in Afghanistan to the mass casualties of the First World War she sings in a kind of pleading tone, all the while knowing that humans are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. (RO)West has always been a complicated, isive, frustrating sort of genius. Never is that more on display than on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a maximalist, genre-crushing album that looks both outwards and inwards – self-aware even in its most crowing moments – it breaks apart the myth of the American Dream. “The system broken, the school is closed, the prison’s open,” he sings on “Power”, one of the best protest songs of the century. Later, he adds, “They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation Well that’s a pretty bad way to start a conversation.” So far, West has yet to write anything half as sharp about Trump’s nation. (AP)Robyn’s magnum opus barely even charted when it was first released at the dawn of the decade. It’s almost a compilation album of the three great EPs she released in one year, Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt 3. But, nearly 10 years on, it is rightly one of the most influential pop albums of the 21st century. Every popstar tries (and mostly fails) to emulate the silky dance-and-cry beauty of songs such as “Dancing on My Own” and “Call Your Girlfriend”. (AP)4250 9) A Tribe Called Quest – We Got it From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service (2016)After an 18-year break – and within months of co-founder Phife Dawg’s death – there were mixed expectations for ATCQ’s return. It arrived in the hubbub of election week, but the group rode into the melee like angry gods on horseback, firing out thunderous rebukes. The hip-hop odyssey delivers America’s existential reckoning, one equally suited to street protests or a recuperative headphone voyage. (JM)When you experience your first heartbreak, you feel as though you’re the only person to have ever felt pain like it. On Melodrama, written when New Zealand musician Lorde was 19 and on the cusp of adulthood, she indulges her heartache, grief, and self-pity with both tenderness and reckless abandon. This is pop music at its most precise – every synth and drumbeat fired off like a bullet from a sniper – but at its most unbound, too, finding brutal, beautiful new ways to sing about the most saturated of subjects: breaking up. (AP)Kendrick has always been a superb storyteller, but the Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN is his odyssey, an album where he presents evidence of his greatness via a series of challenges: tests of loyalty, will, faith and perseverance. It’s an epic punctuated by schizophrenic changes in pace and track structure all the while Kendrick raps as though he doesn’t need oxygen, and you realise his greatest battle has never been with his fans, or another rapper… he’s competing against himself. (RO)After hit album Voodoo, D’Angelo almost died by various means, including addiction and a car crash. Fifteen years on, its follow-up arrived suddenly one Christmas: a grungy, deathly reanimation of the sexy, Soulquarian R\u0026ampB he helped pioneer. Its #BlackLivesMatter-referencing lyrics reveal a man renewed yet still fluttering in the crosswinds of passion and vulnerability. (JM)When footage leaked of Solange Knowles hitting and kicking Jay Z in an elevator at the 2014 Met Gala, word was that the rapper had cheated on his wife, and was receiving the full force of her sister’s wrath. Two years later, Beyoncé seemed to confirm the affair as only she could: not with a statement, but with an astonishing concept album and accompanying 65-minute film. Dipping into genres as though they’re a dressing-up box, the singer traverses the whole spectrum of emotions as she grapples with the betrayal: “My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world,” she sings on opener “Pray You Catch Me”. “Suck on my balls I’ve had enough,” she sings on “Sorry”. (AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. Nils Frahm’s music feels most alive when you’re witnessing it in concert, so it makes sense that Spaces, a collection of field recordings made over two years, is his most immersive and dynamic. The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career. Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars. (HB)Twelve years after Arctic Monkeys released a debut album that shook the British rock scene out of its doldrums, the Sheffield boy wonders came up with this: a concept album about a luxury lunar resort that surgically removed the blues influences on AM and replaced them with lounge jazz and absurdist lyrics. It upset fans who wanted more of the same, and yet, frontman Alex Turner’s musical and lyrical meanderings mark one of the boldest moves by any rock band in recent memory. (RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard. Her pretty, literate vocals spin playful mysteries of faceless lovers in raincoats and strange women on remote shores. “It’s lucidity!” Holter teased. “So clear!” A ludic, lucid dream of a record. (HB)Sky Ferreira did it her way. After years of label disputes about image and musical direction, the Californian finally decided to put her own modelling money towards financing her debut record, 2013’s Night Time, My Time. And what a record it is: melding Eighties pop with alternative rock, it brims with a wild vivacity, as squelching synths come up against gnashing guitars, vulnerable lyrics and often distorted vocals. “Everything is Embarrassing”, produced by Dev Hynes, is one of the songs of the decade. (PS)Combining rumbustious soul-rock with swampy blues grit, this four-piece from Athens, Alabama, were one of the most exciting sounds of 2012 thanks to their humdinger of a debut album. Gutsy and unrefined, Boys \u0026amp Girls is indebted to a bygone era but somehow feels fresh. It’s underpinned by powerhouse frontwoman Brittany Howard’s astonishing voice – capable of both a piercing falsetto or a guttural roar. Barack Obama would subsequently invite the band to play at the White House. (PS)When the documentarians of the future make films about the UK in the 2010s, you can bet they’ll put Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr on the soundtrack. The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain. (HB)After a run of spellbinding singles, the Norse disco maverick released this synthesis of the frivolous and cinematic: an album so casually virtuosic it seemed to have dropped out of an alien supercomputer. From crate digger space-funk to dance floor ecstasy (and a Bryan Ferry feature), It’s Album Time is endlessly replayable: a perfectly formed confection that requires no sequel. (JM)There’s a kind of telepathy that develops when a band spends as much time together as Big Thief. The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)1150 40) Christine and the Queens – Chaleur Humaine (2014)On her electropop-laden debut – the UK release of which meanders between French and English – Heloise Letissier explores the lonelinesses and triumphs of being queer. On “Saint Claude”, she steals glimpses of a feminine boy being mocked on a Paris bus, too ashamed to step in. On “Tilted”, she is newly defiant. “I am actually good, can’t help it if we’re tilted.” (AP)Inspired by the “icy altitudes” of Joni Mitchell’s open-tuned confessionals, the dubstep producer took singer-songwriting into a compelling new landscape of minimalist clicks and autotuned emotion. He sang of “testing sounds For the deaf and the forest cold” and now describes his sparse, graceful debut as “a fractured diary” reflecting “a lack of something”. (HB)In 2016, the UK was in chaos. The EU referendum produced a shock result, David Cameron resigned as prime minister, and the arguing began, as a new harder-right politics emerged. The future felt bleak. In the midst of all this, Skepta – always wary of institutions – poured gasoline over the whole mess and lit a match. Konnichiwa is an album heavy with contempt for authority a sizzling brew of jungle, UK garage and dancehall into which he pours all of his anger, frustration, fear and suspicion. (RO)Where 2008’s For Emma, Forever Ago was an exercise in sparse, solipsistic introspection, Justin Vernon’s follow-up is the sound of a man setting himself free and fully embracing the depths of his imagination. Less hermetically sealed than his debut, it\u0027s exquisite in every way, with Vernon’s soulful falsetto woven into a gorgeous patchwork of jazz, folk, ambient and electronica. He would add more autotune to his voice on later albums here it’s just perfect. (PS)There’s a glorious elasticity of both sound and spirit to the Norwegian singer-songwriter’s seventh album. Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell. (JM)On his 69th birthday, two days before his death, David Bowie released perhaps the most extreme album of his career. Blackstar is more alien than Ziggy as inscrutable as the deepest corners of the universe. He refuses to go quietly, whether making a joyous racket on “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” or adding eerie buzzes and whines to album closer “I Can’t Give Everything Away” where, faced with the nearness of his own death, Bowie engages in a final tussle with his own myth. (RO)Earlier this year, Adele announced that she had split from her husband Simon Konecki. While some sympathised, others rejoiced at the brilliant break-up album that was surely on the cards. “Bunch of f***ing savages,” she joked in response to those gleeful fans. “30 will be a drum ’n’ bass record to spite you.” Cruel though it was, there was a reason for the gleeful reaction – Adele sings of heartbreak like nobody else. And never better than on 21, a sad, soulful masterpiece which on these shores is the best-selling album of the century. (AP)The French electronic pioneers brought funk back for the summer of 2013 with an album drawing heavily on the sounds of the Seventies and Eighties. Pretty much everything you need to know is in the opening salvo “Give Life Back to Music” Daft Punk tend to pop up at times where other artists are grasping frantically for something new. Random Access Memories restarted the party with good old-fashioned craftmanship and Le Daft’s undiluted love for what they do. (RO)It is striking that Lana Del Rey – the greatest artist of her generation – creates art full of meaningful observations about men and women that are deeply unfashionable outside of an Esther Perel podcast. Del Rey desires to be desired she likes it when her man makes her feel like a child she wants to die. The longing for unconsciousness is still present in NFR (I’m the void, she sings on Mariners Apartment Complex) but her most playful record to date is as close to a celebration of her world-conquering status as you are ever likely to hear. (PS)Tiptoeing to the bleeding heart of Steven’s relationship with his schizophrenic, alcoholic mother, this is an album that faces difficult truths with hushed grace. The featherlight folk acquires a remarkable bioluminescence, as the artist finds hope in “signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark”. (HB)ANTI’s botched rollout – Rihanna was teasing the record for years before a leak prompted a hasty free release – seems strangely fitting for an album as joyfully scattershot and unrefined as this. Dark dancehall sounds flirt with hip hop and R\u0026ampB, as the Bajan singer embraces her roots and slyly rebels against the pop tropes du jour. (AP)Having released arguably the Noughties’ defining rock album in Funeral, the Montreal six-piece began this decade with a record bathed in nostalgia. Loosely inspired by frontman Win Butler and his brother Will’s childhood on the outskirts of Houston, The Suburbs has much in common with Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, with its themes of familial responsibility and personal crises. The sound is expansive there are lyrical and musical motifs throughout. If 2007’s Neon Bible was a little portentous and po-faced, this album offers moments of levity in tracks such as the shimmering synth-pop masterpiece Sprawl II. Nothing they’ve done since has been as good.St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, has a tagline for each of her albums. This one, her third, was “housewives on pills”, though that does little justice to a record that marries uncomfortable intimacy with a cool detachment, its obtuse stories of grief, loss and lust told through angular art-rock, frenzied guitar solos and bold melodies. (AP)When his 15-year-old son died in 2015, Cave thought public grieving would be “impossible”. But he found unexpected relief in sharing his feelings with his fans. This ambient double album plays like a warm cloud of solace: direct about the agony and inevitability of loss, in awe of the love that helps us survive it.  (HB)Red is the last album Swift released before it became impossible to discuss her work without mentioning the narrative around her as a person, not just an artist. Her turn of phrase – already impressive for an artist so young – improves immeasurably from opener “State of Grace” and leads the listener to the greatest song of her career to date: “All Too Well”. The analogies and references are less spelt out, too. Then there’s the song structure, the way these songs unfurl as she dissects – with scientific scrutiny – the most intimate details of a relationship, in order to find out where it all went wrong. Red shows Swift with a newfound confidence – and at times, weariness – that can only come with experience. (RO)Brilliantly confounding, Blond keeps the spotlight fixed firmly on its creator’s voice. Tracks are stripped of any unnecessary embellishment, anything that might distract from Ocean’s hypnotic musings on love, sex and death. “Every day counts like crazy,” he sings on “Skyline To” – few lyrics capture quite so well the suffocating feeling of being dragged through life at breakneck speed. Blond is far less cohesive than its predecessor, Channel Orange, but does that really matter? Life is messy and confusing Ocean makes all of it sound beautiful. (RO)A passing comment in a New Yorker profile about being “ready to die” forced Leonard Cohen to tell fans that reports of his imminent death had been hugely exaggerated. Yet the album he was promoting, You Want It Darker, is as powerful a last testament as any artist could hope to release Cohen’s weary utterances – “I’m ready, my Lord” – are delivered in that fathomless baritone, and his meditations on mortality are bleak, even for him. The fact that Cohen did in fact die just three weeks after its release makes those themes, although it didn’t seem possible at the time, even more poignant. (RO)3850 13) Solange – When I Get Home (2019)The decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)The spooky piano and PJ Harvey’s keening howls on the opening, title track of her eighth studio album are enough to signal this album isn’t a barrel of laughs. Yet her finely wrought arrangements – echoing guitars, beautiful melodies and samples that wrongfoot the listener with their cheerfulness – form a superb kind of juxtaposition with the album’s themes. Across 12 brisk tracks, she casts a despairing eye over everything from the conflict in Afghanistan to the mass casualties of the First World War she sings in a kind of pleading tone, all the while knowing that humans are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. (RO)West has always been a complicated, isive, frustrating sort of genius. Never is that more on display than on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a maximalist, genre-crushing album that looks both outwards and inwards – self-aware even in its most crowing moments – it breaks apart the myth of the American Dream. “The system broken, the school is closed, the prison’s open,” he sings on “Power”, one of the best protest songs of the century. Later, he adds, “They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation Well that’s a pretty bad way to start a conversation.” So far, West has yet to write anything half as sharp about Trump’s nation. (AP)Robyn’s magnum opus barely even charted when it was first released at the dawn of the decade. It’s almost a compilation album of the three great EPs she released in one year, Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt 3. But, nearly 10 years on, it is rightly one of the most influential pop albums of the 21st century. Every popstar tries (and mostly fails) to emulate the silky dance-and-cry beauty of songs such as “Dancing on My Own” and “Call Your Girlfriend”. (AP)4250 9) A Tribe Called Quest – We Got it From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service (2016)After an 18-year break – and within months of co-founder Phife Dawg’s death – there were mixed expectations for ATCQ’s return. It arrived in the hubbub of election week, but the group rode into the melee like angry gods on horseback, firing out thunderous rebukes. The hip-hop odyssey delivers America’s existential reckoning, one equally suited to street protests or a recuperative headphone voyage. (JM)When you experience your first heartbreak, you feel as though you’re the only person to have ever felt pain like it. On Melodrama, written when New Zealand musician Lorde was 19 and on the cusp of adulthood, she indulges her heartache, grief, and self-pity with both tenderness and reckless abandon. This is pop music at its most precise – every synth and drumbeat fired off like a bullet from a sniper – but at its most unbound, too, finding brutal, beautiful new ways to sing about the most saturated of subjects: breaking up. (AP)Kendrick has always been a superb storyteller, but the Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN is his odyssey, an album where he presents evidence of his greatness via a series of challenges: tests of loyalty, will, faith and perseverance. It’s an epic punctuated by schizophrenic changes in pace and track structure all the while Kendrick raps as though he doesn’t need oxygen, and you realise his greatest battle has never been with his fans, or another rapper… he’s competing against himself. (RO)After hit album Voodoo, D’Angelo almost died by various means, including addiction and a car crash. Fifteen years on, its follow-up arrived suddenly one Christmas: a grungy, deathly reanimation of the sexy, Soulquarian R\u0026ampB he helped pioneer. Its #BlackLivesMatter-referencing lyrics reveal a man renewed yet still fluttering in the crosswinds of passion and vulnerability. (JM)When footage leaked of Solange Knowles hitting and kicking Jay Z in an elevator at the 2014 Met Gala, word was that the rapper had cheated on his wife, and was receiving the full force of her sister’s wrath. Two years later, Beyoncé seemed to confirm the affair as only she could: not with a statement, but with an astonishing concept album and accompanying 65-minute film. Dipping into genres as though they’re a dressing-up box, the singer traverses the whole spectrum of emotions as she grapples with the betrayal: “My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world,” she sings on opener “Pray You Catch Me”. “Suck on my balls I’ve had enough,” she sings on “Sorry”. (AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. Changes\u0026nbspwill also include Bieber’s single “Yummy”, and marks Bieber’s first album since\u0026nbspPurpose\u0026nbspin 2015.Other recent tracks include the Poo Bear and Jay Electronica collaboration “Hard 2 Face Reality”, and 2017’s “Friends”, which was written with producer BloodPop.\u0026nbspEarlier this month,\u0026nbspBieber revealed that he has been diagnosed with Lyme disease, a bacterial infection caused by ticks.\u0026nbspThe singer shared a post with fans after becoming aware of social media speculation that he was suffering from drug addiction.“They failed to realise I’ve recently been diagnosed with Lyme disease, not only that but had a serious case of chronic mono which affected my skin, brain function, energy and overall health.\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The moon will appear full for around three days, ning from Saturday to Monday.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe time of year means this full moon has traditionally been known as the Full Snow Moon or the Full Hunger Moon, as it often coincided with heavy snowfall and difficult hunting conditions.The arrival of\u0026nbspStorm Ciara\u0026nbspmay affect viewing conditions for people in the UK, with the Met Office forecasting cloud and rain across most of the country on Sunday morning.Created with Sketch.Super worm moon - last supermoon of 2019 in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Worm moon rises over the Karancs Hills in HungaryWorm moon over the Empire State Building in New YorkWorm moon rises over the Galicia Massif mountains in SpainWorm moon rises over the Santiago de Compostela cathedral in Galicia, SpainWorm moon rises over silhouettes of the Beatles in LiverpoolWorm moon over the Guggenheim Museum in Bibao, SpainWorm moon rises over the Karancs Hills in HungaryWorm moon over the Empire State Building in New YorkWorm moon rises over the Galicia Massif mountains in SpainWorm moon rises over the Santiago de Compostela cathedral in Galicia, SpainWorm moon rises over silhouettes of the Beatles in LiverpoolWorm moon over the Guggenheim Museum in Bibao, SpainFortunately, it will not be long to wait until the next supermoon.

I think he should be given a chance. If you don’t give him a chance to rehabilitate himself, how can he learn? He made a mistake, he apologised for it, he’s moved on,” she said.In light of the leaked report,\u0026nbspMr Lammy said: “It’s a scandal that the government is blocking and acting against its own Windrush Lessons Learned Review. The deportation flight to Jamaica next week must be cancelled. No more deportations until the review’s recommendations are implemented.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailMPs Nadia Whittome and Dawn Butler raise point of status of people on next week’s deportation flight to JamaicaThe draft copy of the review states: “Government should review its policy and approach to foreign national offenders, if necessary through primary legislation. It should consider ending all deportation of foreign national offenders where they arrived in the UK as children (say before the age of 13). Alternatively, deportation should only be considered in the most severe cases.”A spokesperson for the Home Office\u0026nbspsaid it did not comment on leaked reviews, adding: “The planned charter flight to Jamaica is specifically for removing foreign criminals. Those detained for removal include people convicted of manslaughter, rape, violent crime and dealing class A drugs.”Bella Sankey, the director of Detention Action, said that among\u0026nbsp​those set to be deported were clients who had lived in the UK since the ages of five and eight. They had all their families in the country – most of them British citizens – and almost no connection to Jamaica.“It’s shameful that the government has suppressed the Windrush report while scheduling next week’s mass deportation flight to Jamaica,” she said.\u0026nbsp“We now know that one of the key recommendations of the review is that the automatic deportation of those that come to the UK as children should end. “Yet Tuesday’s flight is full of such people, who, like so many of our clients, have deep roots and families in the UK.\u0026nbspThis cruel policy is double and discriminatory punishment, it rips children from their parents and causes deep and lifelong trauma. After the scandal of Windrush, government must now make amends to the communities it has shamefully scapegoated.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Look out for that.”So I did, but still can’t isolate the exact moment it arrived at last week’s National Television Awards, on ITV, where the industry had assembled for the th time and, quite possibly, the last as well.If it was the NTA’s farewell, then it’d be a mercy ­killing for an event where shock results have come along about as regularly as Hezbollah ­isions have arrived at the Changing of the Guard.Five years ago, you could’ve bet the house Ant and Dec would claim their th presenting title, and This ­Morning’s Phillip and Holly would milk their tenth consecutive Best Magazine Show hangover, to the point their long-suffering audience were probably feeling homicidal.This year’s only vague surprise being, it transpired, Ant and Dec thought the same way as the viewers, with Dec admitting they: “Feel more and more sick every year.”There was a flip side to all these set-in-stone voting patterns, of course.The NTAs remained the one place on ­television earth where Mrs Brown’s Boys could be relied upon to beat the massively overrated Fleabag.Considering how regimented the actual voting is, though, the far more remarkable thing about the NTAs is that it’s nearly always a shambolic production.Categories come, go, mutate and ide into three drama sections .Some are accompanied by clips . Others, like New Drama, aren’t. It also whores itself out commercially and jumps on every available bandwagon.So David Mitchell trudged on randomly, dressed as Shakespeare, to promote a stage show, and the Impact Award was given to Gavin  Stacey, when it had “Caroline Flack’s bedside lamp” written all over it.A lot of this was down to the fact the NTAs still don’t know their own mind.They want to be both popular and highbrow, which meant poor old Michael Palin was left describing it as “a hotbed of talent”, while the camera went looking for Tess Daly.Through it all , Ant, Dec and This Morning have endured, and it’s possible to have a bit of sympathy for the production, with such stubbornly repetitive voting habits.The NTAs and ITV really are the authors of most of their own misfortune here, though.Insecure television networks need a Best Magazine category, TV awards don’t.Nor do they need a Best Judge, which was the section that eventually lumbered them with four-times winner David Walliams, the trouserless host — a man whose world begins and ends with himself and, when required to do something , like pay tribute to Nicholas Parsons, performs it with all the sincerity of a “mind the gap” announcement.As luck would have it, however, two very obvious solutions to the hosting problem presented themselves in the audience, on Tuesday.One was Ricky Gervais, who probably wouldn’t do it.The other, in about row , was Bradley Walsh, who stole the entire show by virtue of winning and saying nothing, but pulling all the right faces.Bradley would be the most obvious fit in the event’s history and I’m sure it would be warmly welcomed by most people,only the National Television Awards were worth saving.THREE and a half meandering years it took us to reach Friday night’s pm Brexit countdown.Yet in all that time I can’t remember one occasion when British TV’s satirical shows actually had something laugh-out-loud funny to say on the subject.That’s almost certainly because Have I Got News For You, The Last Leg, The Mash Report and Frankie Boyle’s New World Order all decided their left-of-centre anti-Brexit opinion was far more important than mere comedy.The wonderful irony is that the collective fury and bile has definitely had an effect.It’s made a minor star out of Geoff Norcott, one of those very rare comedians who’s not just a Conservative Leaver, he’s actually likeable as well.As the token voice of Brexit, Channel  and the BBC, very grudgingly, have had to include Geoff on almost every comedy show, including The Last Leg: Countdown To Brexit, where they’ve been trying and failing to screw a laugh out of Adam Hills’ beard for months now.I gave up on the latest attempt after about half an hour, which meant I was still looking for a show to make sense of Britain’s relationship with Europe and had only two reasonable options available, as the clock ticked down to pm.One was calm, sober analysis from the BBC, the other was ITV+’s screening of Love Island.Obviously, I took the more credible option and discovered men in lederhosen were flinging jugs of beer at scantily clad Frauleins while the commentator explained: “We sent a runner to buy strap-on harnesses and stuff poles on them.“The girls’ job is to toss pretzels at the boys and the couple with the least amount of pretzels on their pole at the end is out.”MAN Like Mobeen Man don’t like Mobeen.THE dressing-up box brigade lulled me into a  sense of security, at Sunday night’s Baftas, on BBC.True, host Graham Norton made sure there was an undercurrent of hostility to “white men” , from the start, and there was all the usual self-aggrandising flannel about “giving a voice to the voiceless”.But Andy “Gollum” Serkis made a two-minute -second speech, accepting his Outstanding Contribution award, that was so beautully judged it seemed to pacy them for nearly an hour and a half.Then Rebel Wilsonjoked that it was only sexism that stopped her joining Martin Scorsese and Sam Mendes in the Best Director category and it was like she’d flipped a switch on the entire room.Suddenly, Joaquin Phoenix was agonising about “systemic racism” and Prince William was lecturing everyone about “ersity” without the entire Royal Albert Hall gasping at his brass neck.Then, just when I thought it couldn’t get worse, up popped Hugh Grant to announce he was so impressed with the Best Film contenders His Lordship had actually condescended to vote for one of them, which I’m assuming lost.For a couple of seconds at least, though, it really was possible to think, “Maybe the National TV Awards weren’t so bad, after all.”WINTERWATCH, prediction of the week, Iolo Williams to Chris Packham: “In ten years’ time, we’ll probably have penduline tits.”Arthritic groins, Spacehopper-sized prostates and chronic flatulence.Further to last week’s allegations, Good Morning Britain weather girl Laura Tobin says: “I do not crave attention. I like to have attention for my work, good climate change stories and Nasa trips.”As I noticed myself, when I saw Laura appear in Tipping Point: Lucky Stars, Drive, with Vernon Kay, Pointless Celebrities and Sharknado : Global Swarming.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was actually close to repossession at the time.They were going to repossess my home. So I dug myself out of that one.”Ronnie, who now lives in Bristol, told how he planned on never selling his prized honour.He said: It was something I said I would never, ever do. I am so proud and honoured to have done such a thing and be involved in it that I would never, ever sell it.I have always believed from that day on that the le of a member of the royal family was more valid and important that mine.I still considered it was well worth my while getting shot as opposed to Princess Anne.What I would like is whoever does eventually buy the medal, I would hope they might invite me somewhere to tell them an after-dinner story about what happened on the night.The medal - which will be auctioned off at Dix Noonan Webb in central London next month - is expected to sell for between £, and £,.Princess Anne was just -years-old when she was almost abducted in .The princess was in chauffeur-driven limo - with her then-husband Captain Phillips - driving down the Mall to the palace, when a car swerved in front of them.An armed and masked man, Ian Ball, shot at Annes car as royal police protection officer James Beaton and driver Alex Callender got out of the car tofire.During the attack James’s weapon jammed and Ball shot him three times.Alex was also shot in an attempt to disarm Ball, along with journalist Brian McConnell who tried to intervene.The attacker then got in Annes limo and told her to get out - but the Queen’s only daughter gave a ballsy response. She replied: Not bloody likely.Eventually, Anne did actually get out, with Ian following close behind.However, he was then punched by passerby Mr Russell, and police were able to arrest him.Ball had planned to abduct the princess and demand £m ransom from the Queen, but ended up being sentenced to le in prison and detained in a mental hospital.Recounting the attempted abduction, Mr Russell said: It was very fast moving but it is as clear to me now as it was the day it happened.I punched him twice.

What is the future of the BBC  Should China build our telecoms network Seldom has the political news agenda been so packed. But what is the story gaining traction at Westminster  For the latest, let’s go straight to our correspondent outside  Downing Street - who, oh dear, is stomping away in protest like Dick Emery’s Honky Tonks, having just had a blazing row with Boris Johnson’s media strategist.Yes, the big story, crazily, is the stand-off between political journalists and the PM’s media advisers. The reporters, hardly the most delicate bunch of dahlias, are wailing that the Government is being beastly to them.In the blue corner we have Downing Street’s press officers who, in an unusual interpretation of the Trade Description Act, are refusing to speak to the Press. When newspapers write about themselves, readers are entitled to roll their eyes.Political news, like the mass-production of pork bangers, is a manufacturing process best conducted away from the view of consumers. Not unless you want to turn the whole country vegan.I’ve been in newspapers since the mid-s, much of the time at Westminster, and have met drunkards, liars, gropers, cheats — and that was just the religious-affairs writers. Don’t let’s pretend journalism or politics attracts innocent hayseeds. Which makes the over-reacting on both sides of the ide in recent days so ridiculous.Creative tension between reporters and politicians’ media handlers is a healthy thing, but the system has suddenly snapped. This follows a general election in which it sometimes felt as though the media, particularly broadcasters, niggled Boris Johnson more effectively than Jeremy Corbyn did.When Boris won a thumping majority, his aides may have thought: “Right, now we can exact revenge on our media tormentors.” If so, they are foolish and unprofessional.First, they started mucking about with the daily briefings to the Westminster press lobby, the club of accredited journalists who report on politics.Then, on Monday, they tried to bar some members of that lobby from a briefing by David Frost, Boris’s main adviser on the European trade negotiations. Some scribes were told they could attend, others were told they were barred.Downing Street claimed that the briefing was too specialised for general politics writers to appreciate. The reporters took a dferent view.They reckoned Downing Street strategist Dominic Cummings and his sidekick Lee Cain were trying to ide and rule, and to winnow out the journalistic troublemakers. In a rare moment of solidarity among hacks, the newshounds upped and left. Walkout!This squabble is now headline news. Urgent questions were raised in the Commons and many papers and broadcasters are protesting that the Government is trying to censor the free Press in a “sinister” way.They compare this tactic to Donald Trump’s denunciation of mainstream US media for spreading “fake news” . Sir Keir Starmer, would-be leader of the Labour Party, joined the outcry, siding with the journalists. We could have done without that slippery little bit of opportunism.The same Starmer boasted recently that he would refuse to talk to reporters from The Sun, presumably because this paper is not in his pocket.Attempts to neutralise awkward reporters are not exactly new. During the  election, as a scurvy political sketch writer, I was locked out of a Tony Blair campaign event in The Wrekin.Gordon Brown’s people stopped me attending a media event with the president of South Africa.Tory party cronies barred me from witnessing a leadership debate between David Cameron and David Davis in . In the last election, non-sympathetic journalists were not given access to Jeremy Corbyn’s battle bus. Mind you, we were lucky. As one Leftie reporter told me: “You couldn’t get on Corbyn’s bus but I couldn’t get OFF it!”Despite some of those historic precedents, the current “lobby war” is more problematic because it looks more concerted and because it comes at a time when traditional news sources are under challenge from the internet.Online news sites can be shady and unreliable. Traditional lobby journalists, for all their faults, are at least reasonably accountable.Both sides should cool it. The lobby should admit that its clique is unacceptably clubby for st-century politics. And Boris’s henchmen should drop the macho posturing. Why are they picking this fight at a time when the Government is so popular  Never a better time for it, they might say. They want to show who’s boss.You could compare their aggression to that of an inmate who on arrival in prison butts the first guy he meets in order to show other prisoners he’s a tough guy. In my experience, journalists respond badly to this approach.Look at the damage Tony Blair’s thuggish spokesman Alastair Campbell did to the government he served.It is not beyond the wit of ministers to palm favourable stories to selected journaliststhey so wish. But the central media unit at No should remember — as they have repeatedly told us — that they are “the people’s Government” and not merely the servants of Boris Johnson.Their juicy salaries come from the taxpayer and the taxpayer does not expect them to abuse their privileged position.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

How can they live with themselves, keeping the truth from the Lubbock family It’s utterly unforgivable.Another posted: This is scandalous and utterly pathetic .... Im horried.One person wrote: A total disgrace!And a fourth said: I remember feeling so uncomfortable seeing Michael Barrymore lapping up the cheers from the crowd on Big Brother.Another wrote: Stuarts injuries were horrendous  somebody capable of that is not just drunk or high but evil.One person tweeted: This #Barrymore doc about the death of Stuart Lubbock is horric.Somebody knows where and how Stuart sustained those injuries, and somebody  has almost certainly heard somebody  talking about it, such is human nature.People expressed their sadness for the Lubbock family, with some backing former ITV star Barrymore.One viewer tweeted: Its so sad for the Lubbock family, devastatingly awful and I understand how they will never get over any of this, there has been no closure for them.Another said: BodyInThePool deeply sad for the death of this young man and the case remain unresolved.And a third wrote: Barrymore is innocent. An orgy gone wrong. The Sun exclusively revealed Barrymore and his seven pool party guests at his home in Roydon are still being linked to the alleged rape and murder of Stuart.Experts told tonights bombshell documentary they werent convinced Stuart had drowned.Stuart met Barrymore at an Essex nightclub before being invited back to the ITV star’s bungalow.A party at the swanky pad began at .am with the emergency services called at .am and Stuart pronounced dead at .am.In the documentary, the  recording first made to emergency services on the night is heard, with a man saying ‘a geezer’s drowned in the pool’.He then tells the operator ‘I think the geezer’s dead, mate’.An initial post-mortem gave Staurts cause of death as drowning.The coroner ordered a second post-mortem by Professor Chris Milroy, who told the C documentary: I wasn’t convinced drowning was the correct cause of death.“Even though he was found in the water that does not mean he has died there.A third forensic pathologist Dr Ian Calder, a drowning expert, who examined Stuarts body told the Channel  documentary makers: “Stuart’s lungs did not show the critical appearances of drowning.It didn’t add up to a classical drowning.”Stuarts anal injuries were horric, Dr Michael Heath told documentary makers.Stuart’s dad Terry Lubbock told the documentary makers: “It has consumed me, what happened to Stuart.It has taken over my le.”Barrymore, , today broke his silence to claim he has been bashed and bullied over the death.Speaking in a video posted in Twitter today, Barrymore said: Channel  are refusing to show it to me or tell me what it is about.Anyone who wants to get to the truth of the matter should watch the ITV interview I did last year with Piers Morgan. He went into everything and left no stone unturned.The truth is, I have always done everything asked of me and Ive co-operated with everyone.Essex Polices own QC has said that we know that Mr Barrymore has nothing to do with this and that there is no evidence linking him to the injuries on Mr Lubbock or the pool.I have had nothing to do with this whatsoever and yet I keep getting bashed and bullied by the media.A  inquest recorded an open verdict after failing to conclude what caused Stuart’s death.Cops believe Stuart was assaulted then either died in the jacuzzi, or went unconscious and was dumped in the pool to make it look like drowning.Despite several arrests, no criminal charges have been brought over the death due to lack of evidence.A £, reward has been put up for information - after cops blasted the “lies” spun over the past  years.Investigators were looking into the possibility Stuarts murder was “covered up”.A swimming pool thermometer from the hot tub — which could have been used in a sex assault on the victim — later went missing.A broken shed handle, seen by officers, also disappeared and was not found in any bins at the property in Roydon.Cops said the brutality of the sex assault would match one or both of the objects.A  inquest heard that Barrymore’s then-PA Michael Browne was called to the house.Police yesterday said other unnamed men “close to Barrymore” were also allowed in — giving the perfect opportunity to clean up the scene.DCI Stephen  Jennings said: One line of inquiry has to be that this could have been a cover-up.“But there is a chance whoever did this just got lucky and no evidence was left at the scene.”He added: “Let me be clear — I believe Stuart Lubbock was murdered. And we will catch whoever did it.“I don’t think there’s anyone  there — realistically — other than the eight people that were there on the night. Of the people arrested, no one has been eliminated from inquiries.We believe at least one person is responsible — but it could be two or more.“I can’t rule out a single inidual being responsible — but on balance of probability there was more than likely more than one person involved.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It should be knocked on the head immediately.”A council source ranted: “Making this gesture while there is a cloud hanging over the Duke is hugely insulting to Epstein’s victims and those wanting answers.”Andrew left the Navy in  to become a full-time ­working royal.Eldest brother, Prince Charles, was made an Admiral at the age of  and his sister Princess Anne was given the same honour at .But palace and defence officials suggested the promotion could be awarded laterhe clears his name.The latest humiliation for Andrew, which follows the cancellation of a planned birthday reception, comes amid frustration from US authorities, who have allegedly tried in vain to arrange an interview with him.A lawyer for Epsteins victims claims she has a NEW witness who saw Prince Andrew dancing with Virginia Roberts at the Tramp nightclub.Lisa Bloom said the woman had been partying with a friend when she accidentally stepped on a fellow revellers toes at the exclusive nightspot in London in  - before realising it was the royal.And the witness claimed she saw the prince with a young woman - since recognising her as a young Virginia Roberts, who claims she had sex with Andrew when she was a teen.Prince Andrew has denied the allegations, stating he has no recollection of meeting Ms Roberts and was instead at a Pizza Express in Woking for a party on the night in question.Lawyer Ms Bloom said she had been approached by the witness after Prince Andrews interview with Newsnight.She said: Her story is this - she was there in the nightclub and she stepped on the foot of somebody who was dancing next to her.She said Im sorry, he said thats OK.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is often hope where we may first see ­dficulty. You just have to look a bit harder sometimes.In Portpatrick, at Scotland’s bottom left corner, the harbour had fallen into miserable disrepair. A plan was hatched to stop the rot.A local hero organised a share issue for locals to raise the money to buy the harbour and restore the buildings around it. The village now has its pecker up again and the future looks bright.It’s a similar story on Anglesey. At Halen Mon a thriving family business draws water out of the Menai Strait, harvests the salt and sells it all over the world.Near there I met a woman called Sian Sykes who cared about those waters so much she paddle-boarded  miles around Anglesey picking out the plastic.Asthat wasn’t enough, she then paddled the whole coast of Wales doing exactly the same.But my favourite character round there is no longer with us. On the very western tip of Holy Island off Anglesey’s west coast, there is the South Stack lighthouse. It’s been saving sailors from watery deaths since .A hundred years ago, John Jones was its keeper and it was his great granddaughter Denise Shaw who took me up to the top of it.Denise showed me a photograph of her great-grandad sporting a magnicent moustache the seagulls must have coveted for their nests.He was no loner, though. Denise remembers her mum saying old great-gramps was a bit of a ladies’ man.And what a chat-up line he had at his disposal: “Do you want to come back to my place to see how bright my light is ”All four of the areas we’ve looked at for this series of Our Coast are around the Irish Sea. I had a brilliant time at Belfast docks where I joined the harbour pilots, whose work astounded me.It’s their job to bring the giant ships safely into port.I sort of assumed they did this by chugging out to meet them, lighting up a sign saying, “follow me” and gently leading them to their berths.Far from it. Round the clock, all year round, whatever the weather, they race out several miles to pull up alongside these huge vessels.Incredibly, a rope ladder is dropped over the side for the pilots to clamber aboard, make their way to the bridge, take over the controls and steer these monsters into tight spaces on the docks.The ship I boarded with them, somewhat terried, was carrying grain from Romania.As my man took the helm I asked the Polish skipper which country had the best harbour pilots. “You do,” he said, with feeling.Back across the Irish Sea, in Formby, north of Liverpool, I met Mike McComb in the £million place he’s built himself a stone’s throw from the sea.He has more bedrooms, bathrooms and children than I could count .His fortune could have bought him a lavish home anywhere in the world. But it was up here, along the endless beach, that back in the day he and his mates would come on their bikes from their tiny homes in Bootle.So, he tells me as we stand on the beach, lashed by rain and wind, you can keep St Tropez or Malibu. This coast, his coast, is where he’ll stay.The sea seems to be a magnet for the most memorable people, from Grace the crane engineer in Belfast Docks who played rugby for Ireland in three rugby world cups, to Sandy the tattooed pagan near Stranraer who says the sea’s our mother, and the Bulgarian dissident I chanced upon sitting in a hot tub ­surveying Liverpool from the deck of the Queen Mary .My grandad used to tell me that when you put your toe in the sea you’re connected with the whole world.With that in mind, I’ve enjoyed many a paddle this summer reflecting on the power and history of what our island nation is all about.And I urge you to do it, too. After all, it’s pretty easy. Britain’s most landlocked place — Coton in the Elms in Derbyshire — is just  miles from the coast. So none of us is more than a couple of hours away from the sea.There’s never been a more relevant time to get out to the edges and see the soul of this country.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because very often it sure as hell ain’t the product.Last Saturday, the most read piece on the BBC news homepage was a clickbait “story” — taken from Twitter — about how Kim Kardashian eats chicken nuggets.Yes, you read that right. With £.billion of your money to its name, one of the most popular “stories” on the BBC’s news website was an item which didn’t cost a penny to make, wasn’t news and stretched the definition of “public service” far beyond breaking point. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.James Purnell — a particularly puffed-up BBC exec — announced  months ago that he and his Radio  Education team would be expanding into podcasts. He stayed horribly true to his word.In , Auntie produces podcasts on everything from football and Love Island to what Towie star Gemma ­Collins’ latest musings are, which — thanks to the big names at the helm — are ­raking in listeners.For Purnell, this is something to be celebrated. Successful podcasts presumably mean more money in his already overstuffed pockets.But for the hundreds of private podcast makers out there, it spells the beginning of the end. Competing with a company which uses public funds to net the likes of Peter Crouch is nigh-on impossible.How, I ask you, can a state broadcaster justy putting hard-working private firms out of business Yes, Ollie Williams discussing his shock exit from the Love Island villamight be entertaining, but what ­“service” is it providing the public Can the BBC — which doesn’t make Love Island — really do a better job of a Love Island podcast than ITV, which does You’d think the BBC top dogs, who are desperate to cling on to the Royal Charter, would be asking these vital questions too.But in their desperate quest for “yoof” audiences, they’ve chucked their critical faculties out of the window.And it’s all for nothing. Because the quest is a wild goose chase. According to the latest Ofcom report, most kids don’t watch ANY linear TV.So the BBC is defending a dying, analogue means of ­communication. But no one in the corporation can bear to face this unwelcome reality.So instead of cutting their own whopping salaries, they scrap well-known and well- respected current affairs ­programmes such as the ­Victoria Derbyshire show.Why  Because the more ­visible the cut, the easier it is for luvvies to pretend that the BBC is the blameless ­victim of evil Tory austerity.Nothing, of course, could be further from the truth. In fact,anything, it is the Tories and their tens of ­millions of voters who are ­victims of the BBC.The repeated Horrible Histories ­“comedy” — which mockingly undermined the existence of “British things” — and the ­ludicrously PC recent East-Enders storyline, in which a deranged killer embraces Islam and becomes a hero, are the latest in a long line of ultra- liberal BBC content seemingly designed to rub ordinary, ­patriotic Brits up the wrong way.Things can’t go on like this. If the state broadcaster is to survive, there must be an urgent and fundamental rethink.First, the BBC’s parasitical website must be shut down. The stories it features are mostly dross, or  adapted from newspaper reports.To list just one example, when Brits want to know what’s happening with Megxit, they can buy The Sun — which was responsible for the scoop in the first place.If the BBC wants a web presencethey can use it to broadcast News . Next, the salaries of fat cat managers and C-list celebs must be slashed.Then the corporation must think hard about its media offering. BBC and its often extremely niche arts offering should be folded into BBC.Radio  and , with content already well covered by ­commercial markets, must be shut down. As must every ­programme across BBC ­channels which is designed to damage ITV’s ­ratings.And of course Brits should not be punished for refusing to pay a licence fee for a service they may not use.Decriminalising it — as Boris Johnson is understood to be seriously ­considering — is the right thing to do.If Auntie can swallow a big slice of humble pie, accept her glory days are over and slim right down to size, she may have a future.

Ms Reynolds won Wolverhampton North East with a , majority in  and increased it to , five years later. In  her majority dipped to ,. But in December last year, her Tory rival seized the seat with a , majority on a .% swing – another brick in Labouraposs “Red Wall” heartlands demolished. Speaking to the Mirror, Ms Reynolds admitted she was “pretty pessimistic quite early on”. She said: “I had a particularly bad campaign session one Friday afternoon in an area thataposs usually strong for us. “But in order to keep going you have to convince yourself youaposre not on a hiding to nothing, you persuade yourself that actually itaposs just one bad campaigning session. “But looking back, thataposs when I really realised we were probably going to lose.” Ms Reynolds gave birth to her second child over the summer. But she still hit the streets with her campaign team when the election was triggered. They were knocking doors of voters who previously said they would back Labour.But this time electors “were either very aggressively against us – slamming the door in our face and saying, aposNo wayapos – or saying, aposOooh, howaposs your second baby  I donapost think I can vote for you this time, Iaposm really sorryapos. “Some were in anger, some in sorrow. “But a lot of people in that particular session were just turning away from us.”  Ms Reynoldsapos old seat sits on the edge of Wolverhampton city centre and leads towards the outskirts. Her now-defunct constituency office is at the heart of the patch in the suburb of Oxley. A shopping centre lies either side of the busy A Stafford Road dual carriageway, carrying cars the two miles into town past smart, semi-detached houses. Businesses include two Chinese takeaways, three bookies, four off licences and four funeral directors in the space of  yards. Many shopfronts are shuttered – and they now include Ms Reynoldsapos office after her defeat on December . As the campaign wore on, attempts to convince traditional backers to stick with the party failed“We got a mixture of not liking and not trusting Jeremy Corbyn and thinking the Labour Party was therefore a joke, and the idea they would vote for us again was something they wouldnapost give the time of day – totally impossible to persuade,” she said.“They didnapost trust him on the economy, they didnapost believe all the things we were promising could be done without paying more in tax. “There was a general dislike of him, a distrust – not wanting him to be Prime Minister. “We tried what we tried in  – aposDonapost worry he wonapost be Prime Minister, weaposre not doing very well in the polls, but you can afford to vote for me as your local MPapos.  “But that wasnapost getting any traction this time. “We used that in  relatively effectively. “But the problem was we did better than anybody thought we would in  and they had another two-and-a-half years to look at Jeremy, and Iaposm afraid they didnapost like what they saw.” People perceived him to be “weak, a terrorist-sympathiser and a traitor”, she said. “Anybody who had worked in the Armed Forces said, aposI could never vote for that manapos,” admitted Ms Reynolds. Issues around economic credibility hampered Labouraposs campaign. “We said we would throw money around left, right and centre, and people just didnapost buy it, they thought that was a recipe for disaster – either the country would go bankrupt or they would have to pay more money in taxes,” she said. “People didnapost feel like he was going to do things for them. It was a deep distrust.” She wanted the party to hammer home three priorities: the NHS, schools and police.But Labouraposs scatter-gun approach lacked focus – allowing the Tories to press their Brexit message.“We underestimated the Brexit fatigue,” said Ms Reynolds, who represented a seat where two thirds of people voted Leave.  “I am sick of Brexit as well – weaposre all sick of it – but people did buy the aposGet Brexit Doneapos message and we were getting it back at us on the doorstep. “They thought MPs from all parties were standing in the way of it. “The combination of that and Jeremy was killer because you could perhaps persuade people about one of those things but … there was nothing you could doboth of those things were in their minds.” On polling day, one Labour loyalist tearfully admitted she would not back the party this time. Ms Reynolds recalled: “She said, aposI have always voted Labour but I cannot bring myself to vote Labourapos – and she literally had a tear in her eye. “She was visibly upset and that is the position we put people in. “I think it is a huge betrayal of people we traditionally represent.” Ms Reynolds was a staunch critic of the Corbyn regime, long warning of the implosion which unfolded just before Christmas. “In a way Iaposm weirdly vindicated because this is what I said would happen,” she said. “But I lost my seat as a result.  “Itaposs hugely frustrating because there was nothing I could do about Jeremy being the leader.” As leadership hopefuls prepare for Sundayaposs Mirror hustings in nearby Dudley, she urged the party not to back a “continuity Corbyn” candidate. “We need to elect a leader who turns the page on Corbyn and all that he represents – not just him but the whole experiment that has failed,” she said. “If there is any aposcontinuity Corbynapos leader, that would be a disaster and could be the end of the party.” Ms Reynolds wants the next leader to “show people they are listening on controversial issues” like immigration. She added: “Weaposve got a lot of work to do and the next leader firstly has to change the party. “In order to be credible again we need a dferent kind of party, a dferent kind of leadership, dferent Shadow Cabinet. “We need to front up to the people who thought Jeremy Corbyn was going to lead this socialist revolution and say, aposNo, it was never ever going to be successful, and thataposs never going to win us electionsapos. “Whoever it is has got to tell some hard truths to the party – and the partyaposs got to be able to listen.” She warned: “Iaposm not sure this is a five-year project. “I would very much hope it can be turned around in five years but it might not be possible.” Shoppers in the Wolverhampton North East suburb of Oxley delivered a scathing verdict on Labour torday – particularly outgoing leader Jeremy Corbyn. Charity shop worker Liz Thomas, , said: “I voted Conservative, always have done. “Boris is a little bit daft but heaposs lovely. “Iaposm hoping I havenapost done the wrong thing.  “I hated Jeremy Corbyn, heaposs just horrible, heaposs slimy – itaposs a woman thing. “I voted for Brexit but it wasnapost a big part of why I voted Conservative in December.” John OaposConnor, , a retired bricklayer, said: “Personally I thought the best party got in. “I voted for their principles. “Boris is OK, heaposs down to earth.  “Jeremy Corbyn made a few mistakes but he wasnapost the only person who spoke to members of the IRA, yet that went against him.”Unemployed hairdresser Nathan Lawrence, , said: “Iaposve never voted in any general election and now I wonapost ever do so.“I made the biggest mistake of my le – I voted for Brexit. “They told me that my NHS was going to get £million extra.  “I feel cheated, I feel lied to. I have lived here all my le and now my backyard, where I grew up, has become a UKIP heartland. “Iaposm disgusted.” Retired builder James Dell, , voted Conservative because it was “the only sensible thing to do”. The Brexiteer said: “Thereaposs no point voting Labour, they stood no chance of getting in because of their views on Brexit, their incompetence on Brexit, their ision on Brexit. “Iaposve always been a Tory voter but there was no real option this time anyway.  “Jeremy Corbyn was just ridiculous as a leader, far too left. “It shouldnapost be about personas but, as everybody says, heaposs like Steptoe, heaposs not presentable, his views are outdated. “I think people want a more centrist Labour Party.” His we Evelyn Dell, , a retired businesswoman, also backed the Conservatives. She said: “I couldnapost vote Jeremy Corbyn because of the whole anti-Semitism thing. “I didnapost agree with how that was dealt with by the party.  “Boris is great, I donapost get it when people mock him. “He doesnapost take the job too seriously until it needs to be and then he does. “When I listen to him, everything he says makes sense to me. “Labour needs to be more centrist.” Linda Wilding, , a retired bookies shop worker, voted Tory because she wanted a crackdown on immigration. She said: “Immigration was on lots of peopleaposs minds with Brexit and they are the best party to lead us out of the EU. “I like Boris Johnson, he talks a lot of sense.“I donapost think Jeremy Corbyn has got a clue. “They need somebody who is more in touch with the average person, somebody more in the middle as opposed to being totally left wing.” Student Marnie Wilding, , planned to vote Labour but was too tired to visit her polling station after a long day in college. She believed Labour would have done more to help “the homeless and people who go to foodbanks”.

The boxing champion is one of Bulk Powders’ athletes alongside England rugby ace Jonathan Joseph, er Tom Daley and TOWIE star Lucy Mecklenburgh. Joshua, , previously said protein powders were “key to unlocking my top performance”. But a Trading Standards investigation found the multi-million pound company had been using “unjustied health and nutrition claims”. Tests of products including High Protein Snack Bars, Pure Whey Protein, Smooth Roasted Hazelnut Butter, and Maca Powder revealed  breaches of labelling legislation. Cllr Susan Barker, Cabinet Member for Customer, Corporate, Culture and Communities said: “This sentencing sends a clear message to businesses that misleading consumers will not be tolerated and that they have a duty to protect the people who buy their products. “Essex Trading Standards has an ongoing commitment to support residents who should feel confident that they can rely on the information provided in the form of food labels and commercial websites.” ETS launched an investigation into Bulk Powders, which also trades as Sports Supplements Limited, following complaints. Last year’s probe saw food products from the business formally sampled and submitted to the public analyst for consideration.  Of the products sampled, a total of  breaches of labelling legislation were reported. The level of protein in some items was found to be insufficient to make the health claim “protein contributes to the growth of muscle mass”. Colchester Magistrates Court heard the business failed to act on advice and guidance from officers on seven separate occasions. They noted customers may have been misled into paying more for products than they would for similar foods available on the high street.

Russell Steele murdered the mother and daughter then killed himself in an apartment in Newry, Northern Ireland, on March , . The trioaposs bodies were found after they had all been reported missing. Coroner Joe McCrisken found Giselle Marimon-Herrera, , died from asphyxiation and suffocation and -year-old Allison Marimon-Herrera died due to manual strangulation and suffocation. Their chihuahua dog was also found dead, the inquest in County Armagh heard. The hearing was told Mr McCrisken could not be certain that Ms Marimon-Herrera had been sexually assaulted, but that there was evidence her daughter had been raped. Steele had had two passports, his phone and a pair of torn ladies underwear which DNA evidence found were likely to have belonged to Miss Marimon-Herrera in his pockets.  Mr McCrisken had held separate inquests into the deaths of Ms Marimon-Herrera and her daughter, and Steele. The victimsapos family did not attend, but a statement from Ms Marimon-Herreraaposs sister Paola was read to the inquest. She described how her sister had arrived in Northern Ireland in  after separating from her Portuguese husband, and was followed by her daughter in . She also told the inquest that her sister had felt Steele was controlling and she had wanted to end the relationship.  A PSNI officer told the inquest text messages exchanged between Steele and Ms Marimon-Herrera revealed a recent argument which included an attempt by her to end the relationship. A neighbour believed to be the last person to have seen Steele alive recalled to the inquest seeing Steele standing at the front door of the apartment complex on Sunday March  holding a holdall and a plastic bag, looking agitated and unable to stand still. An examination of a laptop found in the apartment revealed research on lethal doses of paracetamol at .am on Monday March , the inquest was told. The police officer who gave evidence at the inquest agreed with a suggestion Steele had been preparing to leave before changing his mind and ing to the apartment where he took his own le.  The inquest also heard that phones likely to have been used by Ms Marimon-Herrera and her daughter had no recoverable information on them. It appears that the information was deleted from both devices, Ms Holmes said. A statement from Steeleaposs ex-we was read to the inquest. Margaret Steele said she met him through church as he battled a heroin addiction. They had a temporary split in  when he relapsed but in total they were married for  years and had two children together. The marriage ended after she discovered her husband was having an affair with Ms Marimon-Herrera, who he had previously met in Spain before reconnecting via social media. He then left their home in Kilmarnock to move to Northern Ireland.  The inquest heard Steele had a criminal record, which included a conviction for an assault which led to an eight-month prison sentence. Delivering his findings, Mr McCrisken said neither Ms Marimon-Herrera nor her daughter would have been likely to have been able to fend off Steele. The killing of Giselle Marimon-Herrera and her -year-old daughter Allison by Russell Steele was barbaric, he said. Giselle Marimon-Herrera was a woman of small stature.

Mr Trainer, from Aintree, who is a repeat aposnoise pollution offenderapos, was previously jailed for the same offence yet continued to play music at a level I enjoy.Prosecution Barrister, Simon Leong, told Liverpool Magistrates Cour t how Mr Trainer’s neighbour, Thomas Michael Thompson, had experienced “noise pollution” from his neighbouraposs property for a number of years.On Tuesday, December , , a police officer attended Mr Traineraposs property after being called out for a complaint of noise by Mr Thompson. However the court heard, when a police officer arrested him on suspicion of breaching a condition of a restraining order, Mr Trainer told the officer “I like playing music at a level I enjoy.” The statement, read in court, also reported that Mr Trainer had said he had a bad cold and “could only hear in one ear”. He also told the officer that being on steroids for a medical condition meant he couldnapost wear headphones as they “irritated his ears.” In court, Mr Trainer, who is hard of hearing, was allowed out of the dock to sit in court and was provided with a listening device so he could hear proceedings. Giving evidence, neighbour Mr Thompson, said: “It’s not just one day of the week, it’s every day of the week. “I go out early morning and stay out until late afternoon to avoid the noise. “It’s just unbelievable at times.”  The court was shown a number of video recordings made by Mr Thompson on his mobile phone, to show what he could hear from his house, which adjoins Mr Trainersapos. In one clip Mr Thompson was seen walking closely to his living room wall, which meets Mr Trainer’s property and music from Classic FM could clearly be heard, which included the sound of the presenters talking. Defending Keith Webster suggested to the court that Mr Thompson had been angry about Mr Traineraposs early release from a previous prison sentence. He also told the court how on one occasion, when police had been called out to the defendantaposs home, the noise was considered too low for the officers to do anything about.

He said the worm was “a potential threat to the bioersity and ecology of the soils in Europe”. It is thought to be spread by the potted plant trade.

He has declined promotion to the rank of Admiral for the sake of the Queen. Her Majesty was due to promote her second son ahead of his th birthday later this month. But Andrew will turn down the honour in an effort to protect his mother from the fallout over the Epstein sex trafficking scandal. The move would have been in line with a long-standing policy under which senior royals are treated asthey had stayed in the Armed Forces and are promoted to higher ranks as a result. But the Duke of York, who turns  on February , has agreed to fall on his ceremonial sword and declined to accept – at least for now – the promotion. It would have followed advancements to Rear Admiral on his th birthday and Vice Admiral when he was . A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said: “By convention, the Duke of York would be in line for military promotion on his th birthday. Following the decision by His Royal Highness to step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, the Duke of York has asked the Ministry of Defencethis promotion might be deferred until such time that His Royal Highness s to public duty.”  Last month, the Duke was pictured with the Queen for the first time since his disastrous Newsnight interview about his association with Epstein, when he joined her at church at Sandringham.

The tube was providing oxygen to a baby born with breathing problems. The terrible problems facing some families came to light as city councillors in Liverpool were briefed on issues for children suffering with asthma in the city. The shocking account emerged at Liverpool Councilaposs education and childrenaposs social care select committee last night, the Local Democracy Reporting Service reports for the Liverpool Echo. The committee was told how poor housing was one of a number of factors at play in childhood asthma - and often one of the most overlooked. Does your family live in poverty  Email webnews@mirror The account comes just weeks after the government blocked the renewal of a successful council scheme used to identy and improve poor housing in the city, and to prosecute Liverpoolaposs worst landlords. Dr Ian Sinha, paediatric respiratory registrar at Alder Hey Childrenaposs Hospital, told the committee last night that poor housing was one of a number of factors at play in childhood asthma - and often one of the most overlooked. The health prospects for children and adults suffering from asthma in Liverpool are signicantly worse than the national average. A child suffering with the condition there is  times more likely to be admitted to hospital from an asthma attack than a child in Tunbridge Wells in Kent, Dr Sinha said. He said families he spoke with who had been referred to hospital were facing problems with mould, rodent infestations and heating problems. Dr Sinha said: One mother of a young baby I spoke to said aposI know there are rats in the house because there are bite marks on the tube that gives oxygen to the baby.  There was another child whose house has floorboards missing and the child is scared because they look through the floorboards and they see mice running under the floorboards. He said pregnant women and mothers of newborn children often face an uphill battle when they complained to poor landlords about the effect poor housing conditions have on their childaposs health. External and internal air quality, obesity, the rate of smoking among pregnant mothers and a iety of other issues all influence childhood respiratory problems. All of those issues are influenced by childhood poverty, which affects more than a quarter of  Liverpoolaposs children, and Dr Sinha warned its effects on managing asthma were pervasive. Dr Sinha said: To take an example, one of the factors in managing asthma is diet. I speak to parents about the advantages of a Mediterranean diet, of cooking methods like grilling vegetables. The response from many of them is that the only method of heating food they have in their home is using a kettle.  Liverpool Councilaposs landlord licensing scheme, aimed at raising housing standards in the city by putting landlords on a register and prosecuting those who donapost comply, is set to expire in April.

I get the very best jewellery, watches and always ensure that I get a bit of winter sun in the run-up to February with a free break with one of my wealthy lovers.

I know I am not his only lover and Iaposm cool with that. Itaposs not asI am exclusive with him. Hayley was taken to Phuket in Thailand by her business man lover. He spends most of the winter travelling out to his ious retreats to check they are well run and normally bring a lover along with him for the ride, she said.

I’ve been offered £ and I can apparently visit a food bankI come back in and apply for a hardship scheme, she said. The way my assessment period works I’ve been deducted £ from my Universal Credit payment today. If they did it from the beginning of the month to the end then I could have kept £ of December’s wage and £ of January. Instead, they say I’ve been paid twice in one month so they’ve deducted £. I’m also in debt to them by nearly £ a month to pay back the loan I took out to cover January’s nursery bill. I genuinely would have been better off financially not bothering to even get the Tesco job because now she’sin nursery already they won’t pay for anything to help me.I honestly wish I didn’t apply for it but it’s too good an opportunity to pass up. It’s just so disheartening that I’m now in debt and will be struggling with money for the next month or two to the point that I might have to use a food bank in order to have a better job le for my family. I’m feeling really stressed about it and can’t believe there isn’t a better option for women with children who get stung by huge nursery bills when they start a new job. Hollie was a lecturer at Yeovil College when she became pregnant with her second daughter in . Needing help with housing for herself and two daughters, she was advised to enrol on the Universal Credit scheme. As a single parent trying to start a career, Hollie says itaposs not enough to cover nursery fees. In December , she was offered a job as Communication and Community Officer. Though happy with the thought of a new job, the increase in her working hours means that her youngest daughter will need to spend more time at nursery meaning a signicant increase in nursery fees of around £. She said: “The job would be an excellent move, my degree is in Italian, and the job sounded really interesting with lots of opportunities.

Sarah Schmid, , who currently lives in Alsace, France, has given birth to all eight of her children at home. Seven of them were aposfree-birthedapos meaning she had no medical assistance throughout pregnancy or delivery. She gave birth to her twins while standing in her living room - as her other children played around her between pushes. Mrs Schmid, who trained to be a doctor but opted to become a stay-at-home mum, has had children in a range of unusual places, including a Swedish forest and her back garden. Her twins Samuel and Sarah are now -months-old. Since she began her free birthing journey, Mrs Schmid has opted to film each of the deliveries - and has built up a YouTube following of more than ,. Mrs Schmid along with husband Tim, , are also parents to Johanna, , Jonathan, , Emanuel, nine, Elisabeth, seven, Konstantin, five, and Kiran, three.  The mum said: I was surprisingly fearless with the twins. I suspected twins when my belly got larger, and as I had monitored all my pregnancies myself, I had taught myself to feel how the baby is lying in my belly. But when I felt it, it was dferent, and it could only be explained by twins. I had always declined having ultrasounds, but as there is more risk with a multiple pregnancy, I had one, to check all was well. I had a friend who was a midwe, and at  weeks, I went to her to have it done, to confirm that I was having twins.  The birth itself only took about five hours and my husband caught both twins, Samuel and Sarah. Mrs Schmid said a photographer, a friend and her children all watched the birth. She added: I had no fear - I prepared thoroughly for a twin birth, and I felt like it was an adventure into unknown territory. I paid more attention to everything, did more research and talked to midwives, more than I would have done with a singleton. Mrs Schmid hopes that by sharing her experiences of birth, it will take away the fear for other women and instead empower mothers.  The mum says she chose to have her children in obscure locations because it brought her closer to nature and made her relax. Yet she accepts that she has received a fair share of criticism, as some believe it is irresponsible and could result in death. Mrs Schmid added: I would like to educate women, so that more will chose their mode of birth not based on fears and feelings of inferiority but based on trust, knowledge and intuition. I feel like the media promotes birth as a medical emergency where doctors are saving a baby from a screaming mother.

His replacement Osman Sow was stretchered off on Saturday. Unfortunately, it sounds like he’ll sit out the rest of the campaign as well.But it’s a sign of the quality they have in their squad that Clark and Sow can be missing and you still have a striker of the calibre of Lawrence Shankland to lead the line. vw, px\"  Sow being out leaves a great chance for youngsters like Declan Glass and Chris Mochrie to show what they can do in the No  position.It’s unfortanute for people to get injured but also a great chance for some of United’s youngsters to impress.On top of Sow’s injury, Paul McMullan, Louis Appere and Calum Butcher have been carrying injuries recently, too.This week is an ideal time to give the players a bit of a break and recharge the batteries for the run-in.The Tangerines want to get that title wrapped up as soon as possible but this breather couldn’t have been better timed.Once again, other teams weren’t really able to make up any ground on the runaway leaders – Inverness clawed one point back at home to Alloa.United are the only team that have managed any sort of consistency this season – a wee break is just what they need to get going again."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/5e3a89398efbe7.12644030-831x564.jpg ","title":"elliott happy to be utility man if it means upturn in dee fortunes","story":"New boy Christie Elliott says he’s happy to arrive as Dundee’s utility man – as long as it means the Dark Blues can get their act together in their promotion play-off push.The former Partick Thistle player takes on his old side this weekend in what’s likely to be his home debut.After last weekend’s - draw at Morton , where Elliott came off the bench in the second half, Dundee’s recent record doesn’t make pretty reading with no wins in their last five games in all competitions.They are still searching for a first victory of  as they dropped down to sixth at the weekend.For a new signing coming in, though, Elliott has the chance to make a real dference to the side’s fortunes – in whatever position the manager chooses.Elliott told the Tele: “To be fair, I’ve played a lot of positions in my career!“I’ve played mostly on the wing but, as formations change, I’ve played wing-back and at right-back.“Anywhere, left-wing, left-back, right-back, I’m happy to do a job for the team.”He added: “It was good to get my debut, get a few minutes on the pitch and, hopefully, I can help create things for the team and get the team going on a good run.“It is a massive club and when the opportunity came along I was really happy to take it.“The club deserves to be in the Premiership and,we can get a few wins in the league, we’ll be back up in the play-off mix.“It’s in our hands sowe can get a good run going we can still get where we belong, back in the Premiership.”Elliott was signed by Jackie McNamara for Partick Thistle back in  and stayed at Firhill until last summer when he headed back to his native England to play for Steven Pressley at Carlisle.Pressley’s time at Brunton Park ended in November and Elliott found action hard to come by. vw, px\"  He said: “It was hard at Carlisle, a new manager came in and changed things.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along. We did not have the new kitchen then. The hotel has always cooked the turkeys for us but cooking big pots of potatoes and vegetables was quite a job with just the gas rings. Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

Douglas and Sons of Lilliesleaf, on Christmas Eve when Graham Douglas died .The Douglas family business was started at the end of the First World War by William Douglas, who had three sons Willie, Dan and Jimmy, who on leaving school in turn all joined the family business. Through time Willie and Jimmy both retired early from the firm through ill health and when Dan retired in  the business was taken over by Williersquos son, William , and long time colleague, Bill Reid . Graham became the fourth generation Williamto work in the business after leaving school and in  took over the business when his father, Bill, retired.The Douglas family took over the building of the annual Border Union Show and Kelso Ram Sales in  and the Championship Dog Show since the first Show in , completing  years for the former and  years for the latter respectively in .It is interesting to note they succeeded Messrs. Bulman, builders Kelso who had been involved with BUAS since . To have had only two main Contractors in over  years is indicative of their skills and loyalties.Graham was very clever at school with a good practical brain and I heard from his le long friend, Andy Shortreed, that he was an expert at, among other things, technical drawing and would make all manner of things out of wood and other material.He was encouraged to study and utilise these skills while at High School in Hawick but Graham was stubborn! All he wanted to do was leave school and join his father, Bill, and be a fencer, which he duly did in .Countless number of farms and estates throughout the Borders have benefited from Grahamrsquos skill, as have the three core events at BUAS. His younger brother, Neil, was in partnership with Graham for a number of years before ing to utilising his skills with heavy plant machinery.I cannot have more regard and respect for Bill and Graham and how they nurtured me when I joined BUAS as Secretary in . I listened and I learnt from them all the ins and outs of both the Showground and preparing these massive annual Events and bringing them together in such a professional manner and with an uncanny calmness that sometimes was frustrating but one knew that come the day the target was reached. The Ram Sales have evolved over the last  years with many changes and updates and it was a pleasure working with someone who was always conscious of the huge responsibility he had to the many thousands of people, whose livelihoods were often very dependant on a good Ram Sales or a good Show, whether buying, selling, exhibiting, a Trade Stand, providing a service or a member of the public.Grahamrsquos other passion in le was his racing pigeons, which he has bred and raced for over  years - and for the last  with his friend and near neighbour in Lilliesleaf, Bob Spearman. They had many years of great fun and indeed numerous successes with their birds and it was always a great pleasure and exciting for those at the Showground when in the spring Graham would very often bring a crate of young birds when he came to work and released them as part of their early training. A master breeder even he did not understand how the young birds knew which direction was home!He had a great eye and would spend many long evenings just watching the birds to learn which would be potential race winners and which to keep as breeding stock. They had their fair share of success in UK races, whether from Edinburgh or the south coast of England but their biggest success was when one of their favourites ndash Bonnie Lad ndash finished th out , birds released from the South of France. No-one does fathom how these incredible birds find their way home and I believe these two wise owls were also baffled but enjoyed the discussion and banter over a pint or two in the local pub. Thankfully Bob Spearman is carrying on with the ldquoLilliesleaf Legends pigeon flock.Grahamrsquos greatest assets were that he was honest, thorough and reliable with great attention to detail in anything and all in which he was involved. He is survived by his we, Anne, two daughters, mother, his two brothers and his two sisters.Irreplaceable but not forgotten in Lilliesleaf, Kelso and the Borders, William Graham Douglas, his father Bill, his grandfather, Willie, and his great grandfather, William.Ron Wilson"},{"url":null,"title":"alleged-stalker-remanded-custody","story":"A -year-old man has been remanded in custody at Jedburgh Sherf Court after being accused of stalking a former partner.Vincent Cardle - who gave an address in Roxburghshire - made no plea during a private hearing and the case was continued for further examination.Bail was refused and he was remanded in custody and is due to appear in court again later this week."},{"url":null,"title":"douglas-crawford-announced-2020s-melrosian-elect","story":"LEADING as this years Melrosian-elect,is -year-old Douglas Crawford.Douglas, who is currently studying a Masters degree in Performance Psychology at the University of Edinburgh, was revealed as the new Melrosian at the annual Ex-Melrosian Burns Supper last weekend.Douglas told us: \"Im really excited, Im looking forward to the summer now.\"It was a really good night, the speakers were fantastic, last years Melrosian, Ben, spoke well.\"I had a lot of family there so it was really special to be announced.\"Douglas will join other members of his family, including his father, who have taken up the role of Melrosian in the past, which he said makes the honour \"even more special.\"He added: \"I and my family are so grateful for this opportunity.\"Im just looking forward to the festivities getting underway.\"The Corn Exchange played host to the sell-out evening on Saturday, January , celebrating the Bards birthday where guests were entertained by an outstanding lineup of speakers and entertainers.Stephen Amos gave the Immortal Memory and the Toast to the Lassies was made by Melrosian , Ben Magowan, which was matched by an excellent reply from Rev.

and embarked on a year-long campaign to eradicate dog fouling.Now, thanks to a successful bid for funding, new bins and bag dispensers have been located throughout the town.ldquoIrsquove always found the notion of dog poo smeared across our streets abhorrent, even as a small child, said community councillor Jackie Couchman.ldquoInnerleithen has a high density of dogs in a relatively small area which magnies the issue.ldquoMost dog owners are responsible and pick up, a sizeable minority do not and, it would seem, will not. I thought it was worth a concerted effort to seewe could make a dference to the state of our streets to benefit everyone. I was prepared to make a personal commitment of time and effort to this cause.The project got off ground last January when Innerleithen community councillors made the decision to try and rid the streets of dog mess.Reflecting on the actions they undertook, Jackie said: ldquoI became involved after Gordon Daly taped plastic bottles to lampposts to dispense free poo bags to those in need.\"Susan Meikle and I offered to help these from supplies Gordon had procured from the Dogs Trust.The following month, the community council was encouraged by local authority councillors to apply for funding through the Localities Area Bid Fund.ldquoThis concentrated my mind and I took it upon myself to complete the application with offers of help from both a previous applicant and The Bridge, said Jackie.ldquoWe heard our project had been shortlisted to be put to the public vote in time for our May community council meeting.But the timetable for the public voting process was disrupted by other political happenings, and after a tense wait and a flurry of activity to encourage voting, good news was delivered.Jackie added: ldquoWe heard our bid was successful in time for our July meeting.\"Various conditions had to be met before the funds could be released, including  percent of the amount applied for supplied by us, copies of our constitution and accounts.ldquoHaving won the funding, final details of ordering, delivery, installation and maintenance had to be agreed.Whilst waiting on the new bins to arrive, the community councillors did not rest on their laurels.With the help of SBC leader Shona Haslam, Jackie and Gordon stencilled anti-fouling signs on problem pavements in Innerleithen.Community councillors also mapped out locations for the new bins and Scottish Borders Council agreed to install these and remove or relocate the redundant ones.ldquoOperationally, the local authority agreed to provide the litter bags and to replenish the poo bags with us taking responsibility for funding them, added Jackie.With the bins now in place, the community council is due to meet on Monday to discuss further fundraising initiatives.The townrsquos community council, in particular, the poo-busting trio of Jackie, Gordon and Susan, have worked tirelessly this last year to combat the dog fouling issue in Innerleithen.Nevertheless, inevitable questions remain.Will they no longer witness the flattened deposit bearing the imprint of a shoe, the stressed parent quickly steering their child away from the offending brown mess, or irritated adult repeatedly scraping their foot off a kerb Probably not says Jackie, adding: ldquoWas it worth it  Yes.\"And in the shorter term it has made a dference.\"Longer term, my feeling is that it will depend on continuing effort and collective ownership of the problem. People have generally been very supportive although every post on social media has triggered lsquothey wonrsquot ever pick up commentsrsquo.\"Despite the campaign Jackie says itrsquos unlikely that everyone will become law abiding citizens and pick up after their dog, but says shersquod do it all again in an effort to keep clean the streets and grass verges of the bonnie town she resides in."},{"url":null,"title":"council-asked-declare-interest-planet","story":"CAMPAIGNERS descended on Thursdays meeting of Scottish Borders Council in a bid to convince the local authority to declare a Climate Emergency.So far  councils across Scotland have made the declaration as efforts continue to halt and reverse the damage being done to the planet.Despite the Extinction Rebellion protest outside the council headquarters at Newtown St Boswells, bosses have yet to issue any statement.Protestor Jennie Gibson said: \"The declaration is the first step to deal with the problem.\"It shows the council takes climate crisis seriously and so should we.\"It means they have to make plans to cut emissions and we can seethey do it or not.

attempted to defend their track record despite being rated amongst the worst performing in Scotland.Figures released by the Local Government Benchmarking Framework last week puts the Newtown St Boswells authority towards the bottom of the heap in most categories.With housing stock transferred over to Scottish Borders Housing Association and all cultural and leisure facilities in the hands of Live Borders, the local authoritys portfolio of responsibility has diminished over the past decade or so.But much of what remains under Scottish Borders Council control is lagging behind other authorities.As well as having the second worst roads in the country, according to the   findings, bosses at Newtown spent less than half the national average on repairs, pound, per kilometre against the Scotland-wide pound,.Although an argument can be made regarding the additional amount of carriageway in the rural Borders, similar authorities, such as Highland, Aberdeenshire, Moray and both North and East Ayrshire, all spent considerably more.Only Dumfries and Galloway, and Eilean Siar authorities spent less during  .Scottish Borders Council also spent below the national average on every aspect of education.Across Scotland the average spend per pupil in secondary education was pound,, while in the Borders it was only pound,.Primary pupil spend in Scotland was pound,, while in the Borders during   it was pound,.And pre-school spend per pupil in the Borders was only pound, against a national average of pound,.The number of sick days taken by teachers in the Borders was also worse than the national average.While spending on frontline education is well below Scottish averages, the amount spent on office-based administration and support across the whole authority during  , at seven percent of budget, was almost double the national level of four percent.Local MSP Christine Grahame believes Scottish Borders Council should re-prioritise its spending.She told us: \"I am sure Borderers will be angry at the information coming to light from this given how clearly it demonstrates the councilrsquos deeply skewed priorities for its spending.ldquoTime and time again constituents have contacted me to complain about the frankly dangerous state of some roads in the Borders and I have repeatedly raised it with SBC.\"To now find out it has the third lowest spend per kilometre on roads in the country, and that the area has the second worst A roads and B roads is an unsuprising but damning indictment of the councilrsquos priorities.ldquoWhy is this Tory-led administration spending poundm on vanity projects like the purchase of the Lowood Estate for speculative development, whilst it underspends on our schools, tourism and helping people back to work  Why does it spends so little on economic development to bring down the  percent of shops that lie empty in our town centres ldquoThere are serious questions for SBC to answer here and I for one will certainly look to see them held to account.Investment in helping people back to work was the second lowest, at . percent, of all the  authorities in Scotland.Scottish Borders Council also spent less than half the national average when it came to economic development and tourism.Across Scotland authorities averaged pound, per , population on attracting tourists and improving the local economy, in the Borders the spend was just pound,.And the figures also show that there was a higher proportion of empty town centre propertiesin the Borders than the Scottish average .Elderly care was also ranked poorly with only  percent of council services rated as good or above - the fourth worst in all Scotland - compared to a national average of  percent.Ron Sutherland, who had a successful career in corporate governance, finance and management, has been a strong critic of spending at Newtown St Boswells in recent years.The retired consultant from Innerleithen told us: \"As those who have attempted in recent times to get to the heart of topical issues, transactions and dealings will already be aware, it is often dficult to ascertain what goes on at SBC, through the barrier of smoke and mirrors around the councils Newtown St Boswells nerve centre.\"It might be thought that senior officials - of which we evidently have many - and elected members prefer to inhabit those parts of Council HQ located away from the spotlight of public scrutiny and accountability!\"However, the Local Government Benchmarking Framework provides an excellent opportunity for outsiders to gain an insight into our local authoritys performance in comparison with other councils across the country, and indeed against those with similar characteristics to SBC.\"Revelations of shortcomings in expenditure, or investment of council taxpayers money last year in several key local authority areas of responsibility such as roads, schools and education, tourism, economic and social development, etc. are unsurprising.\"There are fewany bright spots - especially worrying when SBC allocates almost twice the national average funding to administration support, doing little to dispel impressions of a top-heavy, inefficient organisation.\"This resonates with the recent eye-wateringly costly and confused SB Cares debacle - indicative of poor planning and organisational management allied to woefully inept financial control and monitoring by those senior people charged with doing just that, and paid handsomely into the bargain.For the record in the year to March , its last full year of operation, provisional accounts for SB Cares LLP disclosed a net loss of over pound. million, with net current liabilities - effectively, accumulated insolvency - in excess of pound. million - plus an audit report casting material uncertainty and signicant doubt on the organisations viability as a going concern.,params: .push\"In most peoples book, that would read like mismanagement, which would be little short of a scandal.\"Moreover, in the four years of so of employment, the CEO of SB Cares took home more than half a million pounds for his efforts and he was also employed as an executive director of SBC, in clear contravention of relevant guidelines relating to conflict of interest.\"Will anyone be held accountable \"In a statement from Scottish Borders Council, bosses attempted to highlight the amount of money spent with local suppliers and contractors was signicantly higher than the national average.But it didnt mention that only  percent of invoices were paid on time - against a national average of  percent, making it the fth worst for paying bills in the country.Rather than being disappointed SBC Chief Executive Tracey Logan prefers to look at more locally sourced surveys.She said: ldquoThese statistics are just one element of how we regularly monitor and report the performance of the council.\"Many of these figures are not new, and in some areas we believe that some of the local data we collect, for example the Scottish Borders Household Survey and those undertaken with Live Borders customers, are more representative due to the volume of responses received.\"These show much higher levels of satisfaction with services.ldquoHowever, every piece of information on our service delivery is useful, and we will use the statistics and comparison data to look at how we can continue to change, improve and invest to provide the best possible services to the residents of the Scottish Borders.Scottish Borders Council did fare well in council tax collections and support offered for looked-after children.And it has the second highest spend of any authority, at pound, per , population, on parks and outdoor spaces, with the national average being pound,.The signicant spend is down to the investment in new parks and the additional cost of staff from other departments.Council leader Shona Haslam said: \"It is abundantly clear when you look at the full range of data released that council services are under pressure across the country, with average performance falling across many areas.ldquoIn some measures this follows long periods of improvement, suggesting that we may be reaching a tipping point in how council services are being affected by the need for us all to make savings due to the gap between the funding required to maintain and improve services and that actually available.ldquoScottish Borders Council continues to make and maintain progress in some key areas, but we have to be realistic and acknowledge that services, particularly non-statutory ones, are impacted by reductions in spending.\""},{"url":null,"title":"borders-holiday-inspires-authors-debut-novel","story":"A NEW author has set his debut novel

We are a public body\".He said: \"We have looked very carefully at all the options and this site is the only viable one. If the project does not go ahead on this site, it is very dficult to see it going ahead at all.\"The proposed site is on the Gilmerton estate, south of the current museum.Councillors questioned whether a field to the west of the Scheduled Monument had also been looked at and were told that Historic Environment Scotland had said it would not allow the hangar to be built there either.The planned removal of the trees had led to a public outcry, with an online petition against it gaining more than , signatures.The Woodland Trust told the council that replanting trees would not replace some of the ancient woodland which it said would be lostthe plans were given the go ahead.And Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning convenor, pointed out that East Lothian councillors had declared a climate emergency last year.The committee was told it was likely the new trees would take  years before they equalled the positive impact the felled woodland had on the countys carbon footprint.Fellow committee member Councillor Fiona ODonnell said: \"When this council took a decision about climate change we used the word emergency, not down the line, so we cant lose  years.\"I think the loss is not a price worth paying.\"Three councillors supported the plans, which were recommended for approval by planning officers, including Provost John McMillan, who is the administrations economic development spokesperson.He said: \"I believe in the round this will be doing something for public benefit.\"His views were supported by councillors Lachlan Bruce and Katie Mackie, who pointed to the jobs benefit of the new centre and increase in tourism.Councillor Mackie said: \"One of the things I love about East Lothian is its natural heritage but the introduction of  jobs and need for people not to have to commute to Edinburgh for work is really important.\"Councillor Colin McGinn told the committee that a young boy who attended the meeting with family told him when he came in to \"save the trees\".He said: \"This is about their future. If we make a decision to cut down  trees we are doing him a disservice.\"Councillor Jeremy Findlay refused to support the planning application, saying he was not convinced all other options had been considered.He said: \"I would encourage the Museum of Flight to go back to Historic Environment Scotland and have further discussions with them.\"I am not convinced they will turn round and say no, we have not seen any evidence they will.\"A National Museums Scotland spokeswoman said: \"We are disappointed by the outcome of the East Lothian Council planning committee meeting.\"This is an important project for East Lothian. It will ensure the preservation of historically important aircraft, it will also create jobs and play a transformative role within the local tourism economy.\"We will now take stock and review our next steps.The committee rejected the planning application on the grounds it would result in the loss of  trees, to the detriment of the climate of East Lothian and the councils climate policy, by eight votes to three.Councillors who voted against were Jeremy Findlay, Sue Kempson, Fiona ODonnell, Neil Gilbert, John Williamson, Kenny McLeod, Colin McGinn and Norman Hampshire.

Strongmen wannabes like to keep critics quiet. Erdogan in Turkey, Orban in Hungary ndash like Johnson, theyrsquore big Trump buddies ndash and like Trump they want a tame press.Once the press is dealt with, then itrsquos time to start tinkering with other inconveniences which check power, like judges. Johnson has hinted that the judiciary will have a price to pay for meddling in Brexit.So buckle up for a bumpy ride, while Johnson gets Brexit done.How will the Scottish Government and the SNP deal with this  Strongmen-types also like an enemy. Thatrsquos the role Johnson wants the SNP to play.Johnson is an agent of chaos. He wins by creating drama and then letting his rivals drown amid a welter of headlines as they try to figure out what the hell is going on. He causes chaos, others step in to clean up the mess, and they take the bullet for their troubles. Just ask David Cameron and Theresa May. Or cast an eye over what remains of the Labour party.The SNP may think being pitted against Johnson is good for them, but is it also good for Scotland So far, the SNPrsquos response to Johnson has been to shout \"independence\" at every opportunity. Party managers might believe this to be a great strategy ndash that it keeps passion burning in the hearts of true believers ndash but itrsquos already getting wearying.Throughout the torture of Brexit ndash in fact, in response to almost anything that ever happens at Westminster ndash itrsquos looked to the public asall the SNP does is simply shout independence.The tactic is beginning to suffer from the law of diminishing s. The more itrsquos heard, the more meaningless it becomes. And the more itrsquos shouted, the more one wondersthe party has any other ideas.Johnson knows the public in Scotland is as tired as the public where on these islands after Brexit. The idea of more endless constitutional warfare is far from appealing. Every time the SNP shouts independence at Johnson, many voters wince at the thought of more ision. Johnson also knows that all the SNP can do is shout ndash as, like it or not, he decidesand when therersquos a referendum.If the SNP continues to endlessly shout independence when we all know there wonrsquot be a referendum any time soon then it will appear not just like a grievance machine, but weak. Even worse, the SNP will look like itrsquos playing the public for fools.Endless cries of independence will also achieve little in Scotland. The Yes and No side are polling pretty evenly. Only clever, original politicking will change minds.Nicola Sturgeon has admitted there may not be another referendum until after the next Scottish elections. Everyone  knew this was the case, but to the marchers and flag-wavers, it was betrayal. You can see why ndash they were led by the nose, the mantra of independence fed to them daily. Now they feel cheated. So, the strategy of endlessly crying independence has already caused harm within the party.To many average Yes voters, the endless calls for independence are now like background static. The SNP risks becoming boring, a one-note tune that everyone knows. In modern politics, boredom means defeat. Itrsquos not that the Yes movement is boring, we expect the Yes movement to play one instrument and play it well. But with a party, you want an orchestra.Of course, the party would say that it does much more than shout about independence. True, but impressions matter, and it seems the SNP has only one word as answer to every question.The party itself is tired. Itrsquos record in government is increasingly anaemic when it comes to big domestic issues like health and schools.Perhaps, the party thinks concentrating on independence takes the focus off poor hospitals and education  Well, maybe it would,the SNP could stick to one message on independence.Therersquos constant mixed messaging. Some take pots shots at the leadership. Others are loyal. Some fancy wildcat referendums. Others donrsquot. Some say stop marching. Others wave their Saltire. Some cosy up to online bullies. Others decry them.Then lsquoexcitementrsquo around Nicola Sturgeonrsquos much-awaited speech last week on the future of independence turns anti-climactic. It was staid, managerial. She called for patience, said therersquod be no shortcuts, and urged the party to build the case for independence.Voters would be forgiven for asking whatrsquos going on  Run the country, quit bickering, and stop leading us all on. Outside the twin bubbles of politics and the press, and the echo chamber of social media, the public cares about jobs, schools, cops on the beat, and hospitals.Sturgeon also plans a Constitutional Convention and a series of papers on independence. This work needs done, but it will also add to the narrative that all the SNP talks about is independence.And whisper it, unlikely though it is, Brexit may not usher in a new Dark Age. It might go OK. It might just be a bit awful. If the cataclysm doesnrsquot appear, what does that mean for independence The one thing which will help independence  Good government. Run this country well and No voters may slowly but surely switch to Yes.Noel Dolan, Sturgeonrsquos former senior adviser, made clear yesterday that itrsquos pointless to simply demand that Johnson grants another referendum. Dolanrsquos right. The only path to another referendum is for the SNP and Labour to cut a deal in order to get the Tories out of power. The SNP supports the next Labour government, and then Labour agrees to a second independence referendum.Itrsquoll take time, but the strategy is correct: donrsquot just talk ndash do.

Which begs the question: why in the name of Ena Sharplesrsquo hair net has it lasted for  years  What is there about the storylines and characters that continue to draw us in  How can cobbled-street dialogue seduce so deliciously Now, I hate Coronation Street. Or rather I hate myself for watching it three times a week, although I attempt to allocate it as a guilty pleasure.Yet, between you and me, Irsquove been having a think about its pulling power.Coronation Street is an education in social psychology. It makes us consider societyrsquos paradigms of the bully, the idiot, the matriarchal woman, for example.The Streetrsquos multi-layered textures enable us to flit between complexity and stupidity, which is exactly what we encounter in our everyday lives.Itrsquos a gentle intravenous injection of reality, itrsquos homeopathic medicine, a mild poison that we can gradually introduce into our system, rather like watching a weekrsquos episodes of Loose Women.Now, I like to think I can see the storylines coming a mile off, the well-worn tropes. Yet, such is the skill of the writing wersquore gradually seduced, prepared to buy into this heightened reality.In amongst tales of how car mechanic Abi can fire up a knackered engine within minutes, for example, therersquos usually a plot line of wrenching pathos, which you know will result in her heart breaking very, very soon.In soap we are taught the lesson that everything has to go wrong. Indeed, in the Street the perfect relationship is an oxymoron. In the Street crime is almost always a constant, and where there is no criminal act there is the suspicion of same, which leads to wonderful  accusations, prosecutions and often jail. Tragedy abounds.And the complex, but often daft, storylines allow us to debate moral value systems. The Ken Barlow ergent theory, for example, is all important in helping us contend with those with mixed personality traits: the boss who can be kind ndash and a monster in equal measure, the man who adores his we ndash and yet has had a series of mistresses. And he makes us evaluate the concept of the patriarchy.Meanwhile, we can hate Gary Windass because hersquos a loan-sharking thug, but we also know he suffers from PTSD, from his army stint.Context plus personal decoding equals continued interest.This hermeneutic space between comprehension and interpretation is delicious. While Kirk Sutherland is clearly a couple of dog biscuits short of a dinner, this reality is suffused cleverly by the autodidactic Roy Cropper, who will readily quote Wordsworth, or Kant. As will Mary Taylor during her soliloquies. Meanwhile, Gail Platt does little more than bleat like Bo Peeprsquos herd.And how can we not wallow in a show in which the smug and the pompous, the likes of Percy Sugden and Maurice Cole, arenrsquot found out Thatrsquos not to say Corrie always gets it right. To be honest, I wouldnrsquot careTyrone Dobbs and Fiz Brown never saw their dficult child again ndash shersquos a case for the reintroduction of orphanages. And I think the writers have created some plot stinkers, and jumped the shark all too often with the introduction of Lorraine Kelly and Status Quo.Now, you may argue other soaps should be mentioned in the mix. Itrsquos fair to say BBC Scotlands River City manages a neat balance between gratuitous Glasgow gangsterism and illicit affairing.EastEnders, however, is simply awful, full of horrid people.Emmerdale seems to be too inbred. And Hollyoaks is a  minute selfie.Anyway, soaps are like lovers: you should confine yourself to one at a time.But whatrsquos really great about Corrie is that all genders are allowed to be rotten. Wersquove had female monsters, female irritants, transsexual robbers, and they come in all shapes and colours. Coronation Street is clearly very comfy in its own skins.It also has excellent writers who can provide brilliant barbs for its ndash usually female ndash characters such as Elsie Tanner, Blanche Hunt and more recently Maureen Lipmanrsquos Evelyn Plummer.I like the description of Steve McDonald and Tracy Barlows relationship: \"Like Burton and Taylor in a terrace.\" Or Tracyrsquos passing remark: \"Mary found a downstairs hair in the tagine.\"Coronation Street works because it realises our lives are a work in progress.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”In a response to Councillor Stockan, the minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, says Orkney Islands Council is “wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.”He says minsters understand the “signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities with responsibility for ferries” and that the Government has “made clear our commitment to Orkney’s internal ferry services” with additional funding of £. million in total over the past two years.Councillor Stockan said: “I am extremely disappointed that the First Minister has chosen not to respond to our considerable concerns directly, or to meet with me to discuss an issue of fundamental importance to our community.“I can only describe the Government’s current position as irrefutable discrimination against the people of Orkney. The additional funding we received over the last two years was welcome, but fell far short of what is needed to fully fund our internal ferry service.“I call on the Government to address this when the budget is published this week — and I have asked the other parties at Holyrood to offer us their full support in securing full and fair funding for Orkney.“The running and replacement costs of Western Isles ferries are fully subsidised by the Government. It is only right and proper that we in Orkney should be treated in the same way.”In the letter, Councillor Stockan also criticises the Government for its continued failure to introduce Road Equivalent Tarf on routes linking Orkney to the Scottish Mainland.“The roll-out of RET began on West of Scotland ferry routes more than a decade ago, reducing fares for local people and visitors alike,” he added.“It is our firm belief that there is no impediment preventing RET being introduced on Orkney routes, and that any further delay is unfair and will result in signicant prejudice against local ferry users.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I already knew that the library held old copies of newspapers from previous research but I was unaware of the sheer volume of information available, and the fact that the library holds documents dating back to the early s.The open day allowed members of the public to come in, ask questions, get to know the department and find out how to use the resources to discover their family history and also the story of Ballymena‘ was like years ago’s growth as a town.The Heritage Collection will mean dferent things to dferent people. Some will have a purpose for their search, such as finding a long lost relative or tracing a map of their home area from years gone by. Others will simply visit and get lost in the vast records, pictures and resources on offer.As a bit of a history buff, I was transported back to my university and school days as Daniel Brown, the senior library assistant for the Heritage Department spoke of some of the hidden treasures within the library.He said past records of the old workhouse are available, giving an extraordinary insight into who was actually in the dreaded facility down through the years, and also into the meetings held by some of the officers.We have artefacts dating back hundreds of years. Some are very valuable to us today, such as a complete map of the original Adair estate from  as much can be learned from this. We also have lots of interesting memorabilia including war rationing books and images of the Queens visit to Ballymena after her coronation.Daniel, who has a personal interest in history, really enjoys showing people around the department, whether they be locals or from further afield.He told me: Weve had many tourists come in, especially Americans who are keen to learn more about their ancestry and research old family names. Its interesting looking back and helping people discover where they come from!You can also trace old church history through births, deaths and marriages, communion and membership rolls and even church offerings.It was down this path that I met Mary Carson and Anne McCaughey as they browsed through the pew rental records of Buckna Presbyterian Church dating back to .Both ladies are members of the Broughshane History Society and were looking through the old records searching for ious recognisable names, however their inidual interest in local and family history was not hard to see.Mary spoke about tracing her family tree and how her curiosity was fuelled by seeing two old pictures of her grandparents at her aunt’s house.She followed rthe trail to a local heritage collection where she was able to find out through old newspapers that her grandfather’s death had made front page news many years before.Her search also revealed that a family member she always believed to be her uncle actually turned out to be her cousin!Researching and delving into the past is so interesting in my opinion, and can also be rewarding, Mary told me. I have found out that Im related to, so many people I didnt know about.Anne agreed, and was full of praise for the resources available in the library. She recalled happy times of listening to older family members talk about the past but said it is often not like that today.Today the younger generation dont seem to be as interested. They are busy working on phones or listening to their earphones that they dont seem to care whats going on around them or what has went before, so they are going to have to depend on information and places like this library to trace their past.As I left them to their church history search, my eyes were drawn to the vast arrays of cases containing maps along a wall.Here there are ordnance survey maps from the s right up to the s. There are also Grfith valuation maps for Co. Antrim and Co. Londonderry as well as th century town plans and local government maps - it really is a local history lovers dream!There are far too many resources to list, but some that need a mention include the vast photograph collection from around Co. Antrim as well as multiple information packs on local schools, people and places all arranged by location and subject.Two of the special collections housed in Ballymena library is the Langford Lodge Collection and the  census for parishes in Co. Antrim.The Collection Officer for the library is Maria Diamond, who is always on hand to direct the public to what they are looking for.She was keen to point out the many online resources made available by the library, so as your search doesnt have to end when you go home!Family history and researching your ancestry has really taken off in the last few years, Maria told me.Therefore we have listed many online resources that can help people trace their history in their own time, or when the library may be closed.Maria enjoys her job, and said she has noticed an increase in the number of people using the department.We are generally a busy department, and we try to always be on hand to help guide people to their desired field of study.“We also enjoy welcoming groups and school classes to the Heritage Collection and tailor the activities to their age or field of study. We have lots of resources for children, and a wealth of information on the local area and how it was affected during major events in history, such as the two world wars or the famine. Teachers or groups just need to get in touch to arrange a visit.I was thoroughly impressed by my visit to the local studies department.Yes, I knew alot of information was available, however I was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of resources, how far back it dated and the way in which it was displayed.No matter what period you are interested in, or what local area there is sure to be some information that will aid your study.My visit to the Cultural heritage open day may have been for business, but my next visit to discover Ballymena of old will more than likely be for pleasure!

I want to be in a position to make robust decisions on key issues and I hope Casement will be one of those.”Another key decision for Minister Mallon will be on the York Street Interchange, which was specied as a commitment for the Executive in the New Deal, New Approach document.“There was a procurement process that was challenged. We now have to commence that procurement process again,” she explained.“It certainly is an issue that needs to be addressed. Anyone who travels in that part of the city will know it is hugely congested when it comes to traffic. It is also bad for emissions and the climate which is one of my priorities.“I want to try and progress that but also balance it around connecting people and doing what we can to tackle the climate emergency.“The project is stated as commitment for the Executive but it also features in the New Deal New Approach and I very much welcome that commitment is in there.“Infrastructure is central to the new document and it recogniseswe are serious about transforming lives and ensuring people have real opportunities in areas were people are really struggling then we need to be investing in infrastructure.”As for a possible Glider extending to link South and North Belfast, Nichola saidone of her priorities is “about increasing public transport and people’s access to it”.“I have asked officials for an urgent briefing to see where that is but encouraging people to use public transport and encourage people to walk and cycle are priorities for me.”After three years of no Stormont Executive, Nichola said she is under no illusions to the challenges facing her around Infrastructure, including a huge backlog of work to tackle street lighting, potholes and climate change.“The financial situation that I have inherited is extremely challenging. If you look from , there have been systemic signicant budget cuts to the department.“One of the areas which has been affected has been street lighting and it is something I am very aware of. It is on people’s front doors and gives people a sense of safety and confidence.“If we want to make a dference to people’s lives, we need to address issues like street lighting and pot holes.“I would be hopeful of working with Minister Conor Murphy in the Department for Finance to secure more money to address some of these issues.“Pot holes is a big issue across the North and mainly due to budget cuts to the department. I want to try and address it.“I think we could be doing so much more in Belfast, especially around cycling. We need to encourage and facilitate parents who want to be able to walk their children to school. It will involve safety mechanisms but it is something I want to have a big conversation about with not only my officials but people as well. It is beneficial for the climate but also for people’s physical and mental health.”Asked about many people’s negative attitudes at -hour bus lanes in the city, the Minister stressed she is keeping an open mind but called for better conversations around such controversial issues.“It is about a balancing act. It is about encouraging people to use public transport but in a way to promote local businesses as well.“I have an open-door policy here and I want to engage with everyone. When we all put our heads together, that is when you get to a better place for policies and decision-making.”As for rumours of potential water charges being introduced for residents, she was quick to spell out her position.“The SDLP is opposed to water charges and I have been very quick to say that it won’t be the case under my watch.“I also welcome the fact both the First and Deputy First Minister have come out as well to say it also. I view my role as important in helping struggling families and not to add to their burden.”On a personal level, Nichola is “excited” about her role over the next two years but stressed she will not forget about her local constituents in North Belfast who elected her to Stormont in the first place.“It’s very exciting. It is a very big department. I think a lot of people think it’s just about roads but in actual fact, the department impacts on everyone’s daily lives.“Infrastructure covers things like whether houses can be built or not which is important because we have a housing crisis and other things like waste and water.“When you turn on your water tap, how you travel to and from school and work, MOT to ensure your vehicle is safe, road gritting in winter – all fall within the Department for Infrastructure.“I haven’t forgotten I am here only because the people of North Belfast elected me. I am keen while I take up this role I don’t lose sight of that and continue to be focused also on my constituency and the service I provide.“I will still be a familiar face around North Belfast. The reason that I got into politics is to serve people who put their faith in me.“I won’t lose sight of that and I am very clear that I want to be in the constituency and welcome people to still come to me with their problems and their issues because my job is to try and help them.“I am a parent too and for all parents, it is important to balance your work and your le. I am very lucky I have a supportive family. I look forward to family time and spending time with my children is important but I will do my absolute best in this role.”As for her hopes for her two-year tenure at the helm of Infrastructure, Nichola concluded: “I really want to make the most of these two years. I understand I am coming into a position where we haven’t taken decisions for three years so there is a backlog.“There are huge financial restraints but I really want to make an impact. At the end, I want to look back and ask what did I do to improve people’s lives, better connect people, have a thriving and balanced economy and an improved climate.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"edmund rice to host an evening of light","story":"EDMUND Rice College in Glengormley are inviting the public to attend a special night to support mental health across the North Belfast community.The Evening of Light will take place at the school tonight Wednesdayat pm featuring music and reflection.Music will form a reflective and peaceful atmosphere for the evening, delivered by the Edmund Rice College School Choir, current Year  pupil Robert Hamilton and musicians Two Tempo.There will also be an opportunity to hear from two key speakers from Alpsand Mind Skills and information on their respective programs on mental health, resilience and suicide prevention.The first guest speaker, Frank Diamond is an integral part of the team at Live and Learn Alps, a not for profit organisation, working directly with communities offering support, guidance and education around mental health awareness and suicide prevention.The organisation was founded in September  and has trained upwards of , people in QPRtraining.

He has alerted the relevant authorities. The site is just yards from the St Gall’s GAC clubrooms. Belfast City Council waste bags, household fridges, cemetery headstones, construction rubble, wood and huge amounts of other waste have een dumped on to the land and the massive mound is sliding close to the Ballymurphy Stream.The land is known as Milltown Glen and is situated between Maguire’s Garage, Milltown Cemetery and the Bog Meadows.Michael Culbert of St Gall’s GAC said that the issue of land ownership needs to be claried. “There is a gateway that runs from Milltown Cemetery, a lane, and it’s that land that is being dumped on,” he said. “We want a clean environment, we care about the environment. We have all age groups at St Gall’s, from six-year-olds up and have been in this area for approximately  years. We have never seen the like of this. This is a beautul glen, you have the Bog Meadows and here it’s the epitome of fly tipping. This is going on in the heart of West Belfast and it’s not on. We need someone with responsibility to hold whoever is doing this to account for the contamination of this area. We don’t want the river polluted.“It needs to stop and it needs to be cleared up and now our local councillor Steven Corr has taken up this issue.”Ulster Wildle Nature Reserve Officer Deborah McLaughlin told the Andersonstown News that the dumping has got worse since the start of the New Year.“This is an absolute eyesore and I have contact DAERAin relation to it as a lot of the rubbish will end up in the stream,” she said. “We are concerned at the level of fly tipping going on and concerned for health and safety. DAERA are aware of the issue and at the minute we are waiting to hear back from them.”Local Sinn Féin Councillor Steven Corr said the illegal dumping is “destroying the landscape”.“What we are seeing is a localised environmental nightmare,” he went on. “We are only a few feet away from this stream being contaminated. I can’t get my head around why somebody thinks it’s ok to do this. There are lorry loads of rubbish being dumped down a riverbank, killing wildle as it goes. I’ve never seen anything like this, on this scale, in West Belfast. This is fly tipping on an industrial scale, there is industrial waste on the site, glass, headstones.

The expectations in Holy Child are as high as anywhere  in Belfast and that has continued on.”Martin said that there were many moments throughout his career at Holy Child that stand out.“Our standards in literacy and numeracy, I’m very, very proud of those. We received an exceptionally good inspection report in  where there were no areas for improvement.“I took great pride in the whole business of ‘opening up the school’, so that the children could come in earlier for breakfast club, afterschools clubs. I’ve enjoyed working with our parents and the links our school has with the local post primaries in the area.“I think I’ve improved the fabric of the building. I fought to get the new windows installed and the final jigsaw of that project will be completed next month with the new windows in the foyer. We had a new roof, new heating system.“We won the big Gaelic Raffo Cup last year which was a great achievement, our shows, our choir, I’ve always been very proud of the strong links with St Agnes’ parish.”Martin spoke of the challenges he faced as school head.“The big challenge was finance. Budgetary constraints. Also the complexities of the special educational needs that children now encounter and the school having to meet those needs, was a massive challenge – all the while not getting enough funding. The big challenge of mental health within children and the influence of social media. We were three years without an Executive, with no direction from the department and that was a challenge for the school.”While not sailing around the world or taking up golf as part of his retirement plans, Martin explained that he will still be assisting and helping other schools through advisory work with CCMS.“I’ll be onhand to tell people to basically not make the same mistakes I’ve made, we all make mistakes what about trying this, try that and don’t be worrying about that too much.“I have a photo in my office from when I was here as a child, it has always reminded me to keep my feet on the ground and that the children are the most important thing.”When it comes to not pulling into the Holy Child car park next week, Martin said it will be a time of “mixed emotions”.“I will be very sad to leave the children, to leave the staff, the staff have been brilliant, the parents have been brilliant and I will miss that. I’ve done two ‘cycles of seven’,  years but I will be in and out of the school. I’m emotionally attached to this building, I’ve been here since I was four and I’m  now. I’ve loved every minute of it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"continuity ira blamed for brexit day ferry bomb plot","story":"Police searched  vehicles in bid to find deadly device which was located in Co ArmaghExpand\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming c .ece AUTOCROP wh Belfast_Ports.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming c .ece AUTOCROP wh Belfast_Ports.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming c .ece AUTOCROP wh Belfast_Ports.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming c .ece AUTOCROP wh Belfast_Ports.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"ExpandPreviousNext\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePSNI pictured in the area of Silverwood Industrial Estate in Lurgan on Thursday.

Over the decade-and-a-half, the industrial and shipbuilding legacy that once dominated the space within the city centre has gradually been stripped away, as commercial and tourism industries shape the planning and development of Belfast.While some of the most dramatic changes over the years have been the development of the docks in the city, there have also been signicant alterations to the Cathedral Quarter, Victoria Square and the Ulster University site among others.Clare Mulholland is a professor at the Queen#s University School of Natural and Built Environment. She explained that the pace of change in such a short period of time can be traced to a number of factors including the de-industrialisation of the city and the legacy of the Troubles.Since the Good Friday Agreement and in the last  to  years there has been huge changes in the city, but obviously the urban environment particularly, she explained.The city centre has become a shared space. The best comparison for the development of Belfast would maybe best be to somewhere like Sheffield and Bristol.Ours was more pronounced though because it was people fleeing the city and living where. The urban environment of Belfast changed because of the Troubles.The regeneration of the Cathedral Quarter changed what was previously a very local area into a vibrant part of the city.What can happen with those larger scale developments is that they have great potential to act as a catalyst in the community.While bright new buildings and hotels have popped up, Professor Mulholland does strike a cautionary note about the importance of adequate connection and ensuring Belfast meets future challenges, particularly around climate change. Going forward, she believes we should have an eye on how to ensure the city is sustainable.It depends on careful city planning to make sure the infrastructure is there, she added. There has to be a focus on building a connected city. One that is accessible, particularly by walking and cycling routes.One thing which could be really exciting for Belfast is Stormont declaring a climate emergency, which creates a focus on what is good for this city.I am a big believer that Belfast could be one of the most beautul cities in the world. It is a really beautul size in terms of everything being in walking distance. It has that potential to harness.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.RegisterAlready have an account Log in  Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadGoogling the changes in Belfast as images show cityscape transformation in  yearsPaul Quinn murder: Sammy Wilson calls for Sinn Fein to do #decent thing# and sack Conor MurphyFormer Sinn Fein MLA Francie Brolly dies Deputy Mayor Cara Hunter: I#ve had to deal with months of insults, abuse and suggestive messages... but they won#t put me off doing the jobGarda want to quiz Conor Murphy over murder denial by IRA,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He said the motorway was a needless barrier for the farming community, prohibiting access from one side of the town to the other.Eugene Reidsaid farmers should be allowed to have easier access to the livestock market.William McNeillysaid he was a farmer and had been contacted by the Ulster Farmers# Union.The councillor said a farmer told him it was a nightmare to cross on to the fast lane at Teeshan.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.RegisterAlready have an account Log in  Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadGoogling the changes in Belfast as images show cityscape transformation in  yearsPaul Quinn murder: Sammy Wilson calls for Sinn Fein to do #decent thing# and sack Conor MurphyFormer Sinn Fein MLA Francie Brolly dies Deputy Mayor Cara Hunter: I#ve had to deal with months of insults, abuse and suggestive messages... but they won#t put me off doing the jobGarda want to quiz Conor Murphy over murder denial by IRA,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

With  minutes gone in the second-half Claudy led by a point. With their defence beginning to get the upper hand the momentum was turning in their favour. Then everything changed. The Claudy bench asked referee Mickey McCarron for clarication on the scoreline. The reported - to - was instantly changed on the scoreboard to the officials - to -, in the Monaghan sides favour. googletag.cmd.push The winning margin was more than the two point swing and there was ample time for the Derry men to recover but the remaining theme of the story was of uncertainty. The young Claudy players lost their focus at a critical conjuncture and by the time Matthew Marrons nd minute penalty hit the net, their grip on the cup was almost gone. After the game, Brian Rainey hailed his sides spirit and although they battled back against the odds. For the most part, it was a terric contest between two well matched teams but Claudy will always look back on this game with regret. They will ponder how the game wouldve panned out had the score not been changed during their spell of dominance. googletag.cmd.push When you have team of young lads fighting for every inch of the game, they look up at the scoreboard and they have been docked two points, it is hard for those young cubs to take, Rainey commented after the game. Still, they battled on and still they gave everything. Unfortunately, that decision, which wasnt explained - I dont know how it happened or how it came about - I am just very frustrated that something like that can affect the game in such a way. Claudy carried the underdogs tag but a ninth minute goal from Niall McGonagle gave them the perfect confidence boost. Oisin Kearns-Madden won a kick-out and it was Tiarnan OConnors high ball that found McGonagle on the edge of the square before he slotted home. Matthew Marron, who finished with -, notched two early Blayney points but it was Claudy who held the upper hand and were full value for their - to - lead after  minutes. A mark, called by referee McCarron, saw Niall Rice reply for the Monaghan men who swtly scored again after McGonagle spilled a kick-out and Joseph McMahon passed to Rice for another score. An energised Castleblayney side were level though Marron before centre-back Liam Martin put them into the lead for the first time after  minutes. However, it was Claudy who finished the half strongly. McGonagle, who played at midfield for the second quarter, floated a perfect ball to OConnor who cleverly snaked inside the Blayney cover before firing to the roof of the net, helping his side go in at the break - to - ahead. Like he did at the start of the first-half, OConnor won the breaking ball from the throw-in but Claudys move broke down. It was Blayney who hit the first two scores of the second-half, from Rice and Marron. A touch of McGonagle magic from an acute angle saw him squeeze over a point before the Monaghan men hit the net. Dylan McKenna made the catch at midfield and at the end of the move, Rice raced clear. Despite the clutches of Ben Cooke, he blasted to the net, giving goalkeeper McCormick no chance. In the next play, Claudy almost found the net and couldve had a penalty. Adam Murphy passed to Niall Barr who squared the ball for the in-rushing Keelin Hasson who was impeded by goalkeeper McCully in the goalmouth. Play continued before Claudy were awarded a free in and Hasson was replaced with a head injury. McGonagles free tied the game once again. The Dungiven man then slotted over the bar, with a hint of goal on, and Claudy were back in the lead. Or so they thought. After the score was changed, Claudy were shell-shocked and Castleblayney took full advantage. Marron slotted home a penalty, with defenders Nathan and Zachary McArdle chipping in with points. McGonagle had a close range free blocked by a wall of Blayney players and OConnor saw a late shot blocked by keeper McCully as the brave Claudy fightback came up short.

A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

The -acre estate, which includes the derelict Boom Hall, stretches across a large section of land close to the Foyle Bridge at Culmore. Appeals have been made in recent years for more to be done to preserve the famous hall which is such bad condition that the land around it has been secured off. The new company, which has charitable status, is called the Boomhall Trust. It is understood that the new companys plans are separate from other plans which have put forward to transform the Boomhall site as part of the Foyle River Gardens project. googletag.cmd.push You can find out more about the Foyle River Gardens project here -http:bit.ly uoCd Boomhall Trust chairman, Jim Sammon, said the buildings and land on the site have been unused and ‘run down for the past  years’. “A restored Boomhall Estate will be a powerful statement of optimism and confidence in the future of the region, and send the strongest signal to everyone that five decades of decay are coming to an end in the North West,” he said. Mr Sammon said the Boomhall Estate is mostly owned by Derry City and Strabane District Council which has commissioned a conservation plan for the buildings and landscape. googletag.cmd.push He said the new company is consulting with the council on the options for the site. He added that the Department of Communities has also part-funded the Boomhall Trust to undertake an archaeological investigation of the site in partnership with the archaeology department of Queens University of Belfast. “Our intention is that Boomhall will remain in public ownership and generate resources for local communities to sustain themselves for generations to come,” said Mr Sammon. “As the place where the boom across the river was broken in , Boomhall is one of the most signicant battle sites in European History. “The landscape is also home to the biggest concentration of heritage trees in the city including many magnicent oaks. “We aim to protect this unique human and natural heritage and make it accessible for everyone’s enjoyment without spoiling it with inappropriate and intrusive overdevelopment. “We are proposing that the council designate Boomhall legally as a local nature reserve. This will protect the whole estate from inappropriate new build proposals which can be accommodated on other sites in the city.” Among the trustess of the new company are Pauline Ross, founder of the Playhouse in Derry, Jim Foster, formerly a senior figure in the Londonderry Development Commission, and architect Marie Donaghy was involved in the restoration of the Guildhall. Mr Sammon said the trust is currently developing ‘appropriate proposals’ for the conservation and on-going use of both the buildings and the wider estate for the consideration of the council and local community.

However, the persuasive powers of the members and their supporters eventually began to make progress, additional money was found, designs were modied and planning approval was eventually granted.He continued: Without the passion and determination of this board of governors my work and that of others wouldnot have achieved the success it did and now Limavady can look forward to having a state-of-the-art school which meets the capacity and needs of wonderful children that are entitled to equality of opportunity to address their educational needs. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

However, the persuasive powers of the members and their supporters eventually began to make progress, additional money was found, designs were modied and planning approval was eventually granted.He continued: Without the passion and determination of this board of governors my work and that of others wouldnot have achieved the success it did and now Limavady can look forward to having a state-of-the-art school which meets the capacity and needs of wonderful children that are entitled to equality of opportunity to address their educational needs. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was good to be with family to watch it, they were all very excited and the atmosphere was good.”The south Derry man, who works as a janitor at St Anne’s Cathedral in Belfast, said he was delighted to link up with Tom Jones but that he was relieved any judges had turned their chairs.“It’s a long six seconds that you have to wait before starting. You’re thinking ‘please, just anybody’ but I was over the moon when both Tom and Olly turned.“Going into it, I thoughtI could have anyone to turn it would have been Tom, ideally. I just respect him massively for what he’s done in his career and I thought he’d have great advice.”Tom Jones was thrilled to add Jonny to his team and tweeted on Saturday night: “Every team needs a voice like @BrooksFresh! Authentic, soulful and raw! That was very special. I am over the moon Jonny is joining #TeamTom.”By opting for the Welsh star, Jonny has put himself in competition with Brooke, who linked up with Meghan Trainor, but in a previous era, the two performers’ grandads were on the same side.Jonny’s grandad Roddy Gribbin was manager of the Derry senior football team that reached the  All-Ireland Final, while Brooke’s grandad, Patsy McLarnon, was corner back on the team.The pair also starred for Newbridge club side Sean O’Leary’s in  when the team took home the Derry senior championship cup.Jonny and Brooke have clearly inherited that competitive edge from their grandfathers, and both siners are no strangers to on-field success either. Brooke collected a Derry intermediate camogie championship title in , while Jonny starred in the Newbridge side who won the Derry U B Football Championship in . googletag.cmd.push Jonny was full of praise for his fellow Oakleaf contender: “Brooke has that big, bright, bubbly personality and everyone gets on well with her. When I heard her accent I said ‘you have to be from somewhere nearby’, and when she said she was from Bellaghy I couldn’t believe it.“You get a lot of time to sit and chat and because Brooke and I had that bond of where we were from we connected almost immediately.”Each coach needs to recruit  acts to bring through to the second stage of the competition – the battle rounds – but that number will be halved before they move to the next stage.Both Tom and Meghan will be hoping to channel the competitive streak of both performers’ grandads as they move forward in the competition, but the two Co Derry natives could yet end up on the same team.Judges have an opportunity to steal one act from another coach before the competition reaches the live shows and fans will be hoping the two County Derry stars remain on their screens for a few weeks longer. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This year, Craig Holmes, who works at the Savers Store in Lisnagelvin Shopping Centre in the Waterside area of Derry, has emerged as one of the top performers in the region. The event takes place today during Appren- ticeship Weekwhich is being co-ordinated centrally by the Department for the Economy and supported by Councils, education providers and training providers across Northern Ireland.Craig first began his apprenticeship in retail with Babcock Training, one of a number of private training organisations working with Derry City and Strabane District Council to provide employment opportunities to those keen to get on the career ladder.Since then, Craig has already gained the title of Savers UK Apprentice of the Year following his participation in Council’s ‘Get Paid, Get Qualied, Get Ahead’ apprenticeship campaign. He will now face competition from apprentices across NI for the title of DfE Apprentice of the Year before a winner is announced. The Awards recognise dedication to pro- fessional development and learning, and acknowledge the efforts of those who have made a signicant contribution to their workplace.Speaking ahead of the awards, Craig said he was thrilled to have been selected among the top talent in the region. He has found the apprenticeship scheme personally rewarding, fuelling his ambitions to complete further qualications and move up within the business.“I started with assisting customers on the sales floor, handling their purchases, helping to create window and in-store displays and stock handling,” he explained. “Since then I’ve completed a level two qualication and I’m working towards a level three qualication. With an apprenticeship, you get to see everything that the job involves. I’m now at supervisor level and really enjoy having the responsibility, it’s a great place to work.“It’s been a fantastic experience and to be nominated for the Apprentice of the Year title really is the icing on the cake.”Savers Superdrug area manager, Marie Graffin, said the apprenticeship experience had been a positive one for the store, and warmly acknowledged Craig’s contribution to the business. “Craig is such an honest and hard-working young man, he’s given his all and is a real team player in the store,” she stressed. “He’s always so willing to learn and to acquire new skills to develop personally and professionally.”Tina Gillespie, skills manager with Derry City and Strabane District Council, said: “I am delighted to see Craig’s success continue, he exemplies what can be achieved through the apprenticeship programme with the right attitude and determination.“The council is working very proactively with a number of education providers, private training organisations, careers service and companies to encourage people to avail of apprenticeship opportunities that exist across the council area. The promotion of apprenticeships is a key element of the education and skills outcomes set out in the council’s Strategic Growth Plan and overseen by the Education and Skills Partnership “The partnership was established to support the education and skills ambitions outlined in the plan. Along with our partners, we are supporting employers to secure and develop the skills they need to increase productivity, and enable iniduals to find fulfilling employment and progress in today’s competitive and dynamic world of work.“I want to take this opportunity to wish Craig all the very best in the competition and in his career, I hope to see many more young people following a similar path to success through the programme.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The bypass is the single biggest road scheme ever proposed for the district.Roads officials have previously insisted that the planned scheme will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety. In addition, officials are confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates that the bypass would provide a good economic .Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Cllr Walker argued that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has missed out on signicant roads funding for decades, with many major schemes constructed in other parts of the Province.ldquoI believe the time has come for this council to demand its fair share of infrastructure funding, he declared. ldquoI have been a councillor for over  years and the bypass issue has been raised during every one of them.ldquoThe government department has now moved to a position with all its ducks in this particular scheme now in a row. The public enquiry has been completed and the only thing delaying the scheme is funding.Cllr Walker said he believed that with the Assembly restored and a local minister at the helm of the Department for Infrastructure, the council needs to seek an urgent meeting with Ms Mallon to seek the immediate release of bypass funding to not only alleviate town centre congestion in Ballynahinch, but provide a major boost for the wider South Down area, in particular, tourism.Slieve Croob councillor, Cathy Mason, described the market town as the ldquogateway to the wider South Down area through which all traffic must pass, including HGVs.ldquoThis not only frustrates drivers who are part of the through traffic, but increases tension and danger for those living, shopping and working in the town. The proposed bypass will run round the eastern periphery of the town with a grade-separated junction at the Crossgar Road, she continued.ldquoHousing is also being permitted up to the line of the planned new road and includes the potential for a park and ride site. The bypass has been proposed since the s and for decades local community and political representatives from all parties have demanded this new road.Cllr Mason said the new infrastructure minister must signal the start of work on the multi-million pound road scheme as soon as possible.She said that in , the then Infrastructure Minister Chris Hazzard announced his decision to proceed with the bypass proposal and instructed officials to continue to prioritise this scheme until completion unless instructed otherwise by a new minister. Cllr Mason continued: ldquoWith the infrastructure minister now in place following the restoration of Stormont, funding should now be signed off and construction allowed to commence as soon as possible.She said the tender process for construction should begin as soon as possible, suggesting there is no reason why construction cannot commence this time next year, with the scheme complete and open to vehicles by .Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess is also keen to see work on the bypass get underway and hopes that the new infrastructure minister will also formally sign off the scheme to upgrade the final section of the A between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden in Saintfield.ldquoThe bypass is critically important to the social and economic regeneration of not only Ballynahinch but the wider South Down area, he said.Cllr Burgess added: ldquoIn addition, the A is the main link between Downpatrick and Belfast and while there have been ious upgrades, the section between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden is simply not suitable for the huge volume of traffic which uses this busy road. Itrsquos upgrade is also a priority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Caroline.jpg","title":"Caroline’s love of Newcastle beach inspires St Patrick Centre exhibition  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE artistrsquos fascination with the townrsquos famous beach has inspired her latest exhibition.Caroline Williamson is showing over  pieces of her work throughout February at the St Patrickrsquos Centre in Downpatrick.Just opened this week, Caroline said that the exhibition is called lsquoShell Sounds from the Shorersquo.She said: ldquoOne of my fondest memories is walking down the Newcastle beach, collecting shells with my grandmother.

The ballot was ided into three sections, UK, Devolved and Local.In South Down, .% of over , young respondents said that protecting the environment was the most important UK issue, with almost % in favour of lowering the voting age to .Other key issues were tackling hate crime , welcoming refugeesand making UN Convention Rights of the Child law .Under devolved issues, .% of young people said mental health was the most important issue when compared to child poverty , ending kne crime , curriculum for leand stopping street harassment .Over , young people responded to this part of the ballot and % of responses were environmental issues mdash ranging from dealing with erosion at Ballyhornan to improving school eco-councils to introducing more recycling points.Overall, the top five biggest inidual local issues were stopping the amalgamation of St Patrickrsquos Grammar with St Maryrsquos and De La Salle High Schools in Downpatrick . Other local issues highlighted included tackling litter , mental health , drug misuseand protecting the local environment . These were followed by building a bridge between Strangford and Portaferry .The results were detailed in a report written by Cormac, who said he was ldquodelighted to have been able to recognise the dedication of young volunteers across South Down in helping their peers have their voices heard.He added: ldquoOrganising Make Your Mark for the past two years has been a challenge each time but one which I enjoy greatly and am privileged to be faced with. Itrsquos now time for politicians and decision makers to act upon the issues raised by local young people.Cormacrsquos role in seeking out the opinions of his peers was praised by Baroness Ritchie, former South Down MP.She said: ldquoCongratulations are due to Cormac for his tenacity, ingenuity, hard work, enthusiasm and attention to detail. He is an example to all of us of what a campaigner should be doing. ldquoIn many ways Cormac, you are the Greta Thunberg of South Down. You must be able to use that capacity to challenge your peers, government departments and even your teachers to improve the world we all live and recreate in.ldquoYou also need to challenge our communities to awaken and re-engage with ordinary politics in a way in which people have resonated with the problems presented by Brexit.Focusong on the local issues, Baroness Ritchie described these as ldquodominant topics that occupy young people, highlighting the need for investment of resources and the deployment of new and dferent policy directives to accommodate the challenges of the geographical area, given the myriad of problems facing our young people.Regarding the issues raised under the devolved government category, Baroness Ritchie said she wanted a copy of the findings sent to Ministers in the NI Executive and to the chairs of the relevant Assembly Committees ldquoto identy policy and spending priorities for them in the Programme for Government and Budget.Last weekrsquos event was also attended by local councillors Dermot Curran, Patrick Brown, Oonagh Hanlon and Harold McKee.Baroness Ritchie and Cllr Andrews presented the school awards to the teachers who co-ordinated the vote in their respective schools and they included Mrs Mairead Arkins ,Mrs Jackie Bogues , Miss Aine McMullanand Year  pupil Cloacutedagh Bogues who single-handedly co-ordinated the vote in her school, collected Ballynahinch Assumption Grammar Schoolrsquos award.Down High and De La Salle High schools also took part in the consultation, but representatives were unable to attend last weekrsquos event..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Destructive.jpg","title":"Destructive Natasha is too hot for Fermanagh  ","story":"DOWN Ladies made it two wins from two with a hard-fought victory over Ulster neighbours Fermanagh in Teconnaught on Sunday afternoon.Down began well, but struggled to turn lots of possession into scores, with Fermanagh getting plenty of bodies behind the ball, making it dficult for the home side to find space.Downrsquos superb work rate, defensive structure and high rate of turnovers, provided the  for a half time lead of - to -.With four of Fermanaghrsquos scores from frees, plus a missed penalty and disallowed goal by Down, clearly showed the superiority of the Mourne girls in the first half.It was Fermanagh, though, who began the second half the stronger side, keeping the majority of possession and getting back to within a point on the scoreboard.However, Down found another gear in the final quarter to power home as convincing winners on a scoreline of - to -.Many thanks to Teconnaught GAC for their superb hospitality and facilities.Also a very special mention is due to Teconnaughtrsquos Aimee Greene, who made herto county colours after a  month lay-off with a cruciate knee ligament injury.Next up is a trip to Sligo on Sunday.Down scorers: Natasha Ferris , Aoe Laverty , Anna McKee , Mary Adegbamiye , Lauren Cunningham ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C February 5%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Plans for a major four-lane carriageway through the heart of Downpatrickrsquos town centre were unveiled this week by anxious Department of Environment officials.The scheme is the result of ten years of research into the townrsquos planning and environmental future mdash a future which has now become totally dependent on a traffic plan solution.The details of the new road proposals were given at a special two-hour press briefing on Friday afternoon and Department of Environmental officials admit they are anxiously awaiting public response.The speculation that the town was to get a lsquoring roadrsquo has been quashed by the proposal mdash in fact, say officials, it was never really on the cards mdash and the new system is simply a means of distributing the traffic inside the town rather than re-routing outside the town limits.Eleven separate routes for a new road were studied and the choice narrowed down to four. The pick of those four has now been decided after years of exploratory talks and detailed investigations. Ironically, the final choice is of a route which dfers only slightly from one suggested by the  Downpatrick Area Plan.The new road will begin, effectively, from the entrance to the Meadowlands housing estate in Church Street and will run behind existing Church Street premises on a widening parallel, into the town centre.It will emerge onto the lower part of Scotch Street, across the rear of the Town Hall building and into Irish Street. Use of the present entrance to the new Irish Street car park will probably be made to swing the road through the rear of Market Street into St Patrickrsquos Avenue and on into the Ballydugan Road.KILLYLEAGH mdash A row is brewing in Killyleagh over proposals to open a pool hall in the townrsquos High Street.Angry residents in the area have drawn up a petition objecting to it being opened because they say that area has already suffered severely at the hands of vandals.Local councillor, Mr Sam Osborne, explained that  objectors had signed the petition because they were concerned that the pool hall would bring with it a sinister element.He said people in the immediate vicinity of the empty premises to be turned into a pool room were afraid to go to bed at the weekends and they fear this could escalate.Mr Osborne stressed he did not object to the idea of the pool room, he hoped it would take young people off the street, but he felt it was being sited in the wrong area of town.BALLYHORNAN mdash Plannersrsquo refusal to allow a new caravan site at Ballyhornan will have a major effect on Down Councilrsquos development programmes for the area, it was claimed this week.The claim was made by Downpatrick councillor, Mr Eddie McGrady, who said planners were wrong to issue such a decision until a general development policy had been worked out.Mr McGrady also said he could not understand why there should not be potential for a new holiday location on the Lecale coast, where a number of such locations already existed.He stressed that in the absence of an Area Plan the council should have a policy on this.A planning spokesman confirmed there would be a policy on locations for caravan development when the area plan was published.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Mrs Margaret Atkins, we of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr Humphrey Atkins, made a surprise visit to the Plessey Telecommunications factory in Ballynahinch on Tuesday morning.While her husband was at Stormont trying to thrash out the provincersquos problems in the round table talks, Mrs Atkins was having an extensive two-hour tour of the factory, under the guidance of senior Plessey officials.Mrs Atkins arrived shortly after .am and after a y talk with senior management, including Mr Harold Davies, regional director, and Mr Gerry OrsquoNeill, manager at Ballynahinch, she was shown around the factory.She met and spoke to many of the factoryrsquos -plus employees, sharing jokes and listening and enquiring about what kind of work was done.CROSSGAR mdash Sgt Matthew Cuffey, of st Crossgar Boysrsquo Brigade, has won the Northern Ireland Squad Commanderrsquos Shield at the annual squad drill finals in Omagh on Saturday.Matthew and the st Crossgar Company were representing Down Battalion at the finals, and although the squad finished third mdash three points behind hat-trick winners st Castlederg mdash there was some consolation in the squad commanderrsquos success.This very high honour for Down Battalion and indeed, has been won four times previously by Crossgar boys since the competitionrsquos inception in .Down Battalion officers were delighted at the results, and congratulations are extended to the companyrsquos captain, Mr R Dickson, and drill officers, Mr D Nesbitt, and to the boys themselves.DUNDRUM mdash The controversy over whether a section of lane way in Dundrum would remain open is almost over mdash and itrsquos now virtually certain that it will not be closed.Members of the Dundrum and District Community Committee were told of this at their monthly meeting in the Bay Inn on Tuesday night by the secretary, who read letters received from the estate agents and solicitors of the Lord Downshire Estate, who previously owned the lane.The controversy, highlighted by the Recorder last week, had flared up when local residents sensed Mr Albert Donnelly, the owner of the caravan sites on either side of the lane, which runs from Castle Hill to the junction with the Dromara Road, was preparing to close the lane.Pillars had been erected on the lane and residents were adamant gates would not be put up to block their right of way. The lane had been sold by Lord Downshirersquos estate to Mr Donnelly, but there had been some doubt whether a right of way clause had been ed.This has now been cleared up by the letters from Lord Downshirersquos estate agents and solicitors, who pointed out that the lane way had been sold but that the right of way was reserved. The letters added that they hoped this would allay the fears of villagers.The committee, however, have decided to seek legal assistance on the matter to clear it up permanently.ARDGLASS mdash Hopes are high this week that the EEC will grant aid a fish processing unit in Ardglass.Euro MP, Mr John Hume, has taken up the case in Brussels and yesterday he reported that the ECC Commission was ldquocarefully considering grant aiding the locally financed scheme.One of the biggest problems with the fishing industry at Ardglass has been the lack of fish processing facilities, despite the economic benefits from it.Mr Hume told the Recorder yesterday he was ldquofairly confident the EEC would give aid to a fish offal plant at the harbour.He has been in constant touch with local fishermen in the area and yesterday announced another major breakthrough in his battle to secure a better deal for them.In reply to a parliamentary question he tabled in Brussels, Mr Hume has been told a study of fishing industry in Northern Ireland to be undertaken.ldquoI regard this as a welcome first step and hope the study will concentrate on developing the potential of the fishing industry in Northern Ireland with a view to greater investment in its development, he said.Mr Hume is at present awaiting a reply from the European Commission on ldquothe scientic justication for its ban on barring fishermen off the Co Down coast..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Late.jpg","title":"Late points give Down huge boost  ","story":"FINGERNAILS were being bitten to the quick by worried Down fans in the main stand at Pairc Esler on Saturday night as this encounter hurtled to conclusion.The sides had been locked in a fierce battle for supremacy and with time almost up, nothing separated them at - apiece.However, Down had a sting in the tail and just when it looked asthey were heading for another draw, Barry OrsquoHagan, Jerome Johnston and Donal OrsquoHare plundered points to maintain their unbeaten start to the campaign.All Derry could manage in reply was a single point from Chris Bradley, leaving manager Rory Gallagher lots to ponder on after his side squandered a host of great scoring opportunities.Now for Division  favourites Cork away this weekend with a place in the new top tier of All-Ireland Championship very much at stake.Derry, who also fancy a place at the top table and who drew their opener with Leitrim, last weekend, opened well with Shane McGuigan taking a marvellous score in the first minute.Down responded well and Kilcoorsquos Jerome Johnston, who wasnrsquot expected to start, quickly brought the sides level.However, Derry re-established their lead with two well-taken scores from Benny Heron and Shea Downey.

Across the resort,  street lights are not working.Other district hot-spots include Ballynahinch where  street lights are currently out of order, with faults reported in Killyleagh and  brought to the government departmentrsquos attention in Castlewellan and Crossgar. In Saintfield,  faults have been reported.Elsewhere,  street lights are currently out of order in Ballygowan, with  and  faults reported in Ardglass and Killough respectively.Sixteen street lights are out of order in Dundrum with  faults reported in Drumaness. The figures for the Spa and Clough are  and nine respectively.Downpatrick area councillor, Dermot Curran, who hopes to meet with Ms Mallon to discuss the issue, said investment must be found to address the street lighting debacle.He said that repairs are generally limited to those that can be carried out by the government departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce which only consists of five full and three part time electricians.Cllr Curran described the number of street lights not working across East Down and Lecale as ldquoalarming and hopes that the money to expedite much-needed repairs will be earmarked by the new Stormont Executive.ldquoFaulty street lights represent a health and safety issue for drivers and pedestrians and there is not one area in the district which is not affected, he continued.ldquoWhile the new infrastructure minister will be inundated with requests for meetings and investment in key projects, repairing faulty street lights has to be a priority. The fact that in the local area there are  broken lights beggars belief. I have no doubt that the number will increase before the government department can begin to get to grips with this issue.Cllr Curran said street lights which are not working in areas where elderly people and indeed young families live poses a major problem.He said a fully working street lighting system provides residents with a sense of security and helps deter would-be criminals.ldquoI recognise that the new minister will have an overflowing intray and will have to work with her officials to determine the priorities in the months ahead. It is my contention that repairing faulty street lights must be one of those priorities, said Cllr Curran.ldquoThe new ministerrsquos department faces budgetary challenges, but the resources required to deliver a full street lighting repair service must be made available..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Men.jpg","title":"Men form football team to help with grief of losing baby  ","story":"THE love of football is helping men deal with the grief of losing a baby before, during or after birth.Downpatrick man Pat Moore has teamed up with personal trainer John Fegan from Rostrevor to formthe first Sands United County Down team.The team plays its first match against County Down Masters at the end of the month.Sands is a Northern Ireland charity which provides support to bereaved parents who have lost a baby either through miscarriage, stillbirth or within days or weeks of birth.Both men were helped by Sands when they lost babies before birth and admit they have struggled to deal with their own loss while supporting their partners.By coming together to play the sport they love, Pat, whorsquos better known locally as chairman of Celtic Bhoys FC, hopes that it will help him and other men find support and understanding with other menwho are going dealing with the same thing.The  year-old father of two said that he and his partner lost a much wanted baby during pregnancy nearly two years ago.ldquoOnce we knew we were going to have our first baby together, we were so happy about it and immediately began to plan for its arrival, said Pat.ldquoI expect a lot of men are the same but at the time it happened I had to step up and do all the organising while supporting my partner who was just devastated. When your partner is lying in hospital like that, all you want to do is to take the pain away but, at the same time, you have to put on a brave face for everyone involved.While the team is about football, Pat hopes that the members will be able to socialise after matches and share their experiences.Pat and seven of his friends are also fundraising for Sands by running in the Carlingford half marathon in March and the Belfast Marathon in May.He connected with John Fegan, whose family used to live in Downpatrick, on Facebook after John announced his intention to create the football team.John and his fiancee Kathryn Cole lost their first baby, Faith, at around  weeks into the pregnancy three years ago, although they are now parents to two children, Jude and Matilda.Like Pat, the  year-old knows the importance of physical activity and sport to help with mensrsquo mental health and being able to cope with the loss of baby in this way.He said: ldquoI was encouraged to do this when I realised there were other Sands football teams in Northern Ireland but none for County Down.ldquoThis is for fathers, uncles, brothers, grandfathers, cousins, whatever men who have been affected by the loss of a child.

But credit due to both Paddy and Alec for their performances against regular league players.Group four, headed up by Colin McKinty, always a dangerous competitor in competitions, but he had to contend with an equally talented player in Sean Poland, who has been in great form recently.John Campbell, another player who is in sight of a regular place in the Strangford C team and the affable Katy Rice, improving with every game she plays, completed the group.The first spot in this group was always going to be tight, but McKintyrsquos steady defence was the key factor in finishing top of this group with Poland second.Group four with Michael Carey having steered Strangford B to their third consecutive isional title, was the clear favourite to finish in first place, but would have to contend with the Drumaness No  Pat Mulholland, who has been in excellent form throughout the league campaign.Also in this five-man group were Michael Deery, team-mate Niall Houghan and Drumaness man Seamus McGivern, more at home on the snooker table, but still no stranger to the plastic ball.The games in this group were hotly contested, but in the final game of the group Mulholland and Carey would battle it out for the top place.The first game could have gone either way with Pat just edging home -.The next was equally close but, in the end, it was the Drumaness man who finished in top place with just five points the dference.The first quarter-final match was an all-Strangford clash between McKinty and McCusker.The first two games were shared, but the steady place of McCusker, mixed with well-judged attack, saw him take the next two games to progress to the semi-finals.The second match featured the Drumanessrsquo Pat Mulholland and Charlie Murray. This was easily the match of the round.Mulholland won the first two games, the next two went to Murray with a nip and tuck decider before Mulholland just edged it -. The third match of the round involved second seed Donald Campbell taking on his skipper Michael Carey.The games were all close, but the blistering attack of Campbell saw him progress in straight games. Vincey Poland had perhaps the easiest match of the round against new comer John Campbell.As expected, Poland had too much iation for his opponent and ran out a comfortable - winner.McCusker stated this competition a dark horse to a least reach the final.His opponent in the semi-finals was Donald Campbell and he started as favourite.This semi-final turned out to be the closest match of the competition. John won the first two games and looked confident to reach the final.Back came Campbell to even the score, but McCusker won the first four points of the game and held on win -, leaving Donald to reflect on a match he should have won when he held a game point in the first encounter of the match.The next match was a close affair, but Poland was always in control with Pat Mulholland delighted to have reached this stage of the competition.It was a gallant effort from the Drumaness man but, in the end, Poland booked his final place with a straight game victoryThe home crowd was pleased to see a local man in the final of the competition, but knew he needed to produce something special to beat a player of Polandrsquos stature.The games were close and John, encouraged by his supporters, did everything he could to stem the flow of winners from one of the leaguersquos best backhand exponent, but to no avail and lost in straight games.League secretary, Jim Ritchie, thanked the Strangford club for staging this event and providing refreshment throughout the evening and the competitors for their generous contribution to the charity fund.Competition referee, Peter Deeny, also acknowledged the friendly, competitive spirit in which this event was enjoyed by all participants..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/18172353.blue-sky-thinking-stormont-must-get-back-delivering-people-fermanagh/resources/images/10994709.jpg","title":"bandstand malcolm mcdowell","story":"How long have you been performing Where do you perform What is your favourite song to perform and why What has been your biggest gig to date Any funny gig rehearsal stories Who are your major influences What would be your dream gig Best moment as a musician so far What is the most unusual venue you have played What is your lsquogo-torsquo encore song Whats the best thing about performing Do you always perform solo or do you also play with a band What does  hold for you Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His second vegan recipe book, Dirty Vegan: Another Bite, was released last month alongside a tie-in BBC cookery programme.Last Friday, Matt Pritchard visited the Penarth Pier Pavilion to discuss his latest culinary enterprise and prepare a vegan dish with Mel Grfin of Grfin Books.Pritchard has not lost his mad-dash style and performative vigour. He relished his new role as he prepared for the talk: ldquoI enjoy it, man. Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great. It was just  years of mayhem.ldquoWe were getting paid to travel around the world. Getting drunk and off your head with your mates ndash thatrsquos like winning the lottery when yoursquore that age.ldquoI loved it. But then it took its toll on my mental health. Especially the drugs part of it.ldquoI needed to do something about it and thatrsquos when I started my fitness journey.ldquoWith my addictive personality, when I do something, Irsquove got to do it ndash not just dip my toes in.ldquoI started looking into veganism because a lot of endurance athletes were vegan. The more I researched it the more it started making sense to me.ldquoI love animals. Irsquove got a dog and I wouldnrsquot eat him. Whatrsquos the dference between a dog and a pig  All these things started making sense to me.ldquoAs soon as I became vegan, I felt healthier. So many people were trying to put me off it.ldquoBut on a vegan diet, I did The Decker, which is  full Iron Men in  days.ldquoNow Irsquom looking at doing the Double Decker which is  in  days. On my th birthday Irsquoll be doing  of something for  years.ldquoItrsquos another way of proving to people that veganism helps me, and that age is but a number.Pritchard became vegan in  and began to film his own cooking show on YouTube. In , the BBC aired the first series of Dirty Vegan.ldquoIf yoursquod told me  years ago that Irsquod be sitting here with you now and talking about vegan cooking books, I would I have laughed in your face, he said.Pritchard said that he was forced to leave Twitter last year because of abuse from online trolls and members of the Welsh farming community.Why were people so hostile ldquoBecause of guilt. Anger does it. Cognitive dissonance. Theyrsquore too lazy to change or they donrsquot want to believe it.ldquoBut the evidence is there. What I care about is the evidence and the animals.\"I donrsquot want to kill something that doesnrsquot want to be killed. If you eat steak, how can you say you care for all animals In his characteristic salt-of-the earth way, Pritchard hopes to entertain audiences with his new series whilst gently educating them about the benefits of vegan cooking.ldquoYou know, therersquos   arguing about Brexit. Therersquos   arguing about meat and veganism.ldquoWersquore all arguing amongst ourselves like lunatics. This show is just there for people to enjoy. ldquoTherersquos a bit of fun in it. Therersquos a lot of education.ldquoWhen it goes out on TV, I get a lot of positive messages from people saying theyrsquove cut down on meat.

Veteransrsquo choirs also provide opportunities in music to a whole new range of people.In another Westminster debate on fire risk in flats and shared housing, I raised the concerns of many constituents relating to building defects, fire safety issues and other matters. I stressed my view that companies responsible for defects in construction must take full responsibility and urgently recty them at their own cost.Some of these housing issues are devolved, and I paid tribute to work the Welsh Government has done around fire safety, with the ground-breaking law on sprinklers in , and the ban this week on using combustible cladding on high-rise buildings. We should be working on this on a UK-wide basis.I also secured my own debate on incineration of industrial and commercial waste. Irsquom supporting campaigners in the east of Cardf who oppose a planned new incinerator and have concerns over emissions and the impact of HGVs near schools and homes.With an existing incinerator near Cardf Bay, and continuing controversy over the biomass plant in Barry docks in our neighbouring constituency, this is an area of concern for many people locally. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But must also find a new UK Labour Leader who has what takes to unite, win, and ensure the UK Labour Party has a credible vision fit for the world of the s and s ndash and a Leader capable of speaking for and winning the confidence of the whole country.I was delighted to see so many talented and thoughtful colleagues putting themselves forward for election. There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
