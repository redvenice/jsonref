Wood gets a rest. He started well. Stokes’ first delivery elicits decent swing back into Warner, who manages to just access the ball in front of his pad to inside edge one. The next is edged just wide of Malan at third slip and runs away for four! A genuine edge - Warner only half-forward - he’s riding his luck a little. The next, as you’ve already read, bowls him but it’s a no-ball! Warner manages to survive the last few. An eventful over. Trite to say, but Stokes makes things happen. Warner looking shaky. FYI it’s an extended session which means drinks will be in another 17 minutes at 10.45am Brisbane-time. Stokes has been all over Warner this over, edges both sides of the bat, and then castles him with a beauty before an enormous no-ball is revealed. Warner survives!Woakes is full and Warner checks it back past him and picks up three. The conversation here is about whether Wood will be given a spell now. I’d keep him on for one more if Warner is on strike, but “short sharp bursts” seems to be the consensus. Meanwhile, Woakes continues to Marnus in a less explosive battle but a similarly even one. Labuschagne seems to have a better grasp of his off stump than he did twenty minutes ago, and he leaves well here. Woakes straightens his line (he has a midwicket) and Marnus defends again. Finally Labuschagne is given one to drive, and he obliges. it’s full outside off and he strokes it through cover for two. Wood has Warner worried here. He’s back of a length, in at the ribs, and as soon as Warner has width, he’s slashing rashly and ineffectually. A third man is brought in for a top edge, but Warner manages to get himself off strike - something he’s done a few times this innings, showing great experience. It brings Labuschagne on strike, who defends to midwicket comfortably. Good tussle between Wood and Warner here. The former is causing him discomfort - Warner is wise to stay away. Pete writes in: “On Test Match Special they have been talking about Gramsci, Marxism and hegemonic masculinity... feels like a landgrab from OBO. If they get onto Adelaide, Ryan Sidebottom and Radiohead it might become actionable.” Look I’d venture no one particularly owns conversations on Gramsci, Marxism and hegemonic masculinity, but if the dear readers of the  want to assert its own bona fides here, I’m ready to go!Root reintroduces Woakes, which concludes a very good first spell from Robinson. Woakes is on the money immediately - I’d hazard a guess he’ll be attempting to stay tight on off-bail this spell, he searched just a little too much in his first spell from this vantage point (a 36 year old man on his computer).  The over continues in much the same vein. Woakes is accurate, and Marnus is happy to defend on the front foot. Marnus considers an ill-judged run on the final delivery, indicating some nerves. Warner sends him back. Consecutive maidens. Wood is in to Warner and he’s aggressively back foot punching one uppishly and it falls just short of Stokes at a shortish cover. It was a confident shot but the ball seemed to just stop in the wicket. There’s a leg gully for Warner here, too. On comms, Simon Katich posits that the plan is to “push Warner back”, presumably to catch him half-forward when one’s pitched up. Sure enough, the next one is a bumper, the first one of the day. Warner jumps then ducks. It’s 153kmhr and Warner’s reactions give authenticity to it. He’s hopping. Warner tries to find a single in front of point. He can’t. The next one is the full and wide one, Warner flashes! But misses. That’s the plan. High octane over. A lot of energy.  Warner gets off strike early with another scurried single, which brings the scoreless Labuschagne back on strike. Robinson squares him up and a safe, thickish outside edge runs away to the boundary between third slip and gully. Slo-mo’s show a bit of chat between Robinson and Marnus, no doubt a high-brow literary exchange. Robinson is then overpitching and Labuschagne pushes it back past him for four, just beating Stokes’ e at the rope. Two boundaries in the over, but Robinson will be confident. “Dear Sam. Speaking from the damp, dark chill of Paris, it’s nice to see a bit of sun today. Yesterday was a cruel disappointment. For us snowed-in, unwashed Europeans, the first session of an Aus Test is often a turbocharged blast of forgotten wellbeing - you can feel the vitamin D seeping through your eyeballs. Yesterday, Brisbane looked as tropical as Cardiff. So I’m glad it’s back to business and my nose is peeling under my woolly hat and earmuffs again. “I have a question. I love Woakes with a fair amount of hot, moist passion (and always have) but if you have a genuine quick in Wood, why wouldn’t you give him the new, hard nut? It’s weird - and not in a good way.” G’day Robert, cheers for the note. I think it’s a case of accuracy over speed. They feel Woakes is best deployed to find the edge, which is best achieved with the new ball.Woakes is off, Wood is on. Positive from Root - thought Woakes struggled to find length so Wood gets his bow. He looks quick already. Warner nudges one in front of point for one. it brings Marnus on strike and Wood is back of a length, with a short leg in. Labuschagne is all jerky and jittery movements, which we’ve come to know. But you would be, Wood is bowling 150+ kmhr. So Robinson gets Harris, and England are off and running. Marnus is in, he’s jumpy and leaving his first while exposing a fair few stumps. He’s forward to the next and the ball screws off his bat to gully. There’s a leg gully in for Marnus, which confirms a plan. The next one is left, and the final one whistles past the off stump, which some would call a “good leave”, perhaps kindly. A great over from Ollie Robinson. Woakes’ first ball is driven handsomely by Warner past mid-off for four. It’s rare for Warner to play a shot and hold the pose, but he did here. A half-volley, searching for swing, and dealt with.  Woakes shortens his length for the next couple, and Warner sways out of the way. He’s still trying to find the right area here Woakes - a tough ask when Warner’s feet are moving well. The final one tucks him up and strikes the thigh pad. Less movement that over - a win for Warner.Robinson lumbers in the first half of the over to Warner is either too straight or too wide and are defended comfortably. He then finds his range, challenging Warner in the appropriate corridor, but Warner is able to lean on one which enables a single to mid off.  Harris, who changed his bat mid-over(?), is squared up on the last ball, but survives. Woakes beats Warner with the first ball with one that swung away quite prodigiously, then follows up with one that comes back in. Warner defends the second well and even looks for a single. Woakes is then too straight and Warner nerdles him wide of mid-on to get off strike.  Harris is on-strike - I’m not sure if this is new but he appears to have developed a little back-and-across hop-step trigger movement. It’s less prominent for the shuffle than it is for the jump. Whatever the case, he leaves the remaining few.  There seems enough movement for an edge. Can England find it? It’s Robinson at the other end and he’s beating Harris outside off immediately. Perfect length, perfect shape. Harris is inside the line of it but that’s exactly where Robinson will want to stay. The second is in the same spot - it takes the outside half of Harris’s blade, neither forward nor back. England have three slips and a gully, and Robinson beats Harris again. The Australian opener is playing down the line but this is encouraging for the Ashes debutant. The only gripe? it’s slow: high 120s at this point. It’s a maiden to finish, an excellent start for Robinson.First ball, Warner pushes it into a gap at cover and hares off, he’s home safe, Stokes shies at the stumps and it strikes Warner, but no harm done. So Warner’s busy early. It’s Harris next, and he’s on the back foot to Woakes who’s a fraction short, though the carry looks good. Woakes adjusts, pitches up, and Harris drives through cover for two. The final ball is overpitched and Harris pushes it to cover for another run.Conor writes: “Hi Sam, felt a Christmas eve-like excitement last night and decided to pull an all-nighter with my assignments and BT sport open side by side. Booked a study space in the silent study room, and was practically bouncing in my seat for the first ball. No word of a lie that I let out an expletive that came from the depths of my soul. My whole life this last three months has been one big head tilt into the offside. My hopes, dreams, eudemonic wellbeing all came undone in the space of one leg stump half volley. “how good”. Not very.” And Brendan via Twitter: “It may be a sunny warm morning perfect for batting, but England have 2 bowlers with a total of over 1100 test wickets, in their squad. That levels it up surely...oh wait.Robinson has to have a miracle innings today.” There’s a fair bit of consternation over the omissions of both Anderson and Broad. I was of the same view as Pat Cummins (why wouldn’t you be at this point?) that I expected they’d pick one. But I thought the selections were positive and proactive. We’ll soon find out if they were, and retroactively adjust our opinions accordingly.Where will the fifth Test be played? Still thinking about it. Did the Prime Minister’s intervention in favour of Hobart carry any weight? Yes it’s a prestigious Test, isn’t it? Are you happy with how CA handled the Tim Paine controversy? I respect Tim. Will you reconsider David Warner’s leadership ban? No one has raised it with us. Wherever you land in the Ashes ide, yesterday was nothing short of visceral. A day of explosion and drama, unevenly distributed. After rolling England for 147 on a green one with cloud overhead, it feels much of Australia already senses a drubbing in the offing. Of course, this is how we do things here, building then riding the wave momentum – slightly confected – feeding the stereotype of a snarling Australian unit manhandling a feeble England outfit on a dangerous Gabba wicket. All of a sudden, the omission of Anderson and Broad is conflated with a poor batting display – all of it endemic of a touring party for whom “the wheels have fallen off”. And so on. All of this before England has had a chance to bowl. Ultimately, Australia assuredly exploited some favourable conditions yesterday, and England will have its chance today. The series is essentially two sessions old, and chest-out Australians are only ever a problem or two away from trouble. All eyes will be on Woakes and Robinson, the favoured seam-up metronomes who’ll be counted on to match the unerring lines, lengths and angles of Cummins and Starc. For all the noise and pageantry yesterday, it was the relentlessness of the skipper and former vice that wrought the damage. Should Woakes and Robinson be able to do similar, with catches held, England will wrestle their way back in. No doubt Australia will be brighter and bolder with the bat, so the margins already feel small.  I’ve not done this round for a little while, so be gentle.

Photograph: iStockAbout 480,000 primary school children aged between five and 11 will be offered Covid-19 vaccines after the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) signed off on their use.The State’s vaccine advisory body recommended to Government that the vaccines – a lower dose than the jab given to adults – should be offered to this age group.Deliveries of the vaccine are expected to arrive into the State in the coming weeks with a full rollout to children due to begin in January.The vaccine for children, which is about a third of the vaccine dose given to those aged 12 and over, will be given as a two-dose schedule, three weeks apart.Niac has said children aged between five and 11 who are severely immunocompromised should be given a third dose of the vaccine at least 28 days after the second dose.It has recommended that “before vaccination parents or s should be informed of the known benefits, risks and uncertainties of Covid-19 vaccination. The decision to accept, defer or refuse vaccination for a child should be respected,” it said.The decision to offer the vaccines to this age group came as figures show a surge in Covid-19 cases among primary school children last week, despite a drop in the number of school outbreaks.There were 7,359 cases among children aged between five and 12 in the week to December 4th, an increase of 21 per cent on the 6,077 cases reported the previous week.Covid-19 cases among primary schoolchildren accounted for more than one in five new cases reported in the State during the week.However, the number of coronavirus outbreaks affecting children declined during the week. There were 38 outbreaks, including 30 in schools and eight in childcare facilities, down from 51 the previous week, comprising 45 in schools and six in childcare facilities.There were 131 new cases relating to the newly reported school outbreaks and 53 cases relating to childcare facility outbreaks. The number of cases ranged up to 18 cases in inidual schools and between two and 15 cases in inidual childcare facilities.Since the fourth wave of the pandemic began in June, there have been just over 50,000 cases among children aged between five and 12 years of age - the largest age group of unvaccinated people.Rollout planThe Health Service Executive (HSE) has for some time been preparing a plan for the rollout of the vaccines to children but had been awaiting guidance from Niac before it put the plan into operation.Niac met on Monday evening to discuss the next phase of the vaccine rollout.The Department of Health and the HSE will now work to put these updates into operation.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said that Niac had strongly recommended that the vaccines be given first to children with an underlying condition and those who are living with a younger child with complex medical needs or with an immunocompromised adult.Niac advised that these three categories should be prioritised for vaccination at the same time as others aged between 16 and 49 with underlying medical conditions.It has recommended to Government that these vaccinations should be offered to the children with the same priority as booster doses for those under the age of 40.Priority boostersThe HSE is currently offering booster and third doses to people aged 60 years and over, healthcare workers and people with weakened immune systems and underlying conditions.The rollout of the booster doses to people aged between 50 and 59 is expected to begin on Thursday.The HSE had been awaiting guidance from Niac on the first vaccine doses for children before deciding on when people aged between 40 and 49 would receive their booster jabs.Mr Donnelly said “we have seen a significant increase” in confirmed Covid-19 cases in the 5-12 year old age group.“While we know that most children will experience a very mild form of this disease if they pick it up, for a small few they may become severely ill. Extending the possibility of vaccination to this age group offers another layer of protection to our children and to those around them.”The Taoiseach said following the Niac recommendation, a comprehensive plan and information campaign will be launched by the HSE and Department of Health.More than 93 per cent of the adult population has been vaccinated with initial doses. The HSE has administered more than a million booster jabs since the start of the rollout.The national Covid-19 average last week was 718.4 cases per 100,000, the highest level it has been since last January. There were 223,933 tests carried out leading to a positivity rate of 14.7 per cent.There were 34,208 cases and most were in younger age category. Both the mean and median ages were 31. Those aged over 65 accounted for just 5 per cent of cases.Carlow had the highest rate of Covid-19 in the country (1,361.3 per 100,000), followed by Westmeath (1,019.5) and Louth (886.1). The counties with the lowest rates were Mayo (541.0) and Limerick (511.5).The National SARS-CoV-2 Wastewater Surveillance Programme (NWSP) has detected Covid-19 in all 67 sewage works around the country which are being monitored for signs of the virus.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"funding of 50m for entertainment sector to help keep doors open","story":"The €50 million fund includes €2.5 million for seasonal events such as pantomimes.

Photograph: Dara Mac Donaill  The Legislation to extend Covid-19 emergency powers passed through the Dáil on Wednesday night.The Health and Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill passed by 87 votes to 48 and will now be sent to the Seanad. The Bill provides for the extension of the emergency provisions until March 31st, 2022 with the possibility of one further extension of a maximum period of three months.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said previously the length of time of the extension was “proportionate, reasonable and given the environment we find ourselves in, necessary to protect public health”.Speaking on Wednesday, he said the Government was monitoring the Omicron variant on a daily basis but “ a medium to long term approach” in response to Covid-19 was needed.“I don’t think it works for anybody to keep going through cycle after cycle after cycle,” he said.Sinn Féin’s health spokesman David Cullinane asked that every Covid-19 regulation, made under the legislation, be laid before the Dáil at least 48 hours before they come into effect. He said democratic oversight was “really important”.“We’re talking here about emergency powers, which are very draconian and we’re talking about public health measures which have a real profound impact on people’s lives,” he said.“I have never said that public health measures are not necessary but if the Government is free, which it has done, to interpret, to nuance, public health advice and then to have a view on how it should be implemented, then surely the same right should be afforded to the Opposition.”The Waterford TD said there had been “far too many mistakes” by the Government in making and interpreting Covid-19 regulations.“I’m not going to give you, as the Minister for Health, a blank cheque to make regulations, to do what I’ve seen done in the past without any level of democratic oversight.”Mr Donnelly said sometimes the Government had to move very quickly in terms of Covid regulations and for that reason it was not practical for them to come under pre-legislative scrutiny.Labour TD Duncan Smith said there had to be a better approach than “coming back every few months to have a look at extending these pieces of legislation”. He said his party understood that painful and difficult decisions were ahead but that he hoped as 2022 approaches “we will see a more long-term legislative approach”.“This isn’t a long-term way of dealing with this, this is short-term legislation that’s being rolled over in emergency fashion,” the Dublin Fingal TD said.“At some stage Covid will be with us and it can’t be an emergency anymore, it’s just going to have to be part of how we are living our lives and our health services adapting to it.”‘One voice’Fine Gael TD Paul Kehoe said the legislation was needed as the Government had to make decisions quickly. The Wexford TD said he agreed with the Government’s approach to having “one voice”. “What has been happening over the last few months is that there has been too many voices out on Covid,” he said. “You have Nphet (National Public Health Emergency Team), the Government... It is Nphet’s job to advise the Government, it is the Government’s job to make decisions.”People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett said he wasn’t supporting the Bill and that the “incoherence and often arbitrary and sometimes directionless approach of the Government” and its handling of the pandemic was frustrating.Independent TD Carol Nolan said “we can’t stop everything, we can’t down tools and we can’t do this to people”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"q a all you need to know on getting the moderna vaccine as a booster","story":"The HSE is reported to have large supplies of Moderna due to expire next month, so that will be the main booster vaccine administered over coming weeks. Photograph: Getty ImagesPeople due to receive their Covid-19 booster vaccine in coming weeks will primarily be offered the Moderna dose at HSE vaccination centres.The HSE is reported to have large supplies of Moderna due to expire next month, so that will be the main vaccine administered over coming weeks to the over-60s, over-50s, healthcare workers and younger people in vulnerable groups – though it will be restricted to people over 30.Anecdotally there are indications some people may be reluctant to take the Moderna vaccine. This may be due to Irish stocks about to expire shortly andor confusion about its efficacy. This follows the company’s chief executive Stéphane Bancel warning last week the Moderna jab may not be as effective against Omicron as it had been with the Delta variant.The HSE has confirmed recipients will have no choice on what vaccine they are given.What type of coronavirus vaccine is the Moderna jab?It is a new kind of synthetic “mRNA vaccine” – the PfizerBioNTech vaccine is from the same stable. They provide excellent protection against severe illness and hospitalisation – and have played a critical role in reducing Covid-19 deaths since being approved. A downside, however, is that they must be stored at very cold temperatures.In a half-dozen studies published earlier this year the Moderna jab appears to be more protective over the long term than the Pfizer-BioNTech jab. Protection against symptomatic infection was 93.1 per cent for people aged 60 and above who originally received the OxfordAstraZeneca jab and 94 per cent for BioNTechPfizer recipients a fortnight after the booster shot was administered.Should people be worried about receiving a soon to be out-of-date vaccine?In short no, as they retain the ability to boost antibody production within currently approved time s – though inevitably potency wanes over time. The Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Janssen (Johnson\u0026ampJohnson) vaccines were put on the market with emergency use authorisation of up to six months.This compares with a shelf life of two to three years for most vaccines and other medicines. This is an “inevitable consequence of getting the vaccines out of the door as quickly as possible” , chief scientist at the Royal Pharmaceutical Society Gino Martini told the journal BMJ.Months later,these “emergency” expiry dates remain in force for these vaccines. For approved Covid-19 vaccines, the initial shelf lives were based on data available at the time of submission for regulatory approval.The long-term shelf life has not been extended for any of the vaccines. A shelf life extension would require supporting evidence from relevant stability studies. Vaccine manufacturers are monitoring batches of vaccines with the aim of providing a longer shelf life probably the usual two years.What about the Omicron threat?While Moderna said existing vaccines including its mRNA version will probably be less effective against the Omicron variant, most experts believe they will continue to provide significant protection against severe disease and hospitalisation. It should be stressed, however, definitive indication has yet to emerge. That will be a matter of weeks, if not days.Moderna has confirmed it is developing an Omicron-specific booster though manufacturing the new vaccine would take time. Tens of millions of doses could be available in the first quarter of 2022, but scale-up would not happen until the second quarter – provided it is shown such boosters are required.What is the latest indication on the benefits of mixing vaccines?Evidence supporting a mixing of vaccine doses has hardened over recent months. A study this week shows combining a first dose of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine with a second dose of either the Moderna or the Novavax jabs results in far higher levels of neutralising antibodies and T-cells compared with two doses of the AstraZeneca jab.This finding also has important implications for lower-income countries that have not yet completed their primary vaccination campaigns as it suggests you do not need access to mRNA vaccines – and therefore ultra-cold storage facilities – to trigger an extremely potent Covid-19 vaccine response.The study also bolsters confidence that using the Moderna vaccine as a booster dose in people who have previously received the AstraZeneca jab should result in high levels of neutralising antibodies and T-cells.It follows separate data published last week suggesting the Pfizer and Moderna booster jabs can dramatically strengthen the body’s immune defences.The National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) has decided not to recommend the Moderna booster vaccine for eligible people aged under 30 years “as a precaution”. A similar approach has been taken by authorities in France and the Scandinavian countries after early data showed a higher rate of myocarditis in young males who received Moderna compared to those who were administered Pfizer.For those aged 30 and over, Niac advises the Pfizer vaccine or a half-dose of Moderna should be administered after a six-month interval, though for operational reasons a minimum interval of five months may be used.There are early indications the infection rate is slowing down among those aged 75-79 due to the administration of boosters. Covid-19 infections have already fallen among those aged 80 and over, where booster coverage is above 80 per cent. It also describes as encouraging a decrease in the number of infections among healthcare workers.The rise rapid rise of Omicron elsewhere, which is likely to be replicated in Ireland soon, is the big new complicating factor. So all bets are off until clarity on the exact extent of that threat emerges.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"donegal town dealing with mica if it was in dublin this would already be fixed","story":"Moville, on Donegal’s Inishowen peninsula, is among the worst affected areas in the country for mica and for the students in Moville Community College, the subject is rarely far from their minds.  Video: Enda O\u0027DowdAngeline Ruddy, deputy principal of Moville Community College: ‘It’s on our children’s lips, it’s on our staff’s lips... There’s no getting away from mica’. Photograph: Enda O’DowdAt Moville Community College, everybody is talking about mica.“There’s not an English essay that’s passed to a teacher that doesn’t have a mention of mica in it somewhere... and every time you mention humanitarian issues it’s the first thing to the forefront,” says deputy principal Angeline Ruddy.“It’s on our children’s lips, it’s on our staff’s lips,” she says. “There’s no escaping it. There’s no getting away from mica.”The presence of the mineral in construction blocks – which makes them crack and eventually crumble – has caused structural damage to an estimated 7,500 homes in counties Donegal and Mayo, as well as smaller numbers in other counties.Mica has impacted the entire community, says principal Anthony Doogan, and the school community is no different.At Moville Community College approximately 20 per cent of staff and 25 per cent of pupils – about 20 staff and 100 families – are living in “mica homes” even more have siblings and parents who are affected.“I have five siblings, and four of them are affected by mica,” says Ruddy. The one who isn’t lives in the US.“Where I live, in a half mile radius, 20 houses are affected. It’s everywhere we go.”Her children “know nothing else but a mica household” as they go about their daily routine, mica is “like an app running in the background for every one of us.“‘Is the house safe tonight?’ is a regular question my children will ask,” she says. “I have cracks that are now the width of a two-euro coin, which means my gable is starting to move away from the wall of my house. I don’t know, really, if we are safe any longer.”Others tell a similar story. Special needs assistant Barry Moore’s home is crumbling his daughter was riding her bike around the house when “a lump of plaster fell off... it was near enough to scare her, and me.”“You’re lying at home at night and you hear the walls moving. It’s scary, to think you’re living in a place that is meant to be your safe place and you’re hearing the walls cracking.”Five of the special needs assistants – nearly half of the special needs staff – have mica homes, and so do some of the students they support. A hoist used by one child is attached to a crumbling mica wall, while foster parents have bought two mobile homes to house their children with complex needs.“They need routine, they need to know what happening... they’re going to be moved into two mobile homes behind their house and watch their house getting knocked down,” says Moore.In school, he says, you can “see the children who have mica, or whose houses have mica. They are, like their parents probably are, nearly obsessed with the fact they have mica.“As staff you’re trying to accommodate and support children... but they’re going home to houses that aren’t safe and that are causing them grief and stress.”Guidance counsellor Sineád McCarron’s home also has mica she warns of “what’s coming down the line... this is just going to explode, really, in terms of the amount of support the students need.”As principal, Doogan has significant concerns about the physical and mental health of students and staff – not least through heightened levels of anxiety – and about the impact on students’ attendance and life chances the effects, he estimates, will persist for the next five to 10 years.The anxiety of students and parents “is having an impact on their work rate and their effectiveness at their studies at school,” he says.“Every secondary school in the country”, he emphasises, has seen the effects of Covid “We’re at the beginning of this cycle for mica and in two years’ time, when there’s a large number of houses in this community which need to be demolished and rebuilt, there will be severe anxiety and perhaps worse felt by a lot of our students.”There is also “clear evidence” of an increase in absenteeism due to illness – “they’re living in draughty rooms, the rooms are colder, the rooms are causing them health issues that they wouldn’t ordinarily have” as well as students from mica homes who have left school altogether.Brother and sister Shaun and Aoife Noone describe how their home is “falling down”: “If I put my hand in the wall I could just pull away some of the side of the house,” says 17-year-old Shaun.They have moved out so that their home can be demolished and rebuilt. “I don’t really have a study room so that’s affecting my study, because I’m doing my Leaving Cert now, and it’s harder to focus and settle down and get work done,” he says.“I feel disadvantaged, it’s unfair that most people would stress or be anxious about exams but I’ve got the pressure of my house on top of that, so it’s a bit hard on the mind as well.”Aaron Price (13) and his family have also moved out. “It was a lot to handle trying to go to school and do homework and trying to empty the house.”The Government this week announced a €2.2 billion scheme to rebuild mica homes in Donegal and Mayo, capped at €420,000 per home and with a sliding scale of rebuilding costs from €145 per sq ft for the first 1,000 sq ft to €110 for the next 1,000 and €100 thereafter.It has been criticised by the mica campaigners in Donegal as falling short. “Apparently a new scheme was decided but it’s stupid, apparently each square metre gets less money, that doesn’t make sense,” says Aaron.“We need 100 per cent, and I know we probably will never get that, but if it was in Dublin, this would already be fixed.“It’s not our fault, we spent a lot of money on building our house... why should we have to spend more and more money rebuilding our house?”The adults have done the figures each of those spoken to by The  is facing a shortfall of between €60,000 to €80,000. “If council houses are being built at the minute they are built on a rate of €150 a square metre,” says Moore. “What was being offered would work out essentially for our house at €127 a square metre, which would leave us paying €65,000 on top of what we would get.“My other half is a psychiatric nurse, we’re no millionaires, we’re working-class people and we live in an average size house in Donegal which is the average in the country for a one-off build, 2,500 sq ft.“If they had dropped the sliding scale part... 145 euro per square foot, that’s it, and then your rent and then your storage, I would say 90 per cent of people would have been happy and celebrating, but they put in a scale that doesn’t exist in any builder’s pricing.”“The cost to me right now is €79,000, and that’s just for the build,” says Ruddy. “My house is 2,600 sq ft... that gives a total of €315,000 of a grant. The builders have come back to me with €395,000.“I can’t borrow because I have a mica home... 100 per cent redress is so far from it, I don’t think I’m even getting 80 per cent redress.“My children are at the stage where I should be starting to save for their college. Am I going to build their house and deprive them of education? We’re facing these choices.”“People bought the material in good faith... yet they are being victimised to the extent of having to spend 40, 50, 60, €80,000, whereas other areas were given 100 per cent redress,” says Doogan.For him, it is about the value placed on people from this area, not least given that the school itself is still “nowhere near completion” 20 years after it opened. “We bailed out the banks for €64 billion, and they’re saying three or four billion is a huge amount of money, but it’s less than five per cent of what we gave to the banks.“The people up here paid their taxes to pay for the bank bailout, and people here, like me, paid their taxes to pay for the pyrite redress in Dublin and Leinster. People round here are saying, ‘is there a different law for us?’”McCarron, too, is clear: “How can we help people look after their wellbeing and instil value systems of fair justice when our own Government continues to let this happen?”“They’ve let us down,” says 15-year-old Aoife. “If this was happening in Dublin, I feel it would be a different story, because we’re that far away and we’re rural they say ‘ah, them Donegal ones, they live in big mansions, they can afford it’. We can’t. We need our houses fixed.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shares likes retweets twitter reveals irish obsessions in 2021","story":"The most liked tweet from an Irish account came from the Garda, with the nation responding with delight as members of the force stepped up and performed the Jerusalema Challenge.Twitter has released its most shared, liked and talked about topics for the year just past, with Covid rarely far from our minds and Joe Biden apparently closer to our hearts.While one US president was kicked off Twitter in early 2021, another one was proving quite the draw with Irish users, with a tweet from President Biden proclaiming his inauguration to be “a new day in America” the most liked of the year.The most liked tweet from an Irish account came from the Garda, with the nation responding with delight as members of the force stepped up and performed the Jerusalema Challenge in response to a gauntlet laid down by the Swiss guards.Manchester United has a pretty busy Twitter account at the best of times, but at the very best of times, in August, interaction reached a whole new level as it announced the re-signing of Cristiano Ronaldo with the simplest of tweets. “Welcome home” was all it took to become the most retweeted sporting moment of 2021.Closer to home, the most popular tweet with an Irish angle was from Irish gymnast Rhys McLeneghan. “My head is held higher than ever. At this early stage in my career I can call myself an Olympic finalist. It feels like the beginning of something special,” he said.While the athlete’s tweet was full of joy, one full of sadness also connected with Irish users, who shared Jimmy Carr’s grief at the loss of his friend and fellow comedian Sean Lock in huge numbers.Another widely shared tweet came from Twitter itself as it poked fun at other social media companies – the ones owned by Facebook – when they went offline for hours.The announcement that Chapters Bookshop in Dublin was closing also stuck a chord.Mica-affected homeownersUnsurprisingly, Covid-19 topped the list as the most used news hashtag on Irish Twitter during 2021, followed by a hashtag related to the Mica redress scheme and the struggles of mica-affected homeowners.In international news, sport dominated the stories and topics on Irish Twitter in 2021, with the comings and goings and ups and downs at Manchester United seeing #mufc top the list. For the first time, #bitcoin entered the top of the list as one of the most discussed international topics this year.For the third year in a row, Love Island tops the list for the most talked about entertainment moment on Irish Twitter, followed by Eurovision. The bent coppers of In The Line of Duty fared well as did the Late Late Show.Over the course of the year, the five most talked about movies on Irish Twitter were Zack Snyder’s Justice League in top spot, followed by Spider-Man: No Way Home, even before it sees its official release here, while The Suicide Squad, Black Widow and Dune finished in the minor places.Irish Twitter likes to talk about its favourite sports stars too. When it comes to female sporting heroes, Katie Taylor was the most discussed, followed by Emma Raducanu and Naomi Osaka in second and third place.The men’s list was dominated by men’s football with Marcus Rashford on top followed by Paris Saint-Germain’s Lionel Messi and Manchester United’s Paul Pogba.While Garth Brooks trended in Ireland in recent weeks, he just missed out on making it into this year’s list of Irish Twitter’s most talked about musicians. Continuing their global dominance, BTS had the most discussed music handle in Ireland, with Taylor Swift second on the Irish Twitter list followed by Louis Tomlinson.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"storm barra i m at a loss to understand why schools in dublin were closed","story":"Marino College in Fairview, one of the schools closed in Dublin, due to Storm Barra. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe Department of Education decided to close schools in several counties over the last two days due to the threat posed by Storm Barra.We asked readers for their views on whether the decision was justified and how it affected them.This is an edited selection of your responses.‘Another example of the contempt that this Government treats parents with’Claire Walsh DublinThe late-night decision by the Department of Education to close schools in Dublin today is just another example of the contempt that this Government treats parents with. Much like the last-minute mask decision fiasco the Government takes no consideration of parents ability to choose what might be best for their children or give parents time to deal with the fallout from the decisions. I would hope that in future they could consider parents in their late-night decision making.‘Does the Department of Education have any cop-on at all?’Kieran O’Hare DublinA ham-fisted, behind-covering, one-size-fits-all decision that has greatly inconvenienced parents and deprived children of yet another day’s valuable learning. It was nothing more than a very windy day in south central Dublin on Tuesday. It was even less inclement on Wednesday. Does the Department of Education have any cop-on at all? Why not delegate the decision to school principals. They are on the ground and best placed to make a call on local conditions. What will prompt the next enforced closure? The wrong type of wind?‘This is just not acceptable’Shirley Dunne GalwayIn Galway city, Tuesday was a bit breezy Wednesday was calm and the sun was shining. There is absolutely no reason why schools in Galway city should have closed. We will have a long winter, and negative implications on our children’s education, if schools close every time there is an orange weather alert. We are both trying to work from home whilst our children are home from school, and the school did not roll out any online learning or send home any materials for the children to work on. This is just not acceptable, or sustainable long-term.I am a third-year student in NUI Galway doing exams. They were planned to be on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday but due to the college closure the Tuesday and Wednesday exams were postponed to Saturday and Sunday. This creates a very stressful period as they have been placed in the middle of other exams. I now have four exams in a row from Friday to Monday, also with exams on the following Wednesday and Thursday. Six exams in seven days is not ideal. Both Tuesday and Wednesday did not display any strong winds that would prevent such exams taking place. This is not the type of pressure my course colleagues and I want in the run up to Christmas.‘I’ve no back-up. The pandemic has taken away all my unpaid supports’S Riordan CorkI’m a separated mother of two small children working a four-day week. Working from home (WFH) has its benefits and generally I work a hybrid model mostly. However, when the preschools \u0026amp schools are closed and I’ve no back-up, I’m actually parenting from work at my kitchen table rather than working from home. And I have no back-up. The pandemic has taken away all my unpaid supports – mainly my elderly parents – and the housing crisis, resulting in ever increasing rents, keeps pushing me further and further away from the city where my friends and family live. I do not live long enough in one place to make lasting friendships with neighbours that I could approach for help. My childminder is wonderful, but I pay her €70full day when I earn €95 net. I borrow to work the school summer holidays, I cannot afford any unplanned or unexpected curveballs like these last two days of red weather alerts and school closures. And with end-of-year deadlines, calling in sick is not an option. My workload would only be waiting for my return. Furthermore, I worry about the lasting developmental damage this frequent ‘WFH’ is forcing upon my young children. Both have been sick a lot lately and I cannot send them to school with even a snivel anymore. When they are sick I can no longer take time off to mind them because I am now able to ‘WFH’. So the frequency of this scenario of me at the kitchen table on the laptop ignoring them has increased.When there are two parents, they can help one another, give each other a break. I on the other hand, cannot even go to the shop for milk without packing us all out the door! Lets not forget that we’ve had long runs of school closures in the very recent past in this pandemic. And, in isolation these two days of red weather alerts and school closures would be manageable. However, within the context of this pandemic, a housing crisis and only the beginning of a long winter, it feels like the last straw.‘At 11pm we got the email the creche would close’Mrunal Kotkunde Dublin 16I was okay and scheduled all meetings to next day as I have toddler at home and it was difficult to work with him around. On Tuesday, weather was not bad in Dublin 16 and I thought the decision to close schools and crèches were uncalled for. They should have access the severity and took the decision only on affected areas and not generalised the decision. We got an email from the creche that on Wednesday it would be be open but at 11pm at night got the email that it was closed due to Government decision. Weather was not bad at all, as I have seen much worse weather than these two days. Has the crèche refunded us two days’ fees?We have already had enough stress due to Covid-19.‘Probably the right decision at the time’Kevin Connolly CorkIn our area of east Cork, the storm, thankfully, didn’t hit us as hard as other parts of the county or other counties. The decision to close the schools for the second day proved to be unnecessary in our part of the county, but it was probably the right decision at the time, and was no doubt influenced by poorer conditions in the west of the county. The decision was made in good time, 5.30pm and it was flagged for a few hours before the official decision was made.There was strong wind here for a couple of days. Nothing to worry about, yet two children home from school. Complete nonsense. Children packed into Mcdonald’s yesterday, and packed into indoor play centre today. It was NOT dangerous to go out. Stupid decision.I’m astounded at why the schools were closed when they have had ample opportunity over the past two years to operate online. It reinforces that those accountable for education in our country are not of a proactive or progressive mindset and take the easy option. Very disappointing.‘Conditions were not dangerous’Dermot Maguire DublinI am at a loss to understand why the schools in Dublin were closed. Conditions were not dangerous, it was indeed cold, wet and miserable, but it was also the same in December when I went to school 35 years ago. However, we just went to school and got on with it. Children have missed more school over the past two years due to the pandemic, on top of already the ridiculous amount of holidays for teachers, course days, etc. Of course, the decision to close schools was the one decision over the past number of years that the teacher unions accepted without question. I fear for the education of our children and their mental health.I had not been advised by the preschool so on Tuesday I turned up to it and realised it was closed. I had hectic days trying to do basic things as I live alone with a toddler. The school closures have disrupted my days but finally it’s over.‘These decisions should be taken lightly’John Lalor DublinThe weather didn’t seem severe enough to justify the closure, in Dublin at least. Children have missed some much school time with Covid closures that these decisions should not be taken lightly. Additionally, most working parents had to take two days’ annual leave or lose two days’ pay to mind their kids at short notice. Obviously this isn’t the case in the Department of Education but decision-makers should be mindful of the impact on private sector workers.‘I don’t get this need to blame schools for the weather’Anne Cassidy DublinI would not have sent my kids on Wednesday even if the Government had not closed schools. The weather warning finished at 7am. We leave the house at that time so I had already decided to do the safest thing for my children and work from home. I don’t get this need to blame schools for the weather or the Government and I’m happy to blame the Government for a lot. I’m not sure sure I’d want to be a principal having to deal with that last night, but as a parent kids’ safety overrides my inconvenience. Even if in your particular area it seemed fine we all travel to work think how much more dangerous it would have been with school traffic and fallen branches.‘Is this to be the new norm?’Paul Richardson BrayIreland is an island. Consequently, the weather is regularly wet and windy. In Bray today it is merely breezy and a status yellow warning has been applied. But somehow the local environs are deemed unsafe for school commutes. If navigating your way past fallen leaves and the occasional puddle is challenging, then the decision to close schools for a second day was indeed a wise one. If on the other hand, you consider the inclement weather to be a regular feature of life in this country, then the school closures are perplexing to say the least. Is this to be the new norm – school closures on the basis of oft-cited, but rarely challenged, health and safety concerns?‘We don’t have a family to help in Ireland’Jonas Rall DublinIn Dún Laoghaire, Dublin, the storm was mild, with only leaves and bins being affected. My son, that is two years old, goes to a creche that closed Tuesday and Wednesday, with such short notice that I couldn’t make any arrangements. We don’t have a family to help in Ireland. This put massive stress over my partner and me to take the day off on Tuesday, move meetings and customers to the following days, only to be warned at 11pm on Tuesday that Wednesday would also have the creche closed. I found it unfair as I can see that the storm is not affecting my region, and I pay a hefty amount to the creche to help me take care of him so we can work. Moreover, it was clear in the note that the orange warning was only up to 7 am, with the first employees arriving close to 8.30am, they could definitely work on Wednesday. I’m mad and just hoping they can open on ThursdayFriday without any new surprise.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics fresh restrictions breed frustration","story":"We assess the political fallout from the decisions taken over the past few weeks to introduce new Covid-19 restrictions covering international travel, masking children in primary school and the hospitality sector.

Photograph: iStock And then there was the day Micheál Martin compared Sinn Féin to the long dead British comedian, Tommy Cooper. But the Taoiseach, out of the blue, treated the Dáil to a blast of good old Tommy’s famous catchphrase: “Just like that!” Not once, but three times. Unfortunately, he couldn’t do justice to the celebrated entertainer – Micheál’s delivery went down like a lead balloon while his allusion soared over most of the Shinner heads across the floor. It is well known that Micheál fancies himself as a bit of a mimic. His attempt at a Chinese accent during a tech industry event a decade ago was so well received he had to issue an apology afterwards. But on Wednesday, he chickened out of doing a proper impression of the butter-fingered magician and comedy master. Where was the bumbling, mumbling voice? He barely attempted the famous hand actions. This came as a crushing disappointment to Micheál’s older listeners, the only ones who knew who he was banging on about. Obviously, it would have been too much to expect the Taoiseach to conduct Leaders’ Questions wearing Cooper’s trademark red fez on his head, but by summoning the spirit of the great entertainer he created a mental image some of us can never erase.Tommy died 37 years ago during a live television performance. Were he alive today he would be 100 years old. The youthful political correspondents were stumped. By the look of the slack-jawed Shinners staring back blankly at the Taoiseach, they hadn’t a clue what he was on about either. Blind-sided by the zeitgeist.Housing niggle-festThe comedian, hugely popular in the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s, bizarrely made his posthumous debut on the Dáil record during a routine housing niggle-fest between Micheál and Sinn Féin president, Mary Lou McDonald. Yet again, she lambasted his “failing” Coalition’s “failing” housing policy which is heading towards “serious catastrophe”. For any government with “an ounce of cop-on, alarm bells would be ringing very loudly. Instead, we get deafening silence, heads stuck in the sand, no urgency to respond, no forward-thinking, and, frankly, no common sense.”Yet again, he lambasted Sinn Féin for voting against housing proposals at local level 5,000 of them in Dublin including 853 social, affordable and cost-rental homes at the Oscar Traynor Road site. “I see a lot of sloganeering, sound bites and nice catchy phrases, but I don’t see real substance from a policy perspective.”Whatever he proposes, it is never enough for Mary Lou and Sinn Féin. When his Government says it can realistically provide up to 12,000 affordable houses next year, 10,000 of which will be directly built through local authorities or approved housing bodies, Sinn Féin has a stock response.“You just come along and say ‘Aah, we think that should be 20,000’.”For some odd reason, Micheál resorted to the days of old-fashioned variety shows to explain his point. “Like Tommy Cooper long ago: ‘Just like that’. You know?”He threw out one hand, but it was nothing to match the shoulders hunched, arms half-extended, palms-down shuffle that Tommy used to do. But the show must go on. “Just like that! We’ll make it 20,000,” he exclaimed in a strange hybrid of Cooper meets Cork. Mary Lou didn’t even look at him.“If the Minister says 4,000 in respect of affordable housing – just like that! – we’ll make it 8,000, Sinn Féin will say.” The Taoiseach plucked something imaginary from the air, perhaps a hard-boiled egg from behind young Jack Chambers’s ear. As for the youthful chief whip, sitting behind his boss? Not a breeze.No, concluded Micheál of Sinn Féin’s “threadbare” housing policy. “No substance behind it. It’s just empty rhetoric, as far as I can see.”As usual, the exchanges descended into a shouting match. “Could we all make a Christmas resolution to behave with a bit of decorum, please?” pleaded the Ceann Comhairle, and him still recovering from the Covid. Leaders’ questions moved on. To the Covid, not surprisingly.Booster confusionCatherine Murphy of the Social Democrats brought up the confusion in the booster vaccination campaign. Many people were annoyed when the Taoiseach complained in the Dáil on Tuesday about people not turning up for their appointments. Catherine Murphy pointed out, not unreasonably, that they feel he was unfairly blaming them for the situation when the truth is that the booking system is all over the place. What had the Taoiseach to say about this?“Last night I slept like a log. I woke up in the fireplace.”“I sleep like a baby. Every morning I wake up screaming around 2 o’clock.”“I worry that as soon as I get into bed I drop off. I better order a bigger bed.” Sorry. That wasn’t Micheál’s reply. That’s a bit of Tommy Cooper. Blame the Taoiseach for sending us to look up some of his old gags. Where the Government’s handling of the pandemic response is concerned, the Opposition’s watchword has always mirrored another one of Tommy’s famous catchphrases. “Not like that, Taoiseach. Like that.”Mattie McGrath returned to active service after a few months’ absence with his views on the “draconian powers” adopted by Government during the pandemic unchanged. He still believes the requirement to produce digital passes to gain access to certain services and events is a form of “medical apartheid”. Independent Catherine Connolly was also concerned about the renewed temporary Covid laws infringing on civil liberties. The Taoiseach put up a strong, if weary, defence.Protecting livesA government needs to be “nimble” about introducing legislation to protect lives during a pandemic, he told Mattie. “It’s not the kind of legislation any government wants to bring in. Why would we want to bring in legislation that restricts normal life? There’s no joy in doing that.” As any politician knows “it’s not the most popular thing in the world to be restricting people’s personal liberties and freedom”. Likewise to Catherine Murphy: People are fed up with the pandemic. The restrictions are weighing heavy on people. Younger people are particularly fed up. “But those in the engine room have to keep going to help people. I say again, what is the most fundamental human right of all? It’s to protect life and limb.” Meanwhile, the hip young things of the Fianna Fáil Comms team were busy on social media with their leader’s finger-on-the pulse reference to the late Tommy Cooper. They quickly posted clips from his Dáil performance on Twitter and YouTube (labelled as a “Must Watch”). Micheál must be delighted. We hear he was boasting that not only is he up on the Tweet machine and the Tube, but that he is probably up on Snaptoc, facetic and the InstantGran too.Just like that."},{"url":null,"title":"the pandemic has taught eu to play hardball on trade","story":"European internal market commissioner Thierry Breton, centre, in Brussels, Belgium. Photograph: Olivier MatthysPoolEPAThe European Commission has responded to trade threats by producing its own big stick. Under proposals laid out this week, the European Union could swiftly retaliate against foreign governments that attempt to use “economic coercion”.An EU official said the measures would address “the weaponisation of trade and investment links ... at a time when we see geopolitical tensions increasingly spilling over into these trade and economic relations”.“The instrument is there to fend off any third country from pressuring the EU or its member states in a way that would seek to interfere with our domestic affairs,” the official said. Counter-measures could include freezing governments out of contracts, exclusions from research funding and controls on imports.Officials have been careful not to name any particular country or situation. The tool, which requires the approval of EU governments, was requested by the European Parliament and has been under development for some time.But observers don’t need to look far for a potential example. Lithuania – population 2.8 million – has found itself squeezed by China after it accepted an offer by Taiwan to set up a diplomatic office.The step is somewhat characteristic of the plucky pose of Lithuania towards autocrats in recent years. It’s currently host to the exiled opposition of neighbouring Belarus, and previously quit the “17+1” Chinese outreach effort to central and eastern European states after losing patience with elusive economic rewards and expectations to laud Beijing.The Chinese Communist Party views Taiwan as a breakaway province, and reacted with typical vehemence to a step nodding towards its autonomy. An editorial in the state Global Times described it as an act of “wanton provocation” that interfered with “China’s internal affairs”, and Beijing downgraded its diplomatic presence in Vilnius.Locked outLithuanian exporters then found themselves effectively blocked from sending goods to China, according to the Lithuanian government. It appealed for help from the EU this week, complaining that it had been deleted from China’s customs system, leaving companies unable to select “Lithuania” for customs clearance.Internal markets commissioner Thierry Breton told The : “We need to defend ourselves in this new world.”“We have some countries which are using supply chains as a geopolitical tool to pressure the EU or some member states, to push policy, to generate hybrid threats, to sometimes blackmail countries,” he said. The EU also found itself stung by allies during the pandemic. The United States’ Defense Production Act “blocked de facto all our supply chains in terms of vaccine production”, Breton said. ”They not only blocked the export of vaccines to Europe and everywhere in the world, but they also de-facto blocked vaccine components.”In response, the European Commission required vaccine manufacturers to notify national authorities of vaccines leaving the EU, and receive permission for export. Only one shipment was ever blocked – Italy barred 250,000 AstraZeneca vaccines due for Australia – but the effect was to give the EU oversight over where vaccines were going, and allow the commission to demand reciprocity for exports. “This is a tool that we learned that we need to use when we see that some countries are not playing the game,” Breton said.Plugging holesThe EU is also applying the lesson to address vulnerabilities elsewhere. There is currently a shortage of semiconductors, required to make any electrical product. Europe is reliant for its supply on manufacturing in Asia. Enter the European Chips Act – no, not the kind with mayonnaise – which will promote EU semiconductor research and home-turf supply chains that would be resilient against any potential disruption. Ireland has a role to play: this is why Breton is this week visiting Intel, which has a manufacturing plant in Leixlip.This kind of trade talk can unsettle the coterie of EU countries that are fondest of free trade, Ireland included. There’s a whiff of ‘strategic autonomy’ – a phrase that has become toxically isive in EU circles, as to its opponents it has come to signify French protectionism.“Strategic autonomy, sovereignty, call it what you want,” Breton said. “In today’s world you can have interferences ... a pandemic, a geopolitical situation ... we just need to guarantee what is needed for us.”Asked about the proposed new EU anti-coercion tool, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said he didn’t see a conflict.“Any initiative that the European Union is bringing forward to deal with levels of corruption or market abuse, I don’t see ever being inconsistent with how we can drive the openness of the European Union or support trade in the EU, or between the EU and other parts of the world.”Stay on top of the latest news

“Stonehenge of the sea” is to be displayed at the British Museum, as part of the first major exhibition on its more familiar contemporary.Seahenge, as it is known, consists of an oak tree’s upturned roots surrounded by 54 wooden posts that would have been nearly 10 feet tall, arranged in a 21-foot diameter circle.The exact purpose of the henge and its flipped over stump is unclear, although there has been some speculation that it may have been used to lay bodies on, with scavenger birds able to feast on the flesh of the dead.“If Stonehenge is one of the world’s most remarkable surviving ancient stone circles, then Seahenge is the equivalent in timber,” said Dr Jennifer Wexler, the project curator of the exhibition, adding that it is “still relatively unknown”.The henge is also known as Holme I, after the village of Holme-next-the-Sea where it was discovered by an amateur archaeologist in 1998.Having initially found a Bronze Age axe head, John Lorimer made repeated visits to the beach, eventually uncovering the tree stump and calling in professional archaeologists from Norfolk Castle Museum.Amid controversy and protests, in particular from self-styled modern-day druids with didgeridoos, the full henge was excavated and removed from its original site.Exposure to oxygen and saltwater risked rapid deterioration of the wood, which had spent four millennia encased in peat.It was transferred to the Mary Rose Trust in Portsmouth, which specialises in preserving waterlogged timber, and was stabilised before going on display at the Lynn Museum in King’s Lynn.The henge has never gone on loan before, with Dr Neil Wilkin, the curator of the exhibition, saying that the museum was surprised their request was accepted.Much of the 4,000-year-old construction’s origins and purpose are still unknown to researchers, but they are certain that it held spiritual significance, with the doorway to the circle aligned with the midsummer sun.Visitors to the exhibition, which runs from February 17 to July 17, will be able to pass through that doorway themselves.Seahenge\u0027s more well-known stone equivalent sits on Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire and has long fascinated experts and the public alike. It is believed to have been built over several centuries, somewhere around 3,000 BC to 2,000 BC.While some have speculated that Stonehenge may have been used for healing or for studying the cosmos, a more widely held theory is that it formed the culmination of a funerary procession from the River Avon.Stonehenge and Seahenge are two of just 120 known henges in Britain, while there are over 1,000 stone circles which are more likely to survive the country\u0027s harsh weather conditions than their timber counterparts.The Seahenge timbers are among over 430 objects brought together from across the UK and Europe for what will be the British Museum’s largest exhibition for several years.The curators hope to dispel the idea that the creators of Stonehenge existed in an isolated and primitive society. The loans and items from the museum’s own collection come from across Europe, including France, Switzerland, Germany and Portugal and display the rich cultural world and networks of exchange within which neolithic Britons existed.The majority have not been seen in the UK before.“We think of Stonehenge as an English and a British monument. But actually, when you start to look at it, the tentacles of the root systems reach out across Britain and across Europe,” said Dr Wilkin. Also among the items displayed will be two remarkable cone-shaped gold hats, resembling those of a wizard, and the full Bush Barrow Hoard from the Wiltshire Museum which includes the finest example of Bronze Age gold craftsmanship ever found in Britain.More from NewsEverything you need to know about Covid vaccine passportsBoris Johnson may not recover from this double Covid catastropheGhislaine Maxwell trial: Witness recalls seeing girls leave Jeffrey Epstein\u0026#39s mansion with hundred dollar billsDon’t go to work, but do go to parties, says Boris JohnsonCovid Plan B: How new measures will affect ChristmasDidn’t police guarding No 10 know a party was going on, asks BaronessMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"believe not female priests claim 20 festive ms jumper unofficial","story":"They may not be renowned for being trendsetters. Nor are their seasonal “must-haves” a popular choice on the runways of Paris, London and Milan.Yet female clergy are jumping on an unexpected sartorial trend, with hundreds across the world choosing to wear new Marks \u0026amp Spencer Christmas jumpers. So popular is the new style that a leading Church of England bishop has described it as “the new clergy uniform”.The black jumper, emblazoned with the word “Believe” in bold colours, has been bought by a string of female priests. Using the hashtag “TeamBelieve”, they have taken to social media to share selfies of themselves wearing the jumper.Rev Kate Bottley, a priest in Nottinghamshire and the former Gogglebox star, posted a picture, saying: “Never one to shy away from a bandwagon, like most of the clerics I know I’ve bought this jumper.”Ruth Bushyager, the Bishop of Horsham, tweeted a picture of female priests in the Chichester diocese wearing the £19.50 Christmas jumper, saying: “Vote of thanks to @marksandspencer for the new clergy uniform @ChichesterDio”Leigh Greenwood, a Baptist minister, added: “Do you think @marksandspencer have realised yet that they’ve become the unofficial suppliers of clergy Christmas jumpers?”Rev Claire Jones, a curate in Bodmin, Cornwall, is collating a photo montage of more than 200 clergy wearing their Believe jumpers, saying the jumper had “struck a chord among women clergy”.“We have 220 pictures so far,” she added. “All ordained women, from at least seven different denominations. Across the UK, plus one from Australia and one in the US!“This jumper offered a fun and different way to spark conversations. We might think believing at Christmas is just for children and Santa, but there’s an even more wonderful story at the heart of Christmas which is good news for everyone who believes it!”However, some clergy, for whom the XL size is not big enough, have declared their disappointment at not being able to join in on the trend. The retailer is selling a similar jumper in its menswear section but with the slogan “Ding Dong” replacing “Believe”.An M\u0026ampS spokesman said: “Our customers are certainly getting into the Christmas spirit when it comes to their wardrobe choices and ‘Christmas jumper’ was last week’s top search on M\u0026ampS. We have a huge range of festive knits available and after another difficult year our designers and customers have embraced optimistic and feel-good messages as the #teambelieve posts from the clergy shows.”More from NewsEverything you need to know about Covid vaccine passportsBoris Johnson may not recover from this double Covid catastropheGhislaine Maxwell trial: Witness recalls seeing girls leave Jeffrey Epstein\u0026#39s mansion with hundred dollar billsDon’t go to work, but do go to parties, says Boris JohnsonCovid Plan B: How new measures will affect ChristmasDidn’t police guarding No 10 know a party was going on, asks BaronessMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"durham college head barred public facing roles rod liddle speech","story":"A Durham college principal has been barred from public facing roles as the university is accused of “hanging him out to dry”.Prof Tim Luckhurst, principal of South College, has come under fire for calling students “pathetic” after they walked out when the journalist Rod Liddle rose to speak at a formal dinner.He reportedly shouted “at South College, we value freedom of speech” as several students left the dining hall in protest at the choice of guest speaker.The university has launched an investigation, saying it is “concerned” about the “behaviours exhibited” during the evening.Now it has emerged that Prof Luckhurst is “stepping back” from some duties while the investigation is ongoing.He was due to speak at the university’s debating society, the Durham Union, on Monday evening but hours before the event was due to take place the organisers said it was “postponed”.Prof Luckhurst, a former editor of The Scotsman, was also due to join a delegation of Durham University officials on a trip to America this week but the trip went ahead without him.He was also meant to meet with a group of South College student representatives but the college’s vice-principal emailed on Tuesday evening to explain that he “has been asked to refrain from any public facing roles while the investigation into the formal is ongoing”.Liddle accused Durham University of “scapegoating” Prof Luckhurst and “hanging him out to dry”.He told The : “They have treated an eminent and extremely talented professor despicably. They should be ashamed of themselves. The university authorities are far more culpable than the students - these students are kids. It seems that the university has a desperate wish to placate the student body”.Liddle added that the university’s claim to stand up for free speech is “totally inconsistent” with their treatment of Prof Luckhurst.On Tuesday, Prof Antony Long, the acting vice-Chancellor and Warden of Durham University, emailed students saying that the events of last Friday night “caused considerable distress and anger across much of our community”.He said that “we pride ourselves on being open to different ideas, cultures and thinking” but added that “no member of our University community should be subjected to transphobia, homophobia, racism, classism and sexism”.It came as hundreds of students gathered at South College on Tuesday afternoon to protest against Prof Luckhurst, wielding placards which included the slogans “Proud to be Pathetic”, “Luckhurst Out” and “Tim Out”.The university\u0027s student union has already urged him to resign, calling his position untenable. When Liddle rose to speak following a formal dinner on Friday evening, several students staged a walkout, at which point Prof Luckhurst shouted “at South College, we value freedom of speech” and “pathetic”, according to the student newspaper, Palatinate.During his speech, Liddle said he was disappointed to not see any sex workers that night, in reference to recent controversy over safety training provided by Durham University to student sex workers.He went on to say that the “science or pure facts” are that “a person with an X and a Y chromosome, that has a long, dangling penis, is scientifically a man, and that is pretty much, scientifically, the end of the story”, Palatinate reported.Following the event, Prof Luckhurst apologised for describing the students’ walk out as “pathetic”.He said: “My anger reflected my sincere commitment to freedom of speech. However, I was wrong to describe the students’ action as pathetic and I apologise unreservedly for doing so.”A Durham University spokesman said Prof Luckhurst “is continuing as Principal but as a result of the investigation he is stepping back from some duties” and confirmed that he withdrew from the student meeting, the Union event and the trip to the US.More from NewsEverything you need to know about Covid vaccine passportsBoris Johnson may not recover from this double Covid catastropheGhislaine Maxwell trial: Witness recalls seeing girls leave Jeffrey Epstein\u0026#39s mansion with hundred dollar billsDon’t go to work, but do go to parties, says Boris JohnsonCovid Plan B: How new measures will affect ChristmasDidn’t police guarding No 10 know a party was going on, asks BaronessMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"eu left populists right un clown could yet show macron way victory","story":"The pressures of electoral politics can sometimes prompt even the most zealous leaders to sacrifice cherished principles. Take Emmanuel Macron, the French president, who yesterday saw fit to compromise his strong enthusiasm for the European Union.In a speech in Paris, Mr Macron openly condemned an attempt by the European Commission to promote nonsense. He was referring to its initiative, now disbanded, to fight a woke war by banning gendered words and phrases, such as man-made and ladies and gentlemen, and replace them with neutral and supposedly inoffensive terms like human-induced and dear colleagues.The president openly criticised the Commission, stating that a Europe that comes to explain to people what words they should or shouldn’t say is not a Europe to which I totally adhere. It’s nonsense, basically. Yet this is the same inidual who has openly called for closer fiscal and political integration between member states, who champions the integrity of the single market, and who despises Brexit as an insult to and repudiation of everything he holds most dear.Macron faces presidential elections next year and is trying to undermine the campaigns of Right-wing candidates Éric Zemmour and Marie Le Pen. A war on woke appeals to conservative opinion, particularly because it is viewed as a trans-Atlantic import in a country where suspicion of the United States is deeply held.But by openly taking sides in this conflict and opposing the march of wokeness across our cultural battlefields, Macron is challenging not just its failed bid to alter terminology, but the EU’s very foundations.He is inadvertently siding, for example, with the governments of Hungary and Poland, which have accused Brussels of imposing its wokeness, especially on LGBTQ rights, and openly defied it. Yet only recently, at an EU summit in June, he urged the EU to fight a cultural and civilizational battle to stop the rise of illiberal ideas, which he alleged threatened core European values.Macron’s ided loyalties – between the EU and his own electorate – have become clear before. After a French school teacher was beheaded by Islamists in October 2020, his government championed free expression, even offensive views like those supposedly held by the Hungarians and Poles. And Mr Macron also came close to challenging one of the sacrosanct principles of the European project – freedom of movement – when he promised to step up police surveillance of French borders to tackle the growing threat of terrorism.How, then, can Macron tread this political tightrope between his own electability and his most cherished values?He could do worse than emulate the very man he has recently picked out for fierce criticism – Boris Johnson. Over the years, our own Prime Minister has proved highly adept at appealing to many opposing strands of opinion. Although he infuriated the woke by referring to veiled Islamic women as letter boxes, his article never condemned them. And he was always liberal about immigration even though it was central to the Brexit campaign.In fact, over the next few months, we must expect French presidential rhetoric to become increasingly Johnsonian. Macron has recently urged his fellow French to defend the values of democracy, even though this is not something the EU, which has obstructed and even ignored referendums, has championed. Instead, such references are already resembling the rhetoric of Brexit campaigners who wanted to take back control. Of course, such political role reversals are hardly uncommon, but in this case the irony is particularly delicious.RT Howard is the author of ‘Power and Glory: France’s Secret Wars Against Britain and America 1945-2016’More from NewsEverything you need to know about Covid vaccine passportsBoris Johnson may not recover from this double Covid catastropheGhislaine Maxwell trial: Witness recalls seeing girls leave Jeffrey Epstein\u0026#39s mansion with hundred dollar billsDon’t go to work, but do go to parties, says Boris JohnsonCovid Plan B: How new measures will affect ChristmasDidn’t police guarding No 10 know a party was going on, asks BaronessMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"first physical evidence roman crucifixion britain unearthed","story":"Archaeologists have found the best physical evidence for a crucifixion in the Roman world at a Cambridgeshire housing estate.The remains of a man, who had a 5cm iron nail embedded in his right heel bone, were discovered in an ancient grave in the village of Fenstanton alongside a wooden board he is thought to have been pinned to.He is believed to be aged between 25 and 35, and his emaciated skeleton suggests he was most likely a Roman slave who was routinely punished by his master.The 5\u00277 tall body was uncovered by a team of professional excavators in 2017, who were analysing the site ahead of a housing development being built. The man died between AD 130 and AD 337, according to radiocarbon dating.It is the first example of a Roman crucifixion in the UK, and one of only a handful of similar cases worldwide.David Ingham, who led the excavation, told The : It\u0027s the best example of a crucified inidual from the Roman world. We\u0027d like to stage a reconstruction at some point to see what he looked like. We\u0027d use the skull and recreate the whole body.Corinne Duhig, an archaeologist at the University of Cambridge who examined the remains, concluded that crucifixion was the only likely explanation for the injuries.It is thought that the man\u0027s limbs had been tethered during his life, as his lower legs showed signs of thinning due to shackles.He was likely crucified on a roadside half a mile away from the small cemetery in Fenstanton where he was buried.Crucifixion was the main form of capital punishment in Roman times. Constantine the Great banned the practice during his reign in AD 306-337.Romans reserved crucifixion for condemned slaves, rebels and lower classes. It was designed to prolong an agonising death, and to serve as a warning to others.Suffocation was the usual cause of death, as the unnatural position of the arms being pinned above the head meant the condemned person couldn\u0027t take enough air into the lungs.Despite the link between crucifixion and Christianity, experts believe there was no religious element in this case.It is highly unusual for a victim of crucifixion to be buried, as they are usually left in the open area or thrown into a pit.It is also very rare to recover the nails used to pin the person to the wooden frame, as they were often recovered following death due to their value in Roman times as a metal. Most crucifixions were also carried out using rope.Biblical texts refer to crucifixion taking place with wooden crosses, but using a wooden board instead is thought to be a local variation in this case.No other nails were found in the man\u0027s body, suggesting that he was tied to the wooden frame with rope and the heel bone nail was to prevent him from moving.There was a 1cm-deep hole near where the nail was embedded in his heel, suggesting more than one attempt to pin his body to the wood.Archaeologists believe he would have hung for more than a day slowly dying.The first skeletal evidence for crucifixion was found in 1968 during an excavation of a cemetery in Giv\u0027at ha-Mivtar in Jerusalem. A heel bone with an embedded nail was discovered.However, the remains were less well preserved than the Fenstanton man, and had been moved from one burial site to another.Other skeletons with holes in their heels were discovered in Mendes in Egypt in the 1990s, and in Gavello, Italy, in 2006 - but it is not certain that the holes were caused by crucifixion.Fenstanton man was found in a cemetery with six other graves. His remains are one of 48 sets which were found by archaeologists in five Fenstanton cemeteries during digs between 2017 and 2018.More from NewsEverything you need to know about Covid vaccine passportsBoris Johnson may not recover from this double Covid catastropheGhislaine Maxwell trial: Witness recalls seeing girls leave Jeffrey Epstein\u0026#39s mansion with hundred dollar billsDon’t go to work, but do go to parties, says Boris JohnsonCovid Plan B: How new measures will affect ChristmasDidn’t police guarding No 10 know a party was going on, asks BaronessMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"marazion small cornish town big ambition city","story":"A tiny Cornish town of 1,440 people is making a bid to become the UK’s smallest city, arguing that “size doesn’t matter”.Marazion, one of the county’s most popular tourist destinations, has applied for city status as part of a competition for the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations.It will be in the running with other towns including Reading and Bournemouth, with judges weighing up issues such as civic pride, heritage and innovation.If Marazion is successful, it would become the smallest city in the UK, with only 1,440 residents recorded at the time of the last census.Richard Stokoe, a town councillor and chairman of the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee Committee, said: “Marazion deserves to be celebrated and given city status. “The wonderful people, the fascinating history, stunning beauty and incredible community spirit mean that Marazion would be a fitting and popular place to become the next town to be honoured with becoming a city.“As it is often said, size is not important. “Despite being a David in a field of Goliaths applying for city status, anyone who has ever lived, worked or visited Marazion knows that there is something for everyone and that it would be a worthy winner of the award.”Some 400,000 British and international visitors travel to Marazion every year.It was given chartered status in 1257 by Henry III, and this was reaffirmed by Elizabeth I in 1595. Marazion is now the oldest chartered town in the UK.St Michael’s Mount is just metres from its shoreline.The Queen will confer city status on one or more towns next year to mark her 70-year reign.Paul Elliott, chair of the Marazion Chamber of Commerce, said Marazion obtaining city status would “stimulate local businesses”.St Davids, in Wales, is currently the smallest UK city, with 1,600 inhabitants. It was awarded the status in 1994, to mark its role in Christian heritage.City status is rarely granted - in 2012, 25 towns applied and only three were granted the status.No money had been spent on Marazion’s application for city status, the town council said.The name Marazion derives from the important fairs and markets that were held there, with the earliest recorded in 1070.Marazion had two significant markets: Marghas Byghan (Small Market) and Marghas Yow or Jew (Thursday Market). Over time, the pronunciation has become Marazion.More from NewsEverything you need to know about Covid vaccine passportsBoris Johnson may not recover from this double Covid catastropheGhislaine Maxwell trial: Witness recalls seeing girls leave Jeffrey Epstein\u0026#39s mansion with hundred dollar billsDon’t go to work, but do go to parties, says Boris JohnsonCovid Plan B: How new measures will affect ChristmasDidn’t police guarding No 10 know a party was going on, asks BaronessMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"nothing civic sturgeons brand nationalism","story":"Nicola Sturgeon is a busy woman, so it was left to her deputy, John Swinney, to issue a reprimand to nationalists who have been issuing threats to a Scottish business woman for the crime of promoting her goods at a food fayre attended by Boris Johnson.In most normal countries, the preceding paragraph would be a marmalade-dropping moment. They’ve been threatening who for what?Welcome to Scotland, where citizens must constantly be reminded that it is the Conservative Party who are the villains, lest we start to examine the available evidence and draw some very different conclusions.Michelle Maddox runs Clootie McToot, a bakery in Perthshire that manufactures clootie dumplings, a delicious Scottish delicacy that can be consumed hot or cold as part of either a dessert or a savoury dish (the term “clootie” comes from the traditional method of streaming the pudding in a cloth or “cloot”).Maddox accepted an invitation to display her company’s wares at a Downing Street Market, hosted by the Prime Minister and during which, it was reported, he was given a free sample by Ms Maddox. So far, so normal: naturally a British food manufacturer is going to take any opportunity to improve its profile. Had she been invited to a similar event at Bute House, hosted by the First Minister, no doubt she would have accepted just as eagerly.But now we move into the Twilight Zone of Scottish politics, where self-appointed, self-righteous Bravehearts, the kind of people who have displayed “IndyRef2” stickers in their cars since the weekend after the first referendum, have decided what is acceptable and unacceptable behaviour by other private citizens. And being courteous and generous to the Prime Minister is regarded among such types as an unforgivable sin.In fact it’s regarded as much more than a sin: it is seen as treason itself. In Scotland in 2021, it is a justification for hatred.Maddox herself reported that she had had “an incredibly difficult 12 hours or so on my Facebook page @ClootieMcToot. I have had private message with abuse threats and orders cancelled due to attending a non-political food event at 10 Downing Street.”She later revealed the full extent of the abuse she had received: she had been left in tears after the messages, with one threatening to damage her van, while another warned her not to “walk down dark alleyways”. “It’s been heart-breaking to read the messages. I was told a brick would get thrown through my van window, while another message told me not to walk down a dark alleyway. I’ve also had 12 cancellations of food orders since the video appeared online. “It’s politically motivated, but I don’t where its came from. We weren’t the only Scottish company there. I’m not interested in politics, I’m just interested in my business and in selling Scottish food produce.“The messages left me in tears, but the support since has been fantastic, I’ve had a lot.”It is perhaps naïve of Maddox to claim that she didn’t know where these threats came from. Because most people who live in Scotland and who are remotely familiar with the political landscape here know exactly where such vile behaviour comes from.Swinney, who has a well-deserved reputation as one of Scotland’s most decent politicians, said: “This is totally unacceptable. Please just let @ClootieMcToot get on with running an excellent business with a fabulous product.”Scotland’s political establishment prides itself on their country’s tolerance and progressive attitude. Yet this is far from the first time when independence supporters have chosen to take revenge on those it considers traitors to the cause. In Maddox’s case, she wasn’t even making a comment about independence, and the nationalist blob has dealt mercilessly with those who do. They even called for a boycott of Tunnock’s – makers of the famously Scottish Teacake – when it was announced the company had appointed former Scottish Conservative leader, Ruth Davidson, to its board.It is not Swinney’s fault that some in his movement descend to this appalling level of “activism”, where threats and intimidation have replaced open debate (probably because the latter strategy has failed to deliver independence). But neither will his admonition do any good. For all the SNP’s insistence that it represents a new kind of “civic nationalism”, where everyone’s view is respected and pride in one’s own country has usurped hatred of others, the independence movement cannot ever escape the shadow of raw, unbridled nationalism.And when politicians like Swinney’s boss, Nicola Sturgeon, insist on “othering” any and every party remotely to the right of her as somehow un-Scottish and beyond the pale, the very worst elements of her movement will naturally take that resentment towards Westminster (aka, hatred of England) to the next level. It is then that polite association with the Prime Minister of one’s own country becomes a justification for hatred and violence.Show me a civic nationalist and I’ll show you a nationalist.More from NewsEverything you need to know about Covid vaccine passportsBoris Johnson may not recover from this double Covid catastropheGhislaine Maxwell trial: Witness recalls seeing girls leave Jeffrey Epstein\u0026#39s mansion with hundred dollar billsDon’t go to work, but do go to parties, says Boris JohnsonCovid Plan B: How new measures will affect ChristmasDidn’t police guarding No 10 know a party was going on, asks BaronessMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"partied downing street said goodbye dad last time","story":"In her resignation speech, the Prime Minister’s spokesperson Allegra Stratton acknowledged those people who were following Covid restrictions – separated from their loved ones or cut off from their source of income – while Downing Street held parties last December. “I understand the anger and frustration that people feel. To all of you who lost loved ones, endured intolerable loneliness and struggled with your business – I am sorry,” she said.Here we tell the stories of some of those people affected...Ron Peck, 60, a retired teacher from SussexStanding in the rain on his doorstep, I said cheerio to my dear old dad for the last time. Dad had rung me up when it became clear that restrictions would be tightening again and Christmas would be cancelled. “I hope you still can come up to see us,” he said. “It’s just that I’m deteriorating rather quickly, it seems.” He had cancer of the liver and a heart complaint he had been receiving treatment for both and coping as best he could, all while looking after my mum who has late stage dementia. But things had taken a turn for the worse and he knew was going downhill fast.My wife and I live on the south coast while my parents, Ron and Margaret, lived in Bedfordshire. We drove up the week before Christmas and exchanged presents from a distance in the drizzle. Mum came to the door and couldn’t understand what was going on, why we couldn’t come in. Dad was putting on a brave face – ever the proud army infantry man, he wanted us to see that he was coping. We stayed for a little while, then said our goodbyes and wished each other a happy Christmas. Dad died a few weeks later. They had muddled on for a while, but eventually he had a fall and was rushed to hospital while Mum was put straight into residential care as Dad had been her full-time carer. He was 83. The winter lockdown meant we hadn’t been able to get back to see them.Looking back, it’s heartbreaking to think that on that rainy day on the doorstep we couldn’t share a hug, that I couldn’t shake his hand or even just go inside and linger a while. My father was dying and I couldn’t sit with him and talk. Why? Because I was following the rules.When the story broke revealing that Downing Street had been hosting parties – including one just the night before I said goodbye to my father – while we stuck to the guidelines they created, I felt sick to my stomach. For months we did as we were told and didn’t begrudge it – we wanted to keep our vulnerable loved ones safe as much as the next person. To see the level of disdain the people in charge seemed to have for us while we were trying to do the right thing… well, it’s deeply upsetting. It was such a difficult time watching that video of Allegra Stratton brought all the emotion from this time last year flooding back.We had a socially distanced funeral for Dad on a crisp morning in April. He had three children, seven grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren, but only 10 people could attend his funeral, not nearly as many as there should have been. He was so well liked that even his window cleaner wanted to come, but of course he couldn’t. At the end of the service we said goodbye to each other and went our separate ways. I wasn’t bitter about it at the time, but it’s hard not to feel angry now.As told to Eleanor SteafelJenny Burton, 39, from BuckinghamshireOn the day Downing Street hosted their party, I was worried sick about my husband, JJ, who had been blue-lighted to hospital with Covid. He was only 39, but both of us fell badly ill with the virus in the first week of December.I was so ill that I could barely get out of bed to make dinner for our two children, and moved myself to the spare room. My husband was even worse: he became delirious and couldn’t respond to simple questions because he was so confused and breathless. A few days in, we video-called our GP, who took one look at him and ordered an ambulance.I will never forget my 12 and 13-year-old crying as he was taken away. They were so frightened and it took everything in me to try to keep them calm.The ambulance took JJ to hospital, where the doctors found out that Covid had severely battered his body. He had blood clots in his lungs, as well as failing kidneys. It was absolutely terrifying, and for the first days he was in there I had no idea if he would even survive. His lungs were too weak to summon the breath to speak on the phone. A few days in, a man in his 40s two beds down from him in the ward died.On top of that, I was so cautious about not giving Covid to others that I stopped orders for my candle company Scent and Seed in what is usually the busiest week of the year, missing out on about £2,500 of sales.And while all this was happening, staff in Downing Street were having a Christmas party. After everything my family has been through, it feels like a slap in the face.As told to Helen Chandler-WildeOn December 18 last year, while staff in Downing Street seemingly partied, my brother lay dying in hospital. I wanted desperately to visit him, but lockdown rules meant I had to keep away.John* was diagnosed with cancer in July last year, and his condition gradually worsened. He was a kind, quiet brother, with a public-spirited nature. We shared a fascination with the human mind as adults, we both completed psychology degrees.When he was admitted to hospital in November, I considered driving the 200 miles from my home in Leeds to Bristol, so I could see him. But at that point, with Tier restrictions in place, the thought of getting in my car and travelling across the country just seemed impossible. Once I arrived, would I even be allowed in to see him? Nobody was vaccinated at that point – what if I infected him with Covid? Or what if I caught Covid from a patient, then brought it back to Leeds?I made the terribly tough decision to stay away. There was a lockdown: we accepted the distance as part of our public duty.It was a cold Friday morning on December 18. I received a phone call from John’s wife, one of the most difficult I’ve ever had to take. She shared the awful news that he had passed away that morning. I knew it was coming, but it was still a shock. My older brother was gone, and I couldn’t even say a final goodbye. Now, I often find myself trying to remember something that happened in our childhood. My instinct is to ask John – then I remember he’s not here any more.I spent the few days after his death at home, trying to process the loss. Only a handful of mourners were allowed at his funeral. It was miserable not to be there – but again, I accepted it as a necessary feature of lockdown. We’re all in this together, I believed at the time.My first thought upon hearing about the alleged No. 10 party was, “Same old, same old”. After months of negative headlines about the Government, it didn’t seem surprising. But the more I read, the angrier I grew.This week, I saw the now-infamous video of former No. 10 aide Allegra Stratton joking around. I felt deeply betrayed. While I was agonising over whether or not to see my dying brother, staff inside the most powerful office in the country were apparently in direct contravention of their own guidelines.As told to Luke MintzMore from NewsEverything you need to know about Covid vaccine passportsBoris Johnson may not recover from this double Covid catastropheGhislaine Maxwell trial: Witness recalls seeing girls leave Jeffrey Epstein\u0026#39s mansion with hundred dollar billsDon’t go to work, but do go to parties, says Boris JohnsonCovid Plan B: How new measures will affect ChristmasDidn’t police guarding No 10 know a party was going on, asks BaronessMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid plan b explained what","story":"Covid Plan B explained: What you can and cant do under new rules for EnglandBoris Johnson tonight announced England’s Plan B for Covid as the Omicron iant surges.

Experts warned cases of the new strain are doubling in just . to three days - up from seven days for the Delta iant.People are urged to work from home from Monday, must wear face masks in more settings from Friday, produce the NHS Covid pass at big events from next Wednesday, and may get daily contact testing instead of isolation.It’s what the PM hoped not to do. He hoped he would not have to review restrictions until next week in time for their expiry on December .Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the change “has made the virus an even more formidable foe” and although there are only  confirmed Omicron cases in the UK, “we know the actual number of infections will be signicantly higher.”Mr Javid said the UK Health Security Agency estimates the number of infections “are approximately  times” those currently known - so closer to ,.  England’s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty added: “We know that it looked asit was going to evade vaccination. And now, clinically, we know that it can.” Yet Mr Javid was booed in the Commons as he introduced the work-from-home order - which has left Tory MPs furious. Tory MP William Wragg said vaccine passports “will create a segregated society” - and accused the PM of a dead cat to distract from the No party. “Very few will be convinced by this ersionary tactic”, he swiped. So what can and can’t you do  Here’s the full rundown of new rules. Mandatory vaccine passports for venues Under Plan B, certain venues will be forced to ask punters for an NHS Covid pass. Under previous plans only the vaccine part would be valid. People would no longer be able to show a negative test.But today Boris Johnson announced he is putting this plan into action from am on Wednesday  December - with a key change.Contrary to previous plans, he said “a negative lateral flow test will also be sufficient” to get you into a nightclub evenyou aren’t double-jabbed.  People who haven’t had the boosterwill still be eligible for now - but Mr Johnson said “we will keep this under review as the boosters roll out.” It’s thought venues affected will be all nightclubs, and other venues open after am with alcohol, music, and dancing. They also include:Indoor, crowded settings with  or more attendees where those attendees are likely to be in close proximity to people from other households, such as music venues or large receptions. Outdoor, crowded settings with , or more attendees where those attendees are likely to be in close proximity to people from other households, such as outdoor festivals. Any settings with , or more attendees, such as large sports and music stadia. Working from home Under plan B the government “would consider asking people to work from homethey can, for a limited period”, according to the September document. Today Boris Johnson announced that policy. He said: “We will reintroduce the guidance to work from home. “From Monday you should work from homeyou can. Go to workyou must but work from homeyou can.” The winter plan admitted: The Government recognises this causes more disruption and has greater immediate costs to the economy and some businesses than the other Plan B interventions.” But SAGE had warned it would be a key way of getting cases down. Mandatory face masks  Face masks have already been mandatory by law in England’s shops, supermarkets, gt shops, indoor shopping centres, public transport including taxis and indoor stations, banks and post offices since am on November . They are also compulsory at hair salons, barbers, nail salons, massage centres, tattoo and piercing studios. And theyaposre needed during driving tests and lessons - plus at pharmacies, vets, auction houses, retail galleries, takeaways , estate and lettings agents, high street solicitors and accountants. Tonight Boris Johnson announced they will be extended to “most public indoor venues including theatres and cinemas” too from .am this Friday. There will be exemptions for eating, drinking, exercising, and singing. For that reason, hospitality venues - including pubs and restaurants - will be completely exempt. Those who do not comply can be fined £ for a first offence , doubling on each repeat offence up to £,. Police will be expected to enforce the rules. Daily contact testing New rules say any contact of a suspected Omicron case must isolate for  days. But that could cause a pingdemiccases surge to a million in total by the end of the month, as Sajid Javid warned they could. Therefore Boris Johnson said the government will introduce daily tests for contacts instead of isolation. He did not say when. Face masks in schools At the end of November, secondary schools in England were recommended to ask pupils to wear masks in communal areas and corridors. There are reports of talks ongoing about whether to extend this. However there was no immediate announcement. New foreign travel rules Since November , all arrivals in the UK from anywhere in the world have had to take a paid-for PCR test within  hours of their arrival - and isolate until the result comes back negative. Since yesterdaythey have also had to take another pre-departure test before they board their flight back to the UK. Previously, vaccinated travellers only had to take a lateral flow Day  test, and did not have to isolate. The new rules apply even to the double-jabbed. Arrivals who land without having booked a Day  test in advance can be fined £, on the spot. Eleven countries were also added to England’s red list, forcing all arrivals into hotel quarantine costing £, a head for  nights. They include South Africa, Zimbabwe and Nigeria. Boris Johnson did not announce any extension to this tonight. ‘Clear communications’ This is where Plan B gets vaguer. The Winter Plan said the government would ensure it “communicates clearly and urgently to the public that the level of risk has increased, and with it the need to behave more cautiously.” Boris Johnson today gave some of that messaging as ministers warned of the rapid doubling time of the virus. When will Plan B end  The measures announced today will be reviewed on January  and the government will update Parliament. Regulations will then “sunset” on January , Sajid Javid told MPs. But both of these days could be brought forward or pushed back so they’re not actually massively relevant. Don’t forget the original lockdown was only for three weeks. We can glean some information from the criteria for triggering Plan B in the first place. Key questions the government would ask include:Is the NHS in danger of being overwhelmed This crucially isn’t just about cases - hospitalisations and deaths are more important. Key metrics include “hospital occupancy for COVID- and non-COVID- patients, intensive care unitcapacity, admissions in vaccinated iniduals, and the rate of growth of admissions.The link between hospitalisation and infections: The winter plan says the Government is monitoring the ratio of cases to hospitalisations and also the proportion of admissions due to infections among other factors. It also states ministers are keeping an eye on how many people over -years-old are catching Covid- or ending up in hospital.Vaccine efficacy and immunity: A major booster campaign for the over-s and the most vulnerable started in September, but there are some calls for it to be stepped up. Crucial will be whether immunity across the population is waning, or whether it’s being kept strong by the booster programme.The impact of new iants: In recent months the threat of a new, more deadly or more infectious iant appears to have faded. But that doesn’t mean it won’t emerge in future months, and the government now has a sequencing infrastructure that will attempt to spot them as they appear.Could it go further  Yes. Boris Johnson has refused to rule out lockdown measures at Christmas - or, as some scientists fear is more likely, in January when Omicron surges. Some have warned the Plan B measures above are pretty minimal overall. In particular,cases rise too high, you might need much stricter measures to actually bring cases down, rather than keep them stable or rising more slowly. The Plan B document in September said: “While the Government expects that, with strong engagement from the public and businesses, these contingency measures should be sufficient to reverse a resurgence in autumn or winter, the nature of the virus means it is not possible to give guarantees. “The Government remains committed to taking whatever action is necessary to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed but more harmful economic and social restrictions would only be considered as a last resort.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON DeltaConservative PartyNHSPlan BBoris JohnsonEducationHospitalsPublic transportShopping centresSecondary schoolThe economyPoliticsChristmas shoppingChristmas party\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Office snogging and groping while we were meant to social distance, and now banned Christmas parties.We’ve known for some time that when it comes to ­lockdown and Covid, it’s one rule for us and another for them. Time and time again the Government has shown complete disregard for their own rules and utter contempt for the public. Their mantra is do as we say not as we do.And now, we know not only did they break their own rules, they were laughing their heads off at us while they were doing it.Through the excellent reporting of Daily Mirror Political Editor Pippa Crerar, we learned that last year there was a Christmas party at No Downing Street.From the very place we were given orders about what to do and how to behave, No staff were having a jolly knees-up with cheese and wine and Secret Santa.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section  All this while families across the country were unable to say proper goodbyes to their dying loved ones, and people couldn’t see their ­families because of Covid restrictions – by that point I hadn’t seen my own family for several months. A few days earlier, while children faced a Christmas under lockdown rules, staff at the Department for Education got together for a party with “drinks and canapes”. Not even Armando Iannucci could have come up with something as ­unimaginable as this in a ­plotline for political spoof The Thick of It. On Tuesday, a leaked video emerged of Downing Street aides laughing and joking about a rule-breaking Christmas party with one saying the “fictional” party was a “business meeting”. The country is fuming. We are being taken for absolute mugs. We know it, they know it, heck, even Ant and Dec know it. The behaviour of people who are supposed to be in charge is an absolute insult to everyone who made sacrices and followed the rules. Leadership is about being an example to others, sacrice, and putting other people before yourself. Just ask the Queen, who at , sat alone in church to bury Prince Philip, her husband of more than  years.It’s a disgrace. I’d like to think there will be consequences, but there won’t. At Prime Minister’s Questions, Boris announced some sort of “investigation”. Once again they’re marking their own homework.Johnson’s spokeswoman Allegra Stratton has resigned and a few people may be fired, but now it just feels like they’re moving the ­deckchairs on the Titanic.People will not forget this in a hurry. Let’s see who’s laughing come the next election. Find lost kids living in pain Like Susanna Reid on GMB this week, I was moved to tears listening to the grandmother of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes talk about how her attempts to save the little boy were ignored. She said: “Something is broken in this system and something needs fixing.”  I have a son the same age as Arthur and I just can’t imagine how anyone, let alone his own father and stepmother, could be so wicked and cruel. Hearing how he suffered is heartbreaking. According to schools inspector Ofsted, there are thousands of so-called “ghost children” who have vanished from the UK education system.  Something must be done immediately to ensure they aren’t in harm’s way. If that means a massive recruitment drive for more social workers then so be it. This can never be allowed to happen again.

Whilst at Newsnight she came under fire after appearing to accuse a working mother of two of choosing to claim benefits.Leaving the BBC, she joined rivals ITV as a national news editor in  and co-presented Peston on Sunday alongside Robert Peston.Ms Stratton left journalism in April , quitting to join the government as the Director of Strategic Communications for Rishi Sunakaposs treasury.  Allegra Stratton Downing Street Christmas party video In the leaked clip of a press conference rehearsal, Stratton is seen prepping responses to questions about a Number  Christmas party that is alleged to have taken place on December  . She can be seen making light of would-be-questions about a wine and cheese night involving over  people. She responds whataposs the answer  and laughs that it was not socially distanced. It is believed the festive evening, which coincided with around , new cases that day, also included a secret Santa. What is Allegra Strattonaposs job in government  At the time of the video Stratton was the Downing Street Press Secretary, tasked with being a regular face in the governmentaposs plans to hold frequent on-the-record White House-style televised press briefings. Ms Strattonaposs televised meetings were delayed several times before they were eventually scrapped. During this time she collected a taxpayer-funded pay packet of between £, and £, per year.  In April this year, she moved to a new role as spokesperson for the COP environmental summit in Glasgow, after plans for the briefings were scrapped. Speaking to the Times she said: I’m delighted to be starting this new role. The COP climate conference is an opportunity to deliver a cleaner, greener world and I’m looking forward to working with the prime minister and Alok Sharma to ensure this is a signicant success.However, despite taking a key role as a prominent face in the fight to save the earth from global heating, Stratton caused disbelief amongst environmentalists when in August  she said that she didnapost fancy an electric car quite yet. She said the battery charging times put her off, instead preferring her third hand fuel-thirsty VW Golf. She admitted to using the car for a  mile journey across the country to see family. Allegra Strattonaposs husband James ForsythStratton is married to James Forsyth, the political editor of the Spectator - a Tory-supporting magazine that Prime Minister Boris Johnson used to edit. Forsyth went to school with Chancellor Rishi Sunak, where they both attended the £, boarding school, Winchester Collage.The Chancellor was best man at Stratton and Forsythaposs wedding, with Sunak having attended Oxford and the Forsyth Cambridge.

So where’s MY choice It is estimated by a charity that , children have long CovidImage: Getty Images iStockphotoopinionByPolly Hudson:,  Dec | commentsAt first it seemed sensible. Then insulting. Now  Scandalously negligent. Primary school age children in this country currently have the highest infection rates they’ve ever had during the pandemic - but there are no plans to start vaccinating them. Nearly five million - year olds have been jabbed in America, on Sunday the scheme was approved in Australia, and the rollout is expected to start next week in some European countries after it was given the green light by the European Medicines Agency. But here, nothing.Some parents won’t want their kids to be vaccinated of course, and that’s their choice - but I do, desperately. So where’s MY choice I’d take my seven-year-old to a back street illegal vaccinatorsuch a thing existed, but unfortunately it doesn’t.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section Omicron is only just getting started, and already a whopping , kids tested positive for covid last week, with actual infection levels estimated to be up to four times higher than that. Charity Long Covid Kids reports that , children currently have long covid - , of whom have been suffering with it for over a year.Respected epidemiologist and public health researcher Deepti Gurdasani puts it simply, “Infection of children with SARS-Cov- will be one of those actions we look back at in history and wonder how on earth it was allowed to happen - by those who should’ve been protecting them.” I’ve gratefully accepted every vaccine my son has been offered, starting when he was eight weeks old. I’m lucky to live in a country where they’re available as standard, for free. And I believe it’s my duty to ensure he’s up to date with them, in accordance with the No part of parenting: trying to keep your kid safe. Also of course in this case, where coronavirus is still circulating, jabbing everyone means the whole community is protected. It’s better for everyone. The news about Omicron is becoming ever more concerning, and there were already upwards of , Covid cases a day before it reared its unwelcome head. And yet, every morning, I deliver my son into an environment where he mixes freely with hundreds of others, with no mitigations. No masks, no bubbles, no ventilation. And no vaccine either. Best of British luck, eh, kid  Vaccinating children was approved in the US at the end of October. Prof Jon Levy, chairman of the Department of Environmental Health at Boston University, welcomed the news: “Every paediatrician I know is eager to get their own kids age - vaccinated immediately. “They plan to get as many kids vaccinated in their offices as quickly as possible. If that doesn’t tell you how safe and effective the vaccine is. I don’t know what will.” If the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation know something we don’t – and have good reason why they’re dragging their feet on protecting the smallest, most helpless people in our communities – they need to speak up. Otherwise, they’re forcing us to fail our children.

Heres everything you need to know about Plan B, from vaccine passports to working from home measuresThe government is expected to introduce Plan B measures Image: Getty ImagesByBenjamin LynchSEO writer:,  Dec Updated:,  Dec | comments The UK government has announced Englandaposs aposPlan Bapos to try and reduce the spread of the coronavirus. Cases of the new iant, Omicron, are on the rise and the strategy to curb the number of infections is being discussed by Boris Johnson and his cabinet, according to reports.Scientists are wary of the iant and early indications suggest that is it more easily transmitted, though this has not yet been proven.If it is, then experts are concerned that mass transmissions could overwhelm a struggling NHS.Scientic advisers from SAGE, the government advisory group, believe that Omicron infections in the UK are on course to double every three days.Speaking on BBC Radio ’s Today programme, SAGEaposs Professor Neil Ferguson said: [Omicron] is likely to overtake Delta before Christmas at this rate, precisely when is hard to say.Plan B will enforce more restrictions than mask-wearing mandates already in place. So what is Plan B  What is the governmentaposs Plan B strategy   The governmentaposs Plan B strategy was drawn up in September this year and outlines what restrictions would be put in place should a dramatic rise in coronavirus cases occur. Daily cases are now threatening to go above , for the first time since July. Vaccine passports The controversial vaccine passports will be a feature of le under Plan B restrictions. Nightclubs require vaccine passports, which the government are also calling aposvaccine-only certicationapos.  The current list of places that can expect vaccine passports are:All nightclubs and other venues open after am with alcohol, music and dancing Indoor events with  or more attendees, where attendees are expected to mix. This includes music venues or large receptions. Outdoor settings with , or more attendees, such as music festivals, where attendees are expected to mix Any setting with , or more attendeesIt has not been ruled out that vaccine passports will extend further than these venues, though the government is not keen to do this over fears that a Plan B scenario would have a signicant economic impact. Vaccine passport exemptions According to the initial plans, there are places where vaccine passports will not apply.  These are:Places where people worship together Wedding and civil partnership ceremonies Funerals and memorial services aposLe-cycle events such as at a bar and bat mitzvah, mehndi ceremony or christening Outdoor events in public spaces where these are unticketed and not charged forEvents at homeWorking from home According to the government policy paper published in September, Plan B will prioritise measures which can help control transmission of the virus while seeking to minimise economic and social impact.One way of controlling transmissions is asking people to work from home.  This has now been confirmed and people are being asked to work from home from Monday, December . Wearing face masks The wearing of face masks in shops and on public transport is a mandatory rule already introduced. From Friday, this includes theatres, cinemas, and restaurants. A full breakdown by the Mirror of where masks are required can be seen here. The list includes shops and public transport, as well as places like pharmacies, vets and salons.Other measures are also already in place, including isolation for all arrivals to the UK until their Day  PCR test comes back negative, and a new law saying you must isolate for  daysyou have contact with a suspected Omicron case - evenyouaposre fully vaccinated. Will Plan B be implemented   The government will reportedly announce Plan B restrictions as soon as Wednesday December . Some restrictions may be in place by Thursday morning, though this is unconfirmed. Covid cases are high and the reinfection rate, or aposR rateapos is causing concern.  If it is over , then it is believed that each person is infecting at least one other person on average. Initial research for the Omicron iantaposs R rate is believed to be as high as ., according to the University of East Anglia. Could there be a Christmas lockdown   The higher the cases, the more likely a lockdown over Christmas will occur. This would very much be considered a last resortPlan B does nothing to slow the rate of cases down. A lockdown would mean ato social bubbles and only leaving the house for essential items or for daily exercise. Bars and restaurants may be expected to shut once again under this scenario.  It currently remains unlikely, and there are hopes that the Omicron iant does not give people symptoms as severe as other iants. The vaccine should also help curb transmissions and reduce symptoms when vaccinated people catch the virus. If hospital cases skyrocket, then a lockdown may be needed to protect the NHS.What would trigger Plan B Key questions the government asked include:Is the NHS in danger of being overwhelmed This crucially isn’t just about cases - hospitalisations and deaths are more important. Key metrics include “hospital occupancy for COVID- and non-COVID- patients, intensive care unitcapacity, admissions in vaccinated iniduals, and the rate of growth of admissions.The link between hospitalisation and infections:The winter plan says the Government is monitoring the ratio of cases to hospitalisations and also the proportion of admissions due to infections among other factors. It also states ministers are keeping an eye on how many people over -years-old are catching Covid- or ending up in hospital.Vaccine efficacy and immunity:A major booster campaign for the over-s and the most vulnerable started in September, but there are some calls for it to be stepped up. Crucial will be whether immunity across the population is waning, or whether it’s being kept strong by the booster programme.The impact of new iants:In recent months the threat of a new, more deadly or more infectious iant appears to have faded. But that doesn’t mean it won’t emerge in future months, and the government now has a sequencing infrastructure that will attempt to spot them as they appear.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON DeltaNHSUniversity of East AngliaPlan BBoris JohnsonNightclubsFuneralsMarriagePublic transportPoliticsChristmas partyCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He pulled through but the sepsis caused severe damage in his limbs, causing the tissue in his hands and feet to die.His mum Karina Kolek, , has now opened up on her heartbreaking ordeal - and says she will do whatever it takes to get him the operation he desperately needs. She has vowed to fundraise cash for a potentially le-changing treatment that could give Jakub a chance to be normal. She said: I remember those moments when Jakub was first ill so clearly. I was scared by the way my son looked. His arms and legs were black. I was mad with despair, fear, pain, helplessness - it is impossible to describe. My child was dying before my eyes. The doctors said they did not knowhe would make it. At one point, only his heart was still beating. So I prayed. Fortunately, God gave my son one more le and Jakub had enough strength to survive. Medics discovered he has damaged growth cartilages after he underwent some reconstructive surgery.  That will require further operations to help him to walk without pain - but it will cost £,. Single mum-of-two Karina has launched a fundraiser for further reconstructive treatment from a specialist team in Poland. She added: Some of his fingers could not be saved but his feet suffered the most. That is where the greatest tissue loss is. I am fighting for my son because I believe this is the only chance he will have tolike other children. If Jakub does not get this surgery soon, it may result in more damage to the skin.  Not only will that cause more pain - but in the worst case may lead to Osteomyelitis, a type of swelling in the bone, which could make him seriously ill again. In a plea for help towards his treatment Karina said: Iaposm a mother with two children, alone, and I will cannot cope with it on my own. Jakub survived, but he is crippled. I wholeheartedly ask for this help so that my son can live without pain, without a wheelchair and walk normally like other children in future.To donate to the fundraiser for Jakubaposs operation click here.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Sepsis\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Speaking at a Downing Street press conference, the Prime Minister said the doubling time of the new strain could be between two and three days - meaning its spread will be rapid. Under the stricter rules people must show a Covid vaccine passport to enter some venues in England. Butsomeone is unjabbed they can still enter as long as they produce a negative lateral flow test. Covid passports will be made mandatory for nightclubs and large events, and rules on face masks would be “further extended” from Friday, to “most public indoor venues” including theatres and cinemas.  The Prime Minister said: We will also make the NHS Covid pass mandatory for entry into nightclubs and venues where large crowds gather, including unseated indoor venues with more than  people, unseated outdoor venues with more than , people and any venue with more than , people. The NHS Covid pass can still be obtained with two doses but we will keep this under review as the boosters roll out. And having taken clinical advice since the emergence of Omicron, a negative lateral flow test will also be sufficient.  As we set out in Plan B, we will give businesses a weekaposs notice, so this will come into force in a weekaposs time, helping to keep these events and venues open at full capacity while giving everyone who attends them confidence that those around them have done the responsible thing to minimise risk to others. Mr Johnson made the announcement as the Health Secretary warned that the number of Omicron cases could hit one million by the end of December. Sajid Javid issued the stark warning telling the Commons: Weaposre confident that Omicron is signicantly more transmissible than Delta.  There is still a lot to learn, but some important data has emerged recently. He added: It is far more transmissible than the Delta iant. Mr Javid said Delta cases had doubled in around seven days but for Omicron based on the latest data from here and around the world, our latest analysis is that itaposs been around, itaposs between . and three days. This has made the virus an even more formidable foe. He continued: Although there are only  confirmed Omicron cases in the UK we know that the actual number of infections will be signicantly higher. The UK health security agency estimates that the number of infections are approximately  times higher than the number of confirmed cases, and so the current number of infections is probably closer to ,. UKHSA also estimate that at the current observed doubling rate of between two and a half and three days, by the end of this month, infections could exceed  million. Currently daily infections across the UK have been above , for the last two weeks and Omicron cases have today topped .

She told hospice staff: “You are all marvellous.

They were all so great with him and it made the world of dference to us as a family.”  The Duchess replied: “Well it’s wonderful to know he was so well looked after.” She also paid a private visit to the inpatient unit of the centre where she was able to speak with nurses, doctors and some visiting families privately.

Dr Samantha Lund, the centreaposs medical director, said: “The Duchess’s recognition of all the staff’s hard work is really quite special considering the daily heroic efforts that we have seen to keep going throughout the pandemic. “They are tired but no less enthusiastic and everyone here has pulled together to deliver truly exceptional care for our patients and their families. “We have had to adapt constantly which has provided its challenges, from phone calls and video calls with loved ones, to the changing guidelines and wearing PPE throughout but I couldnapost be prouder of every single colleague. “Our association with the Duchess of Cornwall is such a special bond and it makes all the dference to everyone for her to support us as she has throughout her patronage since .” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Camilla, Duchess of CornwallPlan BNHSThe TimesEducationRoyal FamilyMental healthAlzheimers diseaseChristmas lightsChristmas treesCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

We have lost loved ones, seen our frontline workers placed under immeasurable pressure, and we have experienced heart-wrenching isolation from those we hold most dear. “Alongside this, we have seen how communities have come together to support those most in need. And through our separation from others, we have been reminded just how powerful human connection is to us all. Just how much we need one another. And how loving and feeling a sense of belonging to one another can provide comfort in tough times. The importance of simply being together.  “In our roles, William and I are so fortunate to meet and spend time with phenomenal people across the country who day-in day-out support iniduals and families. And over the past two years, we have been truly inspired by countless people who have brought their communities together through simple acts of long and kindness. This carol service is our small way of recognising the inspiring contribution so many of you have made. Thank you. Christmas is a time when we can reflect on the past, listen to one another, focus on the relationships that nurture us and build our resilience, so we can look forward to a shared brighter future. My hope is that this service creates a moment for us to do this together. Over the next hour we will celebrate the power of this time of year. And I wish you all the very best for the year ahead.” Kate and Wills also chatted with Ellie Goulding and Leona Lewis who performed at the bash.

Carole Middleton has previously told of how she normally allows her grandchildren - who include Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis - to decorate one of her Christmas trees.However, Covid restrictions last year meant Carole, who runs the party supplies business Party Pieces, was unable to see the youngsters and instead they carried out the tradition via Zoom.However, taking to the Party Pieces Instagram page, the grandmother-of-five confirmed the tree decorating ceremony would be taking place again this year. She wrote: Once again this year we plan to have two Christmas trees: one for the children to decorate and one which I do myself. And it seems that helping out the royal children will be Kateaposs sister Pippaaposs kids Arthur and Grace.Meanwhile, Carole also previously revealed another decoration she will be hiding around her home for her grandchildren - Christmas gonks.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

In recent years, the Scandinavian gnomes have boomed in popularity across Britain and Carole, whose Party Pieces business sells the dolls, also wrote on her firmaposs Instagram page: I’m going to need a few of these cheeky chaps this December, to hide around the house and make my grandchildren laugh. “As much as I love immaculate decorations, we can’t be too serious at Christmas!”Itaposs believed that Kate and Prince William along with George, Charlotte and Louis will be spending Christmas this year at Sandringham with the rest of the Royal Family before spending time at the Middletons.But despite effectively celebrating Christmas three times, one royal expert has said William and Kate will be sure to try not to spoil George, Charlotte and Louis too much.Royal expert Duncan Larcombe has said the couple will want their children to feel normal and won’t be lavishing them with expensive gts.Mr Larcombe told OK! that the family will be celebrating Christmas on their own, together with the more formal event at Sandringham with Williamaposs family and spending time with Kate’s family.He said: I think we’re looking at three Christmases rolled into one for William and Kate and their children. “There will be Christmas on their own with their kids, the more formal celebrations at Sandringham with William’s family and then time with Kate’s family, the Middletons. But something we know for sure about William and Kate is that they want their children to feel normal and so they certainly won’t be lavishing them with expensive gts, that’s for certain. They won’t let them be spoiled.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Prince GeorgePrincess CharlotteRoyal FamilyKate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Julie Simpson visited Cargo Fleet Social Club, in Middlesbrough, to cheer on her darts playing partner, only for members to allegedly shout get your lass out of here at her. The alleged yelling happened after Julie stepped foot in the bar - where women were not permitted - rather than the lounge area. But a club secretary has fired back, insisting rules are rules - and claimed they donapost let women enter the bar over fears they would be exposed to bad language or fighting. Julie, who has worked in hospitality since she was a teenager, said she felt humiliated by the incident, and is now questioning why, in , rules like this still exist. The drama unfolded on Sunday night, after teetotal Julie drove herself and her partner to the Middlesbrough club for the darts league match.  She said: We both went to the bar to order our drinks, and the next thing we knew we were being shouted at - they were shouting aposget your lass out of here! Get your lass out of here! Sheaposs not allowed in here so get her out!apos It was really degrading - I just thought to myself what the heck  And it was just normal customers bellowing at me. But there was a woman barmaid in there, and as I was talking to her she just told me that they are aposold fashioned in hereapos.” Julie said she was left feeling about “two foot tall”. She continued: “I turned to my other half and said aposlook, play your darts and Iaposll come back and pick you up - but he said no. I go everywhere with him, and Iaposve never experienced anything so horrible. It was disgusting. Julie claimed there were no posters on the clubaposs wall explaining the rules, nor did the barmaid flag it up.  Yet for the clubaposs secretary Brian Wilson, her gripes fall flat. He insists the venue is all about inclusiveness, citing the -plus women who drink there as guests - although as non-members they arenapost allowed a vote. They get a card, and they are allowed to go to the Christmas party - it is all free for them - and it seems the only person who is complaining is a woman from a dferent club, he said. And I think sheaposs bulls******g, as we have a lady who plays five and threes every Wednesday, and she comes and sits in the same room as . He believes her claims are an attempt to give the club a bad name - and insists the rules are there more to shield women from the antics of boozed-up blokes. He added: It is an old fashioned working menaposs club and we donapost think it is rightwhen there are men effing and blinding in the bar - it isnapost right when there are ladies sitting there. When askedwomen are incapable of handling hearing swear words, he added: Well some would. Butyou had a couple in on a night out, and a fight breaks out at the bar, it isnapost very nicetables are going over. We donapost have no lady members in the club, they are all guests and we have a dart room and we allow them to sit in the dart room. But because of the bad language situation and the drunken situation, we donapost like women in the bar. Legally, the  Equality Act allows clubs or organisations to restrict membership to people who share a protected characteristic - which includes gender. Brian said the club aims to make women feel welcome. We have plenty of room for them, we have a great big lounge for them with music and bingo on. Butthey do come with an away darts team, we do allow them to sit inbut we do not allow them to go to the bar, unless they go to the bar in the lounge. He suspects the club is one of around three of four local venues that still prohibit women from entering the bar area. The clubaposs rules mean women can visit as guests - but canapost be full fee-paying members. He added that they enjoy all the perks of the club, apart from access to certain parts as well as the vote given to the men who pay subs. He added: Our other lady members donapost have a problem with it, so I donapost see why someone from another place should. We do a lot for the community. We have a Christmas party for the pensioners - all women - they are not members but we pay for it They get £ each, a good feed and a turn on. Weaposve never had one complaint from a woman in this club. So for someone to come from another club and complain - I just canapost believe it. Yet Julie couldnapost believe she had fallen victim to rules she thought had vanished decades ago. And she has also questioned that,the venue is so concerned about women hearing bad language, why they would employ female barmaids. What happened would be degrading to any woman. The more I think about it, the more I feel discriminated against and degraded,” she said. To be shouted out, and told no women in here - I just donapost understand.

Leaked minutes of a meeting of the government’s scientic advisers held on Tuesday revealed the shocking numbers. While the predictions around the Omicron iant were dramatic, the overall scale of hospitalisations is still uncertain.But the figures, which had been seen by the BBC, made clear that an urgent response was needed to reduce spread and pressure on the NHS. It comes as Boris Johnson announced this evening that government guidelines would include advice to work from home due to the scale of the iant.Such changes raise concerns about Christmas festivities, as families hope to gather for celebrations after a dficult festive period in .The Prime Minister is already facing a growing backlash for a Christmas Party reported to have been held in Downing Street last year while much of the country was under tough restrictions. The government is currently trying to slow the spread of the Omicron iant to allow for more people to get their booster jabs. The UK has reported  new cases of the iant today, the UK Health Security Agency confirmed. The total total number of confirmed cases of the mutant strain now stands at . There is growing early evidence that booster vaccine doses could be an effective defence against the Omicron iant, despite the strain being the most mutated iant of the virus detected so far.BioNTech and Pfizersaid today a three-shot course of their vaccines produced a neutralising effect on the new Omicron strain in a laboratory test.The announcement was the first statement from the manufacturers on the likelihood of their shots being effective against the iant. They added that a vaccine targeting the rapidly spreading strain could be delivered by March next year.  The Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciescomprises around  scientists, who offer advice to the government on how to react to the pandemic in the UK.Minutes of their latest meeting this week said it was “highly likely” the new Omicron strain would account for the majority of new coronavirus infections in the UK within “a few weeks”.“With the speed of growth seen, decision makers will need to consider response measures urgently to reduce transmissionthe aim is to reduce the likelihood of unsustainable pressure on the NHS,” they continued. Scientists also cautioned the peak of the wave was “highly likely to be higher” than , - , Omicron hospital admissions per day without new rules to slow the spread of rising infections. According to the latest seven-day average, there were currently around  people being admitted to hospital each day with the Delta iant in England. In comparison, hospitals were admitting , Covid patients a day at the peak of the last winter wave. Another point that was not yet clear was whether Omicron would replace infections from the older Delta iant or whether both strains would spread simultaneously. Scientists also said the rate and other specics around the spread would depend on the degree to which they infected dferent groups or demographics of people. The minutes from the meeting went on to say: “Evidence suggests that measures could be reintroduced with expectation of a similar level of adherence as has been seen in the past. “Adherence is likely to be highermessaging and policy have clear rationales and are consistent. Other points covered by the advisors were that the number of omicron infections in the UK was now increasing rapidly, with evidence of community transmission. Hospital admissions from Omicron were expected to follow soon. Taking measures which would slow or delay the Omicron-driven wave of infections would allow more time for vaccination. This could aid the situation in ensuring increasing coverage and booster shots of existing vaccines. The current speed of growth meant decision makers needed to consider response measures urgently. If the aim was to reduce the likelihood of unsustainable pressure on the NHS, transmission needed to be reduced. SAGE scientists also stated that the reduction in severity of disease from Omicron would not avert high numbers of hospitalisations,growth rates remained as high as they were currently.

He said the new rules are coming into force as the doubling time of the new strain could be between two and three days - meaning its spread will be rapid. Face masks have already been mandatory by law in England’s shops, supermarkets, gt shops, indoor shopping centres, public transport including taxis and indoor stations, banks and post offices since November . They are also compulsory at hair salons, barbers, nail salons, massage centres, tattoo and piercing studios.  You must also wear a face mask during driving tests and lessons - plus at pharmacies, vets, auction houses, retail galleries, takeaways , estate and lettings agents, high street solicitors and accountants. Under-s are exempt and anyone who canapost wear face coverings for medical reasons. But from Friday they will become mandatory in more venues. They must be worn in theatres, places of worship, cinemas, public libraries or community premises.  Those who do not comply can be fined £ for a first offence , doubling on each repeat offence up to £,. Police will be expected to enforce the rules. But there are exemptions when you are eating, drinking, singing or exercising so face masks are not mandatory in pubs, restaurants or gyms. Secondary schools in England were recommended to ask pupils to wear masks in communal areas and corridors at the end of November. There are reports of talks ongoing about whether to extend this. However there was no immediate announcement.  Under the government’s ‘Plan B’ rules, any contact of a suspected Omicron case will be forced to isolate for  days. Mr Johnson said: “We will reintroduce the guidance to work from home. “Employers should use the rest of the week to discuss working arrangements with their employees but from Monday you should work from homeyou can. “Go to workyou must but work from homeyou can.” However Mr Johnson also said Christmas parties could go ahead but that people should exercise caution. He said: Itaposs OK to keep going with Christmas parties but obviously everybody should exercise due caution, have ventilation, wash your hands, get a test before you go - give everybody  confidence they are going to be meeting somebody who is not contagious.” It came as the PM apologised unreservedly over allegations of a Christmas party held at Downing Street last year when lockdown rules banned social gatherings – but he continued to deny all responsibility.

The cute framed snap could be seen on a side table resting alongside her trusty black handbag.Andyou look closely it appears to show the Queen and Philip sitting on a sofa with the Queen holding a young Princess Charlotte on her knee.It seems as though Prince George is standing behind them with Isla Phillips - daughter of Peter Phillips - to the side of Her Majesty. Mia Tindall - the daughter of Zara and Mike Tindall - appears to sit in between her great-grandparents with Savannah Phillips - Peteraposs other daughter - seemingly standing proudly beside Philip.Itaposs thought the picture must have been taken before  as some of the younger great-grandchildren donapost feature.

Dedicated servants, many who were forced to spend substantial amounts of time away from their loved ones over the pandemic after entering protective bubbles at Windsor Castle and Balmoral to protect the monarch, said there was “palpable anger” at the revelations over illegal lockdown parties in government.The Queen was evacuated from Buckingham Palace at the start of the pandemic and formed a support bubble with her beloved late husband Prince Philip who moved from his home at Wood Farm on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk.Other royal staff said “sacrices made from the very top all the way down” to keep people safe were being rendered “worthless”. One servant with more than  years service within the household said some colleagues had become “visibly upset” when discussing how the Queen was forced to sit alone at her beloved late husband’s funeral in April due to coronavirus restrictions.Her Majesty, like thousands of others across the nation as the pandemic raged on, complied with covid restrictions leaving them to alter plans for funerals or tragically being unable to say goodbye to their loved ones as they lay dying in hospital. Staff who cared for the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh throughout the pandemic told how they had made “huge sacrices” to maintain strict covid bubbles in the belief they were “doing out bit” to keep the monarch safe from the deadly virus. One said: “It would be a gross understatement to say people are angry. “Many missed Christmas, birthdays, other special occasions and weeks on end away from their families. “But it was all in the spirit it was for the greater good and we were doing our bit. “It’s a slap in the face for anyone frankly.”  The Queen was last year forced to spend a final Christmas alone with Prince Philip at Windsor Castle, before he passed away aged  in April. The image of the -year-old dressed in black with a black mask covering nearly her entire face while sitting alone in St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle will be forever etched in the nation’s memory. Labour leader Sir Keir on Wednesday highlighted the head of state’s leadership and the sacrices she made at the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral during the Covid- crisis at Prime Minister’s Questions.He was speaking as Boris Johnson faced the furore over claims Downing Street staff broke lockdown rules by holding a Christmas party last year.Sir Keir told the Commons: “Her Majesty the Queen sat alone when she marked the passing of the man she’d been married to for  years. “Leadership, sacrice - that’s what gives leaders the moral authority to lead. “Does the Prime Minister think he has the moral authority to lead and to ask the British people to stick to the rules ” The Queen was due to have her weekly audience with the Prime Minister on Wednesday, either by person or by phone. Buckingham Palace did not comment. Her Majesty has been resting on doctors’ orders and only carrying out light duties such as audiences since spending a night in hospital for preliminary tests on October , and later spraining her back. She is also preparing to film her Christmas Day message to the nation. The Queen is likely to use her annual pre-recorded televised speech, which she writes herself, to reflect on the ongoing challenges facing the country, as well as touching on her own personal grief with the loss of Philip in April. The royal family is hoping to gather to celebrate Christmas with the monarch at her Sandringham estate in Norfolk after last year’s festivities were curtailed due to the pandemic.

Tamekia Thompson, , says she is desperate to move from her south London home. The mum-of-two claims rodents eat her food, and the floors and cupboards are strewn with thousands of droppings.Tamekia, a private tenant who moved into the property in  with her two young children, said the house became infested with mice two years ago, MyLondon reports. She said her seven-year-old daughter is incredibly stressed and she is terried her four-year-old autistic son who will eat anything will ingest the droppings and get sick. Tamekiaaposs landlord claims he has put in measures to address the infestation.  Christian Mantey told MyLondon he has a contract with a pest control company, who have laid traps in the house and have agreed to visit every two weeks to dispose of dead mice and fill in holes. He added that the process is taking longer than usual because pest control cannot put poison down over safety concerns with Tamekiaaposs son. He also explained that the tenant is aware of this. Mr Mantey said he has now issued a Section  eviction notice to Tamekia, who has not paid her rent for around seven months. He said: Iaposve given [Tamekia] her Section  notice telling her to leave because sheaposs in arrears of £,. In terms of the rodent issue in the house, thereaposs been pest control that has come to the property, I think about a month ago while she was there. They set up all the traps and all the other equipment they needed in front of her. She said they canapost put certain traps around because of the kids, so they adjusted the traps according to how she wanted it. They come every two weeks, Iaposve got a contract with them that they will come every two or three weeks to pick up the dead mice or whatever they find, and to fill up the holes. He added: Iaposm doing what Iaposve got to do, the pest control is doing what theyaposve got to do, you canapost eradicate these things straight away. Tamekia claims she is withholding the rent due to problems with the house, including the rodent infestation.She said that she left her job in August to care for her son full time and is now dependent on Universal Credit from Croydon Council to pay her rent, which she says she hasnapost paid due to the mouse infestation.Tamekia says she was told by a pest control worker that, because of the severity of the infection, it would be tricky to get rid of them. Tamekia also said the house also has severe issues with damp on one of the walls. However, Mr Mantey claims Tamekia has never told him that her failure to pay rent is due to her problems with the house, or the mouse infestation. Mr Mantey also claims he has had someone fix the damp in the house two years ago and Tamekia didnapost complain again until two weeks ago. He said he has recently been contacted by Croydon Council about the house, who he said have given him  days to get aposspecicapos jobs done in the house, including fixing the damp and repairing the windows. He said: There are people coming to do the whole property. Iaposm sorting it. Speaking about the mouse infestation, he added: Getting rid of any infestation takes whatever itaposs going to take. Tamekia, who is currently on a housing waiting list with Croydon Council, moved into the house to support her sister, who had access to the property under the Shared Lives scheme through the council. The former care worker said: My kids are scared, screaming, crying, they donapost want to sleep in the room. My daughter said to me aposmummy Iaposm stressedapos... and it really broke my heart. I can tell sheaposs frustrated. She said: [My son] will eat anything, you have to be watching him. Tamekia said her family gets sick a lot: My kids they are vomiting and stuff like that... every minute we are catching colds... itaposs just hard work for me to be cleaning [mouse] poo every day... The council confirmed Tamekia is on a housing waiting list but have advised her to seek alternative accommodation due to a housing shortage. Steve Reed, MP for Croydon North, also raised the issue with the council in September, but contacted Tamekia on November  to say he was yet to receive a response. A Croydon Council spokesperson told MyLondon that they have advised Tamekia on her current private arrangement with her landlord. They say they have advised her to seek alternative accommodation through the private rented or social housing sector, as there is a housing shortage. A council spokesperson said: “Although this is not a council property, we have provided Ms Thompson with advice and support around her housing options in both the private rented sector and social housing.

That is three times the number of cases, ,, logged on this day last year. Hospitalisations and deaths are signicantly lower now than they were at the beginning of December  however. On Tuesday  people died and , were in hospital with Covid, compared to  deaths and , patients in hospital a year ago. Have you been affected by Omicron  Email webnews@mirror  While the Covid vaccine is primarily responsible for this much-improved situation in terms of fatalities and the strain on the NHS, the Omicron iant has made the future much more uncertain than it was just a few weeks ago. Scientists have warned that the mutant strain could be three times more infectious than other iants. They predict that , people in the UK are catching the new iant each day while new cases are doubling every three days. Although much research into Omicron is yet to be done, there have been some suggestions that it can evade the vaccines to at least a small degree. At the moment deaths and hospitalisations - while high compared to other European countries - are steady.However,they start to rise over the coming weeks, the Government may decide to bring back restrictions designed to stop the coronavirus spread.Boris Johnson is reportedly considering Plan B for the festive period which could be put in place in the coming days, possibly even as soon as tomorrow. He may decide to do sothe spread of Omicron is threatening to overwhelm the NHS. At the moment scientists believe that Omicron cases in the UK are doubling every three days. Professor Neil Ferguson told the Today programme this morning that the new iant would be the dominant one, overtaking Delta, by Christmas. The Imperial College London epidemiologist predicted that Omicron cases would peak in Januaryno additional measures were taken by the Government.Prof Ferguson said a new year lockdown is apospossibleapos, although it depends on how much pressure the NHS faces in the coming weeks.When pressed about the chance of a lockdown in the new year, he said: At the moment itaposs very dficult to rule out anything we really havenapost got a good enough handle on the threat. If the consensus is itaposs highly likely that the NHS is going to be overwhelmed then it will be for the Government to decide what it wants to do about that but itaposs a dficult situation to be in of course. Itcertainly might be possible at the current time.  He said a laboratory-based South African study published last night indicated that Omicron can evade antibodies developed against the original strain better than any iant so far. Professor Ferguson anticipated that case numbers, which are currently doubling every two to three days, will accelerate aposquite markedlyapos within a week or two. The Government may decide to reintroduce social distancing measures to stop the rise in cases getting out of control. Its Plan B would mean people being told to work from home to limit the spread of the virus while vaccine passports could be enforced for entering events with crowds including football matches, it is reported.  If the rules are introduced, many Brits may be left with a feeling of de-ja-vu. A week before Christmas  a planned relaxation of rules for the festive period were scrapped due to the emergence of the Delta iant. Prime Minister Boris Johnson held a press conference on December  announcing that Christmas as planned was effectively cancelled. From midnight that day a new tier four was introduced, banning people from mixing indoors with anyone not from their household.

The mercury is set to hit double digits by the end of the week after plummeting to below zero in some places.From Thursday, December , conditions will improve and it will come as much-needed relief following Storm Arwenapos s lashing over the UK last month and the continued battering from Storm Barra today. Grahame Madge, a spokesman for the Met Office, told the Mirror: There are no weather warnings and that is indication weather conditions are going to become more stable. We will still have weather such as frost and rain, but the impact on people will be a lot less. The potential to cause disruption is reduced. He also said that that from tomorrow, temperatures will start to climb again. Mr Madge said: In the period over the next few days temperatures are coming back up and the risk of snow is really confined to areas above -metres such as in the Scottish Mountains. Meaning impactful snow at low levels is not likely to be a feature of the forecast.  There is a system that will bring rain overnight and into Thursday and Friday, and it will then largely be clear. Conditions may become more choppy, but there are no further warnings scheduled. From that point of view itaposs more stable. He added: For the most part in Southern and Central England temperatures in the daytime are in the double figures with Bristol reaching  and Nottingham reaching  degrees. The only places that will stay in single digits will be parts of Scotland, Newcastle, Leeds and Northern Ireland. Crucially, overnight temperatures in Southampton and London are predicted to remain in double figures.The Met Office long-range forecast predicts bright spells in the East and showers from the will West come in.Hill snow is still likely up North, but temperatures will hover at about the average for the time of year - which is about C.  There is a risk of another largely unsettled period with further showers and longer spells of rain, heavy in places, with a chance of gales for some exposed areas, but not until after conditions improve first. It comes after Storm Arwen left thousand without power after mph winds and lashing rain at the end of November, and as Storm Barra continues to batter the UK for a second day. Today, Brits are being warned to prepare for strong winds, rain and ice leading to flooding as the country is battered for a second day by Storm Barra.  Gales and snow blizzards caused chaos on Tuesday with wind gusts reaching mph at Aberdaron, in Gwynedd, while around , homes in north-east Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales lost power. Now dozens of flood warnings have been issued across the UK along with the Met Office also issuing a yellow weather warning of gales in England for Wednesday. New rules for traders and hauliers who move goods into Great Britain from the EU come into force on Jan  . There is still time to take action and keep your business moving. There is plenty of support on offer and the Government is ready to help you navigate your way through these new changes. Visit GOV.UK Brexit to prepare for the new rules today. The Environment Agency has issued  flood warnings for England at locations including Hartlepool and Sunderland in the North East, Bournemouth and Weymouth in the South, and part of the Cumbrian coast.  Some  flood alerts, for areas where flooding is possible, have also been issued across the country. The continued chaos comes as communities in the North East and Scotland are still trying to recover from the catastrophic effects of Storm Arwen. Thousands of homes lost power for up to  days in the wake of mph winds and lashing rain at the end of November.  Northern Powergrid has not confirmed whether all homes were connected by Tuesday night as promised. Met Office forecasters said Storm Barra may not cause as much chaos as Storm Arwen – though it has already sparked travel delays and school closures in Scotland. Spokeswoman Nicky Maxey said: “We are not expecting the impacts of Barra to be as bad as we saw with Arwen. “Storm Barra will bring strong winds and heavy rainfall to many parts of the UK today. We may see some snow on the higher ground, too. “It is unlikely to be as impactful as Storm Arwen last week but there will be blustery conditions so people should still be prepared.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Met OfficeEnvironment AgencyNew YearSnowWeatherFloodsBREXIT EU NEWSJACKING\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But the mph winds of Storm Barra brought more danger and destruction. In Scotland, more than , properties were without power - just days after the final homes were reconnected after Arwen hit on Nov . Northern Powergrid apologised to its customers, and thanked them for their patience, particularly in the hardest hit areas of Northumberland and Co Durham.  They pledged to look at ways to improve their performance “in the event of major power cuts”. “We have made some changes,” said a spokesman. “We will learn more lessons from the reviews that will follow.” Mary and Terry Laycock, who live in a small hamlet at the foot of the Cheviot Hills near Wooler, Northumberland, were among the last people to get power back on. “I don’t think they knew we existed. We just seemed to be forgotten about,” she said. “Mountain rescue came to see us and the police also came round with leaflets to say where we could get a free hot meal.  “I have been cooking on two gas canisters and we have also been for fish and chips. I think I have lost everything in the freezer but at least my daughter took the Christmas turkey back to hers.” John Charlton, a Northern Powergrid engineer, was doing -hour days. “Everyone has really dug in deep to get everyone back on supply,” he said.Met yellow weather warnings remained in place in England and in Wales, with the risk of power outages, and flying debris.Bryngwyn Comprehensive School in Llanelli, Wales, shut temporarily after  mph gusts ripped off part of its roof. No one was injured. Wind speeds of  mph were recorded in Aberdaron, Gwynedd, a week after a  mph gust was recorded in Aberporth, Ceredigion, during Storm Arwen. Coastal communities were warned to take care close to piers and harbours, with huge waves hitting seaside towns in Dorset, Devon and Cornwall. The waves were so large in the village of Borth in Ceredigion, Wales, that locals were asked to avoid the area completely. Hyder Ali Pirwany, of Okehampton, Devon, filmed a hailstorm that left the streets carpeted in white. He said:”There was thunder and lightning at first, followed by heavy sleet and hail which piled up like snow. “It knocked out my television and FM radio reception - it is back now almost  hours later.” The Scottish Environment Protection Agency issued  flood alerts and three flood warnings, with more rain forecast today.

Although itaposs a magical place and brings joy to their kids, the parents spend much of their day queuing for rides, holding the bags, and forking out for expensive snacks.

In fact, there are several dferences when celebrities take their little ones to Disneyland - meaning they donapost have to endure quite as much hassle as us Average Joes. Perhaps the biggest dference is how they get in and out of the park in the first place, with a series of special doors to ensure the A-listers of the world can go about their park fun without detection.

The door to the original Club  lounge is designed to look unassuming and like any other door in the park, but inside is a plush bar with fancy furniture in the dining area. Once the VIP guests have finished up in the lounge, they can enjoy fast passes to the bigger rides in the park that attract the biggest queues - although even being famous canapost get you out of queuing altogether, and fast passes tend to be a - minute wait.

Another agreed: Of course her children think youaposre overreacting they were raised by this human bulldozer and donapost know any better. Their opinions on boundaries canapost be trusted.

For those who are unfamiliar with the concept, Elf on the Shelf was created to encourage good behaviour in the run-up to Christmas. The premise behind it is that you tell your children that the elf will report back to Santa Claus each night to say who has been naughty or nice, ing in the morning to a new spot in the house. But coming up with  dferent locations for your elf can be quite a tough task. This is why one mum spends all year getting ready for the naughty elfaposs antics. Mum-of-five Julie Ann Thorn has been doing elf on the shelf for the past eight years and spends months preparing and collecting props for her extravagant scenes.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. From filling entire rooms with balloons and polystyrene to building a huge snow globe in her lounge and even asking her sonaposs dad to get a tattoo of the elf as part of one of the pranks, Julie Ann has really thought of it all. Julie now mainly creates the magic for her youngest son, youngest son, Finley, seven, with the help of her older sons, Liam, , Evan, , Owen, , and Lucas,  and her husband, Graeme, . Julie said: I have always loved Christmas and making a fuss. When I was young my parents were very over the top with it and I wanted to do the same for my family. Iaposd seen a friend doing Elf on the Shelf in the US about eight years ago, so I wanted to try it and make it more exciting for the kids.  And over the years I have just gone more and more extravagant. I spend all year planning my ideas and making notes in a book. Some of the ideas take months of preparation. For example, I once created a winter wonderland using polystyrene from packaging from our new kitchen. It took so long to get it all into black bags and store in the shed until we were ready to use it at Christmas. I even chanced my luck one year and asked Finleyaposs dadhe would get a tattoo of the elf for one of the pranks and on his day off he actually went and got it. I couldnapost believe it.  Finley was in utter shock and was trying to rub the tattoo off of his dad. It was hilarious. Julie says that she feels a lot of pressure to perform with the elf on the shelf as friends tell her they canapost wait to see what she has created. Her youngest, Finley, is completely absorbed in the magic of it, so Julie is determined to keep it alive and spends  months planning and looking for amazing ideas. She added: Finley races downstairs every morning to see what the elf has been up to. He knows that on the first night of December the elf sneaks into his room and changes his bedding while he is asleep and there are glittery footprints left through the house. All of his brothers get involved too which makes it extra special. I look for props all year round and I make lists in the back of my notebook to plan ahead for December. I like to keep a note of any good ideas on social media too. I am usually quite organised and have everything sorted in advance, but sometimes I come across things and improvise, for example, I recently managed to get my hands on a cardboard Coca Cola truck that I am going to use. I think I am going to fill it with shopping and then Finley can donate it to a local food bank. Making a snow globe in the living room is one of the most extravagant ideas I have done so far this year.  I bought a paddling pool in the summer to use as the base. And filling rooms with balloons takes quite a lot of days to prepare because of blowing up the balloons. It looks really impressive too. Itaposs sometimes dficult to find places to hide all of our props, but luckily we have a cellar where we can keep things and Finley wouldnapost go down there because heaposs scared of spiders. I love creating such magic for him every day in the build-up to Christmas. I love seeing his face each morning.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Image: GettyopinionByPatrick Reid:,  Dec Updated:,  Dec | commentsWhen I was a rookie futures trader, the owner of my company hired a luxury hotel in Barcelona for our Christmas bash. We had an incredible year trading, and so as a treat he paid for  of us to go on holiday for a knees up.But before we left he issued us with one stern condition: we would not upset the locals and get too drunk. Famous last words.It started quite civilised as we managed to see a football game at Camp Nou and I got to see the beautul city and architecture. I even popped into the Picasso museum for a couple of hours. That is about as good as it got for being well behaved and sticking by the rules set by the boss. During the evening things went downhill - and fast. The club led onto a beach, and after the third tequila a few of the female traders decided to steal my clothes and wear them. Running around trying to look for them was useless, so I just had to borrow a coat from a mate.  The DJ weaposd hired threw a real tantrum and left because he was fed up with our “music requests. What he didnapost know is we all had a bet to see how many times he could play Princeaposs Kiss . Around am the ambulance got called to help an older trader who we thought was having a heart attack. Thankfully it was just really bad heartburn but we were all really worried for him at the time. What got me was he actually came back to the bar for another drink afterwards! What a legend fool - delete as you see fit. The last thing I remember is wearing a trilby hat trying to look cool and failing while chatting up the receptionist - then seeing two couples having sex on the beach, in full view of everyone.  When the bill came we insisted on paying for the clean-up which apparently was nearly as much as the drinks weaposd guzzled. The fallout didnapost come until two months later, but it was a great bonding exercise and I’ll never forget it. I never thought you could have a hangover that lasted a whole week. Turns out you can, but I do not recommend it. Now my le is far more relaxed and I’ll remember those days with affection.... and embarrassment.*Patrick Reid is the co-founder of Adamis Principle and an FX traderRead MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Heart attackChristmas party\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Shannon Richardson, from Banbury, Oxfordshire, says her -month-old son Freddie had been inexplicably waking up every night around am and refusing to go back to sleep, leaving her and partner Jack Gray perplexed. However, the couple were horried to discover the aposexplanationapos - when they heard a aposdeep male voiceapos talking to little Freddie through the camera, which was so clear they thought someone was in the house at first. Racing into their sonaposs room, Jack ripped the aposhackedapos monitor out of the wall from where it had been positioned to film their youngster - before throwing it into a skip. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Shannon, , was left so scared that it could be a aposlocal manapos that she insisted on staying at her mumaposs house even after it had been thrown away and once home had Freddie stay in bed with her. Now the care assistant fears that the man could have been watching their son for weeks and even seeing the couple trying to calm him, with images on the monitor showing Jack climbing into the cot to try to sooth his son. Shannon said: The sickness, upset and disgust we feel is awful. How long has this creep been watching Freddieaposs room  We get him changed after bath times and put him to bed in there. We donapost know how long this has been going on for because, for a while, heaposd been waking up at the same time in the night at around am and we werenapost able to settle him. Jack was getting in the cot to try and comfort him. Weaposd been trying to settle him and nothing would work so we think someone was waking him up. But now weaposve removed the baby monitor, he hasnapost been waking up in the night. Images caught on the monitor show Jack, who works in fire and flood restoration, comforting his son in the cot in the middle of the night in the weeks leading up to the incident in October, to no avail. Shannon said: It was around .am and me and Jack were watching TV. We had the camera on and we heart rustling so we watched it for a minute thinking it was probably Freddie moving around in his cot. All of a sudden, we heard this really deep, male voice and it was so clear, we thought he was in the bedroom. He was saying aposbabyapos and aposbabaapos like he was trying to wake Freddie up. Jack ran upstairs and barged into Freddieaposs room. No one was in there but the monitor moved towards Jackaposs direction. The voice had come through the monitor. Jack just ripped the monitor out of the wall and picked Freddie up. We went into our bedroom and just sat there not knowing what to do. We were in shock. I didnapost know what to believe or to think. Shannon says the manaposs voice had been so clear that they thought someone was in the house and that the incident has left her feeling scared in her own home. Shannon said: Jack threw the monitor in a skip. I didnapost want to be in my house, I kept going to my mumaposs even though the monitor was gone. I didnapost feel comfortable and I was on edge. I was scared because we didnapost knowit was a local man. I wasnapost comfortable putting Freddie to bed on his own so he was sleeping in my bed with me but I had to eventually put him in his own bed so he didnapost get too used to being with me. Shannon had been given the video baby monitor as a gt while she was pregnant and had been using it ever since Freddie was born, Shannon said: I thought it was really handy because when he was in bed, it was nice to be able to see him. Weaposve been using it since he was born. Baby monitors are supposed to be a safe thing to watch your baby. You would never think that someone  would be watching them through it.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Typically, we caused our own downfall - especially during lockdown when hairdressers remained closed. But lots of us have suffered a dodgy visit to the hairdressers, where weaposve walked away with a wonky fridge or even worse, a pudding-bowl cut. Either way, itaposs practically a rite of passage to sport the unsightly cut. But what happens when your dodgy new hairstyle was caused by your GUINEA PIG. Thataposs what happened from one hairdresser - who admits sheaposd had a skinful before falling asleep with her beloved piggie.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Gara Sullivan woke up to discover that her bald guinea pig, called Dixie, had CHEWED OFF her fringe after ing home from a drunken night out. The -year-old said she was in deep sleep after Thanksgiving celebrations and only made the aposhair-raisingapos discovery the following morning. Initially, she was horried by her chewed-up aposdo, but then became worried that the three-year-old piggie had swallowed clumps of her fringe and could be ill. But she discovered the chewed-off strands next to a guilty-looking Dixie - and shared the ordeal on social media, where it left people in stitches. Now hairstylist Gara has vowed to put an end to their cosy sleepovers - as she fears it could take a YEAR for her fringe to grow back. Gara, from Bellevue, Kentucky, US, said: She doesnapost have any hair - itaposs like sheaposs jealous of mine. She has a little hair on her nose but thataposs it, other than that sheaposs completely naked. Sheaposd had quite the meal, it was crazy. I take naps with her all the time butIaposm drunk, my boyfriend will create a little bed on the floor for me because he knows I like to snuggle with her.  I fell asleep and when I woke up in the morning, I went to the bathroom, looked at myself in the mirror and my bangs were gone. I knew she ate them, I went into the living room and they were right there on the floor. She didnapost even swallow them - sheaposd just left them. I felt nothing, I was totally out. It was the night before Thanksgiving and I drank pretty heavily. This will  per cent be the end of our drunken sleepovers. Gara and her boyfriend Alex Kennedy, , first welcomed Dixie into their home three years ago, along with their two other guinea pigs. While Gara knew the curious sow had a taste for human snacks, she never expected her pet to start eating her too. Gara said: Iaposm a hairdresser and I have this tuft at the front now. I had to move my parting across a little bit so thankfully I can hide it, but itaposs not the cutest look Iaposve ever had. Guinea pigs chew on a lot of random stuff but thankfully theyaposre usually in their cage. Sheaposs never eaten my hair before though. Iaposd say itaposll take six months to a year to grow back, itaposll probably get worse before it gets better. Dixie is very lovely, she loves to cuddle. Sheaposs really sweet and likes to nap. She sleeps a lot and doesnapost bite me. My other two are evil and will bite the cr*p out of you. Sheaposs a very chilled one - she just has a taste for human hair. Alex just laughed at me and told me thataposs what I get for sleeping with her. After posting the video on TikTok, Garaaposs clip was viewed more than m times, with .m likes and , comments. Gara said: On TikTok, I love the comments. Theyaposre so funny, everyone is laughing at me. It was so funny, I just couldnapost not share it with people.Entertained social media users joked the naked guinea pig was trying to make itself a aposguinea wigapos - while others noted it was abehaviour called aposbarberingapos.One person said: Itaposs called barbering and it shows dominance lol.

I had a first date planned with a guy that I was really excited about, super cute, really smart, and he has this idea of dressing up in a theme as an icebreaker for our first date, she explained in a clip shared to TikTok.He said letaposs dress up as really obnoxious tourists for our first date, and I LOVED that idea.

Amelia was in the middle of a house move at the time, but that didnapost stop her from putting in the effort when it came to dressing up, so she borrowed her dadaposs tacky shirt and paired it with big, yellow sunglasses. However, when she arrived at the restaurant picked out by her date, she was horried to discover he was not dressed in theme. I walk into the restaurant and he is not in theme. So I said aposyouaposre not in theme apos and he was like aposya I was kiddingapos, she continued. I was too committed at that point so I stayed like that the entire date. Kept the sunglasses on, kept the fanny pack on, and I went out with him again. Amelia went on to explain that things didnapost go beyond a second date, after the man ended things with her because she was too political. He said I was too political because I asked himhe voted. I might be political, but at least Iaposm not boring, she concluded.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

British socialite Maxwell is accused of preying on vulnerable young girls and luring them to massage rooms to be molested by Epstein between  and . Images shown to a New York court during her trial show Epstein and Maxwell embracing one another, riding a motorbike and flying on private jets. One also shows an advert created in which massage therapists were asked to apply to Epsteinaposs Palm Beach home at weekend. Maxwellaposs criminal trial entered its eighth day on Wednesday, after jurors heard testimony from three women who said they were teenagers when she set them up for sexual abuse by the late financier Jeffrey Epstein.  Prosecutors are expected to call one more alleged victim to take the stand, and may wrap up their case as soon as Thursday, about two weeks faster than they had originally forecast. The defence would then have a chance to present a case. It is unclear whether Maxwell would testy, given the prospect she could face a y cross-examination by prosecutors.

Her lawyers have said her accusersapos memories have been corrupted over the years, and that Maxwell is being scapegoated for Epsteinaposs alleged conduct. The globetrotting investor died by suicide in  in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting his own sex abuse trial.  Two of the women who have testied, identied as Jane and Carolyn, said they had sexual contact with Epstein starting when they were . Carolynaposs case underlies Maxwellaposs sex trafficking charge, because she was allegedly paid for interactions with Epstein. She said the encounters began as massages before escalating. In more than four hours of often tearful testimony on Tuesday, Carolyn recalled telling Maxwell about her troubled childhood, including that her mother was an alcoholic and that she was molested by her grandfather at age . She also said she was nude and preparing to massage Epstein, when Maxwell once fondled her. What she did was wrong, Carolyn said. Maxwellaposs lawyers have argued that Carolyn, Jane and a third woman who testied for the government, Kate, had incentives to implicate Maxwell because they received seven-figure settlements from a compensation fund for Epsteinaposs victims. Kate was described as a victim in the  indictment against Maxwell, but U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan ruled that her encounters with Epstein were not illegal because she was old enough to consent.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Private jetsCrimeTeenagersAlcoholismGhislaine Maxwell\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

If it works, it will be a game-changer.The firm has applied for planning permission to place a miniature version of the new windsurf turbine on the power station site for  months to monitor its effectiveness.Mr Dickinson said that theof time would give the company a full yearrsquos access to trialling the turbine in all seasons on the exposed coastal site.The turbine itself, which he describes as looking like an upside-down egg whisk, features five blades which are electronically operated and computer controlled.The smart technology allows the computer to move the blades with the wind to gain maximum energy from it, as well as monitoring for any kind of impact.Mr Dickinson compared it to having Olympic sailor Ben Ainslie at the helm of five sails, controlling them in the wind during a race to get the best performance.And he said: ldquoThe technology involved means thatthere was an impact from a bird, it would instantly shut down and we would know it had happened.

The UK Government and devolved governments are expecting charities to fill the gap and are failing to do their moral duty to all their constituents and look after the deprived.There is something far wrong when millionaires have had substantial increases in their finances during this pandemic when so many have suffered. Since the end of the Second World War, company senior management and directors have increased their income by incredible percentages and have more money than any fair-minded person would agree was acceptable. Many of these people own more property and other goods than they can ever use.Privatisation of public utilities has led to poor services but large profits for shareholders. Scottish Water is one utility still in public hands and is endeavouring to bring facilities up to standard and is still keeping bills at a reasonable level. Other utilities have been split up into small sections with each one expected to show a profit, thus to leading bigger bills for the public.We must have changes so that everyone is looked after as happens in the Scandinavian countries, where the gap between the haves and have-nots is limited and the majority of the electorate are contented with their lot.Ian Turner, Bearsden.LACK OF FORESIGHT ON GAS BOILERSI WAS surprised that the Scottish Government has decreed that no new gas boilers will be supplied and fitted after , which is just over four years away. The problem is that more than a third of the population of Scotland are at present unable to afford the current energy bills, let alone the alternatives, which have to be supplied and fitted at the householders expense.Admittedly a small and totally inadequate grant is available for the heat exchanger types, but these are untried and untested on any scale in this country.

Fundamentally, it comes down to declining player numbers across the board, allied with changes in lestyle and work patterns which mean that clubs need more personnel at their disposal now than, say,  years ago to last the course of a season. It is estimated that that it currently requires  registered players to be able to field two teams on a regular basis. Away matches are particularly problematic because less and less players are willing or able to give up chunks of their morning and evening as well their afternoon.The physicality of modern rugby ndash even at grassroots level ndash is surely also a factor. After the long Covid lay-off, it was inevitable that a substantial number of players, especially those in the older age brackets, would decide that they quite like waking up on a Sunday morning and not feeling like the have been run over by a bus. In many cases, people just got out of the habit of playing on a Saturday, and of leaving the house to train on a Tuesday and Thursday, so they ended up retiring almost by accident.Scottish Rugby ndash the gamersquos governing body in this country ndash is not responsible for this worrying trajectory, but it has a responsibility to do more to address the issue.The first step should be recognising what everyone at ground level knows: that there are not , active male players in the country. Massaging this stat makes sense from a PR perspective, especially when it comes to the challenge of persuading the Scottish Government, sportscotland and ious commercial partners that rugby is a sport worth getting behind. However, until the problem is properly acknowledged, we canrsquot possibly hope to tackle it.In fairness, Scottish Rugbyrsquos lsquoGame On Principlesrsquo initiative, which facilitates lower regional league matches and friendlies going ahead when a team has as few as  players, is a specic attempt to ensure that available players donrsquot miss out because they donrsquot have enough team-mates. But it is a sticking-plaster solution which doesnrsquot address the fundamental problem, and anecdotal evidence indicates that clubs are more likely to call-off than send out  players to fulfil a fixture.We need practical solutions ndash and that means money. It has been just under  months since the Scottish Government provided Scottish Rugby with a poundmillion grant and poundm low-interest loan ldquoto support rugby clubs across Scotland that have been affected by the pandemic, and despite assurances of openness from Murrayfield, we have still not had sight of how that money has been spent. There is also unease about the lack of clarity on what specically this money was meant to be spent on.A pound.m funding package for clubs was announced by Murrayfield in April ndash consisting of poundk for lsquorecoveryrsquo, poundm for lsquo to rugbyrsquo and poundm spread over five years for lsquogrowth and participationrsquo ndash with clubs to apply for specic grants.We have no idea at this stage how the distribution of this money is progressing.Contrast this with how the Scottish Government funding allocated to football at the same time was handled, with the full poundm grant for clubs outside the top-flight being immediately disbursed by the SFA directly to clubs ndash no need for an application process ndash at values based on the league each club plays in.Scottish Rugby chief executive Mark Dodson and chairman of the board John Jeffrey have told us how well the business has coped with Covid, so letrsquos see that translated into meaningful, direct investment in the grassroots. There are some great facilities out there, but far too many clubs are working out of crumbling relics from the s or earlier. Mini rugby clubs are competing for players againstyouth football teams who are operating in a dferent financial stratosphere, with paid coaches, state-of-the-art facilities andbrand-new kit. We need more development officers working inside clubs and schools, rather than pen pushers sitting behind desks at Murrayfield.Wouldnrsquot it be great to be able to give every kid in Scotland who joins a rugby club a new ball that they can practice at home with  That is something which could have an immediate impact on growing the game.Until we get a breakdown of how the government bail-out has been distributed, the suspicion will persist that the money has been used to prop up Murrayfieldrsquos finances, with layers of bureaucracy being created to justy a bloated payroll at head office, while the grassroots game is neglected."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed-glasgows-11-9m-kelvin-hall-film-tv-studio-operator-announced","story":"Due to open its doors next Autumn it has been jointly funded by the Scottish Government and Glasgow City Council is set to be a catalyst for growth in Scotlandrsquos screen sector.And today the operator can be revealed for the first time.

Diesel trains continue to generate polluting emissions, and a network largely built in Victorian times clearly canrsquot be expected to fully align with st century environmental standards.Scotland has huge ambition when it comes to greening rail travel. It has set a target date of  for eliminating diesel across its  kilometres of track, though it is clear that meeting that deadline is going to be a challenge.At present, only % of the network north of the border is electried, compared to % across the UK as a whole. This means that some  kilometres of track in all have been identied as needing electrication.However, other novel solutions are going to be required to decarbonise in the required timescale, including hydrogen and battery power as well as the more traditional overhead wires.Siemens Mobility is working to help shape the future of the railway in Scotland, developing innovative technology that will create a network ready for the low carbon age.Justin Moss, the companyrsquos Head of Sales for Electrication, concedes that a timescale of just  years before diesel is taken out of the picture presents a challenge ndash but is not impossible.ldquoItrsquos not very long away. But we have some real experts when it comes to modelling, looking at areas such as power requirements. We are examining how we can electry further and faster, while being aware that we may not have everything completed by .ldquoWe are looking at the rolling stock we can use andwe can bring in hydrogen and battery power as a kind of sticking plaster to get the biggest reduction in carbon as quickly as possible, with electrication rolled out after that.It is easy to see why expanding the existing electried network is so daunting: it needs considerable infrastructure including overhead wires and existing structures such as bridges could have to be altered to accommodate these.ldquoAlso, Scotland is a country with hills and mountains and there is a challenge in getting power to those areas in the most cost efficient way possible. It may be better to use hydrogen power, for example on the west coast.ldquoWe are working with Transport Scotland and Network Rail to model the routes, look at the best solution to get to net zero as quickly as possible.As a large and specialised global company, Siemens has a recognised capability in areas such as signalling and rolling stock ldquoItrsquos a case of working together very closely as a team to come up with the most efficient solutions. We want to go as quickly as possible, Justin Moss explains.Routes need to be examined, identying which ones are the easiest and most cost effective to electry quickly. At the same time, low or zero carbon alternatives need to be considered for the more dficult ones, including those in remote areas.ldquoYoursquore not going to demolish or fundamentally change things like historic bridges, so itrsquos about how you solve the problem of how you put power there.Equipping a new generation of trains with hydrogen technology could offer an answer, but Mr Moss points out that it is a new and emerging low carbon offering for which there will be huge parallel demand from cars, heavy goods vehicles and heating.ldquoAt the moment, the infrastructure just isnrsquot there to fill the trains up with hydrogen. However Siemens Mobility is partnering with Siemens Energy to provide the full hydrogen rail system including refuelling and green hydrogen supply and currently has two hydrogen rail projects underway in Germany.ldquoElectrication currently offers the best solution as it provides the biggest carbon reduction, so that will always be our starting point. Butyou canrsquot use that technology, hydrogen could be a good route to take.It is likely that some of the trains of the future will be able to operate using dferent power sources ndash or in bi-mode, as the industry calls it.As well as working in the traditional electried way ndash picking up power from overhead wires through a pantograph on the top of the train ndash they may also have an alternative technology using a battery or hydrogen. This would mean their operation could be similar to a current hybrid car, running on one fuel source and then switching seamlessly to the other when necessary.As an example, the trains might run on battery power through stations, avoiding the need for the complex new infrastructure needed for electrication and cutting down on noise.A feasibility study is ongoing and development work currently taking place with Transport Scotland. Other parts of the rail network will also need to be upgraded, including the signalling infrastructure. Smart technologies can not only reduce emissions on their own, but also help to replace a lot of the existing physical trackside infrastructure.Replacing this with on-train and in-cab technology will help in a number of ways by driving cost efficiencies, providing better information for drivers and allowing for a greater frequency of trains, meaning that they can run closer together and consequently that capacity can be increased.ldquoI see signalling as an enabler for decarbonisation, says Campbell Braid, Siemens Mobilityrsquos Signal and Programme Director. ldquoBut itrsquos expensive and we have to deliver more efficiencies to make it an affordable part of the process.ldquoWe need to convert a lot of the existing mechanical infrastructure such as signal boxes, which means upgrading the technology to make it electrication ready. This will also bring benefits for passengers and freight.There is no single solution, Mr Braid says. ldquoWe need to find a way to deliver more efficiently in order to allow more trains to run to a timetable that allows passengers to move quickly. Thatrsquos where in-cab technology and train detection systems come in.Can Scotlandrsquos railway really be decarbonised as early as , though  ldquoI think the answer to that is yes. We do need to go faster and we need to be dferent, but through a mix and match of technology and rolling stock, wersquoll have a joined up system.www.siemens sustainablemobility------------------------------------------lsquoE-highwaysrsquo look set to be the direction of travelTHERE is no question about it: transport belches out carbon. As a sector, it is responsible for  per cent of global emissions. This means that radical thinking is needed to develop innovative solutions.One promising answer to the problem of pollution caused by road traffic is to build e-highways. These will cut emissions from HGVs, and a number of companies including Siemens have extensively tested them in Germany, Sweden and the United States.In some ways, this proposed technology harks back to the days of trolley buses some  years ago, though it is clearly more sophisticated.E-highways will use powered overhead wires, with lorries having pantographs fitted to draw the electricity.The power supplied would power an electric motor on the vehicle. At the same time, it would charge an onboard battery, allowing the lorry to use this when it drove off the directly electried route.A consortium including Siemens Mobility, is to undertake a pilot e-Highway project in Yorkshire. This is part of the poundm put aside for zero emission road freightfeasibility studies and aims to electry some of the major UK freight roads by .ldquoEffectively, we are taking rail technology and putting it on the motorway, but we now need to see how it will work in terms of logistics, says Siemens Mobilityrsquos Justin Moss.ldquoIt will be a way of reducing carbon output from HGVs, using the sort of overhead line you would find on a light rail system. This would be installed above the slow lane of the motorway for vehicles to attach themselves to.ldquoWersquove identied that the road link between Glasgow and Edinburgh, for instance, would work very well for this sort of technology. It complements the need for getting more freight on the railway.ldquoYoursquore not going to get rid of HGVs completely, but this solution would work in terms of agility.

They are making a comeback now following the rise of OmicronThe report said that Omicron represents a \"very small, but rapidly growing\" proportion of all Covid cases, with  confirmed, highly probable, and possible cases identied in Scotland by December .The prevalence of cases involving the S-gene dropout - a genomic quirk present in the new iant but very rarely found in the dominant Delta strain - is being used to track the spread of Omicron in Scotland.PHS noted that S gene dropout rates had been \"stable and low, at less than  in  cases\" from July to October, but increased sharply from .% as of November  to .% by December .\" alt\"HeraldScotland: Confirmed and probable possible Omicron cases, based on genotyping or S-gene dropouts, have risen rapidly in the past two weeks \" class\"editor-image\"Confirmed and probable possible Omicron cases, based on genotyping or S-gene dropouts, have risen rapidly in the past two weeks It came as the first evidence of reduced vaccine effectiveness against Omicron emerged from studies in South Africa and Germany.The first, from the Africa Health Research Institute in Durban, used blood plasma from  people given a second dose of the Pfizer a month before to test how strong an immune response they were able to mount against Omicron compared to the original Wuhan strain.Researchers found a -fold reduction in the levels of neutralising antibodies - the proteins which bind to the virus surface and block it from infecting cells - in relation to Omicron.Professor Alex Sigal, who led the study, described this as a \"very large drop\" which would lead to an increase in breakthrough infections among the double-vaccinated.However, there was evidence of a stronger antibody response where people had recovered from a prior Covid infection in addition to being fully vaccinated, suggesting the boosters will help.ldquoA good booster probably would decrease your chance of infection, especially severe infection leading to more severe disease,\" said Prof Sigal.\"People who havenrsquot had a booster should get one, and people who have been previously infected should be vaccinated.Matched like for like by age, the Covid mortality rate was six times higher among unvaccinated than fully vaccinated iniduals in Scotland at the end of NovemberMeanwhile, a separate lab test in Frankfurt led by virologist Professor Sandra Ciesek, found that the antibody response to Omicron in people triple-vaccinated with Pfizer was  times lower compared to that mounted in response to Delta.In blood samples from people six months on from their second dose of Pfizer, Moderna, or a mixed course of AstraZeneca-Pfizer, the antibody response \"was not even measurable\", Prof Ciesek added.\"The set of data underscores that it makes sense to develop a vaccine that is adapted to Omicron,\" she tweeted, adding that no conclusion could be drawn about protection against severe disease.: Restrictions to be reviewed daily amid -fold increase in Omicron casesCases of Omicron are estimated to be doubling in the UK every two to three days, and it is expected tobecome the dominant strain within weeks.Restrictions - including the possible extension ofvaccine passports to leisure and hospitality venues - are now being reviewed daily in Scotland amid fears that a combination of increased transmissibility and some vaccine escape could lead to a spike in Covid admissions during winter, at a time when the NHS is already struggling withtreatment backlogs and a substantial rise in emergency admissions compared to the beginning of the year.Around , people per week were being admitted from AE into hospitals at the end of November, compared to fewer than , per week in January and FebruaryEarly hospital data from South Africa has suggested the iant may cause milder disease compared to Delta, but it is unclear whether the same patterns would be replicated in the UK- which has a much older population - or whether admissions data isskewed by higher levels of immunity compared to previous waves and thespread of Omicron infections occurring mainly in younger people.ProfessorAndrew Hayward, a member of the UK governments New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Groupsaid it was too early to say Omicron is milder than previous iants, and stressed that evenit were its ability to spread much faster than Delta posed a severe danger.He said: \"Say for example it was half as severe as the previous strains,you have three times as many cases, thatrsquos still more hospitalisations than we would otherwise have had.ldquoWith it increasing so fast you can get a very, very, very high peak and thats what threatens the NHS capacity.It comes as separate data from PHS shows that Covid hospital admissions fell by % in Scots aged  and overduring November -

And I dont think its too grandiose, you know, to turn to and look for inspiration in the words of people like Martin Luther King who said there comes a time when when its our obligation to break immoral laws.\"Speculation has been re that the government had decided to implement a so-called Plan B of further restrictions, including requiring vaccine passports for large venues and an order to work from home.There were  confirmed Omicron cases in the UK on Tuesday and Downing Street has said there are early signs that the new ian is more transmissible, although much remains unknown. And Nicola Sturgeon, who extended Scotlands work-from-home guidance until mid-January, has warned of a rapid rise in Omicron cases.She said it is vital to \"strengthen compliance\" with existing measures to slow the spread of Omicron.The first minister says she \"cannot guarantee\" further measures will not be needed.The Omicron iant has been reported in  nations and the number of patients needing hospitalisation is likely to rise as it spreads, the World Health Organization has said.The WHO, in its weekly epidemiological report, said more data was needed to assess the severity of disease caused by the Omicron iant and whether its mutations might reduce protection from vaccine-derived immunity.Mr Oliver, whose weekly monologues often go viral on social media said past restrictions including the lockdowns have done as yet \"uncalculated, unmeasured harm to peoples physical and mental health, to the economy, to the education of children\".The former National Trust for Scotland president who faced calls for him to be cancelled after stating he would \"cheerfully risk catching Covid\" in the name of personal freedom added before Boris Johnsons latest announcement: \"And to continue to do that is reprehensible and furthermore, its immoral and you cannot justy submitting to and following the guidelines and restrictions that you know, are morally wrong just because theyve been handed down from on high.\"There comes a time when its beholden upon any of us and all of us to say, Thats immoral, and thats wrong. And just because you as the government are telling me to do it, I will not do it because its immoral and its wrong. That is the right thing to do.\"The archaeologist and author turned TV presenters commentary sparked some debate on social media with his latest comments said he gets s of pieces of mail and he has drawn the conclusion there are millions of people who are opposed to what is going on.He said that he hears from people all the time who say that theyre on the point of losing their jobs because of whether or not they want to take a vaccine.And he said while collective action is needed to stand up against restrictions, he understoodpeople felt they could not put their jobs at risk.The Renfrewshire-born -year-old GB News host who has previously stated that he and his we will not let their three teenage children take the Covid vaccine said: \"I completely understand, empathise and sympathise with people whose first priority is and has to be putting food on the table, making sure that they have an income so that they can look after themselves and look after families,\" he said.\"I hear all the time that people agree with what we are saying, but are frightened to speak.\"Now where someone  in your work, in your shop in your factory, whatever, speaks up, thenmore people stand shoulder to shoulder with them, it doesnt always take everyone to turn the tide.\"One person on the road can be singled out.

The Scottish Government via Transport Scotland have funded around half the £. million costs.The council’s head of marine services, transportation and harbour master, Jim Buck, is confident that the new m modern fibre glass vessel will have been worth the wait.“We are delighted to be able to announce the start date for the Nordic Sea. The Golden Mariana has served the communities well, but it’s time now for a younger, more comfortable vessel to take over. At m, with a m beam, the Nordic Sea will be able to carry  passengers and is capable of running at between - knots, which is a little faster than the Golden Mariana. She has stabilisers installed to help with the motion and is a much more luxurious vessel for passengers and, very importantly, is fully accessible for those who require this.”The ship has attracted plenty of speculation, after long periods of being tied up since being purchased in April . COVID delayed a £, refit programme, and further complicating matters has been the retirement of the previous skipper of the Golden Mariana and the longer-than-anticipated recruitment process for crew to serve on the Nordic Sea.Mr Buck went on to explain why the process has taken longer than some had expected.“It would appear to have taken a long time but actually in respect of the certication process when taking a vessel from one country to another it has actually been remarkably quick. She is the first vessel of her type to go through that process and with that comes inevitable hurdles that need to be overcome. The Nordic Sea had a series of modications made to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication standard.“She was built to a dferent specication so had to go through the required checks and balances to ensure we met the current specications for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency’s current passenger vessel system.”He is confident that she will be a favourable addition to the fleet.“She is a really good sea keeping vessel with good properties designed with the right centre of height for that comfortable ride.”Councillor David Dawson, chair of the board of Orkney Ferries, said: “I would like to recognise the efforts of the team here in Orkney for getting us to this stage, particularly given the challenges added in by the pandemic, but also for the patience of the people of Papay. We must not forget the faithful service of the Golden Mariana and crew who have served the communities well.“From the information I have received from seagoing staff who have taken the Nordic Sea out in what could be described as ‘challenging conditions’, I have every confidence that the Papay community will not be disappointed in what is a first-class vessel.“We are grateful for the support we’ve received from the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland to enable the purchase of the vessel and are looking forward to the inaugural journey.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In an update to the Scottish Parliament this Tuesday afternoon, she explained that the nation#s coronavirus restrictions are to be reviewed on a daily basis in the wake of an increasing number of Omicron cases.She has urged everyone across Scotland to stick closely to the guidelines.

Although folk must still enter via the south nave side door, once inside the cathedral, everyone will be able to enjoy the new glazed timber vestibule.Meredith Macbeth, St Magnus Cathedral#s historical buildings conservator, said: “We are absolutely delighted with the work so far and the new vestibule truly enhances the entryway of this wonderful building. The works are not entirely complete as the curved glass has been delayed by the supplier in Europe due to COVID, Brexit and other supply issues, but we are expecting it early . So for now the area will remain roped off from the public, but it is a delight to see the new vestibule settling in and the excited response by those who know the building so well.”Councillor Gwenda Shearer, chairwoman of OIC#s education, leisure and housing committee, said: “The cathedral really is the gt that keeps on giving to the people of Orkney and further afield.#What a beautul addition to what is a very special building. I look forward to seeing the complete, finished product which is sure to be absolutely stunning.”Elaine Grieve from the Society of the Friends of St Magnus Cathedral, who are making a substantial contribution to the costs of the work, said: “The Cathedral is so precious that it is hard to contemplate making any changes for fear they won’t do the building justice.#However, in this case, what an absolutely wonderful transformation the vestibule has made to the entrance of the building. The craftmanship is outstanding and we now have an addition which befits this treasured building loved by so many near and far.”The cathedral#s stonework also enjoyed a facelt recently.Conservation works included repointing stonework with lime mortar on the interior and exterior of the west door. Samples of original lime mortars were found deep in the constructions joints of the building and were analysed by the Scottish Lime Centre in Fe. An appropriate mix was specied, to match in manner of strength, colour and aggregate size.For anyone wishing to visit there are signs directly through the side gate, please be mindful of the restrictions in place in regards to the pandemic such as the wearing of masks and social distancing while inside.St Magnus Cathedral is managed by OIC on behalf of the people of Orkney.

It shows Allegra Stratton, the Prime Minister#s then press secretary, fielding questions at a mock press conference. on Wednesday morning ahead of travelling to the Houses of Parliament, Mr Blackford said: #I know what Tory MPs think of him, and they have to look at themselves and take their own responsibilities, but how much can we take of a man that can#t be trusted.#This man is a serial liar.” he had been contacted by several upset constituents following the release of the video on Tuesday.  by Mr Blackford which was received from a Highland resident recounted their experience of laying to rest a loved one on the same day as the alleged party took place.The letter read: #It was on the news that they had their party on th December # the same day we had the funeral.#All at the graveside in the freezing cold and snow so we could have the maximum allowed number of  people. We followed the rules, we missed out, while they partied and laughed in our faces.#I switched off the ventilator and was only allowed into the hospital at the last minute, dressed in full PPE. Only two were allowed in, so some of the family even missed that. We were terried to take this virus back to our Highland village # from Glasgow # which had not yet seen any cases.“There were no goodbyes, no visits to hospital, nothing. We had kept away from each other during the lockdowns and we did what we were told.#This news tonight hurts to the core.

He can no longer lead on the most pressing issue facing the country.#The Prime Minister has a duty – the only right and moral choice left to him, is for his resignation.#In response, Mr Johnson apologised for the video and said he was #sickened# by it.

There were no help groups, no mental health care, back then.“We went to my grannys to live for a while and then we came back to the house, the three of us, and that was it. It was a case of paddle your own canoe, really.“My dads going out to work every day as a painter and decorator and we were two young boys going out to school.“Its really just about capturing that time and the values he taught us as kids without ever really knowing he was doing it - or us realising what he was doing. The behaviours, we just kinda copied him.“Thats what I realised as I started to right this thing, that this is what it was...”Ironically, it was his grand daughters prompting that convinced him to put pen to paper in the first place.“About a year ago, my eldest grand daughter said to me - grandad, remember all the old stories you used to tell us when we were kids, about our grandad, racing the pigeons. She told me one of them, almost word for word. I thought, I really must capture those for posterity, for the family. RETIREMENT “Obviously, when retirement and lockdown came into play I had a lot more time on my hands so I sat down at the laptop to fiddle about and to write these wee stories.“As I started, this thing just took on a le of its own and became something completely dferent which was kind of a surprise to me, but a very pleasant surprise, as I really enjoyed writing it.”And I really enjoyed reading it, this simple tale of a hard-working father and his two sons making their way in the world.But the real stars of the book are the pigeons to whom Frankie cleverly lends human traits, such as the ability to talk - characters like Proud Boy, Warhorse and Bootsy.And, of course, Princess Sofia, who we come to learn resembles Frankie’s own mother.The trials and tribulations of the loft in attempting to win the biggest prizes in the sport resemble the struggles faced by Frankie’s family in an era when times were tough.But this isn’t a depressing tale rather, it is an uplting story of how families and, by extension, close-knit communities bandied together to overcome adversity. With a healthy dose of pigeon racing nostalgia thrown in for good measure.“Whilst some of the pigeon names and details have been changed the book is based on true le events,” continues Frankie.“It was never my intention to get the book published, I only started writing it as something to give the grandkids. “I really dont care about the business side of things – its just nice that people can read about my father.“I suppose people are quite surprised about the book but there’s more interest there than anything which is great.“Depending on the feedback who knows, there might even be a second one.”‘The Penzance Smash,’ published by Austin McAuley is out now."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1638889858358.jpg--covid_19___tue_7th_december_figures.jpg?1638889858000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211207newscovid 19 tue 7th december figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows five further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

Presents can be left under the tree in their Church Street shop until  December. Alternatively, vouchers for a haircut in the store can be donated.According to latest figures, around  young people, aged -, leave care each year in Northern Ireland. With more children in care now than ever before, the number is set to grow over the coming years.VOYPIC works across the region, supporting children in care and young people leaving care. The organisation runs ious groups and forums from its office on Garfield Place, as well as supporting inidual young people through coaching and an independent advocacy service.Iain Black, Northern Area Manager at VOYPIC, said, “Christmas is a happy time for most, but for some young people it can be tough. Young care leavers often feel isolated, and Christmas can be a particularly dficult time.“We know that young men leaving care can face a whole range of additional challenges, so we hope that by partnering with The Barber Collective we can start a conversation on how we can help them feel more connected and valued across our community.”Chris Power, from The Barber Collective, explained why the business has decided to support young care leavers.He said: “We realise that we are fortunate enough to be in the position to give and receive gts. Not everyone is as fortunate, but everybody should have a present on Christmas morning.”Gts should be suitable for young people, aged - years old. Presents for young men are particularly need this Christmas. Popular gts include hats, scarves and gloves, home essentials, toiletries, and sweet treats. Gt vouchers, including phone top-ups, utilities vouchers, and supermarket gt cards, are particularly welcomed by young people.Alternatively customers of the Barber Collective can ‘pay it forward’ by gting a voucher for a free haircut to a young man with experience of care.Stuart Forsythe, a care experienced Young Leader in VOYPIC, welcomed the initiative stating: “Sometimes, getting your hair cut can drop down the list of priorities, especially when money is tight. But, sitting in the chair, it gives you time to stop and take a breath, to have a chat with the barber, and to take some time for yourself.”“And, getting your hair cut- it just makes you feel better,” he added.Gts can be left under the tree at the The Barber Collective, Church Street, during working hours until Saturday  December.For more information about VOYPIC, visit www.voypic.org or search VOYPIC across social media.

Costs will rise on the other side. The grant system is not the support it was intended to be.“We need to start with parents, pupils, PTAs, governors and suppliers and schools so everyone understands the challenges and opportunities in each school.“Unorms cannot be a barrier to a child’s entry to a particular school.“There is no one solution. Discussions need to be through consultation from all sides. When tax credits changed for childcare almost  years ago, parents found that childminding costs doubles. That can’t be allowed to happen here.”The Department of Education is reviewing school unorm grant criteria, but admitted it will be  months before it’s in a position to report.Department official Margaret Rose McNaughton admitted that the unorm grant hadn’t increased in ten years and told MLAs she shared concerns that some Boards of Governors were not aware of the impact the cost of unorms could have on families.“We find it ies between schools,” she told MLAs. “Some are very aware of the cost, but until we carry out the research it’s dficult to say with any certainty that every school is fair and reasonable.”Committee chair Chris Lyttle urged a speeding up of the review process, calling the timescale and the cost of unorms incurred by some families as “shocking”.“It’s increasingly concerning that suggestions are made by the Department instead of clear action,” he said.Most ReadNorth Down landowner anger as Stormont department set to list World War Two artillery gun house in his gardenGraeme Campbell: ‘I left NI to live in peace... then crime gang firebombed me out of my home’Michael O’Neill explains ‘respectful’ anthem compromise that his Northern Ireland teams reachedNI taxi driver handed suspended sentence after sharing sex act video in WhatsApp groupLidl gets green light for three new NI storesTop VideosPlayJohnson apologises for offence caused by aides joking about Christmas partyPlayBallywalter pier has been seriously damaged by Storm BarraPlayWatch: Storm Barra makes landfall on Northern IrelandLatest EducationNI teachers #in tears# dealing with Covid crisis in schoolsBrain drain blamed on Northern Ireland’s political ideAlan HutchinsonOpinionIf we’d had one teacher less, normal classes would have been impossible‘Closing of schools must be avoided’, says Children’s Commissioner Koulla YiasoumaNI pupils told: Prepare for part-time schoolLatestBoris Johnson faces Tory anger over Plan B switch amid Christmas party rowRennes hit out at Spurs after European tie is postponed due to Covid- issuesRalf Rangnick ready to help ‘massive talent’ Mason Greenwood developTories admit party took place in HQ during Covid restrictions last DecemberBarcelona knocked out in Champions League group stage for first time since ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

restrictions before Christmas.The chief medical officerand chief scientic advisersaid there are so many unknowns about the Omicron iant that it is not possible to predict what measures may be required to keep it under control.Read MoreMore Covid restrictions not envisaged before Christmas, say Stormont leadersCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Five further deaths and , casesOn Wednesday, the First Minister said he does not believe further restrictions will be required before Christmas.I don#t envisage there being further restrictions before Christmas, the current measures that we have in place,people follow that, that will be able to get us through the Christmas period, Paul Givan said.Speaking at a media briefing later in the day, CMO Professor Sir Michael McBride said: “I wish there were elements of certainty about anything we have been faced with over the last  months.“I think one thing we can say is there is a high degree of uncertainty and there has been throughout the pandemic.“What we can say with a high degree of certainty, this is a much more transmissible virus and that being the case it is likely it will out-compete Delta and therefore will probably, in a short period of time, replace Delta as the dominant iant.”Professor Ian Young, the chief scientist, said: “I’m a scientist, people are always trying to get me to say things for certain and the nature of science is uncertainty.“There is always uncertainty, I think it is highly likely Omicron will become the dominant form of the virus given what we understand about it at the moment and we need to observe the trajectory of it in Northern Ireland very closely.“I think it is unlikely it will be the dominant form of the virus in Northern Ireland before Christmas but that is not a guarantee of what will happen, there can’t be a guarantee.“All I can promise with % certainty is that we will monitor the data and the spread of epidemic very closely and advise accordingly depending on what we observe.”However, both men urged the public to adhere to the current public health guidance in a bid to reduce the likelihood of further measures becoming necessary.Prof McBride also said there are currently no plans to review the close contact guidance for schools in Northern Ireland.However, it was revealed that some people diagnosed with Omicron will be required to isolate for  days.Dr Brid Farrell from the Public Health Agency said this will be assessed by contact tracers on a case-by-case basis and would apply to people who work in healthcare settings.Prof Young also poured cold water on hopes that Omicron may result in Covid- becoming less dangerous, and described early evidence from South Africa that Omicron is leading to people suffering less severe illness as “low confidence at the moment”.He continued: “There is a lot of discussion about how, in the long term, viruses tend to evolve towards forms which cause less severe disease and there is a little bit of truth to that.“But it’s a long process and a bumpy road and what we have seen with Omicron is that it can easily evolve into a form of the virus that is more dficult and more severe, as we saw when Alpha was replaced by Delta.“I would hope it would be good newsOmicron turns out to be less severe but there is absolutely no guarantee at the moment that that is the case and evenOmicron is less severe, I am afraid that there will be new letters and new iants in the months and years to come.“So we are not at the end of Covid, at some point we will transition through from it being a pandemic to it being endemic, a background disease in our population, but I think there is quite a long way to go before we are there yet.”Most ReadNorth Down landowner anger as Stormont department set to list World War

This isn’t the first bereavement the family has suffered, and it’s dferent from all the others.“We got the phone call to say mum wasn’t going to make it and it was  hours of going round and round in circles, imagining what it was like for her, what was mum thinking, wondering whether she was afraid, did she understand why I wasn’t there “At one point I actually prayed for the call to say she had died because then I would know she wasn’t suffering anymore.“So, to see people laughing, to think they had a party with everything we and other families went through, it’s like they’re dancing on my mum’s grave.“I can’t put into words how angry it makes me... it’s abhorrent.”Traumatised by the experience, Brenda is now a member of Memory Stones of Love, which offers support to local people who have lost loved ones during the pandemic.“There are so many of us who feel so hurt by this, there is one girl who lost her husband when all this was going on,” she explained.“This is why we want a Northern Ireland public inquiry into the handling of Covid. Not just one that looks at what happened in care homes, but that looks at the whole response.“For me, not being there in my mum’s final hours, I can’t explain the heartache that brings, and families need answers, especially with what’s happening now.”Marie McIvor, whose mum, Annie McIvor died in May last year after catching Covid-, also expressed fury at the footage of Downing Street staff laughing during a mock press conference when they rehearsed how to respond to questions about a staff Christmas party.And she hit out at a crying Allegra Stratton, who quit her job as an aide to Boris Johnson in response to the scandal.It came after the Prime Minister apologised and said he had ordered an investigation into claims staff broke lockdown rules by holding a Christmas party last year.Marie said: “I saw her crocodile tears. I wasn’t able to be with my mum when she died and it’s heartbreaking.“We weren’t allowed into the church for the funeral, we weren’t allowed to walk behind her coffin or carry the coffin, and now we have this — Boris Johnson and this party we’re told never happened.“The most dficult part about this is my mum followed all the rules, she even stopped her carers coming into the house.“She followed the rules and the people who made the rules let her down.”Commenting on whether he is concerned the scandal may damage confidence in the public health message in light of the new Omicron iant, chief medical officer Professor Sir Michael McBride said: “I don’t know what did or didn’t happen… but what I can say, there is no one rule for one and a dferent rule for someone .“These rules are there for all of us, they’re in everyone’s best interest.“This is about controlling a pandemic that is taking a signicant toll.”Related topicsBoris JohnsonMore On Boris Johnson PremiumMark BainOpinionIt’s all turned Nightmare Before Christmas for Boris PremiumClaire McNeillyOpinionIs it okay Downing Street lying to us over their Christmas party  It’s not okay for them to laugh about how stupid we are to believe them PremiumMalachi O#DohertyOpinionIt’s Sinn Fein who are in denial about republican violenceUK’s Troubles amnesty plans ‘morally offensive’US holds off lting Trump-era tarfs for UK steel due to fears over Northern Ireland ProtocolMost ReadNorth Down landowner anger as Stormont department set to list World War Two artillery gun house in his gardenGraeme Campbell: ‘I left NI to live in peace... then crime gang firebombed me out of my home’Michael O’Neill explains ‘respectful’ anthem compromise that his Northern Ireland teams reachedLidl gets green light for three new NI storesNI taxi driver handed suspended sentence after sharing sex act video in WhatsApp groupTop VideosPlayJohnson apologises for offence caused by aides joking about Christmas partyPlayBallywalter pier has been seriously damaged by Storm BarraPlayWatch: Storm Barra makes landfall on Northern IrelandLatest Northern IrelandUlster Rugby must clary its position on Kingspan sponsorship, says Baroness HoeyPublic urged to regularly use lateral flow tests to fight Covid- spreadCltonville boss queries ‘who made the call’ over Chris Curran’s penalty while Linfield boss outlines coin toss frustration after contentious shoot-outUse a meat thermometer!

including most commonly to protect police methodology,” he told Mr McCrisken.“And it is ultimately going to be a matter for you sir, rather than my client, whether any PII application succeeds.”A PII application by the police needs the prior approval of Chief Constable Simon Byrne and the Government.The relevant material will be circulated to the parties in the inquest in redacted form before a

opportunity of considering them carefully,” he said.Mr Doran said all parties will then have the opportunity to make representations on the issue in open court.The inquest had originally been scheduled to commence on January .That date was vacated last month due to ious outstanding issues, including with the disclosure process and the ongoing Ombudsman’s probe.The coroner told Wednesday’s

If rejected fresh strike action will be announced but that is unlikely to be before January , Unite said.Unite national officer Adrian Jones said: “Right from the beginning of this dispute Unite has been clear that Tesco could afford to make a more generous offer and that has proved to be the case.“It is now up to Unite’s members to decidethe proposed deal meets their expectations.”Related topicsTescoMore On Tesco PremiumFuel shortages: NI haulage company says protocol takes away ‘quite a bit of pressure’NI’s grocery shopping trends edging towards pre pandemic PremiumNI kids could see Santa run out of Christmas toys amid fears over Brexit-related shortagesBelfast fashion designer shows off his Nasty side with new blog PremiumSpaces on Northern Ireland shelves only going to get worse, says food sector… Brexit and Covid crisis blamed for ‘perfect storm’ of driver shortagesMost ReadNorth Down landowner anger as Stormont department set to list World War Two artillery gun house in his gardenGraeme Campbell: ‘I left NI to live in peace... then crime gang firebombed me out of my home’Michael O’Neill explains ‘respectful’ anthem compromise that his Northern Ireland teams reachedNI taxi driver handed suspended sentence after sharing sex act video in WhatsApp groupLidl gets green light for three new NI storesTop VideosPlayJohnson apologises for offence caused by aides joking about Christmas partyPlayBallywalter pier has been seriously damaged by Storm BarraPlayWatch: Storm Barra makes landfall on Northern IrelandLatest Northern Ireland‘Abhorrent Tories are just dancing on my mother’s grave’Ulster Rugby must clary its position on Kingspan sponsorship, says Baroness HoeyPublic urged to regularly use lateral flow tests to fight Covid- spreadCltonville boss queries ‘who made the call’ over Chris Curran’s penalty while Linfield boss outlines coin toss frustration after contentious shoot-outUse a meat thermometer!

Credit: Lauren HurleyNiamh CampbellTwitterEmailDecember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailFormer UK Minister for Sport Kate Hoey has urged Ulster Rugby to “clary their position” over their title sponsor Kingspan’s involvement with the Grenfell Tower fire.The Northern Irish le peer’s comments come following Mercedes’ decision to end its sponsorship deal with Kingspan, saying it is “not appropriate” to continue the partnership.Read MoreUlster Rugby questioned over Kingspan sponsorship amid Grenfell Tower inquiryThe Irish building material company’s logo appeared on Lewis Hamilton’s car at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix on Sunday, causing outrage after it emerged that Kingspan’s K insulation was one of the products installed in Grenfell Tower, where  people were killed in a fire in June . The firm is now being examined as part of an inquiry into how Grenfell Tower came to be coated in flammable materials which contributed to the spread of flames.However, Kingspan said it “played no role in the design of the cladding system on Grenfell Tower” where its product “constituted approximately % of the insulation and was used as a substitute product without Kingspan’s knowledge in a system that was not compliant with the building’s regulations”.Ulster Rugby has repeatedly told the Belfastthat it will not be making any comment in relation to its corporate relationship with Kingspan whilst the Grenfell Tower inquiry is ongoing. But Baroness Kate Hoey believes “it’s important that Ulster Rugby clary to the public their position on this, as clearly there is a growing campaign about Kingspan’s involvement”.Nicola Browne, co-ordinator of NI campaign group Act Now, said a petition calling on Ulster Rugby to end its lead sponsorship was attracting hundreds of signatures.“Hundreds of people in Northern Ireland, including their own supporters, are getting behind Act Now’s call for Ulster Rugby to end this sponsorship deal now and stop whitewashing Kingspan’s image, which is prolonging the pain of the Grenfell families. They need to take action now,” she said.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up In a statement, Mercedes said that the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F team and Kingspan “mutually agreed” to end the partnership “with immediate effect”.Last week, Sir Lewis Hamilton also insisted he had “nothing to do with the team signing any of the sponsors”, adding that he understood team principal Toto Wolff was “sorting” it.UK Communities Secretary Michael Gove had previously said the Government could amend advertising rules on racing carsthe company didn’t pull the partnership with Kingspan, but he has still not acknowledged Ulster Rugby’s affiliation with the firm.On Wednesday, Mr Gove tweeted: “I am glad Mercedes listened to @GrenfellUnited’s dignied representations and ended their sponsorship deal with Kingspan.”Grenfell United, a group of survivors and family members, also welcomed the decision.“We met with Toto Wolff and shared the facts from the Grenfell Inquiry and Mercedes came to their own conclusion,” its statement read. “They have shown that people can be put before profit.”In their own statement, Kingspan stressed the reciprocal nature of the decision, saying both had “jointly agreed that it’s not appropriate to move forward at the current point in time”.The firm was contacted for comment, but said it has nothing to state in specic relation to its dealings with Ulster Rugby, who have said they will not be making any comment at this time.Related topicsUlster RugbyMore On Ulster RugbyDuane Vermeulen fitness update issued as Ulster confirm three players ruled out for Clermont trip in Champions Cup PremiumUlster Rugby: Dan McFarland ready for ‘brilliant’ Clermont challenge with little margin for European errorUlster Rugby questioned over Kingspan sponsorship amid Grenfell Tower inquiry PremiumDan McFarland set to ring changes for Clermont trip as boss says Ospreys loss ‘will play into selection’Dan McFarland blames wasteful performance as Ulster’s momentum stalls with Ospreys defeatMost ReadNorth Down landowner anger as Stormont department set to list World War Two artillery gun house in his gardenGraeme Campbell: ‘I left NI to live in peace... then crime gang firebombed me out of my home’Michael O’Neill explains ‘respectful’ anthem compromise that his Northern Ireland teams reachedNI taxi driver handed suspended sentence after sharing sex act video in WhatsApp groupLidl gets green light for three new NI storesTop VideosPlayJohnson apologises for offence caused by aides joking about Christmas partyPlayBallywalter pier has been seriously damaged by Storm BarraPlayWatch: Storm Barra makes landfall on Northern IrelandLatest Northern Ireland‘Abhorrent Tories are just dancing on my mother’s grave’Public urged to regularly use lateral flow tests to fight Covid- spreadCltonville boss queries ‘who made the call’ over Chris Curran’s penalty while Linfield boss outlines coin toss frustration after contentious shoot-outUse a meat thermometer!

It can’t be one rule for the Prime Minister and another for everyone .”Meanwhile, Downing Street did not comment on a separate report in the Times that Dan Rosenfield, then Mr Johnson’s incoming chief of staff, took part in the December  party while London was under Tier  restrictions.The Prime Minister has repeatedly insisted the rules were followed that night but apologised over the impression made by leaked footage of No  staff joking about Covid restrictions.It showed Ms Stratton and aides laughing on December  about a supposedly “fictional party” having taken place in Downing Street days earlier as she took part in a rehearsal for her subsequently axed role hosting televised press briefings.She resigned as a Government adviser on Wednesday, saying: “I will regret those remarks for the rest of my days and I offer my profound apologies to all of you at home for them.”Exclusive: Downing Street staff shown joking in leaked recording about Christmas party they later denied https:t.co IejHdqtJM— ITV News PoliticsDecember , Meanwhile, Mr Johnson was forced to deny allegations, including from senior Conservative William Wragg, that his announcement of further coronavirus restrictions was a “ersionary tactic” from the scandal.The Prime Minister also appeared to concede that the Cabinet Secretary would be able to go further than just reviewing the events of December  and “look at other things”, with other alleged gatherings in Downing Street over the festive period last year.Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross said Mr Johnson should quithe was found to have misled Parliament.“If he knew there was a party,he knew it took place, then he cannot come to the House of Commons and say there was no party,” he told Sky News.

The low share of services in trade flows from Ireland to Northern Ireland is in contrast with the high overall services content of Ireland’s exports to other markets, ESRI report stated. Ireland is one of the main markets for services trade from Northern Ireland.   The reports, published on Tuesday, assess cross-border trade in services and “enhancing the attractiveness of the island of Ireland” to high-value foreign direct investment . The first of the set of economic reports examines the extent of cross-border trade in services on the island of Ireland and the characteristics of the firms participating in this trade. The main services traded include transportation and storage, business services and computer consultancy. Sales to Ireland account for % of services outflows from Northern Ireland and for % of services inflows to Northern Ireland, the report states. For trade from Ireland, Northern Ireland accounts for slightly less than % of total services exports from Ireland. This reflects the relatively small size of the Northern Ireland economy and the highly export-orientated and FDI-dominated structure of Ireland’s services sector. In terms of the balance of trade, the report found that more services are exported from Northern Ireland to Ireland relative to those from Ireland to Northern Ireland. Examining the characteristics of services firms active in cross-border trade, the report finds that exporting firms in services are systemically larger and more productive than non-exporters. The author of the report, professor Martina Lawless, said: “The patterns identied in this report suggest that there is considerable scope for expansion of cross-border trade in services. “The monitoring of the effectiveness of trade support policies would be greatly improved by expanding and coordinating the information collected on cross-border services flows.” This second research report provides novel evidence on factors and policies underlying the attractiveness of Ireland and Northern Ireland to FDI in high-value knowledge-intensive sectors.      This research also explores opportunities for policy coordination and cooperation on the island of Ireland that could enhance the attractiveness of both jurisdictions to high-value FDI. The research finds that FDI in high-value sectors in Ireland and Northern Ireland accounts for substantial shares of all new greenfield FDI projects. At over %, these shares are higher than the corresponding averages for Great Britain and the EU countries. Speaking ahead of the launch of the reports, Tanaiste Leo Varadkar, said: “We commissioned this research to provide a high-quality evidence base for looking, in real terms, at how we could do more, and do better together, across both parts of this island. “How we could align better, levelling up and taking the best of both jurisdictions. “The research shows that there is much more scope to ‘think all-island’ when it comes to the services economy and attracting foreign direct investment, accruing economic and societal benefits both North and South.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

The low share of services in trade flows from Ireland to Northern Ireland is in contrast with the high overall services content of Ireland’s exports to other markets, ESRI report stated. Ireland is one of the main markets for services trade from Northern Ireland.   The reports, published on Tuesday, assess cross-border trade in services and “enhancing the attractiveness of the island of Ireland” to high-value foreign direct investment . The first of the set of economic reports examines the extent of cross-border trade in services on the island of Ireland and the characteristics of the firms participating in this trade. The main services traded include transportation and storage, business services and computer consultancy. Sales to Ireland account for % of services outflows from Northern Ireland and for % of services inflows to Northern Ireland, the report states. For trade from Ireland, Northern Ireland accounts for slightly less than % of total services exports from Ireland. This reflects the relatively small size of the Northern Ireland economy and the highly export-orientated and FDI-dominated structure of Ireland’s services sector. In terms of the balance of trade, the report found that more services are exported from Northern Ireland to Ireland relative to those from Ireland to Northern Ireland. Examining the characteristics of services firms active in cross-border trade, the report finds that exporting firms in services are systemically larger and more productive than non-exporters. The author of the report, professor Martina Lawless, said: “The patterns identied in this report suggest that there is considerable scope for expansion of cross-border trade in services. “The monitoring of the effectiveness of trade support policies would be greatly improved by expanding and coordinating the information collected on cross-border services flows.” This second research report provides novel evidence on factors and policies underlying the attractiveness of Ireland and Northern Ireland to FDI in high-value knowledge-intensive sectors.      This research also explores opportunities for policy coordination and cooperation on the island of Ireland that could enhance the attractiveness of both jurisdictions to high-value FDI. The research finds that FDI in high-value sectors in Ireland and Northern Ireland accounts for substantial shares of all new greenfield FDI projects. At over %, these shares are higher than the corresponding averages for Great Britain and the EU countries. Speaking ahead of the launch of the reports, Tanaiste Leo Varadkar, said: “We commissioned this research to provide a high-quality evidence base for looking, in real terms, at how we could do more, and do better together, across both parts of this island. “How we could align better, levelling up and taking the best of both jurisdictions. “The research shows that there is much more scope to ‘think all-island’ when it comes to the services economy and attracting foreign direct investment, accruing economic and societal benefits both North and South.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

Specsavers is encouraging avid readers to have regular eye tests so they can continue to indulge their hobby. Presbyopia is the gradual loss of our eyes’ ability to focus close up as the lens becomes less flexible. A natural part of ageing, it usually becomes noticeable around the age of . The condition is common and typically isn’t a cause for concern. But some struggle to adapt, and find they need to hold their book at arm’sto read the page or direct a light on it to see the words more clearly. For most people, the answer is a simple eye test which will identythey need reading glasses, multi-focal glasses or contact lenses to make words clearer – and le easier. Maeve Walsh, director at Specsavers Crescent Link in the Waterside and Ferryquay Street in the city centre, says: “It can sometimes be dficult for people to assess themselves whether they have presbyopia, which is why we always encourage regular eye tests, usually every two years. “As we age, it’s completely natural for our eyesight to worsen and it shouldn’t be something we worry about, providing our eyes are in good health. “My advice to those with presbyopia would be to carry your specs with you at all times and get into the habit of having them close by. This will help with activities like reading, and will also ensure you’re not straining your eyes, which can sometimes cause other problems.” To find out more about presbyopia, or to book an eye test visit:https:www.specsavers eye-health presbyopiaandwww.specsavers stores derryorwww.specsavers stores crescentlink Top five signs you have Presbyopia .

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec   addthis, Lynch’s, the local family retailer which operates a number of Spar and Eurospar stores and supermarkets, have opened their third local supermarket bringing their total store number to eight across the North West and Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Lynch’s Eurospar, Greysteel is the third outlet from the retailer to open under the popular Eurospar brand and has allowed management to more than double the number of jobs available, now employing  locally. Acquiring what was previously a Centra store on the site, company director Paul Lynch says the community needed a larger format supermarket brand that would not only bring a host of fresh and local produce and ranges, but would be convenient and complemented with services vital to the local area. Paul said: “We have invested around pound, to bring our supermarket experience to the Greysteel area and are so proud to open the doors. “We have more than doubled the size of the space which allows optimum navigation throughout the aisles, where shoppers will find an increased iety and range of fresh and local foods including our own meat offering and pre-packed ranges. “Importantly, we have continued the on-site partnership with Nicholl Fuels to offer locals a -hour fuel service with pre-pay pumps and we have  parking spaces to allow shoppers to conveniently load their cars safely.” The team has also retained important services including the Post Office, ATM, Lotto and PayPoint and added even more amenities and initiatives to bring value and choice to the area. The deli now serves an extended range of hot and cold food to go alongside Barista Bar coffee and Spar bakery, and shoppers can take advantage of the many deals available including the current  Deals of Christmas campaign which drops the price of big name items and festive essentials every week in the lead up to Christmas. Paul continued: “Eurospar also price matches over a thousand branded products to Tesco each week, so paired with our consistent schedule of value deals, we’re bringing a huge amount of savings for shoppers.” As is the Lynch and Eurospar ethos, the team in-store will implement outreach initiatives with the local community, sponsoring and supporting local clubs and organisations, while also fundraising for charity partner Cancer Fund for Children. Paddy Doody, sales and marketing director at Henderson Group, which owns the Eurospar brand in Northern Ireland added: “We now have  Eurospar supermarkets in Northern Ireland, each one bringing a wealth of convenience in a large format supermarket to their areas. “The Lynch’s are experienced independent retailers and know how to engage with their local communities, with an incredibly high bar set for customer service. “Its fantastic to see the Eurospar brand thriving under our independent retailers and we wish Lynch’s the best of luck with their new business.” The new supermarket in Greysteel joins Lynch’s portfolio of stores including Eurospars in the Skeoge area of Derry and Draperstown in Magherafelt, plus Spars in Dungiven, Claudy, Newbuildings and Trench Road in Co Derry, and Clonoe in Coalisland.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

Owner of Ferry Clever, Christopher Ferry, said he believed it was more important than ever to shop local this Christmas. “Everything was in lockdown and a lot of small local businesses really got affected by that. I think this is probably the most important year ever regarding supporting local because a lot of businesses really struggled to get back on their feet after being closed for so long. “I think that people realise that, and they are really going all out this year to support local. A small business like myself doesn’t take it for granted, I really appreciate it and I would just really push to support local this year especially. Big operators like Amazon can be handy but your small spend makes a giant dference.” Ben Allen, owner of local record store ‘Abbazappa,’ spoke of the benefits of choosing to shop local. “I know my customers. I know them by name, they know me. The thing about a record shop is when a customer is with you evenit’s only for a few minutes, you’re that person’s best friend and you can talk about music, recommend things, and talk about all sorts. That doesn’t happen online. Online is completely soulless.  Ben Allen, proprietor of Abbazappa.  “The greatest thing on earth is being able to look through the products in the likes of a record shop or book shop physically. It’s a pleasure to do that. You can pick it up and seethe products okay before buying it. You can’t do that online, it’s a bit of a lucky dip.” Sinn Feacutein Foyle MLA, Paacutedraig Delargy, also urged the people of Derry to support local businesses this year. “On the back of the voucher scheme, we’re encouraging everybody to spend their pound in local businesses as it’s been such a tough couple of months for them. Anything that can be done to make sure these businesses get back on their feet, we need to do it and make sure we can support our local high street shops.” The new Ferry Clever store can be found at - Bishops Street, and Abbazappa Records can be found at the Yellow Yard on Palace Street.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

Mr Durkan had long lobbied for the provision to be removed and worked alongside a number of charities to get Sinn Feacutein Communities Minister, Deirdre Hargey, to change the current provision. The Social SecurityBill was granted accelerated passage at its second stage in the Assembly on Tuesday. Foyle MLA Mr Durkan said: “I have long campaigned for this cruel and unnecessary measure to be changed. To ask people who have been given a terminal illness diagnosis to jump through hoops in order to access help and support is unconscionable. That we are not doing everything we can to make things easier for those suffering from illness in the final months of their lives is callous in the extreme. “Through my work with Marie Curie on this issue I was made aware of one family that received a letter declaring their brother was fit for work on the very day of his funeral. This should never have been allowed to happen and I hope this legislation will go some way to preventing that and get those suffering from terminal illness the quick and easy access to welfare they deserve – it’s the least we can do. “The extension of this provision to people with a year to live is welcome and will help many, but it doesn’t go far enough. I would urge Minister Hargey to take a leaf from the Scottish Government’s book and consider permitting clinicians to make the call on determining whether their patients are terminally ill without worrying about arbitrary time limits.  “People living with Motor Neurones Disease, Multiple Sclerosis and other le limiting illnesses won’t obtain a better prognosis.

The discovery of a new iant may also present new challenges so I would urge the Minister to revisit her approach to COVID in schools. High Efficiency Particulate Air filters remove contaminants such as viruses from the air, reducing airborne transmission in classrooms with poor ventilation. “It is clear that HEPA filtration is one of a number of mitigations which could help make our classrooms safer. “The Minister has dithered and delayed on ventilation for too long. It is crunch time for our schools. I am calling on the Minister today, to act urgently to examine the provision of HEPA air filtration for all of our classrooms. “The Minister keeps telling us she wants to keep schools open. We agree, but she has to be willing to do what it takes and that means HEPA filters in all of our classrooms, not just some ofthem. Sinn Feacutein will continue to work to ensure the safety of our children and young people as well as our school staff.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

John Hume was widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the recent political history of Ireland and one of the architects of the Northern Ireland peace process. The prizes to his name include the Nobel Peace Prize , the Martin Luther King Jnr Non-Violent Awardand the International Gandhi Peace Prize . His we Pat led the announcement and following her recent passing it is the continued wish of the Hume family and Foundation that they be loaned to and displayed in the city. Chair of the Business and Culture Committee, Councillor Conor Heaney, welcomed the key stage in the process of having the items displayed in the city. I am pleased that we have been able to approve the funding for the display of the John Hume Peace Awards in the Guildhall so that the public can view these internationally signicant items, he said. John is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the recent political history of Ireland and was one of the architects of the Northern Ireland Peace Process. He is the only person in the world to have received all three of these awards and their prominent display will give just recognition to that achievement and add to our offering to visitors to our City and District. The paper was presented by Head of Culture at Council,AeidinMcCarter, who added: The Hume Family wish for as many people to see the collection on display as possible and it has been agreed that the Guildhall will be the most appropriate and fitting venue to display them in. Theyare expected to go on display later next year. Speaking at the Committee meeting yesterday, SDLP councillor Rory Farrell said: This is a fantastic gt from the Humefamily to the people of this city. John and Pat are sadly no longer with us,but their legacy lives. Their legacy ispeace, it’s peaceful change. It’s the power of dialogue over violence and John in particular was widelyrecognised and revered for hiscontribution to peace on this island. Hes the only person in historyto be awarded the three big peace prizes and the Humes family have loaned thosethree prestigious awards to the peopleof this city. So, I think its right andI think its proper that those are awardsare publicly displayed in the Guildhallso locals and visitors alike canappreciate and understandthe magnitude of John and Pat’sachievements.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

It also states the need for increasing the notication period for utility companies to implement price rises and introducing a cap on energy company profits. On publishing the report, Ms McLaughlin said:“Households across the North are struggling right now. Between the cut to Universal Credit, increasing national insurance contributions, the runaway cost of oil, gas and electricity, people are finding it really dficult to make ends meet. To date, our First Ministers have shown no political will or, it has to be said, interest in tackling it. “The SDLP is publishing this action plan, setting out our view on how hard-pressed households can be supported in the short and long term. This includes direct support by extending the Winter Fuel Payment to Universal Credit recipients who have already had their payments cut by the Tory Government and facilitated by Sinn Feacutein Ministers. We are also proposing a Warm Home Discount Scheme that would reduce energy costs by facilitating the installation of insulation while decarbonising our housing stock. “We are also seeking to reform the structural issues that have led to successive price rises at short notice to households. That should include extending the period that companies must give notice to consumers before a price rise takes effect. This will allow families time to prepare for signicant increases rather than being caught on the hop at times like Christmas when energy use is traditionally higher. “I don’t believe that the First Ministers understand the scale of this crisis. Nor do they seem to be engaged in the action needed to relieve pressure on people across the North.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

She took to Facebook in a search for information about the school after noticing it as she travelled up and down the road. “I had been passing this school every day and was just fascinated by it. I wondered what it was called, when it was up and running, when it closed,” she told the County Derry Post. “Wee country schools like that had generations of families in them, and it was just something I became fixated on. “I wanted to know what it was called, andanyone had any memories or photographs of it. It was really to get a lot of people talking about it. “I wanted to stir up a bit of nostalgia among the community that was linked to the school, and was hoping that it would bring a lot of people back in touch with each other. “One lady hilariously came back and said there were some she could do without getting in touch with, and that made me laugh.”  Councillors raise County Derry road issues with DfI officials  Department officials were speaking at a recent full council meeting.   Despite that particular womans reluctance, Julie was able to gather a huge amount of information on the old school, which had been in use for almost  years. Opened in , the school had undergone two extensions in its -year stint, and at the time of its closure, Mr Noel Cunningham, who had links to the RAF, was the principal. A Mrs Carson taught at the school around the same time, while there were two dinner ladies named Bertha Clarke and Greta McKinney. Julie said she had been contacted by  past pupils of the school during her search for its history. “I ordinarily wouldnt have been out this road, but now being on it every day, I see it, so I thought Id put it out and seewe got anything back,” she said. “People were putting up messages, tagging people and asking Is this the school you were at  and I wondered how long it has been since those people were in touch with each other. “I thought it was a really lovely site a quaint country school, and there arent many of them around. I know its up for sale so I thought Id like to know the history before anything happens to it.” The derelict site at Killure PS. Despite the relatively recent closure of the school, photographs have proved dficult to come by for Julie, with just one unearthed so far. She is appealing for anyone with information or photographs to get in touch with her via the Derry Post to pass on what they know. “If anybody had photographs it would be a lovely thing for me to be able to share with everybody,” she said. “It was just to see what I could get back about it for them.

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec Email: editor@derrypost  addthis, A County Derry group within the Ulster Farmers Unionhave welcomed the further roll out of a local broadband provider into Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Fibrus is currently developing full-fibre infrastructure in rural parts of Northern Ireland, and as part of the process, has struck up a partnership with the UFU. The company became affinity partners of the UFU, meaning their members are able to avail of special rates for its broadband services. James Graham, Group Manager of the South Derry Londonderry UFU said full-fibre broadband would have a major impact on how farmers in the area live and work. “Having access to effective and efficient connectivity services is now essential to those working in our industry,” he said. “This new network will help boost our mission at UFU to support a vibrant and sustainable farming economy. “Modern farming practices and administrative processes have become increasingly digitalised, so connectivity has quickly become a crucial utility on our farms. “We have secured an excellent deal with Fibrus which is available to all our members, so we hope many of them take up this beneficial opportunity - as I have already.”  INTERVIEW: Cllr McPeake: Broadband is a priority  The Mid Ulster councillor says Project Stratum needs to be carefully managed.  Liam Tunney speaks to local Sinn Feacutein councillor Sean McPeake about council pragmatism, his role models and helping St Brigids Mayogall go viral last year.   The live network was launched last week in Magherafelt, and Fibrus Brand and Marketing Manager Joe Diver said rural regions had been living in the digital darkness. “That’s why we are committed to connecting communities and equipping families and rural businesses - whether SMEs or farming businesses - with the tools to thrive in modern times,” he said. “We are already making our way across Northern Ireland, transforming connectivity in these areas and addressing the digital imbalance that exists between urban and rural. “Working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union has helped us to identy ways to support local farms and agri-businesses specically, which we know make up a major portion of rural economies. “We’re delighted to now be live in Mid Ulster and look forward to seeing those who need it most, reap the benefits of our hyperfast broadband services.” For more information on the work of Fibrus and the Ulster Farmers’ Union partnership, visit www.fibrus ufu.

One of his most memorable stories features in a book penned by Dennis Taylor when the Magherafelt man toppled the mighty Alex ‘Hurricane’ Higgins.” Tommys legacy stretches long beyond his playing days, and he was instrumental to ensuring the survival and development of the game within the Mid Ulster area. “When his best playing days were perhaps behind him he didn’t turn his back on the game,” said the club. “He organised the Mid Ulster Snooker League for + years, which is an unbelievable commitment and no doubt it was this dedication that kept the game alive in the area. “When he handed over the reins in the late noughties, the game was still in a healthy state and we are all indebted in a way to Tommy that the Mid Ulster league is still being played to this day.” As a symbol of their gratitude, the Mid Ulster League named a trophy after Tommy, and the club said seeing him presenting his own trophy was an emotional moment. “A few years back many of the players felt that it would be a fitting tribute to name one of the Mid Ulster league competitions after Tommy. “We consider ourselves fortunate that Tommy was able to attend to present his own trophy. “As a club we have our own piece of history on the wall in the club, Tommy produced a great article detailing the history of our own club from its founding in  and is well worth a read for any local. “It was also fitting that when the club was rebuilt in  that he played Joe Swail on the opening night. A fitting tribute for a great snooker man.”  Derry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,   Obituaries    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

One of his most memorable stories features in a book penned by Dennis Taylor when the Magherafelt man toppled the mighty Alex ‘Hurricane’ Higgins.” Tommys legacy stretches long beyond his playing days, and he was instrumental to ensuring the survival and development of the game within the Mid Ulster area. “When his best playing days were perhaps behind him he didn’t turn his back on the game,” said the club. “He organised the Mid Ulster Snooker League for + years, which is an unbelievable commitment and no doubt it was this dedication that kept the game alive in the area. “When he handed over the reins in the late noughties, the game was still in a healthy state and we are all indebted in a way to Tommy that the Mid Ulster league is still being played to this day.” As a symbol of their gratitude, the Mid Ulster League named a trophy after Tommy, and the club said seeing him presenting his own trophy was an emotional moment. “A few years back many of the players felt that it would be a fitting tribute to name one of the Mid Ulster league competitions after Tommy. “We consider ourselves fortunate that Tommy was able to attend to present his own trophy. “As a club we have our own piece of history on the wall in the club, Tommy produced a great article detailing the history of our own club from its founding in  and is well worth a read for any local. “It was also fitting that when the club was rebuilt in  that he played Joe Swail on the opening night. A fitting tribute for a great snooker man.”  Derry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,   Obituaries    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

They provide training and education to make the Deaf community hearing aware, and the hearing community deaf aware. Rose Ayling-Ellis is making history as the first deaf contestant to compete on Strictly Come Dancing, and information officer for the charity, Pauline Doherty last night heaped praise on the -year-old dancer.  “It is great to see Deaf Culture being recognised. Deaf Awareness and sign language shouldbe taughtto everyonein schools,” she said. In a recent episode, Rose and her partner Giovanni danced a section of their performance without any music and Pauline found that moment very important for the Deaf community. “When Rosie danced with no music to show hearing people what Rosie was feeling, it was fantastic,” said Ms. Doherty. Rose has been an inspiration to young people all over the UK and the Dungiven based charity have been unequivocal in their praise for young dancer. “Rose is fantastic, I love watching her and I really hopes she wins,” said Wendy Cassidy, cleaner at Hands That Talk. Paddy Bradley the caretaker smiled and said “Yes, Rose is very good. It’s nice to see Deaf people on TV,” he added.

She cannot wait to see Rose every week, and she hopes Rose will win it,” he said.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.    The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

After continuing with his le, as best he could, he collapsed last year in his garden with back and leg pain. Kevin travelled to Istanbul last month to meet a specialist and will require surgery within a matter of months, which will cost in the region of pound,. A crowdfunding page has brought in poundK so far and Ballinderry are aiming to help raise the remainder. On Friday, June , their  and  U Feacuteile teams will play in a novel charity game, with all the funds going help Kevin and his family. “We are trying to raise as much money for Kevin and his family as possible,” said Philip Muldoon, one of the organisers. “We want the good people off Ballinderry and surrounding areas to come along and donate on the night of the match to keep the date free. “To any business people who would like to sponsor a prize for the raffle in the Bridge Bar afterwards they can do so by contacting myself or Karl Conlan. “Kevin is going to need a lot of help post and pre surgery and this will go a long way to doing that.” To mark the occasion Noel ONeill of Arboe based company ND Sports has made the outstanding gesture of sponsoring a one-off retro top for both teams.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

Pic by Mary K Burke.Reporter: Liam Tunney Dec Email: liam@derrypost  addthis, Derrys Competitions Control Committeehas vowed to clamp down on the number of clubs moving fixtures for the  season. googletag.cmd.push In their report to the Derry GAA AGM, the CCC said that of  games played during the  season,  games had been moved away from their original date. The figure excludes changes made before the beginning of the season to accommodate club requests, and the CCCs report said clubs need to stick to the deadline for making changes. “A weekly fixtures list is sent to clubs and any changes for the incoming week should be notied by the given deadline,” they said. “There is a tendency for club managers to agree last minute changes among themselves, sometimes not even informing their club secretary. “The original referee is not always available for the changed date time and this is a headache for our Referee Administrator. “In  as per CCC policy there will be NO game changes accepted after Sunday night for the week ahead unless in exceptional circumstances.” Dungiven picked up the U Jack Cassidy Cup in , but the CCC have raised concerns about the age grade. Pic by Mary K Burke. Elsewhere in the report, the Committee stressed the need to take another look at the bridging competition between underage and senior, saying the U grade did not work well. They also urged clubs to be honest in choosing their grade, and said there were reports of players prevented from attending to ensure lower-sided games. “We ask clubs to ensure that they work with managers and team personnel when choosing the grade they enter for  , and that they aim to play  a side including all eligible players,” the report said. “There were worrying reports that some players were being told they were not needed on a given night to ensure a  a side game. “This should NOT be happening and especially not in the current climate when sporting activity is more important than ever.” Discipline has continued to be an issue, with figures provided by the CCC revealing one club had had  incidents dealt with during . The report indicated the CCC would deal with issues in the strictest manner possible. Our games are contact sports and accidental injury will inevitably happen, but a deliberate attack on an opponent or official, causing serious injury is inexcusable, and the fear is that one of these days something will go badly wrong, with terrible consequences for all involved, said the report. We need to hammer home to our players the danger of the one punch attack and instil in them a healthy respect for their opponents and officials. The disregard for the authority of referees, and the abuse directed at them, especially from young players gives rise for concern. These remain UNACCEPTABE and we will continue to deal with them in the strictest manner possible. We will implement whatever measures we need to protect players and officials and work to ensure our games are safer and more enjoyable for all. In his secretarys report to the AGM, Peter Keane said Derry was in a good place both on and off the field of play. He said the county was close to appointing their full time Head of Operations. “The County Executive will announce the appointment of a fulltime Head of Operations in the coming days,” said the report. “When we look at what has happened over the past couple of years which can be put down to a dedicated and hardworking Committee of volunteers backed up by determined sub-committees then this appointment can only lead to further development both on and off the pitch. “The appointee will have leadership skills, financial expertise, strategic planning skills, marketing skills -all attributes that will help Derry to achieve their objectives in the next few years.” The report also said Derry were in a fairly good financial position, pointing to the recent acquisition of a new sponsor and a number of appointments yet to come.  More recognition for All-Ireland winning Derry minors  A civic honours reception has been held in their honour.   “We have reaped the rewards of an excellent championship campaign which generated increased revenue compared with last year,” said the report. “Over the past few days we are glad to welcome the Errigal Group as the counties main sponsor for football and hurling for the next five years. “The Counties Marketing consultants Teneo are presently seeking further sponsors for Development squads and Naming Rights sponsorship for both stadia - announcements will be made soon.” Sean Keanes report ended with a rallying call for the coming year. “I look forward to working together with you all again next year as we play a vital role in putting Derry back on the map again,” he added.

The resulting spot kick was coolly dispatched again by Robinson.At the beginning of the second half Omagh pulled level again and the sidelines were a hive of activity, with changes being rung by both sides.Left-back Jack Kelly delivered a deep cross into the Omagh box and the hardworking Tom Crudington recycled it out to Calam Mulqueen, who made no mistake when called upon to put Down High - ahead with the clock running low.But once again Down High became complacent as Omagh turned the screw and won countless corners. The pressure took its toll and a thoroughly deserved equaliser left the tie at - with the visitors left wondering what had gone wrong.At this stage, goalkeeper Alex Truesdale was busy keeping his side in the game and made one miraculous point blank save, resembling Jerzy Dudekrsquos heroics for Liverpool in the  Champions League final.Extra-time loomed large and with the floodlights now on both sides knew that one mistake or a well-placed pass could be decisive.After a cautious start to extra-time, Caolan Lennon stepped up to take a free-kick and scored a simply stunning goal into the top corner of the Omagh goal mdasha tremendous -yard thunder strike that encapsulated his class throughout the game.Omagh Academy pushed to get back into the game and were caught on the counter when that man Robinson pounced and rounded the rsquokeeper to score and put somne breathing space between the sides.Robinsonrsquos goalscoring exploits won him the man-of-the-match award, with Mulqueenrsquos midfield battling also worthy of high commendation.Lennon was a constant thorn in Omaghrsquos side while mazy runs from Josh Ward caught the eye, with Josh McMullan working hard too.

finalised and it is hoped that once the date of the K event and the venue have been formally confirmed that the parkrun will become an annual event for runners of all abilities.Hugely popular across the globe, the proposed Downpatrick parkrun also has the potential to provide the local economy with a boost.Downpatrick Town Committee is behind the ambitious plan for the new parkrun which it believes will bring the local community closer together and may encourage people who have never run before to get out and enjoy themselves in an event where there is no time limit and no one finishes last.Last month, the Town Committee issued an online appeal for ldquoenthusiastic and committed volunteers to come forward to help get the parkrun up and running and itrsquos hoped that the parkrun could become a weekly event and attract people from across the district to enhance their health and enjoy the great outdoors.Downpatrick area councillor Gareth Sharvin has welcomed the progress on establishing a parkrun event at Dunleath Park.He said parkruns have become popular with runners and walkers alike across the country and keen participants in the Downpatrick area have been planning the establishment of a similar event in the county town.Cllr Sharvin confirmed that he recently requested an update from Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Active and Healthy Communities department on the progress of establishing the parkrunand providing financial support to the group setting up the event.ldquoI am happy to report that the financial contribution and approach has been agreed between all stakeholders and officers are working with the parkrun organisers to finalise the details, he said.ldquoWith this great news, it should not be long until we have our first parkrun event in Downpatrick, utilising the new trail around Dunleath.Cllr Sharvin added: ldquoA parkrun will also bring people from outside the area into Downpatrick spending locally in our shops and cafes, adding to our great array of social and leisure activities on offer.News that Dunleath Park could host the parkrun comes after recent confirmation that major investment is planned for this part of the town.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is planning to create a series of new facilities, including a dedicated running track, while also in the pipeline are a cycling pump track, skateboarding track, improved planting and a new play park.In addition, soccer and GAA pitches are in line for an upgrade as part of the plan to transform Dunleath Park into a sporting and recreational hub.Itrsquos

From the resulting kick-out Carew won possession before sending over a mammoth effort to put the Johnnies back in the ascendancy.With both teams displaying huge work rate, the challenge for the Johnnies was to play through the Fontenoy press and find space.Ryan Morganrsquos pace, and incisive angled runs were a crucial factor in carving a way through a Fontenoy backline that was being well marshalled by Queens Universityrsquos Niall McElroy.Cope and Madine combined to create an exceptional team score in the th minute, but the Fontenoy response was swt and the energetic Eoin OrsquoHare burst through to raise the green flag in the next phase of play.Caolan Burns and Eoin McCrickard kept the scoreboard ticking over with well taken frees for their sides.A key battle within the game was that of Johnnies centre half Oran OrsquoConnor against Michael McMullan. OrsquoConnor was readily available each time the full back line of Aaron Murphy, Adam Walsh and team captain Rory McMullan gained possession.McMullanrsquos brave block from a Shea Moorehead effort in the th minute typied the spirit within this young Johnnies team, his cousin Conor McMullan claimed the resultant rebound and found Cope who won a late free on the far sideline.From fully  yards out, Ryan Morgan launched a majestic effort that found its way to the Fontenoy net to leave just one score between the teams. The next kick-out was pivotal. Kevin Middleton managed to fist the ball down to the onrushing OrsquoToole to claim a vital possession for the Fontenoys who held out for a narrow win.A great game played in a good spirit and well officiated by referee Colm Gribben..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Planners approve Down High order  ","story":"PLANNERS have given the green light to y a condition of the planning approval for Down High Schoolrsquos new multi-million pound campus in Downpatrick.The iation ensures that archaeological remains uncovered within the proposed development site are properly identied and protected or appropriately recorded.Local planners have approved the move under their delegated authority which means their decision does not have to be formally approved by the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee.The Education Authority confirmed recently that an application was made to allow construction of the eagerly-awaited new school to start, in tandem with the completion of the archaeological works which, due to the signicant findings uncovered, could take some time.A spokesman confirmed that site works are due to finish next January, with the archaeological report expected to take a further six months or more to complete.Education officials have also revealed that an addendum to the original business case was completed and approved in March this year.They say the new school project was issued for tender last month with a target of contract award by the second quarter of ldquoto complete a -month contract period for construction of the new school building and associated works.It also emerged recently that the contract to build Down High School on a site mdash which borders the Strangford and Quoile roads mdash could be awarded as early as next spring.Tenders were issued last month and education officials expect that it will take  months to build the eagerly-anticipated new building and complete all associated site works once construction work gets underway.The site was purchased some time ago by the Department of Education with the construction of the new school deemed a priority as far back as  due to what at the time was described as the existing schoolrsquos ldquosubstandard accommodation and over-reliance on temporary classrooms.The site of the proposed new campus is located in an area of outstanding natural beauty which also includes a graveyard linked to the townrsquos former workhouse.Extensive archaeological work was disrupted by the coronavirus but has resumed to identy and evaluate any remains at the site.It is understood that any which are discovered will be relocated to a nearby site during an ecumenical service led by local clergy.School officials say they are aware of the ldquohistoric signicance of the development site, with plans to commemorate important parts of local history..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Posthumous honour for ‘hero’ fundraiser Bonny after £230k Marie Curie support  ","story":"A DRUMANESS man who helped raise pound, to support families deal with terminal illness has been posthumously honoured by Marie Curie.The late BonnyBrown was one of a number of people given an honorary remembrance award at the charityrsquos annual Fundraising Excellence Awards.His family watched online last week as Marie Curie chief executive Matthew Reed paid tribute to the  year-old who started the Co Down Marie Curie fundraising group.He said: ldquoWe are here to celebrate people in their letime who gave so much time and of themselves and made such a considerable dference to the work of Marie Curie and to so many dferent families.Bonny sadly died on April  last year of a heart attack which shocked and saddened the Drumaness community.

Together we can put a stop to illegal puppy farming. Buying a puppy from illegal breeders can have devastating results, she continued.ldquoOften puppies die a short time after purchase or end up with infectious diseases such as parvovirus which is expensive to treat and, often fatal. They can also suffer behavioural issues relating to fear and anxiety due to poor or no socialisation.Chief Inspector Ford said it can be tempting to buy a puppy in these circumstances and often purchasers will recognise that things are not quite right, asking people to remember that by lsquorescuingrsquo a puppy in these circumstances, they are fuelling and supporting what is a particularly lucrative criminal industry.She added: ldquoWe would encourage anyone who is aware of illegal dog breeding establishments to contact their local council and we would like to take this opportunity to thank those that have done so to date already.Council chairwoman Cathy Mason said the local authority was committed to working with its partners to address this issue.ldquoWe investigate all reports made to us, she said. ldquoRecently, animal welfare officers seized seven dogs from a property following reports the animals were kept in poor living conditions and a further  dogs were seized at an illegal puppy farm with associated poor environmental conditions.Cllr Mason said the local authority is currently investigating a case of failing to ensure the welfare needs of dogs and causing unnecessary suffering.She continued: ldquoThis is a particularly timely message at this time of year when many will be thinking of purchasing a puppy for Christmas.ldquoCouncils are the lead agency when it comes to animal welfare issues and we routinely work with other agencies such as police and Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to help us tackle this serious issue.Cllr Mason also asked people across the district for their help.She added: ldquoIf anyone sees or is are aware of anything untoward, please report it to your localcouncil dog warden immediately so we can take appropriate action and seek assistance from relevant partners..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13277399.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yeats. These were champions of Irish culture who disliked the shrunken Irishness of the new Free State and, in a pivotal moment in Irish-English relations, voted with their feet to demonstrate that their Irishness included Britain and the world. Recently, the Dublin-born Mary Kenny, who lives in Kent, defended Edna O’Brienfrom Irish attack for accepting her Dame of the British Empire honour in , on the grounds that the Irish were active in the Empire, too. Unless you insist that race or ethnicity defines nationality, Dame Edna is as British as I am. That southern Irish professionals are punching above their demographic weight in Britain is clear when you ponder their number in front of the cameras and behind the microphones of the BBC, over and above Graham Norton: the late Dave Allen, Des Lynam OBE and his nephew Joe Lynam, Dara O’Briain, Fergal Keane, the ex-convent schoolgirl Orla Guerin MBE, Al Ryan, Angela Scanlon, Declan Harvey and Donnachadh McCarthy. There must be dozens of Irish at the BBC, ITV and Channel Four — producing, directing, scripting, research-assisting. Hundreds of Irish work at the heart of British culture and help it pump the blood of that culture. Their CVs often reflect an entirely English le, as do those of countless Irish academics. At the summit are such eminences as professors Roy Foster from Waterford , Eamonn Duffy, a “cradle Catholic”from Dundalkand Bernard O’Donoghue from County Cork .Professor Louise Richardson FRSE, a Catholic from Tramore, is the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford and arguably the highest ranking academic in the UK. Professor Adrian Hill from Dublin is Director of the Jenner Institute at Oxford and directed the search for the anti-Covid  vaccine. Working under him is Professor Teresa Lambe from Kilcullen, Co Kildare.The current CEO of British Airways, the nation’s carrier, is Sean Doyle, who was born and reared in Youghal, Cork. He follows Willie Walsh from Dublin. Not even the sky is the limit for the Irish in the land of the ancient enemy. Yet bizarrely, the Irish cannot draw attention to their own success. Why the silence from both sides of the Irish Sea about Irish relocation to Britain The historian Diarmaid Ferriter writes that the silence was still in force when he left school in , a year in which , Irish people crossed the water to live. It is still in force. Tony Murray, a first-generation London-Irishman teaching at the London politan University, wondered in  why Irish writers have been so reluctant to portray the experiences of migration to London  “Is it shame, indference, or plain Irish contrariness ” When Richard Mulcahy, Fine Gael leader, dared in  to describe the attractions of Britain to Irish citizens, he was accused by Fianna Fáil of being recruiting sergeant for a foreign country to discuss the topic was regarded as unpatriotic. This suggests the answer. That code of silence must persevere among the migrants in Britain, for I read almost nothing by the Irish who are established in Britain about their being successful or contented.It would draw the ire of republicans. Victimhood, after all, is a plank of their , and success in Britain contradicts it and what Ferriter calls the “single, heroic nationalist narrative of Irish history”. Dara Ó Briain is trolled by the Irish Twitterati simply for being happy and thriving in Britain. “It’s always West Brit season for Irish celebrities working in the United Kingdom,” wrote Donald Clarke in . The cultivated Ó Briain, Irish speaker and GAA supporter, has responded wittily to his begrudgers: “By definition, I’m not a West Brit, because I actually live in Britain. I mean, get your insults straight, please”. Yet even O’Briain seems to me to be defensive, and understandably. The Dailyeconomics columnist, Liam Halligan, first-generation English from an Irish Catholic family, was attacked for his  criticism of Leo Varadkar for damaging Anglo-Irish relations by his attitude to Brexit. “As someone who physically embodies the binding blood and cultural ties between Britain and Ireland, I’m regularly attacked in the Irish media for having voted to leave”. He was supposed to revert to ethnic type and oppose Brexit on the simple grounds of anti-Britishness, not reflect his English upbringing, education, livelihood, and professional economic assessment of the UK’s decision to leave the EU. Yet, he wrote movingly, “Having grown up ‘London-Irish’ in the s and s, all I ever wanted was for the two countries that define my ethnicity to get on”. The TV presenter Laura Whitmore found out that while the Irish can have successful lives in Britain, they must not erge from the Irish Story that installs the British armed forces as devils incarnate. When Whitmore appeared in a  British Army podcast, interviewing a female soldier about body issues in a male-dominated occupation, she was tarred and feathered in the social media. This century-old control of the Diaspora is echoed by the Chinese Communist Party’s attempt to do likewise in the West and which we rightly deplore. Except, of course, cultural reality and demography suggest that the middle-class and professional-class Irish in Britain are not a Diaspora at all, but simply compatriots across the water. As a presenter who makes his living by talking, one might think Graham Norton should be able to articulate the position of the successful Irish in England. But when inin  he is asked: “What about the UK, his home for decades now ”, his answer from Cork is displacement activity. “There’s a lot of charity shops. I know that. We’re raising a lot of money for cancer. But see, that’s an odd thing I’ll do, where I’ll say ‘we’re’ raising a lot of money. And so I have that thing, because I’ve lived there since  my career is there, my friends are there, I pay tax there, I vote there. And I work for the British Broadcasting Corporation.” “And so, I’ve said this before, but it is that thing where I’m in London, I get on the plane, and I’m going home to Ireland. But when I leave here in September, I’m going home to London. And I think you can do that. I don’t think we have to be policed that strictly.” But who are these police whose authority causes him to wool-gather and prevents him from naming “that thing”, his dual identity  It seems tragic that a huge portion of Irish historical and present reality must be repressed and thus the potential for inidual and collective fulfilment wasted. Those who police the Irish attitude to the British are defied in silence daily, but silence is complicity in one’s own repression. I suspect that many southern Irish would be relieved by acknowledging Britain and Ireland’s intimate relations. But they are held to ransom in the name of the Cause. Yet fully acknowledging the intimacy is the starting-point on the road to final peace on these islands. The Taoiseach Michèal Martin has called for a “re-set” of the UK-EU relationship. Closer to home, he should call for a re-set of the UK-Ireland relationship and add an “s” to the second word of his Shared Island Unit. Meanwhile, it is the intent of the republican campaign to de-Anglicise Northern Ireland and sunder it from the UK while Ireland gaily enjoys its unfettered but unacknowledged access to the UK via the media and the Common Travel Area.

Clockwise from top left, David Lloyd George Austen Chamberlain, F.E.Smith, , Winston Churchill, Robert Barton, Michael Collins, Arthur GrfithLock it up carefully”, David Lloyd George said to his mistress and secretary, Frances Stevenson, in her room at  Downing Street, as he handed her the British copy of the historic Anglo-Irish Treaty just before  am on  December .Under its terms the Union of Great Britain and Ireland, as created by Pitt the Younger  years earlier, came to an end. Only the six counties of the newly formed Northern Ireland were to be permitted to remain within the United Kingdom. Their devolved Parliament, which had been opened by King George V the previous June , was given the power to vote them out of the all-Ireland settlement, based on dominion status, which the Treaty embodied.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

They formed a column headed by Lloyd George himself the others, drawn from his Liberal  Unionist coalition cabinet, were Austen Chamberlain, F.E.Smith, Lord Birkenhead , and Winston Churchill.Another column listed the signatures of three of their Irish counterparts, headed by Arthur Grfith, the founder of Sinn Fein in , and followed by the charismatic Michael Collins, the chief organiser of the IRA’s terrorist campaign against Britain, waged from  until July  when a truce was agreed between the two sides. The third Irish signatory, Robert Barton, a Unionist landowner turned Republican and an intimate friend of Collins, was the Sinn Fein delegation’s economic adviser. Never before had British and Irish representatives put their names to a formal agreement of this kind as complete equals. After the signing, which took place at . am, the two sides shook hands for the first time. Trust had replaced the deep suspicion with which they had first regarded each other. Irish leaders, who a few months earlier had been denounced as rebels and murderers, had come to enjoy the respect of the British delegation. Michael Collins had undergone an astonishing transformation from terrorist leader to statesman, gaining the admiration of two prominent members of the British team, Churchill and Birkenhead.Final agreement on the terms of the treaty had been reached in two intense negotiating sessions in the Cabinet Room at No , which ended two months of wrangling. The first session, which lasted over five hours, began at pm on December . Lloyd George employed all his formidable political skills to secure a breakthrough in all but one of the key areas that had hitherto defied resolution.The Irish gained the full fiscal and financial autonomy they craved. The British got what they wanted on defence: the use “in time of war or of strained relations with a foreign power [of] such harbour and other facilities as the British government may require”, combined with the permanent retention of what came to be known as the Treaty Ports , major strategic assets which Neville Chamberlainwas to abandon in a further Anglo-Irish Treaty in  to Churchill’s fury. Since the start of negotiations in October, the words of an oath of allegiance which Irish elected representatives would in future be required to swear had been through endless drafts. It was at last settled with a suitably convoluted rigmarole to spare the Irish republican conscience as much strain as possible: “I will be faithful to His Majesty King George V, his Heirs and Successors by law, in virtue of the common citizenship of Ireland and Great Britain, and her adherence to and membership of the group of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.” This was the first time on which the customary reference to Empire was dropped from an official document.There remained just one make-or-break issue: Northern Ireland, with its devolved powers over local matters entrusted to it by Westminster earlier in . Sinn Fein were determined to get it into their independent state. Lloyd George was happy to give them all the help he could. In November, he had piled pressure on Sir James Craig, the Northern Ireland prime minister. In letters and conversations he tried, with all his accustomed craftiness, to get Craig to accept that he had a patriotic duty to remove the last barrier to peace in Ireland by joining a sovereign all-Ireland Parliament in place of Westminster, while retaining all the devolved powers that Westminster had provided.The Unionist members of the British delegation did not demur. Not for the last time, Ulster Unionists found that they could not rely on their English Unionist allies in high places . Austen Chamberlain said that separate arrangements for six of the nine Ulster counties were “illogical and indefensible”. He thought “the greatest moral pressure” should be put on Northern Ireland to bring it into a settlement that was “vital to the Empire”. His party chairman, Sir George Younger , believed “Ulster should take some risks and forget some of the past arguments against unity in Ireland”.These Unionist calls for compromisewere made against the background of a sustained press campaign, led by The Times, criticising Ulster Unionists for their intransigence. “Ulster blocks the way to peace” was the newspapers’ regular refrain. Craig described it as “ a press campaign against Ulster without parallel in the history of Great Britain.”But the Northern Ireland premier was unmoved. He told Lloyd George that a single parliament for Ireland was “precisely what Ulster has for many years resisted by all the means at her disposal”.Lloyd George tried another tack in November, concentrating his cunning this time on the leader of the Irish delegation, Arthur Grfith. Here he had much greater success than in his attempts to manoeuvre Craig into an all-Ireland parliament. At a private meeting with Grfith on November , he got the leader of the Irish delegation to give a personal written pledge that,Northern Ireland refused to accept an all-Ireland settlement, it would remain under the British Parliament, “but in this case, it would be necessary to revise the boundary of Northern Ireland. This might be done by a Boundary Commission ... to make the boundary conform as closely as possible to the wishes of the people.” What went unrecorded in the paper was the clear impression given by Lloyd George that Northern Ireland would lose so much territory that it could not survive as a separate entity and a united independent Ireland would as a result come into existence.During the course of the long afternoon session in Downing Street on December , Lloyd George reminded Grfith of what they had agreed.Proof was needed. A frantic search was made of the prime minister’s wardrobe, and “eventually an insignicant pocket cast up an envelope and a piece of paper.” On the strength of this written undertaking to establish a Boundary Commission whichwould undermine Northern Ireland, the leader of the Irish delegation agreed to sign the Treaty himself, but said that he could not commit his colleagues.At this, Lloyd George assumed a magnicently melodramatic air. He had told Craig in Belfast to expect news of the outcome of the discussions in Downing Street the following day. That could of course have been done by telephone, but Lloyd George now conjured up an elaborate plan to send the news in writing to Belfast in an attempt to force a decision out of the other two Irish delegates.“Here are the alternative letters which I have prepared, one enclosing Articles of Agreement reached by His Majesty’s Government and yourselves, and the other saying that the Sinn Fein representatives refuse to come within the Empire. If I send this letter it is war, and war within three days. Which letter am I to send  Whichever letter you choose travels by special train to Holyhead, and by destroyer to Belfast. The train is waiting with steam up at Euston ... to reach Sir James in time we must know your answer by ten p.m tonight. You can have until then, but no longer, to decide whether you will give peace or war to your country.”With these impassioned words ringing in their ears, the Irish delegates ed to their Knightsbridge hotel for anguished discussions amongst themselves, but promised to be back in Downing Street by the pm deadline. In fact, it was nearly .pm when they ed.Nothing more was heard about the special train waiting at Euston. Grfith announced calmly, “Prime Minister, the Delegation is willing to sign the agreements, but there are a few points of drafting which perhaps it would be convenientI mentioned at once.” The most important concerned the Boundary Commission redrafting increasedthe likelihood that Northern Ireland would collapse. At Iam on December , an agreed text was handed to the Downing Street typists.In England, reaction to the treaty was ecstatic. The Times led the way: “These are fitting peace terms to mark the close of an age of discontent and distrust, and the beginning of a new era of happiness and mutual understanding.” In Ireland, discontent intensied and took a new form: the long quarrel with Britain was replaced by distrust and ision within Sinn Fein, which led to a bitter civil war the following year. In Northern Ireland, IRA terrorism increased, generating sectarian stre in  parts of Belfast came to resemble the battlefields of the First World War. The Boundary Commission recommended only minor changes, and its report was shelved. Englishmen looked away. “The country”, said Austen Chamberlain, “wants peace and is tired of Ireland and Ulster.” English politicians hoped they would never have to think seriously about Irish affairs again. For nearly  years they had their wish — which meant that that they were fatally handicapped by ignorance when the Ulster crisis of  erupted.l BIBLIOGRAPHY—D.G.Boyce, Englishmen and Irish Troubles: British Public Opinion and the Making of Irish Policy -and “ How to Settle the Irish Question: Lloyd George and Ireland -” in A.J.P.

Three Sinn Fein offices received payments from the fund, which have since been repaid.MP and MLA constituency offices were ineligible for the scheme.Northern Ireland’s Auditor General Kieran Donnelly said that while £. million of these payments under the Small Business Support Grant Scheme have been recovered, it is “not clear” how much of the money wrongly paid out will ever be recouped.Mr Donnelly’s report said that payments are likely to have been made to businesses which did not suffer Covid- related hardship because no assessment of need had been undertaken.Responding to the findings, the Department for the Economy insisted the scheme was an “emergency response to a crisis” and introduced at “extreme pace”. The department said that without the support many businesses may not have survived.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.The audit office report said it was “simply assumed that all small businesses eligible for small business rates relief needed the support regardless of their situation”.The scheme was launched on March   and provided one-off emergency grants of £, to small businesses to help mitigate the potential threat of closures at the start of the Covid- pandemic.It was designed and delivered jointly by Stormont’s Department for the Economyand Land  Property Services . In total the scheme made payments of £. million, with £. million of this given out through “push payments” directly into the bank accounts of businesses which had not applied for the grant.The report said that the decision to implement push payments to all businesses in receipt of small business rates reliefwas “inherently risky”.It continued: “It was likely that some public money would be issued to businesses which did not suffer hardship as a result of the Covid- crisis.“No evaluation was undertaken to quanty the potential level of funding likely to be issued to those who did not require it.”The report added: “On the same day that the online portal for applications went live, £. million was paid via push payments, directly into the bank accounts of those businesses identied on the LPS database as eligible for SBRR and which paid their rates via direct debit.“These payments were made without State Aid approval from the European Commission.”Following his audit, Mr Donnelly estimated that £. million could have been paid to recipients who were not eligible under the scheme rules.He said that to date, the Department for Economy and LPS have identied £. million of potentially ineligible payments.This includes £ million in duplicate payments, £, paid to landlords rather than tenants, and £, paid to wind turbine owners, an industry which was not impacted by the pandemic.The report said that communication and collaborative working between the organisations involved in scheme delivery could have been better.It said that important LPS queries on eligibility were “not being answered by the Department for Economy for weeks after they were received”.It also said that staff involved in the scheme’s design and implementation had been instructed to work from home during the pandemic but initially did not have key resources such as video conferencing facilities.Among those who wrongly received the payments included three Sinn Fein offices. The money was repaid after seven months.Several Sinn Fein representatives, including former Foyle MP Elisha McCallion and West Tyrone MLA Catherine Kelly, resigned over the matter.The report said: “These payments were part of the initial payments issued automatically, without an application being received.“These offices should have been excluded from the payment list but were overlooked.”At the outset of the scheme, the Department for Economy Permanent Secretary raised serious concerns over the value for money and the risk of fraud and error, the report states.However, in light of the perceived urgent need to get support to businesses quickly, then Economy Minister Diane Dodds issued a ministerial direction for the scheme to go ahead.The report said that “many of the concerns raised by the DfE Permanent Secretary came to pass”.Covid-Northern Ireland  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularSinn Fein rising star quit over payments‘I was beaten out of estate with a baseball bat for being Protestant’Tributes pour in for tragic dad whose smile would ‘light up a room’ years of silence broken: sisters tell of anguish over IRA murdering their brother in bedJim Allister: Once again an Independent Reporting Commission report which has no mention of IRAMost PopularMS have announced their Christmas dinner range for  - here’s what’s available, on sale nowAldi releases two festive gin liqueurs for Christmas, including a Spiced Biscuit flavour - how to buyChristmas toys : popular toys expected to sell out this Xmas - including Paw Patrol and a fidget popperFood and drink gts: best Christmas food and drink hampers from Marks and Spencer, Aldi and Hotel Chocolat  best men’s waterproof hiking trousers UK: stay dry hiking with trousers from Craghoppers, Berghaus, Montane                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kTUwUJ sc-dqBHgY ciFbrr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The consultation with key stakeholders will run for a period of  weeks.”The issue first arose inFebruary  when the council received a request from Abbeyville Residents’ Association for five Irish language street signs which was turned down after councillors voted in favour of a policy retaining street signs in English only proposed by Glengormley DUP councillor Alderman Phillip Brett and seconded by Glengormley Ulster Unionist councillor Ald Mark Cisgrove.Ald Brett stressed the importance of the council having a policy on the issue so thatthere were future requests, these could be dealt with “smoothly”.Ald Cosgrove said that given the facts and figures presented to members over the number of Irish language speakers in the borough, the request would be “preposterous” and street signs would look like a “dog’s dinner”.According to the  census,.% of residents in Antrim and Newtownabbey had some knowledge of Irish. In , it was reported that  people in Antrim and Newtownabbey spoke Irish as a main language.However, in September , the council was forced to do a u-turn after being challenged in the High Court by a resident who sought a judicial review over a “deeply held concern that the policy adopted by the local authority was unlawful”. Read hereThe borough councilinsisted that its policy was “not a ban in any way on the Irish language” and a new, “more detailed policy would be drafted for the council to consider”.Commenting on last week’s decision, SDLP group leader Councillor Roisin Lynch said: “I was disappointed that councillors decided to support this deeply restrictive policy. It is a shameless and deliberate attempt to slow down and stymy efforts for dual language signage.“There can be little doubt that this onerous policy is designed to obstruct efforts to progress the visibility of Gaeilge in our local communities. I am particularly disappointed that Alliance Party councillors backed a policy designed to restrict the growth of the language.“It is of vital importance that the Irish language is given the visibility it deserves and that anyone who wishes to see bilingual signage in their area has access to a fair and transparent process. This is a slap in the face to those in our communities, including myself, who know that we need to break down barriers to the visibility of the the Irish language, not create new ones.”Antrim and Newtownabbey Mayor Councillor Billy Webb commented: “This is not an Irish language policy. This is a multi-lingual policy. We are a erse community.“The policy is going out to consultation. We were looking for one third of residents of a street to instigate an application and then  per cent plus one in the actual vote. That is a normal and true democratic process. The DUP was looking for two-thirds.”Michelle Weir, Local Democracy Reporter--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this article.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe complaint to the Public Services Ombudsman for Wales against the Cardf and Vale University Health Board was lodged by the patient -referred to in the complaint as lsquoMr Drsquo -who was unhappy with the care and treatment he received at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardf during and after a scheduled admission for surgery to remove the right side of his colon.Mr D, who has Aspergerrsquos Syndrome, complained that hiscondition - at the time believed to be Crohns Disease -was not clearly diagnosed and that clinicians were slow to identy he suffered a post-operative bleed and needed further emergency surgery.He complained that information about his treatment and care was not provided clearly to him despite those caring for him knowing about his Aspergerrsquos Syndrome. He was also unhappy with aspects of his care after his discharge.Mr Drsquos surgery was carried out on the presumption that he had Crohnrsquos Disease according to the Ombudsman, but surgical findings suggested complex chronic appendicitis.The Ombudsman found that neither of these conditions needed the extensive surgery that Mr D was given. The Ombudsman also found there was no complete record of how his condition was monitored following his surgery and that his post-operative bleed might have been detected sooner.The Ombudsman also concluded that the clinicians were aware of the patientrsquos Aspergerrsquos Syndrome but did not clearly communicate the information about his diagnosis and treatment to him. The Ombudsman also found that the patient was not seen by a mental health clinician as requested by Mr D because it was not arranged.MORE NEWS:The Ombudsman did not uphold the complaint regarding Mr Drsquos care post-discharge.Nick Bennett of Public Services Ombudsman for Wales said: ldquoThis regrettable case highlights yet again the importance of one of the key principles of prudent healthcare formulated by the Welsh Government ndash lsquodo only what is needed and do no harm.rsquoldquoPhysicians responsible for Mr Drsquos care should have employed a lsquowatch and waitrsquo approach in which his condition would probably have settled without surgical treatment.ldquoInstead, Mr D, a vulnerable inidual, faced completely avoidable trauma of unnecessary surgery and post-treatment complications ndash a trauma which saw him seek mental health support. I anticipate that my findings will be extremely distressing for him. This is reflected in my recommendations in this case.The Ombudsman recommended that Cardf and Vale University Health Board provides Mr D with a detailed apology and a redress payment of pound,. Mr Bennett also recommended that the physicians and nurses involved in Mr Drsquos care have relevant training in the management of Crohnrsquos Disease and chronic appendicitis as well as the care and management of patients with Aspergerrsquos Syndrome.It was also recommended that the nursing team consider the importance of conducting and documenting post-operative observations and of preparing accurate and relevant care plans.The Ombudsmans report says Cardf and Vale University Health Board has accepted the findings and conclusions of the Ombudsmanrsquos report and has agreed to implement the recommendations.A spokesperson for Cardf and Vale University Health Board said: \"As a health board we would like to reiterate our sincere apologies to Mr D for the concerns identied in the report.\"We are implementing the recommendations from the Ombudsman and an improvement plan has been developed to monitor the delivery of all recommendations within the agreed timescales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Currently developers already have plans for an extra , homesmdashwhich havenrsquot yet been builtmdashthanks to the existing local development plan.Although, itrsquos possible that not all of these will actually be built. Some additional lsquowindfall sitesrsquo are also likely to come forward, where developers build homes not allocated in the development plan.So factoring these in, the first option would mean an extra , homes needed, as well as , new jobs. That would mean , new homes built each year, for a total of , by .The second option would mean an extra , homes needed, and , new jobs. That would mean , new homes built each year, for a total of , homes by . This could mean more affordable housing.The third option would mean an extra , homes needed, and , new jobs. That would mean , new homes built each year, for a total of , homes by . This is based on population growth projections from the previous development plan, which some critics say were too high.Councillor Caro Wild, cabinet member for strategic planning and transport, said: ldquoThe replacement LDP is going to shape the look and feel of Cardf for years to come, so it was really important for us to hear as wide a range of views as possible. At this stage of the process, we are accessing a number of dferent scenarios on the possible levels of growth in Cardf up to , and the need for houses to be built to accommodate this growth..removeldquoIt is important that people understand the consequences of the options, as most growth scenarios will have pros and cons with regard to important issues such as land for employment opportunities, the impact on the environment, addressing housing need, supporting the delivery of community and transport infrastructure, and how many truly affordable homes that could be provided.People can respond to the consultation by visiting the website https:cardfldp.consultation.ai, while there will also be focus groups to gather views of people who donrsquot normally respond to council consultations.The next phase of the consultation explores eight options on how the city should accommodate a growing population, and how many homes should be built in the countryside or in urban areas.Option one would extend the existing strategic sites, built on countryside on the outskirts of the city. This would mean more affordable homes and a wider range of housing, due to the cheaper construction costs of building on greenfield sites.Options two and three would see new homes built mostly on urban brownfield sites, meaning land which has already been developed. This would mean denser housing, and could be more expensive to build with less range in size. Option four is similar, but focusing on building around existing district centres to create a lsquocity of villagesrsquo concept.Option five would see new homes built around existing transport links in urban areas while option six would focus growth around proposed transport improvements like the metro and planned new train stations, including on some greenfield sites.Option seven would focus on greenfield sites not already earmarked for development, on countryside on the outskirts of Cardf. Option eight would be a mix of using greenfield and brownfield sites, in urban areas and the countryside, to get the best of both.Cllr Wild added: ldquoAt this stage of the process, all of the options that are presented in the consultation are potential options, rather than preferred options. The preferred strategy could combine a number of these options together. All of the feedback from the public will be considered, alongside further technical work, which will help the council prepare the preferred strategy that will be consulted on with the public in autumn .This consultation follows a previous one held earlier this year, which focused on what the broader goals of the replacement development plan should look like. This included exploring how the city should face problems like coronavirus and the climate crisis. The final plan is expected to be approved in October . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

communities is critical and I am pleased to have worked along side our DUP council team who have been to the fore in championing and driving forward the play park replacement and looking at an overall play strategy. “We will continue to work hard to deliver on this election promise. “We also made the point concerning the need for inclusion of equipment for those children with physical disabilities.

contacting me for some time around the need for a play facility and the proposals being brought forward by Council would ensure the delivery of a first class play park in the area. “I am committed to driving this project forward and trust all other parties will get behind the investment needed to make this a reality. “Play is so important for physical and mental health and development,” said the

Last week saw the completion of the booster programme to those in Supported Living accommodation, those attending Adult Learning Disability Day Care Centres, and those who are homeless. Residents, service-users in the community, and staff who were eligible for the vaccine booster received their jab at a total of  facilities spread right across the Western Trust area. Karen Hargan, Western Trust HR Director and Vaccination Programme Lead, said the programme just completed is testament to the Trust’s commitment to looking after some of the most vulnerable citizens in our community. “As a Trust, we are dealing with an ever-changing situation when it comes to vaccinations. As new iants come to light, and transmission rates alter, we have to adapt our plans accordingly. But one of our key priorities will always be to look after our most vulnerable citizens to ensure that they do not miss out, are protected from this virus, and are not left behind. “I would like to personally offer my thanks to all of the owners of these facilities and their staff for helping us to deliver this programme, and of course to our highly skilled and extremely dedicated vaccination teams, without whom programmes like these simply would not be possible.” For the latest information on the Western Trust’s vaccination programme please visit the Western Trust Vaccination Info page.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cebcdbf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cbdbddcbaeb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1638984916407.jpg--covid_19___wed_8th_december_figures.jpg?163898491600","title":"covid  wed th december figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows five further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.
