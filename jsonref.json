I think it\u0027s a combination of both things.Wanda Barzee, 72, is pictured for the FIRST TIME since her...Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, 31, exhibits her model figure in...Big Brother: Lewis Gregory can\u0027t hide his delight as he...Share this article\u0027That kind of a message, it might not be for everybody. But there is a group of people for whom that message is designed. And nothing fills my soul more than to think that maybe some kid watching that would say, \u0027Hey, I\u0027ve been thinking about that. I\u0027ve been thinking about praying. Let me try that out.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s like the only way I feel like I can repay what has essentially been a giant gift in my life.\u0027Top honor: On Monday, Chris Pratt, 38, received the MTV Movie \u0026amp TV Generation AwardPratt dismissed the idea that talking so openly about his faith, particularity at a non-religious event, could be a risk in Hollywood. \u0027I think that there\u0027s this narrative that exists out there that Hollywood is anti-Christian or anti-religious, but it\u0027s just not the case,\u0027 he said.\u0027They are kind of not anti-anything. They are kind of pro whatever is authentic to you. \u0027And I like that. Because it\u0027s authentic for me to be pro-Christian, pro-Jesus. That\u0027s my thing. I like it. \u0027And I\u0027ve never had anyone try to shame me, to my face. Maybe they go say it behind my back. But if that\u0027s the case, go ahead. You can say whatever you want about me - to my face or behind my back. I\u0027m not going to change.\u0027Aside from his Christianity, Pratt said that exercise way a major motivator in his life.     The couple that exercise together: Chris Pratt, 39, and girlfriend  Katherine Schwarzenegger, 28, were spotted out for a walk on a sunny Saturday in Los Angeles           Old love: Chris with his wife of eight years, actress Anna Faris, and their son Jack, six , at his Hollywood star ceremony in 2017. They filed for orce last DecemberThe interview with The Associated Press, took place after Michelob Ultra, which Pratt is a spokesman for, announced it was sponsoring seven athletes with disabilities, part of the nonprofit group Achilles International, to run in the New York City Marathon. \u0027It\u0027s hard enough to do a marathon or to do a triathlon. But to do it when you have physical limitations and disabilities, it\u0027s pretty awe-inspiring,\u0027 he said, adding that fitness is \u0027a great common denominator.\u0027The 39-year-old actor, who enjoys biking, running and ocean swimming when at his farm in the San Juan Islands off the coast of Washington state, says that he feels he was \u0027genetically made for... moving refrigerators or something.\u0027\u0027But now I\u0027m doing a job that really isn\u0027t that physically demanding. So having something that I can just shut my mind off and do physically every day is good for me.\u0027The Jurassic World actor added that he is a little self-conscious about his running skills, after breaking his leg as a child left one of his legs crooked, and so he was in awe of actors like Tom Cruise who could sprint flawlessly on screen and did their own stunts.\u0027When I run, I run a little crooked. And if I run at top speed, there\u0027s a high likelihood I will fall down,\u0027 he said.\u0027Tom Cruise. \u0027Mission: Impossible\u0027 - he ran across London, across bridges, over buildings. Yeah, Tom is a great runner. He did all his own jumping, he was flying the helicopter, he really was like - oh, if there\u0027s a question of whether or not I\u0027m the best at this, let me put that question to bed. He\u0027s the best.\u0027But it was Cruise\u0027s reputation that Pratt said he most admired.          The 39-year-old actor, who enjoys biking, running and ocean swimming when at his farm in the San Juan Islands off the coast of Washington state          Pratt has erected crosses on his land \u0027One of the career goals that I have based on Tom Cruise is his reputation as being a really nice, positive guy who works hard. I\u0027ve never actually met him, but I would like - if you\u0027re going to leave a legacy, it\u0027d be nice to have it be that people thought you were nice and easy to work with and you worked hard. I think that\u0027s pretty cool.\u0027Prat split from his wife Anna Faris last year, but has found love again in Katherine Schwarzenegger, 28.They came out as a couple in June and have been spotted enjoying a sunny Saturday day in Los Angeles last weekend.Proving that couple that exercises together stays together, they enjoyed a walk. At one point the beautiful 28-year-old daughter of Arnold Schwarzenegger and his ex-wife Maria Shriver reached out to lovingly stroke her beau\u0027s arm. Chris and Katherine are reportedly serious, a source dished to People, even though they\u0027ve only been together a few months \u0027They\u0027re both serious about the relationship and hopeful for the future,\u0027 the source revealed. \u0027Chris doesn\u0027t just date to date, and neither does Katherine. She\u0027s very excited.\u0027 They were set up by her mom Maria, according to the source.The actor split from wife Anna Faris in August 2017 after being married for eight years and they share six-year-old son Jack.  He filed for orce on December 1, nearly four months after they announced their legal separation. Three days later Anna filed her nearly identical response. They both cited irreconcilable differences and requested joint legal and physical custody of their son, according to E!

One of the things that the book shows or at least tries to show are the things that they say on the one hand and the things that they do on the other, and they often don’t match up,’ Moisey told DailyMail.com. The purpose of the book, which is being published by Daylight, was not to focus on the one particular fraternity but rather that secret societies are a part of American culture - a huge aspect that often isn\u0027t seen, he explained.He said: ‘I was not interested in this particular fraternity itself but I was interested in the culture that the United States has of men joining secret societies in college and the kinds of things that they do that other people not in those societies don’t do.’   Many photographs in the book show binge drinking and drunkenness, which is in sharp contrast to the ideals the fraternity holds and that are laid out in the organization\u0027s ritual book           Moisey gained access to the fraternity through his brother, who was a member. He documented the partying and some ceremonies but even for him some rituals were off-limits. Above, two fraternity members pour beer down one member\u0027s throat          The fraternity is all about shaping young men to have particular values, Moisey told DailyMail.com, and they pledge oaths to very high values.

I thought often some of that was beautiful,’ he said. He noted that it becomes a problem when the wildness and drunkenness \u0027reaches a point where it spills over into the rest of society.’Prestigious fraternity is investigated for \u0027extreme hazing\u0027...Frat boys left weeping after parents of three students...At Yale, Kavanaugh stayed out of debates at a time of manyParents of LSU fraternity pledge sue after son\u0027s deathShare this articlePhotos include one that shows a woman passed out on a bed, others where young women are drinking with the fraternity brothers, and as part of couples.‘A lot of the things that seemed interesting or alarming gender-wise now look worse in the #MeToo era,’ he said. ‘Now the pictures have a relevance that I never thought that they would have.’   The purpose of the book was not to focus on the one particular fraternity but rather that secret societies are a part of American culture - a huge aspect that often isn\u0027t seen, Moisey said. His photographs depict a fraternity house that is derelict and decrepit, above, is a member in a kitchen that is disarray          ‘The people in my pictures are not bad people. They’re not evil people. A lot of them have very strong relationships with their girlfriends and their families and a lot of them are people that I look up to but they get caught up in a culture that I don’t really think should exist,\u0027 Moisey said. On the right is drawing of a stick figures engaged in a sex act on a door, and the left, a member of the fraternity smoking            Moisey said he wasn\u0027t comfortable saying that he witnessed hazing but felt that based on what \u0027you see in my pictures you can decide whether or not some of the things that they go through are necessary for friendship and bonding’          Moisey said the fraternity brothers let him photograph their wild celebrations, in this instance, above, it looks as if something like flour is being poured on a naked fraternity memberMoisey noted that his shooting of the photos took place mainly during the presidency of George W. Bush. ‘I made these pictures in the Bush years, when we had a president who just outwardly embodied the frat boy ethos,’  he said.Vintage shots of fraternity brothers and buildings are also strewn throughout the book. Former presidents and fraternity members, such as Bush, his father, George H. W. Bush, and John F. Kennedy, are shown and listed. The book’s appendix, ‘Men of Distinction’ lists the many captains of industry, CEOs, chairmen, senators, and government leaders, such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, that were also fraternity members. Also on the list is current Supreme Court justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual assault, and who is a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon chapter at Yale University - the same fraternity as Bush and his father George H. W. Bush.          Former presidents and fraternity members, such as George W. Bush (top row, right), his father, George H. W. Bush (middle row, middle picture) and John F. Kennedy (bottom, left), are shown and listed. The book’s appendix, ‘Men of Distinction’ lists the many captains of industry, CEOs, chairmen, senators, and government leaders, such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, that were also fraternity membersMoisey said that he tried to frame the book in terms that some of the young men pictured are poised to become leaders.‘Many of our past and present leaders have joined these institutions,’ he said. ‘So (readers) can see the people in the pictures not just as a random group of guys or boys who are behaving like boys… but as our past and future leaders so they can attach those names to bodies.’            A list of Supreme Court justices that were also fraternity members, according to a new book called ‘The American Fraternity: An Illustrated Ritual Manual\u0027The metaphor he is trying to get across, he said, is that the image that the rest of the world has of the \u0027ugly American\u0027 is the image that we have of the fraternity man.   The fraternity house is shown as derelict and decrepit: books overflowing on a cart and scattered on the floor, a kitchen that has seen better days with plaster on the ground, and a shot of a fraternity member, his legs splayed and forlornly holding a broom as detritus from a party – beer cans and cups are around him. There are also photographs of the brothers engaging in everyday activities, such as sleeping, ironing, sitting and chilling, and one when a fraternity member holds an apple in his hand while eating it. There are the somber, ceremonial moments where they take part in their rituals where only candlelight illuminates them, and a tender moment when two brothers hug. Other photographs are framed as portraits with close-ups of faces.  The shots of debauchery are contrasted with the seriousness of the ritual book of ‘Psi Rho’ - a made-up name for the fraternity that Moisey chronicled. It starts with the initiation ceremony, where candidates are supposed to wear black robes, and passwords and signals are needed to enter the ‘chamber of preparation.’ When they enter what is called the lodge, there is supposed to be a coffin with either a human skull or skeleton. At one point, the pledge is put in the coffin, wrists bound with cord and hands ‘palm to palm,’ according to the book.           Moisey did the bulk of his shooting during George W. Bush\u0027s presidency, he said, \u0027when we had a president who just outwardly embodied the frat boy ethos\u0027          \u0027It’s like a wildness that they cultivate,’ Moisey said about fraternities. Above, a fraternity member on his knees. He noted that it becomes a problem when the wildness and drunkenness \u0027reaches a point where it spills over into the rest of society’          ‘I don’t think that any of the people in the fraternity will feel that my book represents the entirety of their experience. I want to caution people against seeing it that way because most of being in a fraternity is totally innocent. Most of what a person does is sits around, talks with his friends, you know, plays video games and goes to class... I wanted to focus on the cultural problem, not the entirety of a fraternity man’s experience,’ Moisey said. A member of the fraternity (pictured) in a suitThen the brothers form a funeral procession ‘and the coffin borne in the direction of the sun three times about the lodge.’ The candidate pledges himself to the fraternity, ‘solemnly and sincerely promise and vow’ that he submits himself to the discipline of the fraternity, and he will obey, ‘maintain and support’ its constitution and laws, according to the book. There is a ritual of initiation, where a pledge begins the path of becoming a fraternity brother, Moisey said, with the idea being that ‘you’re a person who’s lost in the darkness of the rest of the world and who’s found the light in the fraternity house.’           Photographer Andrew Moisey spent seven years chronicling an unnamed fraternity for his new book, \u0027The American Fraternity: An Illustrated Ritual Manual\u0027Candles are lit for truth, honesty and purity, and in a section called ‘The Libations,’ ‘Honor and Chivalry are basic principles of our Fraternity. Without them men are unworthy of friendship,’ according to the book. As part of the ‘Candle Ceremony,’ the Lord’s Prayer is supposed to be recited while on the right-sided page, a photo shows a fraternity member grabbing a woman’s breast.The book also includes the song, \u0027Yo-Ho,\u0027 with lyrics such as \u0027I put my hand upon her s*****,\u0027 and \u0027I put my c*** inside her mouth.\u0027 The corresponding page is a photograph of a brother holding a dog - its teeth bared - while it seems as if an arm is extending to punch it.Moisey said he wanted to emphasize that ‘The people in my pictures are not bad people. They’re not evil people. A lot of them have very strong relationships with their girlfriends and their families and a lot of them are people that I look up to but they get caught up in a culture that I don’t really think should exist. I don’t think that men uniting into a secret society is the best idea for everybody else.’ ‘I don’t think that any of the people in the fraternity will feel that my book represents the entirety of their experience. I want to caution people against seeing it that way because most of being in a fraternity is totally innocent. Most of what a person does is sits around, talks with his friends, you know plays video games and goes to class... I wanted to focus on the cultural problem, not the entirety of a fraternity man’s experience.’          During the period that Moisey was photographing the fraternity, a member died, and above, is a photograph he took of the funeral. Moisey declined to go into specifics out of respect for the member\u0027s family "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/21/17/5005259600000578-0-image-a-13_1537548697756.jpg","title":"International Day Peace 2018 need know designated day","story":"Lil Wayne Tha Carter V: Weezy fans vent on Twitter after long-awaited album isn\u0027t releasedWhen is the X Factor 2018 final and how to get tickets revealedX Factor 2018 spoilers: Judges\u0027 categories, guest stars, final date and more revealed Mister Rogers\u0027 Neighborhood star is celebrated with a Google DoodleWho is Khabib Nurmagomedov?

Orrin Hatch of Utah told CNN, \u0027Somebody\u0027s mixed up.\u0027Experts say a person\u0027s memory is not like a video recorder, perfectly capturing an objective record of everything that happens for later retrieval.\u0027Memory is mostly true but sometimes unreliable,\u0027 said psychologist Jennifer Talarico of Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania. Generally, \u0027we get the gist mostly right.\u0027Your beliefs and expectations shape what you perceive in your life and how you later remember those events, researchers say.  Ford, a 51-year-old California psychology professor (pictured in 1984, left), told The Washington Post that she told nobody about the alleged incident in any detail until 2012. Kavanaugh (seen in his yearbook photo, right) has repeatedly denied Dr Ford’s allegation\u0027You are constructing the reality out there as it happens, and therefore you get stuck with that ... as the most accurate you can have for your memory,\u0027 said David Rubin, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University. \u0027That\u0027s all you have to base your memory on.\u0027So in a situation where a woman fears being raped by a man, her memories might be shaped by that fear into a recollection that overestimates the threat, whereas the man might consider it \u0027just playing around\u0027 and simply forget it later on, Rubin said. And both could be completely honest about their recollections.Rubin noted the obvious fact that people can forget things they did while drunk. But he said the man in his scenario could forget about the event even if he had been sober.Typically, when people make mistakes in recalling an event, they unknowingly slip in details that would be typical on such occasions, Talarico said. When it comes to emotionally charged events, it\u0027s typical to remember a central person or an item such as a gun but forget the context and details, Newcombe said. \u0027You have this vivid central thing and everything else is fuzzy,\u0027 she said. \u0027Emotion makes one thing go up and the other go down.\u0027So it would be wrong to challenge Ford\u0027s memory of the alleged incident over inability to recall details, Newcombe said.Ford, a 51-year-old California psychology professor, told The Washington Post that she told nobody about the alleged incident in any detail until 2012, while in couples therapy. Her husband said he recalled her using Kavanaugh\u0027s last name at that time.Some experts cited a classic case of how memory can fail: the 1973 Senate committee testimony of John Dean, former counsel to President Richard Nixon, regarding the Watergate affair. He testified about conversations that, it later turned out, had been recorded.In 1981, a psychologist published a comparison of his testimony to the tapes and found that even though Dean was basically right about the existence of a cover-up, his accounts of conversations were often wrong.As for the Kavanaugh matter, Rubin said, \u0027We don\u0027t have the tapes for what happened at the party.\u0027Dr Ford’s lawyers are currently negotiating with the Senate Judiciary Committee on the terms of her possible testimony next week, raising the prospect of a dramatic Senate showdown over Dr Ford’s accusation.On Thursday, Dr Ford’s lawyers told the Judiciary Committee that her preference is to give evidence next Thursday.She does not want Kavanaugh in the same room, her lawyer told the panel’s staff in a 30-minute call that also touched on security concerns and others issues, according to a Senate aide.Dr Ford is willing to tell her story, but only if agreement can be reached on \u0027terms that are fair and which ensure her safety,\u0027 the lawyer said.She said Dr Ford needs time to make sure her family is secure, prepare her testimony and travel to Washington.          President Trump weighed in on the sexual assault allegations Friday, challenging Dr Ford\u0027s account The accusation has jarred the 53-year-old conservative jurist’s prospects for winning confirmation, which until Dr Ford’s emergence last week had seemed all but certain.It has also bloomed into a broader clash over whether women alleging abuse are taken seriously by men and how both political parties address such claims with the advent of the #MeToo movement, a theme that could echo in this November’s elections for control of Congress.The discussions have revived the possibility that the panel will hold an electrifying campaign-season hearing at which both Dr Ford and Kavanaugh can give their versions of what did or did not happen at the party 35 years ago.Kavanaugh, now a judge on the powerful US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, has repeatedly denied Dr Ford’s allegation.Abandoning his previous restrain, President Donald Trump tweeted on Friday: \u0027I have no doubt that, if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents. I ask that she bring those filings forward so that we can learn date, time, and place!\u0027The president previously had avoided naming Dr Ford or casting doubt on her account. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/13/22/5025072600000578-0-image-a-40_1536874347046.jpg","title":"BBC taken legal action against sizes dance tutor running Strictly Curved","story":"    Essex-based dance tutor, Teresa Lawrence, 50, (above) runs \u0027fun dancing classes for the fuller figure\u0027A pint-sized dance troupe for larger-figured ladies has come under attack, with BBC bosses claiming the catchy title \u0027Strictly Curved\u0027 is too similar to the broadcaster\u0027s hit TV show. Essex-based dance tutor, Teresa Lawrence, who runs \u0027fun dancing classes for the fuller figure\u0027, called the BBC \u0027petty and stupid\u0027 for threatening legal action in a letter she received on Monday.  \u0027It looks like we have to change our name as the BBC won\u0027t let us use the word \u0027strictly\u0027!\u0027 the 50-year-old dance tutor shared over her group\u0027s Facebook page. \u0027Oh well they won\u0027t get us down we will all come up with a better name as strictly speaking it won\u0027t bother us,\u0027 she joked. Teresa, who is a proud size 24 and lives in Basildon, runs classes for \u0027the fuller figure\u0027 in community centres across Essex for around £5 a class.           A pint-sized dance troupe for larger-figured ladies (pictured) has come under attack, with BBC bosses claiming the catchy title \u0027Strictly Curved\u0027 is too similar to the broadcaster\u0027s hit TV show          \u0027It looks like we have to change our name as the BBC won\u0027t let us use the word \u0027strictly\u0027!\u0027 the 50-year-old dance tutor shared over her group\u0027s Facebook pageShe applied to trademark the name Strictly Curved in August but on Monday received a letter from BBC lawyers  demanding she change the name and remove her Facebook page.The letter - sent by the BBC\u0027s Intellectual Property Department - dictates she has a week to stop using \u0027anything similar\u0027 to the Strictly Come Dancing brand, which the broadcaster has trademarked. Katie Piper \u0027is given round-the-clock security by Strictly...Share this articleBut Teresa says her classes - run three times a week - attract about 30 people for each session. \u0027It\u0027s not like I\u0027m earning millions of pounds from it!\u0027 she told MailOnline.  \u0027Strictly Come Dancing has 10million viewers.

One of the things that the book shows or at least tries to show are the things that they say on the one hand and the things that they do on the other, and they often don’t match up,’ Moisey told DailyMail.com. The purpose of the book, which is being published by Daylight, was not to focus on the one particular fraternity but rather that secret societies are a part of American culture - a huge aspect that often isn\u0027t seen, he explained.He said: ‘I was not interested in this particular fraternity itself but I was interested in the culture that the United States has of men joining secret societies in college and the kinds of things that they do that other people not in those societies don’t do.’   Many photographs in the book show binge drinking and drunkenness, which is in sharp contrast to the ideals the fraternity holds and that are laid out in the organization\u0027s ritual book           Moisey gained access to the fraternity through his brother, who was a member. He documented the partying and some ceremonies but even for him some rituals were off-limits.

I thought often some of that was beautiful,’ he said.

Bush. ‘I made these pictures in the Bush years, when we had a president who just outwardly embodied the frat boy ethos,’  he said.Vintage shots of fraternity brothers and buildings are also strewn throughout the book. Former presidents and fraternity members, such as Bush, his father, George H. W. Bush, and John F. Kennedy, are shown and listed. The book’s appendix, ‘Men of Distinction’ lists the many captains of industry, CEOs, chairmen, senators, and government leaders, such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, that were also fraternity members. Also on the list is current Supreme Court justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual assault, and who is a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon chapter at Yale University - the same fraternity as Bush and his father George H. W. Bush.          Former presidents and fraternity members, such as George W. Bush (top row, right), his father, George H. W. Bush (middle row, middle picture) and John F. Kennedy (bottom, left), are shown and listed. The book’s appendix, ‘Men of Distinction’ lists the many captains of industry, CEOs, chairmen, senators, and government leaders, such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, that were also fraternity membersMoisey said that he tried to frame the book in terms that some of the young men pictured are poised to become leaders.‘Many of our past and present leaders have joined these institutions,’ he said. ‘So (readers) can see the people in the pictures not just as a random group of guys or boys who are behaving like boys… but as our past and future leaders so they can attach those names to bodies.’            A list of Supreme Court justices that were also fraternity members, according to a new book called ‘The American Fraternity: An Illustrated Ritual Manual\u0027The metaphor he is trying to get across, he said, is that the image that the rest of the world has of the \u0027ugly American\u0027 is the image that we have of the fraternity man.   The fraternity house is shown as derelict and decrepit: books overflowing on a cart and scattered on the floor, a kitchen that has seen better days with plaster on the ground, and a shot of a fraternity member, his legs splayed and forlornly holding a broom as detritus from a party – beer cans and cups are around him. There are also photographs of the brothers engaging in everyday activities, such as sleeping, ironing, sitting and chilling, and one when a fraternity member holds an apple in his hand while eating it. There are the somber, ceremonial moments where they take part in their rituals where only candlelight illuminates them, and a tender moment when two brothers hug. Other photographs are framed as portraits with close-ups of faces.  The shots of debauchery are contrasted with the seriousness of the ritual book of ‘Psi Rho’ - a made-up name for the fraternity that Moisey chronicled. It starts with the initiation ceremony, where candidates are supposed to wear black robes, and passwords and signals are needed to enter the ‘chamber of preparation.’ When they enter what is called the lodge, there is supposed to be a coffin with either a human skull or skeleton. At one point, the pledge is put in the coffin, wrists bound with cord and hands ‘palm to palm,’ according to the book.           Moisey did the bulk of his shooting during George W. Bush\u0027s presidency, he said, \u0027when we had a president who just outwardly embodied the frat boy ethos\u0027          \u0027It’s like a wildness that they cultivate,’ Moisey said about fraternities. Above, a fraternity member on his knees. He noted that it becomes a problem when the wildness and drunkenness \u0027reaches a point where it spills over into the rest of society’          ‘I don’t think that any of the people in the fraternity will feel that my book represents the entirety of their experience. I want to caution people against seeing it that way because most of being in a fraternity is totally innocent. Most of what a person does is sits around, talks with his friends, you know, plays video games and goes to class... I wanted to focus on the cultural problem, not the entirety of a fraternity man’s experience,’ Moisey said. A member of the fraternity (pictured) in a suitThen the brothers form a funeral procession ‘and the coffin borne in the direction of the sun three times about the lodge.’ The candidate pledges himself to the fraternity, ‘solemnly and sincerely promise and vow’ that he submits himself to the discipline of the fraternity, and he will obey, ‘maintain and support’ its constitution and laws, according to the book. There is a ritual of initiation, where a pledge begins the path of becoming a fraternity brother, Moisey said, with the idea being that ‘you’re a person who’s lost in the darkness of the rest of the world and who’s found the light in the fraternity house.’           Photographer Andrew Moisey spent seven years chronicling an unnamed fraternity for his new book, \u0027The American Fraternity: An Illustrated Ritual Manual\u0027Candles are lit for truth, honesty and purity, and in a section called ‘The Libations,’ ‘Honor and Chivalry are basic principles of our Fraternity. Without them men are unworthy of friendship,’ according to the book. As part of the ‘Candle Ceremony,’ the Lord’s Prayer is supposed to be recited while on the right-sided page, a photo shows a fraternity member grabbing a woman’s breast.The book also includes the song, \u0027Yo-Ho,\u0027 with lyrics such as \u0027I put my hand upon her s*****,\u0027 and \u0027I put my c*** inside her mouth.\u0027 The corresponding page is a photograph of a brother holding a dog - its teeth bared - while it seems as if an arm is extending to punch it.Moisey said he wanted to emphasize that ‘The people in my pictures are not bad people. They’re not evil people. A lot of them have very strong relationships with their girlfriends and their families and a lot of them are people that I look up to but they get caught up in a culture that I don’t really think should exist. I don’t think that men uniting into a secret society is the best idea for everybody else.’ ‘I don’t think that any of the people in the fraternity will feel that my book represents the entirety of their experience.

Most of what a person does is sits around, talks with his friends, you know plays video games and goes to class... I wanted to focus on the cultural problem, not the entirety of a fraternity man’s experience.’          During the period that Moisey was photographing the fraternity, a member died, and above, is a photograph he took of the funeral.

Ford, a 51-year-old California psychology professor (pictured in 1984, left), told The Washington Post that she told nobody about the alleged incident in any detail until 2012. Kavanaugh (seen in his yearbook photo, right) has repeatedly denied Dr Ford’s allegation\u0027You are constructing the reality out there as it happens, and therefore you get stuck with that ... as the most accurate you can have for your memory,\u0027 said David Rubin, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University. \u0027That\u0027s all you have to base your memory on.\u0027So in a situation where a woman fears being raped by a man, her memories might be shaped by that fear into a recollection that overestimates the threat, whereas the man might consider it \u0027just playing around\u0027 and simply forget it later on, Rubin said. And both could be completely honest about their recollections.Rubin noted the obvious fact that people can forget things they did while drunk. But he said the man in his scenario could forget about the event even if he had been sober.Typically, when people make mistakes in recalling an event, they unknowingly slip in details that would be typical on such occasions, Talarico said. When it comes to emotionally charged events, it\u0027s typical to remember a central person or an item such as a gun but forget the context and details, Newcombe said. \u0027You have this vivid central thing and everything else is fuzzy,\u0027 she said. \u0027Emotion makes one thing go up and the other go down.\u0027So it would be wrong to challenge Ford\u0027s memory of the alleged incident over inability to recall details, Newcombe said.Ford, a 51-year-old California psychology professor, told The Washington Post that she told nobody about the alleged incident in any detail until 2012, while in couples therapy. Her husband said he recalled her using Kavanaugh\u0027s last name at that time.Some experts cited a classic case of how memory can fail: the 1973 Senate committee testimony of John Dean, former counsel to President Richard Nixon, regarding the Watergate affair. He testified about conversations that, it later turned out, had been recorded.In 1981, a psychologist published a comparison of his testimony to the tapes and found that even though Dean was basically right about the existence of a cover-up, his accounts of conversations were often wrong.As for the Kavanaugh matter, Rubin said, \u0027We don\u0027t have the tapes for what happened at the party.\u0027Dr Ford’s lawyers are currently negotiating with the Senate Judiciary Committee on the terms of her possible testimony next week, raising the prospect of a dramatic Senate showdown over Dr Ford’s accusation.On Thursday, Dr Ford’s lawyers told the Judiciary Committee that her preference is to give evidence next Thursday.She does not want Kavanaugh in the same room, her lawyer told the panel’s staff in a 30-minute call that also touched on security concerns and others issues, according to a Senate aide.Dr Ford is willing to tell her story, but only if agreement can be reached on \u0027terms that are fair and which ensure her safety,\u0027 the lawyer said.She said Dr Ford needs time to make sure her family is secure, prepare her testimony and travel to Washington.          President Trump weighed in on the sexual assault allegations Friday, challenging Dr Ford\u0027s account The accusation has jarred the 53-year-old conservative jurist’s prospects for winning confirmation, which until Dr Ford’s emergence last week had seemed all but certain.It has also bloomed into a broader clash over whether women alleging abuse are taken seriously by men and how both political parties address such claims with the advent of the #MeToo movement, a theme that could echo in this November’s elections for control of Congress.The discussions have revived the possibility that the panel will hold an electrifying campaign-season hearing at which both Dr Ford and Kavanaugh can give their versions of what did or did not happen at the party 35 years ago.Kavanaugh, now a judge on the powerful US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, has repeatedly denied Dr Ford’s allegation.Abandoning his previous restrain, President Donald Trump tweeted on Friday: \u0027I have no doubt that, if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents. I ask that she bring those filings forward so that we can learn date, time, and place!\u0027The president previously had avoided naming Dr Ford or casting doubt on her account. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/20/12/02EA8215000007D0-0-image-m-50_1537441855629.jpg","title":"Natwest online mobile banking goes down","story":"    NatWest customers complained that they had been unable to use their cash cards in ATMs in a new IT meltdown           RBS boss Ross McEwan (right) was on LBC with Nick Ferrari today where he apologised to the millions affected by the IT glitch          NatWest\u0027s internet banking and app went down today leaving millions without access to their accounts          This customer has been warned she will face fees unless her overdraft is cleared - but could not get into her accountMr McEwan was on LBC today to talk about the bank and Brexit but was taken to task over the online banking problems. One listener asked him if the bonuses of those in charge of IT would lose their bonuses.Mr McEwan said: \u0027If we docked people every time something went wrong you\u0027d have an organisation where nothing would change.

We are aware of the problem and are working to fix the issue.\u0027Customers can still use ATMs and telephone banking.\u0027The glitch came a day after some Barclays customers were left struggling to log in to their accounts due to a technical problem.Millions of Barclays customers were locked out of their accounts yesterday when the bank\u0027s online, mobile and telephone systems crashed.Users complained they were unable to log in for most of the day, leaving them unable to pay bills or transfer money.They also faced problems in branches, where some systems were down and cash machines allowing people to withdraw larger amounts of money were not working.The latest fiasco to hit the banking industry comes after TSB\u0027s computer system meltdown earlier this year left customers facing disruption for weeks.

Regulators and politicians are increasing scrutiny over banks\u0027 cyber resilience.The consequences for banks of online banking problems and the subsequent scrutiny of those failings by politicians can be severe.Earlier this year a major outage at mid-sized lender TSB, owned by Spain\u0027s Sabadell, left thousands of customers unable to access their money or make vital payments for long periods.TSB Chief Executive Paul Pester resigned this month, following heavy criticism by the Treasury Committee and the bank\u0027s customers for his handling of the crisis.British banks do not have long to strengthen their contingency plans for when online banking services fail.The Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority in July set a deadline of Oct. 5 for British lenders to explain how they can avoid damaging IT breakdowns and respond to the growing threat of cyber attacks."},{"url":null,"title":"Chris Grayling says Britain heading no deal Brexit","story":"    Chris Grayling told the BBC last night that the EU needed to realise that no deal was possible if they insisted on a border in IrelandTheresa May\u0027s cabinet ally Chris Grayling has said Britain is heading for a no deal Brexit unless Euroocrats change their minds on the Irish borderThe Transport Secretary says the Government will not drop its Chequers plan despite a disastrous summit in Salzburg leaders where EU leaders threw it back in Mrs May\u0027s face.She was ambushed in Austria yesterday when No 10 had hoped there was going to be breakthrough in negotiations.Last night Chris Grayling said the EU knew Mrs May\u0027s red line was the Irish border issue and warned them without a softening of position by Brussels there will be no deal.He told Newsnight: \u0027We are in the midst of a negotiation where people are setting out robust, firm positions – and this is often the way with the European Union.

But unlike the Brexiteers, it says technology cannot solve the Irish border problem.Instead, it has laid out proposals for Northern Ireland to stay within its customs jurisdiction - something Mrs May says she could never accept because it would mean splitting the UK. Here are the main differences between the two models:                                                                                                 CHEQUERSTrade:Britain would stick to EU rules on goods by adopting a \u0027Common rulebook\u0027 with Brussels, but in the services sector.Theresa May says this would allow the UK strike free trade deals globally, but the scope would be limited by commitments to the EU.The blueprint should minimise the need for extra checks at the borders - protecting the \u0027just in time\u0027 systems used by the car industry to import and export parts.The UK Parliament could choose to erge from these EU rules over time.But there is an admission that this would \u0027have consequences\u0027.Customs:Britain would set up something called a Facilitated Customs Arrangement.This would see the UK effectively act as the EU\u0027s taxman - using British officials to collect customs which would then be paid on to the bloc. The borders between the UK and EU will be treated as a \u0027combined customs territory\u0027.The UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU.Northern Ireland: Mrs May says her plan will prevent a hard Irish border, and mean no ergence between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain.There would be no need for extra border checks, as tariffs on goods would be the same.Single market origin rules and regulations would also be sufficiently aligned to avoid infrastructure.                                                                                                 CANADA-STYLETrade: Britain would strike a Canada-style free trade deal with the EU, meaning goods can flow both ways without tariffs.As it is a simple free trade deal, Britain would not be bound by the rules and red tape drawn up in Brussels.The arrangement would be a relatively clean break from the EU - but would fall far short of full access to the single market.Eurosceptics have suggested  \u0027Canada plus\u0027 in key areas such as services and mutual recognition of standards.The UK would have broad scope to strike free trade deals around the world.Customs:Technology would be used to avoid extra customs checks on the borders.As a result goods travelling into the UK from the EU and vice versa would be tracked and customs paid without extra checks.The EU has suggested this is \u0027magical thinking\u0027. Northern Ireland:The EU says the Canada model would mean border controls are required between Northern Ireland and the Republic to protect the single market and customs union.It insists Northern Ireland must stay in the bloc\u0027s customs jurisdiction in order to prevent that.Mrs May has signalled she agrees with the analysis - seemingly the reason she is reluctant to go down this route.But Brexiteers point out that there is already a tax border between the UK and Ireland, and say technology and trusted trader schemes can avoid the need for more infrastructure.                                                               Brexiteers such as Jacob Rees-Mogg (left) and Boris Johnson (right) are calling for a looser Canada-style deal with the EU"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/21/18/223EEE4600000578-6194227-image-m-34_1537550200058.jpg","title":"Rare edition philosopher Adam Smiths Wealth Nations goes sale 50 000","story":"    Charles Hanson with one of the volumes of The Wealth of Nations found in a dusty cupboard          The book lays out the principles of modern capitalism and could be worth as much as £50,000      \u0027I now look forward to people saying You\u0027re not as good as...Brexit Britain \u0027should axe cap on skilled migrants... but...Desperate May clings to Chequers plan for Brexit despite...Share this articleConsidered Smith\u0027s magnum opus, the book - which full title \u0027Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations\u0027 - took Smith ten years to write. Jim Spencer, head of the Library Department at Hansons Auctioneers in Derbys, which is handling the contents sale, unearthed the find yesterday and described it like finding \u0027gold\u0027. He said: \u0027I felt like I\u0027d stuck gold.

There is no-one more passionate about books than me.\u0027I\u0027d spent a whole day at Bishton, going into every nook and cranny and practically climbing up chimneys to make sure I didn\u0027t miss anything major.\u0027I was covered in thick dust by the time I\u0027d finished.\u0027This week I was randomly called back to the house for some final checks. I looked into a cupboard beneath a silver cabinet and there it was - pure gold in the world of antiquarian books.           Jim Spencer found the rare book while sorting through the contents of Bishton Hall for a sale          First published in 1776, the book is one of the world\u0027s first assessments of what creates wealth within a nation\u0027It was like finding hidden treasure. Everything about it was absolutely right. I knew straight away it was a first edition.\u0027    Bishton Hall, at Wolseley Bridge, near Stafford, dates back to circa 1750 and its contents are being sold by Hansons Auctioneers on behalf of the Stafford Northcote family, who moved there in 1946.Bishton Hall Country House and Fine Art Auction will take place from October 10 to 16 at the Georgian mansion, with The Wealth of Nations being sold on October 15 with a guide price of £30,000 to £50,000. When it was first published in 1776 it cost £1, 16 shillings.      Governor of the Bank of England at the time, Mervyn King, holding the new Adam Smith £20 note which went into circulation in March 2007Adam Smith was a Scottish economist, philosopher, author and a pioneer of political economy.He was a moral philosopher and a key figure during the Scottish Enlightenment, as well as being considered the father of modern economics.In 2006 it was announced Adam Smith would replace Edward Elgar on the £20 and go into circulation the following year.He will be replaced on the banknote by painter Joseph Turner in 2020.Smith is best known for two classic works, namely An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations in 1776, when was aged 52, and The Theory of Moral Sentiments, written in 1759.The second book is usually abbreviated as The Wealth of Nations, and is considered his magnum opus and the first modern work of economics.Smith laid the foundations of classical free market economic theory and against oppressive tariffs with The Wealth of Nations as a precursor to the modern academic study of economics.His writing came mostly from his own observations of the workings of industry and cross-border trade.In this and his other works, he developed the concept of ision of labour and looked at upon how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity.Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by Tory writers in the moralising tradition of William Hogarth and Jonathan Swift.He has been celebrated by advocates of free-market policies as the founder of free-market economics, with bodies such as the Adam Smith Institute in London, the Adam Smith Society and the Australian Adam Smith Club, named after him.In 2005, The Wealth of Nations was named among the 100 best Scottish books of all time.The minor planet 12838 Adamsmith was named in his memory after the asteroid was discovered in March 1997 by Belgian astronomer Eric Walter Elst in Chile.

The nude scene, drawn by Lee Bermejo, occurs as Batman removes the Batsuit for a body scan from his computer. The superhero’s genitals were visible in the print edition, but obscured by darkness in digital editions.On Friday, DC confirmed to the  that Batman’s genitals would no longer be depicted in any future editions of the comic. The Hollywood Reporter quotes a “source close to the project” as saying the studio had decided “the nudity did not add to the story and would be removed in future printings”, after an online furore.Around 115,000 copies featuring the superhero’s “lil Wayne” still exist, according to the Hollywood Reporter, with fans fighting to get their hands on the uncensored comic. Big Bang Comics in Dublin announced a one-copy-per-customer limit due to “unprecedented demand”, while comic news website Bleeding Cool reports that Diamond Comics Distributors was listing the title on back-order, meaning no more copies with the offending page will be printed.One fan Tweeted: “Just called my local comic shop to reserve a copy of the book with BATMAN’S PENIS and he muttered under his breath ‘this is ridiculous’ and I am so glad I get to annoy a straight person AND see Bruce Wayne’s peener in the same day.” “I called at 11am and was told no more,” wrote another, sadly.Batman’s is not the first penis to appear in a comic book, but it had been hailed by critics as going some way towards redressing the balance, after all the female flesh that has been depicted in comics for decades. “It is refreshing to see a focus on male nudity. Female bodies are so often exploited in comics, both in their illustration and in character’s lack of agency, that seeing a man’s body on display is frankly refreshing,” wrote Chelsea Steiner in The Mary Sue.Other writers feel the comic does not go far enough. Comics editor Susana Polo argues on the website Polygon that we see “just the barest, silhouetted outline of Batman’s penis”, and that she expected more. “I’m not saying that Watchmen is a classic because Doctor Manhattan’s penis was visible, but I am saying that we had a clearly drawn, fully lit penis in a DC book as early as 1986.”Polo continues: “In an environment where we can all go look at an unofficial drawing of Batman’s penis at any time, I would expect anyone crafting an official drawing of Batman’s penis to take the power of that responsibility and do something bold. Something that’s additive to the story. And so, in this op-ed, written in my full professional capacity, I am arguing that if Batman’s penis is shown in further issues of Batman: Damned, that it be more prominent in both art and story.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5eeb0895eb5abf3bc1c325038e9d7f044ca9790/806_1754_2619_1570/master/2619.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7eecafb95e19c667ad70e8a8c6df11d","title":"how to write a great sentence","story":"Orwell advised cutting as many words as possible, Woolf found energy in verbs, and Baldwin aimed for ‘a sentence as clean as a bone’. What can we learn from celebrated authors about the art of writing well?Every writer, of school age and older, is in the sentences game. The sentence is our writing commons, the shared ground where all writers walk. A poet writes in sentences, and so does the unsung author who came up with “Items trapped in doors cause delays”. The sentence is the Ur-unit, the core material, the granular element that must be got right or nothing will be right. For James Baldwin, the only goal was “to write a sentence as clean as a bone”.What can celebrated writers teach the rest of us about the art of writing a great sentence? A common piece of writing advice is to make your sentences plain, unadorned and invisible. George Orwell gave this piece of advice its epigram: “Good prose is like a windowpane.” A reader should notice the words no more than someone looking through glass notices the glass.Except that you do notice the glass. Picture an English window in 1946, when Orwell wrote that sentence. It would be smeared with grime from smoke and coal dust and, since houses were damp and windows single-glazed, wont to mist and ice over. The glass might still be cracked from air-raid gunfire or bombs, or covered with shatterproof coating to protect people from flying shards. An odd metaphor to use, then, for clear writing.Behind Orwell’s windowpane theory of prose lies a puritan pride, a sense that the writer will be purified by a clean, sinewy style as by an early morning run and a cold shower. “The great enemy of clear language is insincerity,” he wrote. Insincere writing spat out tired idioms “like a cuttlefish spurting out ink”. Bad ideas were the bedfellows of bad prose. Fake thoughts made fake sentences.Some of this is true but none of it is a good way of learning how to write a sentence. More ethical demand than useful advice, it forces writers back to their own reserves of wisdom and authenticity. It blames bad writing on laziness and dishonesty, when a likelier culprit is lack of skill. If you ordered me to make a blancmange, all I could come up with would be a gloopy, inedible mess – not because I am lazy or dishonest, but because, although I have some vague idea that it needs sugar, cornflour and boiled milk, I don’t know how to make a blancmange.Orwell saw the plain English sentence as the sword of existential truth, a cure-all for the bad faith of modern life. But much of the time he didn’t even follow his own advice. “If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out,” he ordered. Perhaps he should have written: “If you can cut a word, do.”Orwell’s prose, as well as ignoring his own rules when it suits, is really a beautiful contrivance. Take the last thing he wrote, in his hospital notebook: “At 50, everyone has the face he deserves.” This unforgettable sentence has an argument behind it that a moment’s thought will reveal as unfair and untrue. Orwell’s oeuvre is full of such sentences that read like eternal verities and turn out to be nonsense. “We may find in the long run that tinned food is a deadlier weapon than the machine gun.” (We didn’t.) “Serious sport … is war minus the shooting.” (War minus the shooting isn’t war.) “Writing a book is a horrible, exhausting struggle, like a long bout of some painful illness.” (Steady on.)A good sentence imposes a logic on the world’s weirdness. It gets its power from the tension between the ease of its phrasing and the shock of its thought slid cleanly into the mind. A sentence, as it proceeds, is a paring away of options. Each added word, because of the English language’s dependence on word order, reduces the writer’s alternatives and narrows the reader’s expectations. But even up to the last word the writer has choices and can throw in a curveball. A sentence can begin in one place and end in another galaxy, without breaking a single syntactic rule. The poet Wayne Koestenbaum calls it “organising lava”, this pleasure to be got from “pushing a sentence in a wrong direction without altering its sweet grammatical composure”.A memorable sentence makes immediate sense but sounds just slightly odd. The model Kate Moss, once asked for her motto, replied: “Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels” – a terrible message to send about dieting and body image, but a well-turned sentence, surely. Skinny, usually an adjective, is here turned into an abstract noun, paired with another abstract noun, nothing. And yet skinny is also quasi-concrete, because where it lies in the sentence suggests that it can actually be felt, just as food has a taste. But feels also retains its non-sensuous sense of intuiting or experiencing something: skinny feels good. As the sentence ends with the snap of a stressed syllable, our perspective has been altered in a way that feels true, even if we don’t share the sentiment. Reality has shifted a little and then clicked back into place.A sentence is much more than its literal meaning. It is a living line of words where logic and lyric meet – a piece of both sense and sound, albeit the sound is only heard in the reader’s head. Rookie sentence-writers are often too busy worrying about the something they are trying to say and don’t worry enough about how that something looks and sounds. They look straight past the words into the meaning that they have strong-armed into them. They fasten on content and forget about form – forgetting that content and form are the same thing, that what a sentence says is the same as how it says it.The word “sentence” comes from the Latin sentire, to feel. A sentence must be felt by the reader, and a feeling is something that grows and fades like anything else that is alive. A line of words should unfold in space and time, not reveal itself all at once, for the simple reason that it cannot be read all at once.John Donne’s sermons are full of sentences that are ever-alert and open to the world: “And into that gate they shall enter, and in that house they shall dwell, where there shall be no Cloud nor Sun, no darkness nor dazzling, but one equal light … ”. His sentences puzzle out their purposes in allusive phrases that hold the attention briefly before the next phrase takes to the floor. They flaunt their learning but revel in the loose-fitting ligatures of speech and thought. Donne’s prose, just like his poetry, is a sort of heartfelt thinking. It brings together judgment and gentleness, reason and passion, acerbity and receptivity. You can actually see him working it all out in front of you on the page, as each sentence moves and gathers force under the prickling itch of the moment – as if he is scrabbling his way towards a beautiful truth just beyond reach.It’s all in the verbs. Virginia Woolf wrote that she wanted to go beyond the “formal railway line of sentence”, to show how people “feel or think or dream … all over the place”. Her serpentine sentences, held loosely together with dashes and commas, catch the butterfly restiveness of the human mind, and the evanescence of human life, as they come up against the more solid surfaces of the world. Like every skilled writer, though, Woolf starkly varies sentence length. Her long, elastic thought refrains collide with shorter, percussive fragments. A year into the second world war, she wrote this defiant sentence in her diary: “Thinking is my fighting.” Even if that doesn’t have what style guides tend to like – a concrete subject and a strong verb – it has a low rumble of energy running through it. Why? Because, apart from the possessive pronoun my, it consists wholly of verbs or verb forms.A decade ago the American writer Gary Lutz gave a lecture to Columbia University students titled “The sentence is a lonely place”. Lutz told them that he was drawn to writing in which “the sentence is a complete, portable solitude, a minute immediacy of consummated language”. He wanted to read books that he could open at any page and find a sentence – “a totality, an omnitude, unto itself” – that gave him something illuminating and cherishable all on its own.Contemporary writers mostly side with Lutz. They leave space and silence between their sentences, so that the reader can see the full stop and hear its click. Sentences have become less shackled to each other. Those written a few hundred years ago typically began with a whereof or a howsobeit, to resume an unfinished thought. And they used lots of conjunctive adverbs, those connecting words like moreover, namely and indeed. Such adverbs are in historical retreat. The use of indeed peaked in print in the 18th century and has been declining ever since. The number of howevers and moreovers has been falling since the 1840s.Readers today can link sentences in their heads without lots of thuses and whereupons to do it for them. Just as cinemagoers have learned to see the implied continuity of time across the quick cuts of a film, without needing a caption that says “meanwhile, back at the ranch”, so have readers learned to make a little cognitive jump between sentences.A lot of contemporary writing treats its sentences as lonely places, and then joins them together through evocative juxtaposition – the convergence of their collective solitude, if you like. This makes the sentences at the start and end of paragraphs crucial, because that is where the biggest thought-leap occurs. You can alter the whole tone of a sentence by moving it from the end of a paragraph to the start of a new one, and vice versa. Annie Dillard likes to start or end her paragraphs by swerving into unexpected terrain: “Why do we concern ourselves over which side of the membrane of soil our feet poke?” Maggie Nelson leaves gravid pauses between her sentences and paragraphs, where implications sit. Her book The Argonauts tells the story of a developing romance and relationship in short paragraphs and single sentences surrounded by white space. One paragraph begins with a sentence that sparingly conveys a new intimacy: “And then, just like that, I was folding your son’s laundry.”If a writer’s sentences have enough life and interest in them – with “every step an arrival”, as Rainer Maria Rilke put it – they will hold the reader and move the writing along. The writing finds a hidden unity that has no need of the mucilage of linking phrases. Each sentence is like a tidal island that looks cut off until, at low tide, a causeway to the mainland appears. A good lesson for any writer: make each sentence worth reading, and something in it will lead the reader into the next one. Good writers write not just in sentences but with sentences.

So what makes us unique?You are an animal, but a very special one. Mostly bald, you’re an ape, descended from apes your features and actions are carved or winnowed by natural selection. But what a special simian you are. Shakespeare crystallised this thought a good 250 years before Charles Darwin positioned us as a creature at the end of the slightest of twigs on a single, bewildering family tree that encompasses 4bn years, a lot of twists and turns, and 1 billion species.“What a piece of work is a man!” marvels Hamlet. “How noble in reason! How infinite in faculty! … In action how like an angel!  In apprehension how like a god! … The paragon of animals!” Hamlet then ponders the paradox at the heart of humankind: what is this quintessence of dust? We are special, but we are also merely matter. We are animals, yet we behave like gods. Darwin riffed on Hamlet in 1871 in his second masterpiece, The Descent of Man, declaring that we have “god-like intellect”, yet we cannot deny that man – and woman – carries the “indelible stamp of his lowly origin”. This is the central question in understanding our place in the scheme of evolution.What makes us special, while we remain rooted in nature? We evolved from earlier creatures, each on a unique trajectory through time. We share DNA with all the organisms that have ever existed the proteins our genes encrypt utilise a code that is indistinguishable from that in an amoeba or a zebu.How did we become the beings that we are today? Scientists call this state “behavioural modernity”, or sometimes “the full package”, meaning all the things that we consider as part of the human condition: speech, language, consciousness, tool use, art, music, material culture, commerce, agriculture, non‑reproductive sex and more. Precisely when these facets of our lives today arose in our species is debated. But we do know that within the last 40,000 years, they were all in place, all over the world. Which facet singles us out, among other animals – which is distinctively human?Navigating this territory can be treacherous, and riven with contradictions. We know we are animals, evolved via the same mechanisms as all life. This is comprehensively displayed in the limitless evidence of shared evolutionary histories – the fact that all living things are encoded by DNA. Or that similar genes have similar functions in distantly related creatures (the gene that defines an eye is virtually the same in all organisms that have any form of vision). Or that our bodies harbour the indelible stamps of common descent in our bones (our hands contain bones almost perfectly like-for-like with the bones in the flat paddle of a dolphin’s fin, and with a horse’s front legs, and a bat’s wings).Prudent scepticism is required when we compare ourselves with other beasts. Evolution accounts for all life but not all traits are adaptations. We use animals in science every day to try to understand complex biochemical pathways in order that we might develop drugs or understand disease. Mice, rats, monkeys, even cats, newts and armadillos, provide invaluable insights into our own biochemistry, but even so, all researchers acknowledge the limitations of those molecular analogies we shared ancestors with those beasts millions of years ago, and our evolutionary trajectories have nudged that biochemistry to suit each species as it is today.Arguments around these issues are generally the preserve of scientists. But there is a set of behaviours that are also inspected forensically and with evolution in mind whose reach extends far beyond the academy. We are a species that devotes enormous resources, effort and time to touching each other’s genitals. Most animals are sexual beings and the primary function of sex is to reproduce. The statistician David Spiegelhalter estimates that up to 900,000,000 acts of human heterosexual intercourse take place per year in Britain alone – roughly 100,000 per hour. Around 770,000 babies are born in Britain each year, and if we include miscarriages and abortions, the number of conceptions rises to about 900,000 per year.Some – not all – of these seemingly familiar sexual practices can be explained readily. Male Cape ground squirrels are promiscuous, and masturbate after copulation, we think, for hygiene reasons, protecting themselves from sexually transmitted diseases by flushing their tubes. Other behaviour is still mysterious to us: giraffes spend most of their time sexually segregated, and the vast majority of sexual relations appear to be male-to-male penetration. As with the myriad examples of sexual behaviour between members of the same sex, it demonstrates that homosexuality – once, and in many places to this day, decried as a crime against nature – is widespread.Because sex and gender politics are so prominent in our lives, some look to evolution for answers to hard questions about the dynamics between men and women, and the social structures that cause us so much ire. Evolutionary psychologists strain to explain our behaviour today by speculating that it relates to an adaptation to Pleistocene life. Frequently these claims are absurd, such as “women wear blusher on their cheeks because it attracts men by reminding them of ripe fruit”.Purveyors of this kind of pseudoscience are plenty, and most prominent of the contemporary bunch is the clinical psychologist and guru Jordan Peterson, who in lectures asserts this “fact” about blusher and fruit with absolute certainty. Briefly, issues with that idea are pretty straightforward: most fruit is not red most skin tones are not white and crucially, the test for evolutionary success is increased reproductive success. Do we have the slightest blip of data that suggests that women who wear blusher have more children than those who don’t? No, we do not.Peterson is also well known for using the existence of patriarchal dominance hierarchies in a non-specific lobster species as supporting evidence for the natural existence of male hierarchies in humans. Why out of all creation choose the lobster? Because it fits with Peterson’s preconceived political narrative. Unfortunately, it’s a crazily poor choice, and woefully researched. Peterson asserts that, as with humans, lobsters have nervous systems that “run on serotonin” – a phrase that carries virtually no scientific meaning – and that as a result “it’s inevitable that there will be continuity in the way that animals and human beings organise their structures”. Lobsters do have serotonin-based reward systems in their nervous systems that in some way correlate with social hierarchies: higher levels of serotonin relate to increased aggression in males, which is part of establishing mate choice when, as Peterson says, “the most desirable females line up and vie for your attention”.Sexual selection is one of the driving forces of natural selection in most animals. In general, males compete with each other, and females subsequently have choice over which males they mate with. While this is one of the most studied areas of evolutionary biology, it’s incredibly hard to establish that rules that apply to lobsters (or does and stags, or peacocks and peahens) also apply to humans. There are physical and behavioural differences between men and women in relation to sex, but our cultural evolution has loosened the shackles of natural selection to the extent that we cannot satisfactorily match our behaviour with other beasts, and claims that we can are often poor science.Peterson believes that the system that is used by lobsters is why social hierarchies exist in humans. The problem with the assertion is this: serotonin is indeed a major part of the neural transmitter network in humans, but the effect of serotonin in relation to aggression is the opposite. Lower levels increase aggression, because it restricts communication between the frontal cortex and amygdala. Lobsters don’t have an amygdala or frontal lobes. Or brains for that matter. Most serotonin in humans is produced to aid digestion. And lobsters also urinate out of their faces. Trying to establish evolutionary precedents that justify or explain away our own behaviour is scientific folly.If you wanted to make a different but equally specious political argument with a waft of science about how to arrange our society, you could compare us to killer whales. They live in a matriarchal social group, in some cases led by post-menopausal females. Or hyenas, the animal with the greatest jaw strength of any, which are also matriarchal, and engage in clitoral licking, to bond socially and to establish hierarchy. Or the insect order hymenoptera, which includes ants, bees and wasps, and are roughly the same evolutionary distance from us as lobsters. Their social hierarchy involves a single queen and males, whose role is twofold: protecting the colony, and providing sperm on demand – they are literally sex slaves. Or the freshwater small invertebrates called bdelloid rotifers: millions of years ago they abandoned males altogether, and seem to be doing just fine.Yes, hierarchies assuredly exist in animals as competition is an inherent part of nature, and our sexual biology has common roots with all life on Earth. But we should not presume that understanding the biology of other animals will necessarily illuminate our own, as Peterson does. It’s a strange irony that someone who claims to bow to evolution should simultaneously fail to grasp its concepts. In some ways it’s a less cogent argument to an evolutionary biologist than that of creationists, who simply deny that evolution has happened. Then again, it was Darwin who said that “ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge”. Nowadays, you can buy “lobster dominance” T-shirts.We crave stories, and for those tales to deliver narrative satisfaction. We want dramatic triggers that bestow us with behaviours that are ours alone and therefore might be used to define humankind, and in doing so give us a sense of belonging or even purpose in the confusing modern world. We look to science and history to fulfil those cravings. But life is complex, culture is dynamic: evolution doesn’t work that way. Sometimes we talk about cultural evolution in opposition to biological evolution, the former being passed on socially, the latter being encoded in our DNA. But the truth is that they are intrinsically linked, and a better way to think about it is as gene-culture co-evolution. Each drives the other, and cultural transmission of ideas and skills requires a biologically encoded ability to do so. Biology enables culture, culture changes biology. What humans uniquely do is that we accumulate culture, and build on it. Many animals learn, but only we teach.As we meandered into the most recent 100,000 years or so, our culture became ever more significant in crafting our abilities. This is apparent in the fact that our bodies have not significantly changed in that time. A woman or man from 1,000 centuries ago would fit in perfectly well in any city in the world today if we tidied them up and gave them a haircut. But the way we live our lives since then has become ever more complex.We are desperate to find the things that tip us over the edge from being merely an animal into Hamlet’s paragon of animals. Was it our language? Was it religion, or music, or art, or any number of things that are not as unique to us as we had once thought? The truth is that it was all of these things and more, but crucially, it was in the engagement of our minds to transmit skills and ideas to others. We changed our societies and maximised how culture is transmitted. We took evolution’s work, and by teaching each other, we created ourselves. The stories we tell about how we came to be who we are often neglect the complexity of biology and the oceans of time during which we evolved. To understand human evolution, we need new stories.• The Book of Humans: The Story of How We Became Us by Adam Rutherford is published by W\u0026ampN (£18.99).

The Co-operative Bank and Cashplus have also had to apologise for online disruptions in recent days, while memories remain fresh of TSB’s huge IT meltdown earlier this year. Nicky Morgan has written to the RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, and his Barclays counterpart, Jes Staley, asking for answers about the causes and consequences of the failure. She said: “This is yet another addition to the litany of failures of banking IT systems.“It simply isn’t good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money. High street banks justify the closure of their branch networks on the basis that they are providing a seamless online and mobile phone banking service. These justifications carry little weight if their banking apps and websites cannot be relied upon.”Morgan also raised the issue of compensation for customers. In her letter to McEwan and Staley, she said: “What arrangements have you put in place to compensate customers who have lost out as a result of the failure? How in particular do you intend to deal with consequential loss claims from business customers?”Angry customers took to Twitter as the RBS failure emerged, with one saying: “NatWest app down again. Not really acceptable for our 24-economy! How can we trust you with our money?”An RBS spokesperson said: “We would like to apologise to customers who experienced issues logging into their online and mobile banking accounts this morning this issue has now been resolved.”The latest outage at RBS will raise painful memories of the worst-ever service failure by a British bank, when a software update in 2012 at RBS resulted in millions of customers being locked out of their accounts, some for up to a month."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12eb251722b0ec8957a8e2bb9012e45a48fe8f2b/0_104_4813_2889/master/4813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29032e1953bb4945cb6e14ff8ad747f3","title":"lets bring back the dignity of walking being on foot in your city","story":"From trudging through snow to navigating streets with a buggy,  readers share what it’s like to walk in their citiesWe were overwhelmed with nearly 300 responses to our callout for your experiences of walking in cities – thank you to everyone who got in touch. Here is an edited selection.Growing up in southern California in the 1970s, I learned to walk the city from an early age. It taught me many things, about the intimacy of shared experience, the points of the compass, discovering the weirdness in daily life – like the day I spotted a massive tortoise waddling majestically down the street, someone’s escaped pet. And it taught me the concept of Stranger Danger. “No, thank you,” my six-year-old self told the nice lady who wanted to give me a lift home. I can still tell you the license plate number of the dirty brown station wagon that curb-crawled me in third grade.I now live in Germany, where many cities are eminently walkableYet for the last 40 years, the number of parents driving their children has steadily increased, which is a sad trend. For all the benefits driving seems to offer, parents should realise what they are depriving their children of when they don’t let them walk the city. Ursula Schoenberg, Frankfurt, GermanyThe arches of the ruined San Francisco monastery, in the old quarter of Santo Domingo, loom in the sky like Jurassic limbs as you follow the street towards the Caribbean Sea. Colourful clothes hang from iron balustrades to dry, people sweep their porches and talk to their neighbours from an assembling of turquoise, vermilion and grapefruit-yellow wooden dwellings. Rapt by this bucolic scenery, I was almost hit by a car driven in the typical Dominican manner: without any regard for pedestrians.People love to see you walking in Santo Domingo – they say “saludos” (greetings) and smile – but will shout at you if you take too long to cross the street. Carlos Guillen, Santo Domingo, Dominican RepublicMy city of Szczecin is not pedestrian-friendly. However, I enjoy my 20-minute workday walk to the bus station. Some people will make a face and ask how it is possible that such a dull walk could be my favourite. But I notice things that I couldn’t from the interior of a car. The pedestrian’s world is not perfect: you will have to brave the uneven pavements catcalling, if you are a woman beggars. It is not always comfortable to hear and experience that day-to-day drama, but we should not hide from it, like many politicians do. Maciej G, Szczecin, PolandI have lived in Southeast Asia for much of the past seven years and Bangkok has become one of my favourite places to walk. It gets a bad reputation in the English-language travel and literary world. It’s exoticised through descriptions of gleaming Buddhist temples, always-smiling locals and delicious food. More often, there are complaints of harassment by men selling sex, drugs and tuk-tuk rides in steamy, crowded streets with impossible traffic. Sure, that happens on a few streets in Bangkok. But saying you can’t walk around without being propositioned is like saying you can’t go to New York City without being hounded by costumed characters based on a walk through Times Square. There is so much more to dynamic, creative Bangkok than the industries catering to the demands of mostly Western men. Aileen Thomson, Bangkok, ThailandUp and down and definitely up again. You quickly understand the meaning of seven colinas (hills), the phrase printed on transport cards in Lisbon. There is no escaping them. On the upside, the views you get as part of your trip to the supermarket, or with your pastel de nata. The other is the delicious reminder of “I’m fit!” when visitors complain of their aching calves. The downsides are literal. The light-reflecting cobbles, slippery when wet or dry, are responsible for one of the highest rates of podiatry problems in Europe. On the steeper inclines it can be preferable to walk in the road. The epidemic of parking wherever the hell you like can also push you into the flow of oncoming traffic. Joanne Stilges, Lisbon, PortugalWalking has always been my primary mode of transportation. I have a healthy fear of driving and prefer my own legs to a bicycle. Growing up in Onehunga, Auckland, I explored factories, graveyards and the more scenic parks. I did not get my driver’s licence until I moved to the sprawling city of Canberra to study. There I looked forward to moving to Berlin for my postdoc, where I wouldn’t have insults – or bottles – thrown at me from cars. Berlin was indeed a dream for walking, though I soon learnt that heels do not work on cobblestones. Walk, S-bahn, walk, U-bahn, walk, there. Walk to the Saturday markets, walk to meet friends, walk home at 5am, a trifle unsteady.My husband is a walker, too. When we had our daughter, I walked everywhere with her, in the carrier or later the buggy. When we moved back to New Zealand, we rented a house halfway up a killer hill in Island Bay in Wellington. Playcentre mothers would comment of our three-year-old: “She walks all that way?” Yes, she could on a good day, because that was how we got around. Now we live in flatter Upper Hutt and I walk everywhere, though kindly neighbours always ask if I’d like a lift. I walk to enjoy the day, to marvel at the trees and hills, for exercise. I walk because it is as natural as breathing and it makes me feel good. Mary Hayek-Williams, Wellington, New ZealandI decided not to drive when I was 16. The first Earth Day had just happened and they said driving was causing this new thing called “pollution” and if we didn’t stop the petroleum culture we would all be choking to death in 50 years. I am now 65, and I walk everywhere all the time. I love walking the half-mile from my house to the public transit station because I can greet my neighbours and see what people are doing to their houses or growing in their gardens, and say hello to the dogs and cats and kids along the way. Not driving has caused me quite a bit of inconvenience, but it has kept me from getting fat. It stopped me doing too much each day and thus slowed the pace of life. It made me resourceful about getting places in other ways. It allowed me to make friends while travelling on public transit. In a car I can’t see anything or talk to anyone and the driver is usually mad and yelling at the pedestrians and other cars. How is that a better life? Mary Kay Ryan, Oak Park, IllinoisMy favourite place to walk in Quezon City is inside the University of the Philippines. The reason is simple: it’s the only place where there are sidewalks. There are small blocks, shade provided by trees, human-scale buildings and other pedestrians. I get to feel the city, to experience its problems and qualities in a deeper way. The city was made for cars, and the few sidewalks that do exist are taken by street vendors and a jeepney ride is so cheap that people go for it, regardless of the length of the trip. The biggest challenge to walking here is the culture. As I heard once: “let’s bring back the dignity of walking”. Anna Clara Marçall, Quezon City, The PhilippinesI am very fortunate that I can walk and do not require a wheelchair however, my disabilities cause me severe pain if I walk long distances. There are millions like me who fall into the zone between able-bodied and wheelchair confined. When I hear the term “pedestrian friendly”, my first thought is “disability unfriendly”. There is a new outdoor mall near me with a pedestrian-friendly town centre design. It is a sprawling, lively place, but I can’t shop there. Walking needs to be encouraged in a way that does not forget about the needs of the disabled. Pamela L Clements, Jacksonville, IllinoisI moved to Portland 23 years ago to attend the art college. Now, living in North Portland, I come downtown about once a month to buy supplies, meet my wife at work, visit friends and check in at my gallery. For those of us spread across the city’s five quadrants, downtown remains an easy meeting point. We also go downtown for protests and parades. Protests and parades put our bodies in control of asphalt usually held hostage by cars, and – whether permitted or not – it feels like the city belongs to us again. Almost all marches cross Burnside Ave, sometimes taking over its Bridge, sometimes cutting back and forth between NW and SW downtown. Each street corner triggers recall, some of past protests I’ve experienced, others – like the 1991 protests against Bush Sr. – that have been related to me by folks who were there. This picture (above) is from pencil notes of the 2017 inauguration rally, which was hit hard by the Portland police. I’m a marcher, not a face-the-grenade-activist I left early for the train, watching police trucks begin their flanking motion through the side streets. Gabriel Liston, Portland, OregonWalks don’t come any nicer in Sydney than at Mrs Macquarie’s Chair, on a peninsula in the harbour to Darling Harbour. Passing through the botanical gardens, the old Rocks precinct and arriving at the pedestrianised Piermont bridge, the route has history, culture and meaning. Most notable, however, is the absence of cars along most of the way. The lack of noise pollution makes one aware of all the sounds that would be more easily heard if it not for the constant burning rubber and churning of engines on Sydney’s roadways. Dominic, Sydney, AustraliaI’ve been living in Edinburgh for over 15 years. The Scottish winter can dishearten the most dedicated of walkers, but on a summer evening I’ll finish work early, jump on the tram then the bus, get home, change and set off straight away for an hour of wandering and evening dreaming. What better and cheaper way than walking to sort my thoughts and keep fit? The families, joggers and dog walkers in Braidburn Valley Park help me shake off the stress and insincerity of my corporate job. I’ll then head towards Hermitage Drive – where I might resent the obvious wealth if I weren’t so chilled out. By the time I make my way to the Blackford Hill and pond, it’s all about nature, fresh air and the massive bag of blackberries I’ll take as my bounty. Marisa Conde, Edinburgh, ScotlandIn 30 years, I have walked a total 64,200km, which is one-and-a-half times the circumference of Earth. Sixteen months ago I set a target to walk a cumulative distance equal to the length of India, from the north tip to the south. I walk through the city of Pune daily on my way to my office, and follow this practice in cities that I visit all over the world. There was a time when it used to feel very conventional to walk to school, college or work. However, back then most walkers were driven by poverty or the pathetic public transportation system. In one job I used to walk 9km (5.6 miles) to work. I was given a memo stating that my walking did not present the organisation in a good light. I had a hard time explaining my passion. But today it is linked to fitness, with many companies providing incentives for walking to work. Jitendra Date, Pune, IndiaEvery morning I wake, groan, pull on my shorts, brush my teeth, and put on my walking shoes. I walk my neighbourhood, Melville, along wide roads lined with beautiful trees and exquisite flowers. The skies are always pretty, too. I greet the paper recyclers pushing their extraordinarily heavy loads, the broom vendors hoping for their first sale of the day, the car guards. Sometimes I tell the guy who sells drugs on my corner to take a hike. And I always cross the road to say hello to the dogs. On 7th Street, the restaurants are usually just setting up. I walk past the window cleaners and the street sweepers, the waiters and the masseurs, the old man who asks if I can “spare some change?” My barista sees me coming and says, “Good morning, Sandra. Flat white?” I drink a lot of coffee, and I always walk to pick it up.Walking clears my head, gets me into a routine, gives me a sense of community. I love it. I love my ’hood. And I love that, at 56, my legs are still good. Sandra Caganoff, Johannesburg, South AfricaThe trick to walking in Tokyo is never to make eye contact. Two million people use Shinjuku station every day, and the pavements, walkways, subways, malls and passages that feed it are teeming. You don’t look directly into the faces of folk coming your way, and that lack of eye contact signals that you aren’t going to swerve. But they’re not looking at you either, so each party is minutely altering their trajectory with every step. This delicate balance is easily upset. First-timers, gaijin (outsiders), or the rare ruralist who make the mistake of looking indicate to oncoming traffic that they will swerve. Mutual eye contact can be disastrous as you both alter course in the same direction, at the same time. You might offer a whispered, heartfelt “Ah! Sumimasen!” (sorry), but it is too little, too late – you’ve lost face, and they’ve moved on. Rachel Evans, Tokyo, JapanI’m gradually losing my vision, and there came a day eight years ago when it felt irresponsible to drive. I took my car key off its ring and dropped it in a kitchen drawer. I’ve been a pedestrian ever since. In my suburb of Richmond, walking is exercise – an optional activity. My neighborhood even has a walking club, a group who walk up and down our cul-de-sac streets. But when they have an errand to accomplish, they use a car. Well, of course they do. Sidewalks are laid here and there and may not connect, making my routes something of an expedition. Sometimes snow removed from the roads is deposited on them in mounds. I know where the uneven sidewalks are, the roads with the well-worn footpath where a sidewalk should be, which streets have no crosswalks. I’ve learned to love the walks anyway. The pace is predictably, inescapably human.Last winter I found a new route – out my back gate, through the woods and down the greenbelt buffering homes from the shops. In the snow these walks are bliss, silent except for the squeak of the powder under my boots. The snow is brilliant at midday and in the dusk it turns almost blue, as though lit from within. Sometimes in the course of chatting with a neighbour, the fact I don’t drive comes up. The most predictable responses are the wistful sighs. “That sounds so nice,” they say. Yeah, it is. Elizabeth Clark, Richmond, VirginiaRiyadh is not a pedestrian-friendly city – when I began walking here drivers would often stop to ask me if I was lost and needed a lift. While there are elegant boulevards which would not look out of place in Spain or France, what draws me is the dusty scrubland at the city’s fringes. To get there you walk past the fast food joints, coffee franchises and supermarkets, the gyms filled with lycra-clad men on treadmills staring at their phones, and rush from lane to lane across the motorway, dodging speeding SUVs (their drivers also staring at their phones). After all that, it is reassuring to come across the robed tribesmen arguing over the price of the sheep milling all around as they have done for millennia. Ray Mac Uait, Riyadh, Saudi ArabiaAs a resident of New York and now London, I’m no stranger to walking city streets. But the miles logged were taken to another level when I had my son and began my year-long maternity leave. What could have ben an incredibly isolating period was filled with rich exploration as I put my son in a pram and went walking to keep from going mad from too much time at home. It was good for us both – exposing him to the sights, sounds and smells of a rich street culture, and making me feel part of the human world. Inevitably he would fall asleep and I’d keep walking, listening to podcasts and strolling through the quiet back streets of Soho or Shoreditch like they were old friends.Exploring a city with a baby makes you aware of things you never had to consider before: how wide are the sidewalks? (No to Soho.) Are there baby-changing toilets along the way? (Bermondsey is impossible.) Are the coffeeshops big enough to fit a buggy? (Don’t even try the City.) One of our go-to routes is the 45-minute walk from our flat next to Burgess Park to reach Borough Market just before it opens – a truly magical moment that very few Londoners experience. This is when I feel most at home.

The most important lesson of the Brexit negotiation is that it is not a negotiation, and never has been. Blessed with superior size, wealth and power, the EU has been able to dictate the framework and substance of the talks, and has refused any deviation from its red lines.The second most important lesson of the Brexit negotiation is that the EU will prioritise its economic and political cohesion above all else. That cohesion rests on two key outcomes: an unided single market and an open border on the island of Ireland.It is these principles that have led us to Salzburg. The EU will not accept the Chequers plan, which proposes a single market in goods but not in services, capital or people. It will also not accept any possibility of border infrastructure in Ireland, which is anathema to Dublin and, according to the Police Service of Northern Ireland, presents a credible risk of sectarian violence. That has duly paved the way for the Brexit endgame, which EU negotiator Michel Barnier has now confirmed: there will be a border for goods in the Irish Sea.The EU does not, however, want to antagonise or humiliate the UK, and has scrambled to defuse the drama of this development. Barnier stresses that most checks between Britain and Northern Ireland will take place in offices and warehouses, and only live animals and food products will need to be examined at ports themselves. But no amount of diplomatic politesse can conceal Brexit’s reality: one part of the UK will be economically split from another.Theresa May effectively guaranteed this impasse last December, when she agreed the Irish backstop. The backstop guarantees, as a last resort, Northern Ireland’s alignment with Ireland on the customs union and single market to ensure the free flow of goods. Northern Ireland would be permitted to retain the single market just in goods because the Good Friday agreement depends on it. But no such exemptions would ever be open to the rest of the UK. Although the EU was too coy to admit it at the time, this always meant that the whole UK would have to commit to the prospect of staying in the full single market and customs union, or else concede the erection of trade barriers within its territory.If May had been armed with political judgment, or merely cognisant of reality, she would have prepared the British people – and government – for that concession. She has instead wasted nine months denying she ever made it. It comes as little surprise that the EU has now taken the initiative where the UK refused.The prime minister has boxed herself in with promises she cannot keep. She insists on the ability to strike UK-only trade deals and end free movement of people, while refusing to accept its consequences. In Salzburg she announced “the idea that I should assent to the legal separation of the United Kingdom into two customs territories is not credible”, but failed to acknowledge the lack of credibility in any other option. She resembles a desperate fugitive who urgently needs to escape a building but instead keeps inexplicably locking herself inside it.The most problematic consequence of the EU’s proposals is one that Brussels is most loath to spell out. This is not simply about checking goods. If Northern Ireland permanently operates a different customs regime from the rest of the UK and implements EU tariffs, then Northern Ireland must be exempt from any future UK trade deals. But it is almost inconceivable that the DUP – let alone the UK parliament – would ever agree to such a scenario. The DUP leader in the Commons, Nigel Dodds, has referred even to the checking of goods as “separating Northern Ireland from Great Britain”.Noisiest in their opposition are Tory Brexiters, not least David Davis and Boris Johnson, both of whom quit the cabinet in protest. They argue that the promise to maintain a common rulebook for goods and other continued alignment will mean a post-Brexit UK is tied to the EU without having a say on future rules, rather than being a free-trading independent nation.Labour has also disparaged the proposal, expressing deep scepticism about the so-called facilitated customs arrangement system.Brussels has sought to stay positive, but has deep concerns about elements of the plan viewed as overly pick-and-mix, and thus potentially incompatible with EU principles.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, says he opposes both the customs plan and the idea of alignment for goods. He also makes plain his contention that the Chequers plan contains no workable idea for the Ireland-Northern Ireland border.But at the same time the EU has been careful to not entirely dismiss the proposals, raising the possibility it could accept some adapted version.Officially, May and her cabinet, though even here the backing can seem lukewarm at times. Asked about Chequers, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, said it was the government’s plan “right now”, indicating alternative ideas could be considered.Even May’s allies concede it will be a hugely difficult task to get the plan through parliament. Damian Green, the PM’s close friend and former de fact deputy, described the process as “walking a narrow path with people chucking rocks at us from both sides”.On the remain side of the Conservatives, the former education secretary Justine Greening called the Chequers plan “more unpopular than the poll tax”, saying May should start again from scratch.If anything can save the plan – and it’s an outside shot – it will be a combination of the hugely tight timetable and the fact that, as yet, no one else has yet produced a plan with a better chance of being accepted by parliament.On 20 September, an informal gathering in Salzburg, Austria, will provide a snapshot of current EU thinking. Then, 10 days later, the Conservative conference could show the Chequers plan is holed below the waterline.If it survives these tests, the proposals will then reach the crucial EU summit Brussels on 18 October, with something final needed, at the very latest, in the next two months. PETER WALKERMay consequently has two tasks. First, she must determine whether her government would survive opposition to an effective border in the Irish Sea from the DUP and Commons. But more important, she must decide whether she values the economic integrity of the UK more than the ability to unilaterally change Britain’s tariffs and end migration rights for Polish plumbers.The EU, for its part, knows it holds all the cards and recognises the danger of giving ground. Its priority is to accommodate Dublin, not London. It also concludes that a government so determined to leave must believe it can look after itself. Brussels has no reason or incentive to make any better offer.The government has never understood the Brexit process and therefore has always botched it. It expects the EU to treat the UK both as an equally powerful third country, and as a member state still deserving the EU’s protection. It is neither. And so in a battle of red lines, the UK will lose. That is the most brutal lesson of all.• Jonathan Lis is deputy director of the thinktank British Influence"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87e74e3130293264e9dc49f54d5e27301ac41f06/0_0_4537_2724/master/4537.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=188628b0b48c85af41c291785c19a278","title":"european language brexit britain","story":"For someone who occasionally seems unsure whether their wife is Japanese or Chinese, Jeremy Hunt seems to speak pretty good Japanese.Unless bits of it were Chinese, obviously. Given the way things have gone lately for Theresa May’s government we probably shouldn’t rule anything out, but let’s just assume the Tokyo audience he addressed in their native tongue this week wasn’t just being polite and that he did actually deliver the whole speech in the correct language.Lately there has been some tinkering with grade boundaries to encourage uptake. But while mathematicians and scientists have gone to great lengths to popularise subjects once seen as geeky or intimidatingly difficult, there has been no concerted push behind French or Spanish.And if we’re honest, Britain’s solid international reputation for being rubbish at languages isn’t just down to the kids. How many of us slogged through years of irregular verbs and asking the way to the station, only to be reduced in middle age to fumbled holiday conversations in shops and frantic pointing?But watching Hunt reminded me of something I’ve been wondering for a while, which is whether the prospect of leaving Europe will finally make learning a language feel less like a slog and more like a thrillingly subversive act one great defiant two fingers to everything Brexit Britain stands for.Languages are lovely things to learn in their own right, of course, if you’re so minded living, breathing entities that weave in and out of each other, exchanging sounds and words and ideas. But they’re also one of the purest forms of soft power. Speaking to someone in their own tongue is a disarming act, a gesture of empathy and respect. If you’re not actually very good at it then in some ways all the better at least it’s obvious you’re making an effort, which is why typing furiously into Google Translate doesn’t quite have the same effect.Eventually, once they’re good enough to stop occasionally churning out scrambled garbage, robot translators will presumably put human translators out of business. But they’ll still struggle to convey what a human switching between languages does, which is a fundamental willingness to put oneself out in order to put someone else at ease. Speaking foreign languages is about meeting people halfway, building bridges and accepting differences – all skills sorely in need of some practice, judging by the current tone of public\u0026nbspconversation.But above all, languages open so many doors to understanding. There are few better ways of grasping why so many British negotiating gambits flop in Brussels than reading a German newspaper’s take on them. (I still have fond memories of sneaking into French government briefings at EU summits, the gist of which was usually that the French had conclusively won all the arguments, to compare them with the Downing Street version in which oddly enough it was generally the British who had triumphed.)And even to understand the construction of a language can shed light on a different way of thinking. What seems like basic politeness in English sounds almost weirdly apologetic if translated directly into anything from Spanish to Hebrew, while people translating directly the other way can sound rude, abrupt or stilted to English ears even when that’s not remotely the intention. A basic knowledge of how someone’s first language works goes a long way to avoiding small, grating cultural misunderstandings when they’re using their second.It’s true that English remains the lingua franca of big tourist resorts and business conferences. But the trouble with grandly relying on everyone else to speak your language is that it can make you oddly vulnerable. What stubborn monoglots often don’t realise is that they will only ever hear as much as the people around them want them to hear that private conversations and whispered asides will remain a closed book. If you really want to take back control, then learn a language, and with it the small covert thrill of eavesdropping on conversations that people don’t realise you can understand.But it’s Brexit that could turn an abstract intellectual pleasure into a small private act of defiance, both for grieving remainers and for those liberal leavers who actually meant what they said about leaving the EU but not leaving Europe. For those who can’t bear to see Britain defined by belligerent isolationism, who don’t want the rest of the world to think that this is who we are, then one tiny but practical way of showing it is brushing up on a European language and making a determined effort to use it. Cold comfort, obviously, for those who would rather Britain never left at all. But if the great rupture is coming, then we still have a choice over how culturally isolated we become. The least we can do is keep talking."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7ef739b6774f195bdc7c95af7a56bebba7762c9/6_0_1167_700/master/1167.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e50fafbffb2551208a157aa0e904d67b","title":"peoples vote brexit remain theresa may salzburg statement","story":"The hills were alive with the sound of humiliation. At Salzburg, Theresa May was hoping she’d hear if not sweet music, then at least enough warm words from European leaders to allow her to say her Chequers plan still lived. Instead, they told her it “would not work”. Stung by that, she took to the Downing Street podium on Friday to deliver an icy death stare in Brussels’ direction – and to demand that the EU treat Britain, and her, with “respect”. There was even a hint that talks could break down, if the EU did not explain its objections and come up with counter-proposals.We are, then, approaching that point every negotiator most fears: when one side’s maximum falls irretrievably short of the other’s minimum. Lacking a Commons majority, constrained by her dependence on the Democratic Unionists and the veto-power of the Moggites, there is only so far May can go – and that is not far enough for Donald Tusk and the EU27. Chequers would have Britain sharing a common rulebook with the EU on goods, but not services. That’s simultaneously too Europhile for the Moggites and unacceptable to the EU, because it means cherrypicking the best bits of the single market. (The idea that this objection requires explanation, as May claimed in her monologue of cold fury, is absurd on its face: the EU has literally spent years explaining that the four freedoms are inisible, that no member state can just pick and choose the one or two that suit them.) And all this before you even get to the impossible geometry of the Irish border question, where every permutation is unacceptable to someone.The usual pattern with Euro-stalemates is for gridlock to endure until the 59th minute of the 11th hour, when the leaders finally emerge from an all-night summit clutching a bleary-eyed compromise. But that is becoming increasingly hard to imagine. Britain is asking for something that might just be impossible – which means the prospect of a no-deal Brexit is growing. Tellingly, May repeated her line that “No deal is better than a bad deal”.That encourages the hardcore Brexiteers, obviously, but it gives some cheer to the hardcore anti-Brexiteers too. Their demand for a people’s vote rests on several premises that are looking ever more robust, buttressed by signs that we’re about to crash out. One is that the politicians have failed to deliver Brexit and it’s time for the people to take back control. Another is that a core promise of the leavers was that Brexit would entail a smooth departure: they needed us more than we needed them, they wanted to sell us their BMWs and prosecco, a Brexit trade deal would be the “easiest in human history”. Now it’s clear that all that amounted to a false prospectus, the people deserve to have another say.For the avoidance of doubt: I buy these arguments, along with the rest of the case for a people’s vote. I agree that 2016 merely settled the principle of Brexit, not what it would mean in practice. I agree that if every trade union is required, under Conservative-passed employment law, to ballot its members first on strike action and then again on the final, negotiated deal, then the nation should at least have the same right on a matter of such gravity. I agree that departure from the EU requires “continuing consent”, that democracy should never shackle a nation to one decision, taken one time. I accept all that, but I have worries about a people’s vote all the same. Put my pessimism down to the dizzying events of the last two years, which have taught me to prepare for the worst.Which gets to the heart of my angst. Let’s say the drive for another vote is successful. What would be on the ballot? What if it’s Justine Greening’s call for a three-way choice between whatever deal is patched together, no deal and remain: how confident could we be that remain would win that? It is at least possible that no deal would be a lot of voters’ second preference and emerge the winner.This week’s admirably clear report, The Roadmap to a People’s Vote by the former mandarin and article 50 author John Kerr, seeks to reassure nailbiters like me by saying that any choice is likely to be binary. Could that be a Noel Edmonds referendum, offering the public a straight choice: the deal or no deal? No, insists Kerr: it would be “deeply undemocratic” to exclude the option of staying in the EU when that option commands such strong public support. I lack his confidence: undemocratic it might be, but I can still see it happening. I can imagine the arguments, as leavers insist that the question of whether to leave was settled in 2016: now all that remains to be decided is how.But let’s say my fears are misplaced and that the eventual choice is a straight fight between no deal and remain. Again, I’d be nervous. Given the populist currents swirling in this country and beyond, given the appeal of a Brexit message that would say “What part of leave did you not understand?”, I can see no deal winning that one too – gaining legitimacy for what would be an act of national self-mutilation.None of these is an argument not to go ahead with a people’s vote. Without one, this journey could well end in disaster anyway. A referendum is our best shot at averting calamity. My warning is against seeing it as the magic wand that will wave all our troubles away. A people’s vote won’t be the end of the war against Brexit – it will be the start of the biggest battle of all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2324170e9ea60f30f8c0cb54ee32718d67090cad/0_36_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=768bc0eb360dee42b509b7cd1c496918","title":"tesco jacks little englandism cornish camembert jacks","story":"The new Tesco chain prides itself on its British products – but it’s really selling the myth of post-Brexit self-sufficiencyJack’s dependence on Europe goes deeper than its shelf-stackers. Jacob Kohen was born in Whitechapel in 1898 to Polish Jewish parents, Sime Zaremba and Avroam Kohen, a tailor from Łódź. The young Jacob spurned his father’s vocation to become a grocer. His fruit and veg stall soon became a dozen, then a wholesale business, then a shop. Years later, at the bank manager’s suggestion (his staff had trouble telling apart the many Jacob Kohens at the Mare Street branch), Jacob rechristened himself John Edward Cohen – Jack, for short.Now, almost a century after the son of Polish immigrants set up shop on an East End street corner, Tesco is attempting to one-up its continental competitors by vaunting its Britishness, using its founder’s “very British name” as proof. Yet these British credentials are as manufactured now as they were then. Jack’s, in this sense, is not a supermarket at all but rather a parable of Brexit Britain, an impossible dream of a nation sustained by its own wilful ignorance and nostalgic self-regard.

Its place on this week’s Man Booker shortlist is testament that long books are fine by the judges. It’s the long-winded ones they rejected: “We occasionally felt that inside the book we read was a better one – sometimes a thinner one – wildly signalling to be let out,” said Kwame Anthony Appiah, their chairman.Most readers can empathise, and may feel that the word “occasionally” was tactful. One book survey found that the average number of pages had increased from 320 to 400 pages between 1999 and 2014. Some think that the shift to digital formats has contributed, not least in removing the fear of being crushed beneath your duvet by your bedtime reading. Val McDermid, another of the judges, cited the inexperience of editors commercial pressures which deny them the time they need to spend on books and the unwillingness of writers to listen. The phenomenon of “book inflation” over careers has been noted: the last part of Karl Ove Knausgård’s My Struggle runs to almost 1,200 pages, and Paul Auster’s most recent novel 4321 is almost as long as his previous three books put together. The approving may credit increased boldness and mastery of material. The unimpressed blame growing authorial egos.Writers are not the only ones reluctant to kill their darlings. Director’s cuts tend to expand rather than contract movies. Viewers of Apocalypse Now Redux – 49 minutes longer than the lengthy original – can testify that there’s sometimes good reason for studios to interfere with a creative vision. Yet executives too can overrate the long and sprawling. One culprit can be the misguided sense that volume equals value for money. Another is the odd association between physical heft and artistic or intellectual merit – “weighty” is a compliment, “slight” is an insult. One film critic says that studios fear shorter movies will not be deemed worthy of Oscars. The very term the Great American Novel suggests a certain size, though that was not the original intent.That may be partly the legacy of doorstop classics: Moby Dick, Middlemarch, and Crime and Punishment. (It’s not a purely western phenomenon: China’s beloved The Story of the Stone runs to 120 chapters). Ulysses needs all of its 700-plus pages to capture a single day, while War and Peace, at over 1,200, ranges over 15 years, five families, domestic drama and grand historical events. Readers gallop through Elena Ferrante’s Neapolitan quartet (regarded by its author as a single novel) while short books don’t always keep their readers A Brief History of Time, despite living up to its titular promise, was bought much more than read. But Persuasion, one of Jane Austen’s shorter novels, is arguably her best. Virginia Woolf’s groundbreaking Mrs Dalloway is not much over 200 pages. Rather a single Bashō haiku than the 1,150-plus pages of James Clavell’s Shogun. The long and short of it is that authors must earn their length."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/076b2624f61ef7cf89a2f7d787cf8f59938ca558/0_15_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba2c6063fa36ad1206ec74bd9071a58d","title":"the guardian view on theresa mays brexit panic dressed up as statecraft","story":"There were ways in which the brutal dilemmas of Brexit could have been better navigated, but no government could have avoided them altogetherTheresa May’s humiliating rebuff by European Union leaders in Austria this week has many proximate causes and one common root: Brexit threatens the stability and integrity of the EU, while downgrading the UK’s diplomatic and economic standing in the world. No British prime minister taking on such a project can expect help from continental counterparts. Nor can they anticipate gratitude for their actions at home as the painful consequences emerge. Mrs May today tried to regain the initiative with a Downing Street statement. She reaffirmed familiar opinions. She rejected off-the-shelf models of association with the EU, the Norwegian and Canadian templates, on the grounds that the former retains too much Brussels jurisdiction, while the latter requires too tangible a border in Northern Ireland. She restated opposition to a second referendum, and trumpeted Britain’s readiness to embark on Brexit next year without any deal. To underline that point, she offered reassurance to EU citizens resident in the UK that their existing rights will be respected. For that to even need saying is testimony to the way ministers have allowed this process to be shrouded in confusion that in turn stokes alarm. This was panic dressed up as statecraft.Meanwhile, the broader terms of the UK’s position recall the prime minister’s most notorious accidental catchphrase: “Nothing has changed.” Only now the tone is more defiant and, as a result, the temperature has risen. Mrs May is doubling down on her Chequers blueprint, and calculating that the EU side, perhaps regretting the Salzburg snub, will be more accommodating. That is not impossible. Work in Brussels was already moving slowly but not unproductively towards compromise behind the scenes. But Mrs May’s fundamental problem is located in domestic politics, not in Brussels, and cannot be dismissed with angry glares at the camera. It is this: all models of Brexit sit on a spectrum between wanton national self-harm and damage limitation. There is no painless path that might allow a government to fulfil the referendum mandate without severe cost. The moribund Chequers plan is no exception. Another prime minister might have navigated the brutal dilemmas of Brexit better, but no government could have avoided them altogether. A test for all parties during the present conference season is how honestly that fact can be addressed. For Labour the challenge is to evolve its Brexit position beyond tactical calibrations.There have been compelling reasons for caution. There is a tension between a broadly pro-European membership and leave voters in constituencies that Labour wants to win. It is also normal for opposition parties to see events through the lens of electoral advantage and to see a general election as the best mechanism for dealing with bad government. Understandably, that remains the preference of the Labour leadership. But Brexit has reached a critical stage that demands a response in terms of immediate national interest, not just party preference. Labour activists recognise that imperative and have rightly been organising to make sure the party has a full and open debate on the subject at its conference – including the question of whether another referendum might be necessary to avert catastrophe.That is the right conversation for Labour to be having. The chances of that happening at the Conservative conference in Birmingham the following week are slim. Mrs May’s statement confirmed that she has no back-up plans and no reserves of diplomatic capability. It was a performance intended to show strength that only proved her weakness. And that sets the tone for the Tory conference. There will be much Eurosceptic bombast and precious little engagement with substantive, viable routes out the impasse to which Mrs May’s leadership has brought the country. It is dangerous to be so far along the Brexit process without a plan that takes into account fundamental dilemmas arising from the economic and strategic realities of our former relationship with the EU. But no less alarming is the apparent reluctance or inability of a whole generation of political leaders to express those dilemmas honestly to the country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02922f4f1970daaf6238d8e3335b6429766c39a8/0_71_2121_1273/master/2121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e455374342b9439af875a2bed32603f","title":"eight of the best coastal walks in wales","story":"Whether you fancy a stroll with fabulous sea views or a long-distance hike past a medieval castle, you’ll find it all on the coast of WalesThe Welsh coastline has been described as one of the best places on Earth to visit, and it’s not hard to see why. From rugged clifftop peaks to sprawling, serene beaches puffins to porpoises ­– natural beauty of incredible variety and scale is everywhere. Wales is the only country in the world that boasts a walking trail ning its entire coastline. The really dedicated can tackle the whole 870 miles. You can even run it – the current record is 23 days.For those more inclined towards a gentle hike or a relaxed amble, taking in glorious sunsets from castles or viaducts, here are eight of the best coastal walks.Aberaeron to New Quay (6.5 miles)New Quay claims to be the inspiration for Llareggub, the fictional seaside village at the centre of Dylan Thomas’s masterpiece Under Milk Wood – and it is worth a visit alone so that you can make your own mind up. This easy trek between two of the loveliest fishing towns in Wales takes you through forests, waterfalls and fern, finishing at glorious Traeth Gwyn beach in New Quay. Make sure to plan your timing with the tide in mind so you get the full experience, and have time for a swim in fine weather. The Hotel Penwig boasts a seafront location and is ideal for an overnight stay or just a drink to toast a fine walk.St Govan’s chapel, Pembrokeshire, to Stackpole Quay (5.5 miles)Expect medium intensity here, mainly because of the steep steps that take you down to the mystical St Govan’s chapel, the real draw of this lovely walk. St Govan’s origins are debated, including the suggestion that he was Gawain, the legendary knight. Another story has him as an Irish Christian missionary who took shelter from pirates in these rocks and then created his monastic chapel in thanks to God for his survival. The remarkable stone structure has been as weathered by the sea as the rocks around it, but it remains in good shape. Look out for the bird life – chocolate brown guillemots and black razorbills come in the summer to breed on the cliffs. For a different wildlife experience, the walk also takes in Bosherston Lily Ponds, where house martins and swallows skim over the lily-covered fresh water. Also nearby is the beautiful Barafundle Bay – with its clear waters and expanse of golden sands, it is the closest Britain gets to the Caribbean.This short and slightly steep walk is well worth it. One of the best views in Wales awaits you, only a small, well-signposted distance from the town of Barmouth, which was a favourite of the poet William Wordsworth. At the summit, you’ll have a view of the dramatic upland landscape of Cadair Idris, as well as the Mawddach Estuary, but be sure to make time for the spectacular wooden Barmouth Bridge. It is just over 150 years old and, at 699 metres long, it is Britain’s longest wooden railway bridge. You can walk or cycle over the bridge for free.Mumbles to Three Cliffs Bay (12.5 miles)This is a long walk made easy thanks to the well-maintained path. Three Cliffs Bay is a perfect example of the particular charms of the Welsh coastline – the wildness, the feeling of being outside of time, the awe-inspiring peace. This walk is the perfect summer outing, and the bay provides a picturesque picnic location that would be hard to beat. The Gower Coast Path has many highlights, and this scenic walk is one of the most breathtaking.Holyhead to Trearddur Bay (12 miles)You are spoiled for idyllic walks in Anglesey and this stretch offers a perfect mix of cliff-hiking and open coastal views. You begin in the impressive Holyhead Breakwater country park, built on the site of an old quarry. Regular exhibitions and displays offer information about the local wildlife – which include falcons and peregrines – to any accompanying little ones, and a friendly cafe with local suppliers will set you up for the day. The entire Anglesey coastline is designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and this walk has some of the most breathtaking views. Visit South Stack lighthouse to watch the breeding seabirds on the cliffs and experience the full drama of wind and sea. You can also get guided tours of the lighthouse. Once you’ve arrived at your destination, a stay at the seafront Trearddur Bay hotel is highly recommended.The Glamorgan Heritage Coast is so-called because it’s been recognised as an area of notable natural beauty or scientific significance, and walking it you can see exactly why. It’s as much a treat for amateur geologists as it is for keen walkers. You’ll pass by Dunraven Castle, and although it hasn’t survived intact, it makes for a striking and almost magical scene. If you decide to do the full walk, make sure you’re aware of the tides as they can take you by surprise. The Blue Anchor is the perfect traditional countryside pub for a pie and a pint when you’re done.Conwy to Llandudno (18 miles)This ambitious walk is perfect for experienced long-distance hikers, but the route is also easy to ide into smaller sections for those who only have an afternoon. It will take you up the Conwy River estuary and around the Great Orme, allowing for spectacular views of the north Wales coastline. As well as being a scenic delight, this is a walk for the historically minded – Llandudno has managed to keep its briny Victorian charms intact, and Conwy boasts an imposing medieval castle built in the 13th century.A very good walk based around some of Dylan Thomas’s old haunts, taking you via the River Taf and a Norman castle. The Dylan Thomas Boathouse is a must-see, bound to inspire those of a poetic bent – and the deck is the perfect place to sit with a coffee to take in the estuary. Laugharne Castle is a well-preserved and strikingly beautiful site, with a glorious view from the top of the tower. On your return, why not enjoy a beer in famous literary watering hole Brown’s hotel, where Thomas entertained his fellow writers and students.

This small patch of paradise on the California coastline is adored by locals, and anyone is welcome to enjoy the clean and quiet spot. If, that is, they have a key costing $100 a year.A 9ft iron gate blocks the path to a beach staircase, set among expensive hillside homes in the tony surf town of Santa Cruz, south of San Francisco. Yet by California law, all the beaches along its 840 alluring miles of coastline belong to the people, and the state is cracking down at Privates and elsewhere in a push to mitigate a growing ide between rich and poor.Resistance from those who want to keep Privates private will be stiff – they say the situation is far more nuanced than a class war. “I am an advocate for this thing – everyone is who lives around here,” said the professional surfer Shawn Dollar as he loaded a paddle board into his car in the parking lot outside the gate. “It’s nice here. People pick up dog poop and there’s no trash.”Officials are well-versed in such disputes. The Coastal Commission has been working since the late 2000s to open Martins Beach, also south of San Francisco, after the billionaire venture capitalist Vinod Khosla purchased the 89-acre Half Moon Bay property for $37m and promptly closed off the only road to the waterfront. Even though he has repeatedly lost in court, Khosla is now taking the issue to the supreme court – which could threaten public beach access across California by setting a precedent that limits the state’s regulatory powers.Khosla, for his part, told the New York Times last month that he has buyer’s remorse over the whole ordeal.“If I were to ever win in the supreme court, I’d be depressed about it,” he said. “I support the Coastal Act I don’t want to weaken it by winning. But property rights are even more important.”“I mean, look, to be honest, I do wish I’d never bought the property,” he said. “In the end, I’m going to end up selling it.”Meanwhile near Santa Barbara, a homeowners association have blocked off 8.5 miles of coastline, and the only way for non-residents to access it is to rent a boat, anchor offshore, and swim or boogie-board the rest of the way in. The state is considering using eminent domain to regain access. It has also spent the last 40 years fighting property owners in Malibu who blocked their beaches, and at the end of 2016 it issued more than $5.1m in fines.Three reports released in 2017 by researchers at Stanford Law, Berkeley Law, UCLA and San Francisco State University all found that residents along California coasts are more affluent and more white, and that there are significant physical and financial barriers for others who want to enjoy the beach – even though it is legally a publicly owned resource. “Because disadvantaged communities typically have fewer economic and recreational resources and opportunities, foreclosing any of the ones they do have will disproportionately affect them,” the Stanford researchers wrote.According to advocates, what’s happening at Privates is different. They point to the care they lavish on their walkway, and staircase down to the sand and argue that overcrowding and mismanagement by the state, which is facing a parks maintenance backlog, will result in its degradation.“It is everyone’s favorite park,” said Mark Massara, the attorney representing the Opal Cliffs recreation district in its efforts to keep the gate and fee structure. “It is only coastal staff, from their ivory tower, that wants to make this into some sort of Malibu scenario where you have elitists trying to privatize the coast.”Rather than a land-grab by rich property owners, he emphasizes that the community has held permits since the 1980s and has made the beach what it is today. The fee, Massara explains, is necessary to keep the area as polished as it is. “Wouldn’t it be a shame if the district goes out of business and then this turns into an ugly little overgrown horrible park with trash and everything else?”Jennifer Savage, a policy manager at advocacy organization Surfrider, sees the gate as an inequality issue. “There’s a growing awareness of the intangible barriers that keep people from being able to access the coast because of income,” she said.“We hear the rationale that allowing public use of a public beach will result in crime and trash and the destruction of our natural resources. And, certainly, not all people in all instances are perfect stewards,” she added. “But if we wanted to really protect the natural ecosystems, then you could make an argument that people should not be allowed to go anywhere and all of our parks and beaches should be gated off from general use. That’s not the way that we do things, at least in California.”Oddly enough, Dollar, the pro-private Privates surfer, doesn’t even have a key, but says he always is able to get in. Recently, in an attempt to work with regulatory officials, the gate has often been left unlocked, and remains so throughout the summer. California regulators, he sniffed, are “putting their hands in everyone’s business”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8849f508449b80ba6cf1ba8ebf1267c0ba1d73c2/0_8_2743_1646/master/2743.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=351ac1887b850db9ef7edeac56d23164","title":"un environment chief criticised by un over frequent flying eric solheim","story":"Erik Solheim’s huge travel bill is a ‘reputation risk’ and he has ‘no regard’ for rules, says draft internal auditThe globe-trotting travels of the UN’s environment chief have been sharply criticised in a draft internal audit as “contrary to the ethos of carbon emission reduction”.Erik Solheim, executive director of UN Environment, was travelling for 529 out of the 668 days audited, spending $488,518 (£370,380), according to the report. The audit also said he had “no regard for abiding by the set regulations and rules” and claimed unjustified expenses.The development comes amid growing concern among some UN Environment officials, with sources claiming his “haphazard and dictatorial management style” has “already made us dysfunctional in many respects”.Solheim told the  he had already paid back money for instances of oversight and made changes where other rules had been broken. He said he could not comment in detail on the audit until it was completed and published: “If any other mistakes are found, we will immediately correct them.”Responding to staff concern over his leadership of the UN Environment Programme (Unep), he said: “To secure unprecedented environmental action, we need to change, as iniduals, as society, indeed as the UN. No one is immune to the difficulty that type of systemic change often brings.”The draft audit, leaked to the , was compiled by the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) and will be finalised after responses from the iniduals named. It is particularly critical of Solheim’s frequent flying, which included a weekend trip from the US to France and back.It also said Unep, unlike several other UN organisations, did not have policies and incentives for staff to reduce their carbon emissions. In August, Solheim told a Norwegian aviation magazine, people should not have a “guilty conscience” about flying and said he held gold frequent flyer cards at all three major airline alliances.“This is simply embarrassing,” said Truls Gulowsen, head of Greenpeace in Norway. “Solheim has made Unep much more visible, which is a good thing, partly through travels and discussions with so many people. But this report puts him in an extremely bad light and weakens the credibility of UN’s entire environmental organisation.” Solheim said: “Making good on our global agenda demands engagement with the world and indeed an expanded approach to our work. I am therefore determined to continue to focus on our mandate to create real results for real people, with real impact on the ground.”The draft OIOS audit also criticises Solheim’s management style as “having no regard for abiding by the set regulations and rules, and correspondence seen showed management willingness to circumvent regulations and rules which were termed as ‘bureaucratic’.”The audit said Solheim’s travel had been approved by a manager who reported directly to him, not someone more senior. “We have immediately put new procedures in place whereby my travel is approved by the office of the secretary general,” Solheim told the .The audit also said Solheim had not provided justification for 76 days spent in Oslo and Paris on official travel. After a request from a UN official to account for days spent in his home country, Norway, Solheim, emailed: “We cannot accept this question on holiday vs job … we are not any longer living in the industrial age and they must stop treating me as if I am a 07 to 16 factory worker … the other side of this coin is that they must stop asking this stupid question.”Solheim told the : “It’s true that I have vented frustration with what I perceive as excessive bureaucracy in the UN system. I believe fully in reforming the UN so we’re better able to confront the urgent challenges facing our planet.” But he added: “If administrative rules are found to have been overlooked, I accept personal responsibility and offer my unflinching commitment to refining a process that prevents them from ever occurring again.”The OIOS report also criticises Solheim for allowing two senior managers to work unofficially from Paris, rather than Unep headquarters in Nairobi. A source said staff saw this arrangement as the managers “getting away with murder”.In one case, the unofficial teleworking resulted in additional travel costs of $23,750, according to the draft audit. Questioned by officials over the unofficial arrangement in emails seen by the , Solheim said: “Please blame it on the erratic executive director.”On another occasion, discussing management reform, Solheim emailed colleagues to say: “There is no need to be the most legalistic implementer of nonsense. Very often it is easier to get forgiveness for non compliance than to get permission for change.”Numerous Unep staff have contacted the , on condition of anonymity, criticising Solheim’s leadership of the organisation, which is governed and funded by UN member states.“He thinks he is a CEO when he is actually an international civil servant,” said one source. “A lot of us were very excited when he came.

For Moschino’s creative director, Jeremy Scott, at his Milan show this week, even that was not enough – or so he would have us believe.The statement was, of course, not true, but Scott was making a much bigger one. The increased speed at which the industry is moving, and fast fashion – the theme of his first collection for Moschino in 2014 – are pressing issues.Since then the designer has not shied away from making social and political statements with his designs, exploring themes such as conspiracy theories, body image and recycling.This time, skirt suits were printed in rough felt-tip sketches. These scribbles covered everything from from hats to tights and varied from leopard to fashion figurine designs. Elsewhere, the Moschino teddy-bear mascot came illustrated on T-shirts, while another of the house’s signatures, chunky gold chains, were drawn on tracksuits, mini dresses and swimsuits.This ingenuity was mixed with the whimsical as specific objects from the atelier morphed into runway looks. Huge metallic pattern-cutting scissors formed the structured silhouette of an evening gown a thimble became a hat and a ruffled tape measure transformed into a floor-length scarf. One model arrived carrying a roll of fabric still attached to her dress – the ultimate poster girl for this collection, entitled Unfinished Business.Scott is no sloucher. In addition to heading up the menswear and womenswear at Moschino in Milan, he runs his eponymous label from New York, and this year he has added a collaboration with H\u0026ampM. The collection, which will be unveiled in October, presents Scott with a chance to reach a new audience at a lower price point. “I thought it was the perfect opportunity for me to deliver further what I wanted to do when I first came to Moschino with the french fries phone case,” he said, referring to the entry-level accessory that became a cult hit.His collections, for all their daring, often ide opinion. Scott, who cites designers such as Thierry Mugler among his role models for his ability to create a distinctive world, is happy to keep sketching outside the lines. “I don’t do something that’s for everyone … I wouldn’t dull myself down to appeal to more people. It’s not that middle of the road it’s not who I am,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c72bab845b7ced1fdfd489efafe232ceb42bbbb4/214_284_5546_3328/master/5546.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=152d83e2a0488ebe9fce5719aa449e4d","title":"ruben neves diogo jota wolves porto cricket interview","story":"It is Tuesday afternoon in Wolverhampton city centre and Monica Lopes, the owner of Aromas de Portugal, has just welcomed a couple of regular customers into her coffee shop on King Street. Well, regular in one sense but not in another given it is Rúben Neves and Diogo Jota who are sitting in front of a plate of delicious Portuguese custard tarts – pastéis de nata – talking about cricket.For Jota and Neves, who joined Wolves in July last year after playing together at Porto, this little corner of the Black Country feels like home away from home. Hélder Costa, another member of the sizeable Portuguese contingent at the club, is credited with discovering the place, which opened 13 months ago. Monica, who is from Porto, could not have timed things better in that respect, although she has no interest in football and was oblivious to the fact a number of her customers were household names and worth millions of pounds until she saw her boyfriend talking to them and asked how he knew them.Neves and Jota, who got to know each other playing for Portugal’s Under-21s, are terrific company. Humble and affable, they speak with such maturity it is easy to forget they are 21 years old. At times they are like a married couple as they finish off one another’s sentences, no more so than when the conversation turns to the slightly awkward question of how they compare Wolverhampton with Porto.“It’s not possible to compare, it’s completely different,” Neves says, diplomatically. “In Porto it’s a tourist city. It’s close to the river, the ocean as well, there’s a lot of history. The wine and the food also. And here it’s an industrial city. But we’re fine with it. We want to play football … in the best league in the world, so the city doesn’t matter,” Jota adds. “And we have a good home and our family with us,” continues Neves.The overriding impression is that Neves and Jota could not be happier. Jota talks about how much more comfortable he is off the field in Wolverhampton than in Porto, where the level of attention was suffocating at times, and both remark on how refreshing it is to be in a league where the ball is in play a lot more. “Time-wasting is one of the worst things we have in Portugal,” Jota says, sighing. “For example, when we played against Manchester City we still wanted to play when we had Jonny injured. But in Portugal, you’ll get a lot of players ‘injured’.”The follow-up question prompts Neves and Jota to react with laughter and a sense of incredulity. Given that their manager is also Portuguese, does he ever get invited to the birthday dinners? “Nooooooooo!” the two respond in unison, looking flabbergasted. “You can’t cross that line,” Jota says, smiling.Their level of respect for Nuno, who also managed them at Porto, shines through when they talk about him. “He’s a really intense and ambitious coach,” Neves says. “I think the most important thing is the motivation – he’s always motivated to do his best all the time. Even when we’re playing good, he wants us to play better. I think this makes the difference with him.”Everything comes a lot more easily with a ball at their feet. Neves has caught the eye this season with his wonderful range of passing, and it feels a matter of time before Jota, Wolves’ top scorer last season, opens his Premier League account. “We want to make ourselves look good in the best league in the world,” Jota says. “When it was our first game, against Everton, I was very emotional, because it really means something for me. When I came on to the field, I thought: ‘I’m here’.”Saturday’s visit to Old Trafford promises to be another special occasion, especially with José Mourinho in the opposite dugout. Neves, who grew up supporting Porto, can vividly remember their 2004 Champions League triumph under Mourinho, even though he was only seven. “I watched the final with my family,” he says. “We went into Porto to celebrate because all my family are fans. Mourinho is a legend at Porto.”Rather surprisingly neither Neves nor Jota has spoken to Mourinho, despite plenty of common ground, including when it comes to their agent. Jorge Mendes represents all three and it is interesting listening to Jota’s response when asked how important Mendes is from a player perspective.“He’s like my right arm,” Jota says. “I think from a player’s point of view, you feel you are with the best at his job. I feel there is no one better than him to manage my career, so I have nothing to worry about – just to do my job on the field. When you speak with him, he’s really ambitious and he says you can always do more. He’s very confident and believes in you more than you do yourself sometimes.”Monica could probably do with Mendes’s help, too, because sadly Aromas de Portugal is on the market. Monica’s father is ill and the family have asked her to return home, meaning she is trying to find a new owner. All the catering equipment is included in the price and the same goes for a distinguished list of regular customers, provided the place remains in Portuguese hands. “We hope it does,” says Neves. “We have alternatives. But the best place for us is here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/596aab0c042112db74ee7e3cd349616196003a86/307_21_2469_1481/master/2469.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6ead03e7e833f2234ce84c389815f18","title":"sergio aguero signs manchester city contract extension one year 2021","story":"Pep Guardiola has revealed Benjamin Mendy has an injured fifth metatarsal, with Manchester City’s manager unsure how long the left-back will be out.The 24-year-old has missed the past two games. It is understood the problem is bruising in the left foot and minor. Guardiola, asked for how long Mendy would be unavailable, said: “I don’t know it – he has a problem in his bone.”Guardiola welcomed the news that Sergio Agüero had signed a one-year contract extension to stay City until 2021. If the striker sees out the deal it would mean he will have been at City for a decade, having joined from Atlético Madrid in summer 2011.The 30-year-old has scored three goals in six appearances this season and has drawn praise from Guardiola for his all-round game, an area the manager has been keen for Agüero to improve. “I am so happy he has signed a new contract and can stay 10 years at the club,” Guardiola said.The sentiment from Agüero, City’s all-time leading goalscorer, was similar. “My idea was being here for 10 years,” he said. “I’ve been here for seven years, it’s going to be 10 when the contract expires. This was the main reason I signed. I’m very happy because they have treated my very well since the first day I got here.”City suffered a surprise 2-1 home defeat to Lyon in Wednesday’s opening Champions League group game. Yet Guardiola defended his team, saying they were not required to say sorry.“The players don’t have to apologise,” he said. “Why should they? They ran, they fought, tried to make a comeback. The competition punishes the mistakes. We made a lot of mistakes. But they don’t have to apologise.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a5db320e10cb17ccdcf65dff1d049405aa31ecf/403_57_1046_628/master/1046.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6d74ce2036964ca4473bda46d0d32d5","title":"liverpool impress ronaldo ridiculousness and cows cows cows football weekly extra","story":"Max is joined by Barry Glendenning, Lars Sivertsen and Jonathan Wilson to discuss the Champions League, Ronaldo’s red, the timekeeping skills of cows and Mark Hughes’s elusive smileJoin the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

You can deny it. But search your feelings, you know it to be true. There is just something very likable about Pochettino: the barking laugh, the pouchy dimples, the way he strides around the touchline looking like the world’s most handsome oil rigger.As a reporter you want to hear Pochettino speak. You want him to enjoy being in England. You want his views on players and tactics. You want to go for a barbecue at his house afterwards and smoke a cigar while he cooks the steaks in a pair of Wayfarers and a Hawaiian shirt. Later on maybe we can have a game of poker with Diego Simeone and Carlos The Jackal.So persuasive is the Poch charisma it was tempting to give him a pass when he started talking about “respect” in midweek, with the suggestion he wasn’t given enough of it after Tottenham’s 2-1 defeat by Internazionale. Pochettino had been asked a question about his decision to omit two of his best defenders from a match Spurs lost as a result of bad defending.It was an excellent question, the sound of someone doing their job well, going into uncomfortable spaces at an uncomfortable moment.The response – “don’t disrespect the players!” – was un-Poch like. It was even a little José-ish in its tone. “Respect, respect, respect,” Mourinho had barked across the press room a couple of weeks ago in Manchester, standing up and pointing and looking slightly wild in response to what started off as a fairly routine question about playing Ander Herrera in a back three.This touchiness, the apparent outrage at being questioned, the suggestion that a cat may not in fact look at a king, is increasingly common around football. But the hostility is also something that should be resisted, and that should be questioned in itself.Who is allowed to have an opinion about all this? English professional football has always had a disdain for the views of those who have not been employed to play English professional football. This notion of disrespect at being asked a few questions, whether by journalists or fans empowered by social media, springs from the same place. How dare you, who live outside this world, to whom this is all interpretation, question my actions.In philosophy this has been referred to as the “practical man” fallacy, the idea that nothing can exist with any meaning outside immediate physical experience. In football this emerges as the “never kicked a ball in your life” theory.This states that even the most taciturn, unreflective human with the physical gifts and good fortune to be paid to kick a ball will in every case have a better understanding of all issues around kicking a ball than, say, Brian Glanville, or a club season ticket holder, or the historian Simon Schama.My favourite recent example of this was history ace Schama’s good natured Twitter “beef” with Alan Shearer during the World Cup. Shearer responded to a minor disagreement over the nature of England’s performance by suggesting that as he, Shearer, had played in similar games 20 years ago his view must be the correct one.Shearer was joking, riffing on his own spectacular career as an England player. But it was funny in other ways too, because Schama is a historian and academic, disciplines that rely entirely on interpreting experience through evidence and reasoning. Schama’s views on, say, the French revolution or the dissolution of the monasteries are considered valid and illuminating, despite the fact he wasn’t present at these things either, and has never stormed a Bastille in his life.But when it comes to football, which is happening right now, which you can see, and which isn’t actually that complicated or hard to understand? No way mate. Nobody could ever imagine what football is like. Even after seeing it happen in front of you, having evidence and being intelligent. Now shut it and listen to the thoughts of Danny Mills.Respect: how much should you really have for anyone? Shearer is right on this. His experience enriches his views. He can use it to tell you interesting things you wouldn’t otherwise have known. But it’s not an exclusive deal. There might also be things that Schama (who’s never shot an Austrian Archduke in his life) or a teenage tactics blogger, or Rene Maric, the 26-year-old assistant manager of Red Bull Salzburg, might be able to tell Shearer.Similarly Pochettino is right that his intimate insider knowledge of the mental and physical requirements of his players should be respected. But it can also be questioned. There is no need to create an artificial barrier here. Football has always been furious, disrespectful, iconoclastic, hostage to the furies of the crowd. This is the source of its strength, its resilience and its financial good health. So spare us the talk about respect. The day people stop asking questions or shouting from the bleachers, glued instead to their in-house docu-films, or bled dry of doubt or interest by an increasingly set bunch of hierarchies well, that’s the time to start worrying."},{"url":null,"title":"want to know your rights but only have 60 seconds","story":"London barrister hopes to educate people about the law with bitesize Youtube videosChristian Weaver likes to keep it concise. His video series ‘TheLawin60Seconds’ is pioneering legal advice for an age of supposedly limited attention s.The 24-year-old lawyer has begun teaching people about their rights in online talks to camera that aim to simplify the complexity of legislation into a few basic principles.He may not be the first person to deliver consumer-friendly lectures over the internet but his tight timeframe presents a unique challenge in compressing arcane information into a one-minute broadcast.Weaver’s first online lecture was on Stop and Search. His most recent have been on tenants’ and consumer rights.“It’s important that people know the law and their legal rights,” he explained. “People are busy so it’s a matter of condensing everything into 60 seconds.“I’ve had very favourable reactions. Some schools have said they will use them for their lessons. It’s not just about your rights but also interesting points of law.“Law has always interested me. I feel it’s a real injustice that peoples’ human rights can be violated simply because of the lack of money for a lawyer to take their case. This is about ensuring that people’s human rights are protected and assured.”After studying at Nottingham Law School and training to be a barrister, Weaver is working at the London-based charity Inquest which supports relatives in coroners’ courts. He has lined up a pupillage place next year at a barristers’ chambers that specialises in human rights.Weaver chose to talk about stop and search powers due to the rise of street violence in London and in his home city of Nottingham. The police tactic is an effective way of combating crime, he says, providing it is intelligence-led. He wants to ensure that everyone knows their rights.“Often people don’t know how to act in such a situation,” Weaver said. “These are rights that you should know when you come across the police.”He highlighted tenants’ rights because as a student so many of his friends had been “ripped off” by landlords. He sees himself more as a lawyer than a full time vlogger.Having sat in on some of the Grenfell inquiry hearings, he is considering delivering his next talk on the legal implications of the high-rise tragedy.“People think that the law is too inaccessible or difficult but by promoting it as ‘The Law in 60 Seconds’ they are aware from the get-go that it’s not going to be too long.”The Bar Council, which represents barristers in England and Wales, welcomed Weaver’s initiative. “Bite-sized information is a good starting point for anyone considering taking legal advice, as long as they know that there will most likely be a need to seek more in-depth knowledge from a qualified lawyer,” a spokesperson said.“It is encouraging to see a member of the bar coming up with an innovative way of helping the public get a better understanding of how the law affects them in an age when the consumption of fast, easy-to-understand information is the norm.”A spokesperson for the Equality and Human Rights Commission said: “We all know the law is complicated and all too often people don’t understand it. Knowing your rights and how to enforce them is a necessary step to ensuring our laws are as effective at protecting us as parliament intended them to be. We’d be interested in talking to Christian to see if we can work together on some of his ideas.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f002572ebd639832dc7efb668f2286eedbae4d7f/0_132_2354_1412/master/2354.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ac35393a9602155bdff9f339e7b200a","title":"my rubber fetish has enriched my life","story":"The sixtysomething with a passion for rubberIt all began when I was about 13 and had a swim cap I was mesmerised by the smooth feel of the rubber, the sounds it made, and the smell. I don’t know what made me associate rubber with sex but I began masturbating with it, and ever since, my sex life has been wonderfully enhanced.As a teenager I felt abnormal, until I came across fetish magazines like AtomAge, Shiny and Smooth, filled with pictures of people wearing latex clothes, and I realised, with relief, there were others like me.I’m in my 60s now, and although society is becoming more tolerant of less conventional forms of sexuality, like BDSM, rubber – and fetishism in general – remains socially unacceptable. There are certain objects – high heels, tight skirts, leather clothes – that can verge on the fetishistic, but perhaps these are more acceptable because they are part of everyday wardrobes.The characteristics of rubber – the fact that it gets hot or cold depending on the air temperature – work against it as a fashion material. A common theme in online forums is: “How can I tell my partner?”, the fear being that our partners will find us beyond the pale. I am fortunate to have a partner – of over 30 years – who, while not enthusiastic about my passion for rubber, tolerates it. She accepts that I wear latex clothing and she will sometimes – although not as often as I would like! – wear latex herself.My rubber fetish is fun, wonderful and an integral part of me: I can’t be “cured”, and I don’t want to be.

The most popular baby names of 2017 have been announced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), and while Olivia, Oliver and Muhammad – in its varied spellings – remain the most likely names to be heard shouted across the nation’s playgrounds in years to come, the inventiveness of parents shows no sign of slowing down.Aurora, Lyla, Orla, Edith and Hallie enter the top 100 girls’ names, while for boys, popular names include Leo, which enters the top 10, and Ralph, moving into the top 100.Sarah, the most popular name for girls throughout much of the 1970s and 1980s, has dropped out of the top 100 for the first time since records began in 1904.Parents in England and Wales gave 28,222 different names to the 348,071 boys born last year, and 35,475 to the 331,035 girls. More parents seem to be aiming for something celestial, with Luna and Aria among the fastest-rising girls’ names in the past decade.The biggest climber was Harper, the name David and Victoria Beckham gave to their youngest child in 2011. Music and sport often provide inspiration, with 35 parents plumping for Kendrick for boys – perhaps with the rapper Kendrick Lamar in mind – and 50 calling their boys Kobe, possibly after the basketball player Kobe Bryant.However, the British political class does not inspire people so much. There is no Boris, Jeremy or Theresa in either of the top 100s, although Jacob was the sixth-most popular name in 2017, a year in which the arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg has grown in popularity in some quarters. There were only 11 Nigels born last year, compared with 50 Winstons.The names given to the newborns of England and Wales present a different and more erse picture than those registered when Britain joined the EU in 1973. Back then, Michael and Jennifer were the most popular names.There is also considerable regional variation. In Gwynedd, north Wales, Hari is the most popular name given to boys. In Blackburn, it is Zainab for girls. Amelia and Muhammad are most popular in Birmingham, Jack and Olivia in Bristol, and Arthur, Oscar, Florence and Lily in Tunbridge Wells.Muhammad was the 10th most popular name for boys, but if the alternative spellings of Mohammed or Mohammad were included, it would be about as popular as Oliver and its variants, such as Olly, across England and Wales, the ONS said.Two names that do not appear in the top 100s are Walt and Boo, the twins born this week to Chris Evans and Natasha Shishmanian, who had earlier nicknamed the boy and girl Ping and Pong, which do not appear either."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2508209224edba3998de802239b25d83993199a/0_360_3456_2074/master/3456.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ab50cb704601208c88b90fcce7fd908","title":"from cricket to chris evans murdoch invests in uk radio boom","story":"News UK under Rebekah Brooks hedging against print decline by expanding in commercial radioWhen Chris Evans announced this month that he was leaving BBC Radio 2 for Virgin Radio, casual observers may have been confused about how a digital-only station that attracts a few hundred thousand listeners could afford to poach a presenter who earns £1.6m a year and reaches 9 million listeners a week on his BBC breakfast show.What they probably didn’t realise is that Evans’ hire is part of a largely overlooked decision by Rupert Murdoch’s News UK business to invest heavily in the booming British commercial radio industry, hedging against the ageing readership of its print outlets such as the Sun.“News UK are keen to ersify from newspapers,” said Matt Deegan, a radio consultant who works for Folder Media. “Radio is a pretty good margin business if you can keep control of your costs. It ersifies away from newsprint and allows them to grow advertising.”Deegan said Evans’ recruitment was part of a strategy by News UK to make Virgin the biggest commercial radio station in the country. He said the plan required “good content, excellent marketing and an aggressive story” to persuade the public to tune in.Spending is up across Wireless Group, which operates Murdoch’s UK radio brands. Its flagship station TalkSport outbid the BBC for the radio rights to the England cricket team’s forthcoming tours of Sri Lanka, the West Indies and South Africa, meaning there will be no Test Match Special coverage. The sister station TalkRadio has added Matthew Wright, the former Channel 5 presenter, to a lineup that already includes Eamonn Holmes, and further signings are expected.The expansion is an opportunity for Rebekah Brooks to continue her public rehabilitation. The former Sun editor returned as News UK chief executive in 2015 after being cleared of any wrongdoing in a phone-hacking trial. Under her leadership the company has brought the Sun out from behind a paywall and made an unexpected £220m bid in September 2016 for Wireless Group, the Northern Irish broadcasting company once known as UTV, which had been ordered to break itself up after a disastrous incursion into the Irish TV market.Multiple News UK insiders say Brooks’ reputation within the company, which took a battering after the high-profile collapse of its gambling venture SunBets, is increasingly staked on making the radio business a success. One described her as being very hands-on and involved in drawing up a long-term strategy for the group.The addition of a radio audience, especially the younger listeners that TalkSport attracts, helps the News UK sales team when pitching to advertisers who are less interested in print products. Wireless Group stations will soon be based within the same central London building as News UK’s print newspapers.With the majority of radio listening now taking place through digital devices – aided by the ubiquity of in-car DAB radios – commercial radio groups are increasingly confident of investing in stations that are not available on FM. In the last decade the UK industry has been dominated by two companies, Global and Bauer, who between them control stations such as Classic FM and Magic and have also combined dozens of smaller local stations into new quasi-national networks such as Capital and Hits, eating into the BBC’s audience share.These companies have shown themselves willing to throw money around, such as when Global’s LBC pinched Eddie Mair from Radio 4. BBC and News UK sources suggested to the  that Evans had also been in negotiations with Global about working for one its stations before plumping for Virgin. A spokesperson for Global declined to comment on the speculation.Wireless Group, stuck in third place in the market, has turned to old brand names that listeners may recognise. The Virgin Radio that Evans is joining is not the same station that he worked for, bought, sold and then sued in the late 1990s and early 2000s. That station was rebranded as Absolute Radio in 2008. The current Virgin Radio, operated by Wireless under licence from Richard Branson, only started broadcasting in 2016. The ability to cross-promote stations in News UK’s other media outlets means readers of the Sun can expect to see positive coverage of Evans when he joins Virgin Radio in the new year – a change of stance from 10 months ago when the newspaper ran pieces with headlines such as: “Why does the Beeb protect Chris Evans over sex scandal but sling out others?”The relative lack of mainstream attention paid to Murdoch’s investment in the UK radio industry may have been a blessing for his wider interests, given the concerns around media dominance that have dogged his 21st Century Fox group’songoing takeover bid for Sky TV, due to be resolved this weekend.Robert Thomson, News Corp’s global chief executive, told a conference last month that the acquisition of Wireless Group was working out “very, very favourably for us” given the potential for commercial growth.Deegan said: “It’s easy sometimes to think of radio as a Cinderella medium. But its commercial and audience success is why everyone’s quite bullish.”Chris Evans The Radio 2 breakfast show host was said to have been upset that his salary was made public in a series of pay disclosures and, having just had twins with his wife, Natasha Shishmanian, is looking for a new challenge at Virgin Radio, where he will be tasked with helping to lift the station out of obscurity.Matthew Wright The presenter quit Channel 5’s The Wright Stuff this year after years as a daytime TV staple. He’s now presenting the afternoon show on TalkRadio, which is taking on Global’s LBC.Eamonn Holmes The former Sky News Sunrise host now presents the drive-time programme on TalkRadio, where he sits on a schedule that includes Julia Hartley-Brewer, Iain Lee and the unlikely Murdoch employee George Galloway."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32f3ece978baf6d799efa52e12427218d678cbfb/0_374_4830_2899/master/4830.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fa48d31dd9bb9bef4305578cc7ec74e","title":"lets move leytonstone on good form","story":"It’s quite humdrum, but mostly in a nice wayWhat’s going for it?

When she takes a break and looks around, it is with the open-mouthed look of curiosity and awe that you see in many infants. Evie’s vocabulary currently consists of a repertoire of squawks and “mmm” sounds. In the past few months, she has begun to stand unaided for short periods – even taking a few steps in her walking frame – progress that fills her parents with immeasurable pride, not to mention hope for the future.Despite her baby-like demeanour, Evie is eight years old. She has Pura syndrome, a vanishingly rare developmental disorder that didn’t officially exist until four years ago. Developmental disorders affect children’s normal mental or physical development. Before she was diagnosed, all Evie’s parents knew was that she suffered from “global developmental delay”: a vague umbrella term for a set of symptoms with myriad potential causes – some, but not all of them, associated with a\u0026nbspheartbreakingly poor prognosis.Yet thanks to advances in genome sequencing, more and more families like the Walkers are receiving an accurate diagnosis for their child’s condition, and with it a clearer picture of what the future holds. In some cases, such as Evie’s, it reveals they are suffering from a completely new disease in others – albeit a minority of cases, for now – it reveals a potential treatment for a\u0026nbspcondition that had hitherto seemed untreatable.It’s not only children with developmental disorders whose lives are being transformed by this technology. In October 2018, NHS England will launch its Genomic Medicine Service, 13 genomic medicine centres that will provide whole genome sequencing to people with undiagnosed rare diseases and cancer – another disease of mutated genes.By uncovering the exact genomic changes driving tumour growth, doctors can choose more effective treatments. In so doing, the NHS says England will become one of the first countries in the world to routinely offer “comprehensive and equitable access to the latest in genomic testing and management for the whole country, regardless of condition and where people live”. People with developmental diseases and cancer will be the first to benefit, but as our understanding of genetics grows, the infrastructure will be in place for the testing of other disorders as well, such as early onset dementia or multiple sclerosis, which may be caused by several gene variants.Ever since the announcement that a first draft of the human genome had been sequenced, scientists and politicians have been claiming we’re on the threshold of a new era of personalised genomic medicine. Has it finally arrived?Evie was Alison Walker’s second child, born 15 months after her first. Walker had sailed through both pregnancies, and when Evie was delivered, a week overdue, by normal vaginal delivery, it appeared her parents had been blessed with a second healthy child – and an excellent sleeper to boot. But this attribute rapidly became a source of concern. Her parents had to wake her to feed her, and then she didn’t feed for very long. She also felt abnormally cold. Walker raised these concerns with her health visitor when Evie was five days old, and she was told to take her to hospital.Immediately, the triage nurse grabbed her and raced off down the corridor. Evie spent a week in intensive care while the medical team worked to keep her warm and fed. “We assumed it was just a little bump in the road, that she’d get better, and then we’d go home with our gorgeous little girl and all would be well,” says Walker.But even though Evie returned home, she remained extremely sleepy, and as she turned from infant to toddler, it became clear that she wasn’t hitting the usual developmental milestones. She regularly returned to hospital, undergoing blood tests for various hormonal and nutritional deficiencies, brain scans to detect neurological damage and genetic tests for common inherited diseases. Her parents naively assumed that one of these tests would eventually reveal how to fix Evie’s issues: “Then we started to realise that not only could we not fix it, we couldn’t figure out what the problem was to start with,” Walker says.Evie was two years old when a hospital consultant sat her parents down and broke the devastating news that not only was it unlikely that Evie would ever catch up with healthy children her age, but they wondered if she would develop much further at all. Evie still couldn’t hold her head up, stand, walk or talk – and yet, the medical tests kept returning normal results.The Walkers’ experience was traumatic but surprisingly common. A rare disease, as defined by the European Union, is one that affects fewer than five in 10,000 people. According to Rare Disease UK, there are between 6,000 and 8,000 known rare diseases – and five new ones are described in the medical literature every week. They range from well-known inherited diseases such as cystic fibrosis and Huntington’s disease to childhood cancers and obscure developmental disorders such as Pura syndrome. Around three-quarters of rare diseases affect children, and a third of those born affected will not survive to see their fifth birthday.One thing that has changed is the development of next-generation sequencing technology. DNA-sequencing machines don’t sequence the whole genome in one go. Instead, the DNA is cut into short pieces, around 150 “letters” long, and the sequences of these fragments are read and then stitched together by comparing them to a reference sequence. Next-generation sequencing enables hundreds of thousands to millions or billions of these DNA-sequencing reactions to be performed simultaneously, massively speeding up the process. It’s only in the past few years that researchers have been able to sequence an entire genome in a cost-effective way.Helen Firth, a clinical geneticist at Cambridge University Hospitals, has spent her career trying to help those affected by rare diseases. “Once you’ve got a diagnosis, you can try and learn from other patients with that condition about what the future might hold,” she says. This is so you can try and tailor future medical surveillance and management of the disease, she adds, as well as “provide accurate advice to other family members about the chances of another child or family member being affected by the condition”. Yet despite her best efforts, for many years Firth could only diagnose about a quarter to a third of the patients coming through her doors. Traditionally, geneticists like Firth used a process called karyotyping, which involves pairing up and ordering all the chromosomes to see if any are missing, duplicated or contain subtler structural changes.Karyotyping remains a useful technique for pinpointing large abnormalities, but the level of resolution is limited to about 5m base pairs. Geneticists’ work became easier with the development of array technology, which enabled smaller abnormalities to be detected, with a resolution of 50,000–100,000 base pairs. However, neither of these techniques could spot tiny (but often very significant) changes, such as a single chemical letter being substituted for a different one. For this, you need DNA sequencing, a technique first developed during the 1970s. The initial sequencing of the human genome took about 13 years and cost more than £2bn. The process has become progressively faster and cheaper ever since.Even so, until recently it was only practical for clinical geneticists to sequence one gene at a time – limiting what could be achieved in an inidual patient. However, by 2010, array technology had improved and the cost of genome sequencing fallen to the point where Firth, together with Matt Hurles – who is now head of human genetics at the Wellcome Sanger Institute – believed they might be able to diagnose many more patients if these technologies were systematically applied.So, in partnership with NHS genetics services and several other research groups, they recruited more than 12,000 British children and adults with undiagnosed developmental disorders for the Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DDD) study and sequenced all the gene-coding regions of their DNA. They also sequenced their parents’ DNA, enabling them to identify mutations that had occurred de novo – either during egg or sperm production or when the affected person was still an early embryo.“The question with these families has always been why so many of them have one very sick child and everyone else is healthy,” says Hurles, who leads the DDD study. “What we’ve found is that when we can make a diagnosis in these children, it’s often because of one of these new mutations.”One of those recruited was Evie Walker. She and her parents each gave a saliva sample, and the genetic sequence of each of their 20,000 genes was compared with a database of 1,450 known developmental disorder genes. Although doing this has enabled many DDD participants to receive a diagnosis, it didn’t work for Evie. Instead, for Evie and those like her with no diagnosis in the DDD study, the researchers turned to her other genes – those with no known link to disease – looking for ones containing a significant excess of de novo mutations.This led them to the Pura gene, which encodes a protein that helps regulate the expression of numerous other genes. Evie and two other girls were found to have small deletions or spelling mistakes in different areas of the Pura gene, which the researchers believed accounted for their illness. Although the girls had similar symptoms, they weren’t identical: “We’re often finding that these disorders are quite variable from one patient to the next, and this might be one reason why they haven’t been recognised before now – because a clinician couldn’t have said: these are all one thing,” says Hurles.To date, rare variants in nearly 1,500 genes have been shown to cause developmental disorders. So far, the DDD study has identified 30 new genes associated with developmental disorders and has led to the recognition of 14 entirely new disorders – although the data is still being analysed and more are likely to emerge.“It has been wonderful to have families, for whom I\u0026nbspstruggled for years to get a diagnosis, recruited to the DDD study, and then to sit in clinic with them, and actually explain the molecular diagnosis,” says Firth.As for Alison Walker, though she wanted a diagnosis for Evie, she underestimated the impact it would have on their lives: “We thought it would just be a name for what we were already living with. We didn’t expect it to be life-changing, but then when it came it really was.”In Melbourne, Australia, six-year-old Sarah Anderson was going through a diagnostic odyssey of her own. The first sign that something was wrong was when Sarah, at 36 hours old, couldn’t stay warm, was incredibly floppy, wasn’t feeding properly and would temporarily stop breathing.“I remember the geneticist coming in and saying, ‘I give her seven days enjoy her spend as much time with her as you can,’ and thinking, this wasn’t supposed to happen,” says Sarah’s mother, Mel Anderson.Fortunately, Sarah defied the odds, although as she grew older she failed to meet the normal developmental milestones and struggled to control her movements. At 14 months she developed severe epilepsy, suffering up to 20 seizures a day, which left her exhausted and made her other symptoms even worse. She was misdiagnosed with several conditions before the cost of genome sequencing fell to a point where her parents were able to fundraise the US$8,000 (£6,000) needed to get it done. Sequencing didn’t provide an immediate diagnosis, but it did narrow the search to around 20 genes – one of which was Pura.The breakthrough came when a doctor from Melbourne who knew about Sarah’s case attended a conference where early results of the DDD study were being presented. One slide listed the Pura gene along with other genes of interest. Afterwards, the doctor walked up to the presenter and said: “We’ve got one of those.” Several months of emails and telephone conversations later, Sarah’s neurologist was emailed a\u0026nbspdraft of the research paper the British researchers were putting together on this new condition. It contained a photo of the first child that they had diagnosed.“Suddenly they were more excited I think than I was,” Anderson recalls. “Our neurologist couldn’t get the words out, but then we looked at this child and … ” she takes a sharp intake of breath. The photo showed a pretty four-year-old girl, with a round face, long dark hair cut into a blunt fringe, and a slightly open mouth. Anderson thought: “That’s Sarah.” It was Evie Walker.Even though Sarah’s doctors could now give Anderson a diagnosis, they couldn’t tell her any more about what it meant. Anderson credits Sarah’s neurologist with what happened next. He said: “Find the others bring the parents together form a foundation find researchers – it’s the only way you’re going to get the answers that you need.” Things happened quickly. In the autumn of 2014, a paper describing the three British girls with Pura mutations, plus Sarah, was published. At the same time, an American group published a study describing another group of children with similar mutations. Anderson arranged to fly out and meet some of them. On that first visit, she met with seven other families, and they agreed to set up a foundation. Soon afterwards, they launched a\u0026nbspwebsite and began to register the foundation. They then reached out to any researcher they could find who had worked on the Pura gene or the protein it encoded.One of them was Dierk Niessing at the Institute of Structural Biology in Munich. Niessing had spent the early part of his career trying to solve the structure of the Pura protein and understand more about what it did. Mice that had been engineered to lack the Pura gene showed serious defects in their brains and nervous systems. The mice also tended to struggle with eating, breathing and walking.“Everything was weaker,” says Niessing. “So, my guess was that it’s an important protein, and perhaps at some point a disease would be found.”When the 2014 paper was published, he was proved correct. In 2016, the Pura Syndrome Foundation held its first conference near London, which Alison and Evie Walker attended. It was the first time Alison Walker had met Mel Anderson face-to-face. “It was like meeting a\u0026nbsplong-lost sister,” Walker says.“Initially it made me really sad to think that so many people had been through the same thing we’ve been through,” she says. “But it was nice to know, on the days when you just felt like putting your head in your hands and sobbing, that other people do understand.”The 100,000 Genomes Project was launched in England in 2012 by the then prime minister David Cameron, whose son Ivan was born with a rare neurological disorder that baffled doctors and eventually claimed his life. The goal was to sequence 100,000 genomes from patients with cancer, rare disorders and infectious diseases, both to find diagnoses and potential treatments for them, but also, in so doing, establish the infrastructure to offer routine whole genome sequencing for rare diseases and cancer within the NHS by October this year. So far, it has sequenced more than 75,000 genomes – most of them from families with undiagnosed rare diseases – and diagnoses have been returned in around a quarter of cases.One of them was a boy with severe immunodeficiency and neurological disease, who died at the age of four months. “His parents were very distressed they wanted to try and have other children, but they were very fearful of having another child like him – so they asked for themselves and the child to be enrolled in the programme,” says Mark Caulfield of Genomics England, which is charged with the delivery of the 100,000 Genomes Project. The boy’s DNA revealed a mutation in a protein that transports vitamin B12 into cells. Shortly afterwards, the mother became pregnant again, and just before the baby was born they discovered that he was carrying the same mutation. However, case reports of other children with this mutation suggested that giving high doses of vitamin B12 could overcome the problem, so this is what they did.“So far, he is developing according to the normal milestones and has not had the experience of the first child,” says Caulfield. “We begin to see how, not for all – and maybe not even for many – but for some, genome sequencing can lead to treatments.”Yet, despite the optimism, genome sequencing doesn’t provide answers for everyone. Paul Arvidson’s nine-year-old daughter, Nenna, is enrolled in both the DDD study and the 100,000 Genomes Project, yet neither has come up with any answers for why she is the way she is – at least not yet. For the family, the hardest thing is being unable to make long-term plans: “Because we haven’t got a diagnosis, we haven’t got a prognosis. We don’t know if her condition means she isn’t going to make it to adulthood, or to her teens. We want to be able to prepare for that – to know if there are things we need to think about sooner rather than later.”Also, whereas the current DNA-sequencing technology is very good at identifying single letter changes in the DNA sequence, it’s less good at spotting more than just a single letter change, or insertions or deletions.For very rare diseases, it could also be that there aren’t enough other people with the same sorts of mutation for it to be detected.With the power that sequencing brings, there is also risk. Genome sequencing carries the potential for detecting genetic variants unrelated to the condition being investigated – but which could have serious health consequences nonetheless. Some people might want to know if they have a high risk of developing a\u0026nbspserious illness down the line – particularly if there’s a\u0026nbspchance of reducing the risk – but others would prefer not to know. The DDD project made a conscious decision not to report such “secondary findings”.The 100,000 Genomes Project, however, offers its participants the option of finding out if they carry genetic variants that strongly predispose them to high cholesterol or certain cancers – such as breast and ovarian cancer, which are linked to variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes – or that might cause cystic fibrosis in future offspring.The 100,000 Genomes Project makes a clear distinction between gene variants that you can take action on (such as BRCA, where you can have enhanced screening or prophylactic surgery if you carry a high-risk variant) and those that you can’t. For instance, some variants of the ApoE gene strongly predispose the development of Alzheimer’s disease in later life, but knowing you carry this variant doesn’t enable you to prevent the condition.In the US, however, many more potentially life-changing results are reported. In 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics published a\u0026nbspminimum list of genes that it recommended should be communicated as secondary findings during clinical genome sequencing, which it has since updated to include 59 medically actionable genes.If you’re a parent seeking answers about your child’s rare condition, you may feel that the benefits of a diagnosis outweigh the downsides of finding out this additional information. Increasingly, genome sequencing is being offered to babies in neonatal intensive care units, meaning the age at which children are being diagnosed with rare diseases such as Pura syndrome is becoming lower. This may be helpful, as it cuts out those years of uncertainty and enables therapeutic action to be taken in some cases. Even in conditions such as Pura syndrome, where there is no therapy, the fact that there are other people from whom parents can learn about their child’s condition, and how to navigate some of problems it creates, is a huge comfort.“Even for genes we discovered just a few years ago like Pura, we’ve now got profiles of what the typical milestones look like for children,” says Firth. “We’ve got leaflets written with the help of the support groups that we can share with families.”Yet for Pura syndrome, there are many more questions that need answering. For one thing, why are the symptoms so variable between different iniduals? “We even have 12 patients now with the very same mutation in the very same position and they have very different symptoms,” Niessing says.For Alison Walker, the biggest question is what the future holds for her daughter. So far, only a handful of adults have been diagnosed with Pura syndrome, but it’s unclear whether this is because children with the condition don’t tend to survive to adulthood or because few adults have yet been tested for it.At the 2016 conference, Walker met a family whose daughter is younger than Evie, but up and walking, providing a glimpse of what Evie might be able to achieve with the right support.Mel Anderson and Alison Walker both hope that continuing to share information between families and increasing research into Pura syndrome will help find a treatment that will benefit their daughters. To date, some 250 people across the world have been identified with the condition, a disease that didn’t officially exist four years ago. With every new case, knowledge about it – and hope for the future – grows.This is an edited version of an article first published by Wellcome on Mosaic, and republished here under a Creative Commons licence.

At the same time, efforts are under way to eliminate tampon tax and taboos around menstruationFrom the time we’re old enough to get our periods, girls can be made to feel ashamed of them. Everyone who sat in a classroom through those strange, secretive years will remember the absolute horror and dread of being caught short or having to ask a teacher for menstrual products. We learn not only to come prepared but to be silent about what’s going on too. It’s second nature for us to conceal the very fact that we have periods at all – hiding tampons and pads on the way to the bathroom, stuffed into pencil cases, bras, sleeves.If it was difficult for those of us fortunate enough to always have these products to hand, it’s shocking to consider the girls among us who are forced by poverty to go without them entirely. Several years ago the concept of period poverty began to rise in public consciousness in the UK. The Ken Loach film I, Daniel Blake, a harrowing account of the realities of poverty in modern Britain, sent awareness of this particular struggle soaring. After its release, food bank managers around England reported that a scene in which a young woman named Katie is forced to shoplift pads sent toiletry donations skyrocketing.Of course, the problem isn’t confined to menstruation when an inidual or a family is living in poverty, it can mean they are forced to choose between eating enough or keeping the lights on and buying all sorts of hygiene essentials. A report by In Kind Direct – an organisation that receives donations from consumer goods companies and distributes them to charities – lists toothpaste, nappies, tampons, razors, deodorant and shampoo as items that had to be foregone by people living in poverty. It is vital that all of these essentials make their way to donation banks. But perhaps one reason that period poverty has especially caught public attention in the past two years is the particular problem of teenage girls, already at economic and social disadvantage, missing out on their education needlessly.Amika George, the teenage campaigner who started the #FreePeriods campaign, became engaged with the issue when she read an article about schoolgirls in Leeds who had been truant on the days of their periods. Concerned teachers had contacted Freedom4Girls, a charity established to provide sanitary products to Kenyan girls and women. Shocked that in modern Britain there were girls forced to choose between missing school and using unsafe alternatives such as socks, toilet paper and rags, George set to work.“I started a petition to call on the government to provide free menstrual products to girls from low-income families, and decided to spread the word and talk unashamedly, not just about period poverty but about menstruation!” she said in an interview with Vogue last year. More shocking to George, and many others, than the problem itself was the fact that nothing was being done about it by the government. Indeed, the fact that sanitary products are taxed as a luxury product means their prices are kept even higher than necessary, blocking more girls from accessing them.At the same time, girlguiding became much more menstruation-positive, with the introduction of a period poverty badge. Guides will be encouraged to discuss this as a social issue, support fundraising for donations, and explore how they feel personally about periods. An activity-led programme of education includes items such as role play of a scenario in which you’ve had a period leak while not at home. Doireann Larkin, the development manager of Tender, a charity that uses drama and the arts to help young people understand healthy relationships, fully supports the initiative: “We need to provide every opportunity for girls to feel confident and secure in school. By failing to address period poverty, we’re denying some girls the chance to focus and participate fully in class and increasing the disadvantage they might already be facing.”Guides will be able to get badges that are decorated with pictures of tampons, pads and menstrual cups, a fact that seems especially encouraging given how previous generations have been taught to hide such images. It’s a strange fact that, until recently, advertising for menstruation products would rarely show the actual product, using isolated fabric samples instead.The Homeless Period Project (HPP) addresses those already at their most vulnerable. While we may understand how desperate a homeless woman’s situation is, we rarely consider the logistical nightmare of menstruating without shelter and access to products. Local chapters of HPP set up their own fundraisers to donate to local shelters.These frontline activists and organisations are crucial. But so too is dismantling the taboo that exists behind all the secrecy and shame. We have to move on from the medieval idea that periods are dirty or not to be spoken of. That’s why young campaigners such as Grace F Victory are so important – she recently collaborated with the Always #EndPeriodPoverty campaign, which has seen the brand donate more than 5m pads directly to schools, a figure that’s estimated to rise to more than 10m donations by the end of the year. After her Instagram post of herself with a menstrual leak lost her hundreds of followers, she spoke out against them. Embarrassment is bad enough in and of itself, but when an inevitable bit of our biology causes us to miss out on daily life, there’s even more need to overcome it. We simply can’t accept that vulnerable young women are being blocked from their education.This is why ending period poverty needs to include taboo busting at its core. We can’t offer help to people too ashamed to ask for it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c76f468b90ff1a826fabf6f26807e59eff7feaa/1833_0_2464_1478/master/2464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a9555ace86b5ed7ae622010c22ced05","title":"brexit statement only shows theresa may has lost all self respect","story":"Nothing had changed, it was all the EU’s fault and she wanted respect. Has she any for herself?Was this the moment Theresa May finally lost all touch with reality? The day the Maybot’s circuits overloaded and reverted to their factory settings. The day when history was rewritten in such a way as to make it virtually unrecognisable.Shortly after midday rumours started to circulate that the prime minister was going to make a statement at 1.45pm. An important one. A lectern and flags job. The sense of panic was palpable. And not just inside No 10. Everyone felt it. The combination of the prime minister, a lectern and an unscheduled statement usually signifies turmoil for the country and disaster for her. A general election? A resignation? A visitation from Bono? Anything was possible.As it happened we nearly didn’t get any statement at all. The power had gone down inside No 10 and there was no live news feed. Sometimes the metaphors write themselves. But when she did eventually appear, 20 minutes later than planned, we were treated to the bizarre sight of May barricading herself inside No 10 with a solitary BBC cameraman – she clearly didn’t trust either the lectern not to blow over in the wind or the assembled hacks outside not to ask awkward questions at the end – to announce that what she had said on Thursday in her press conference (which went disastrously and ended in humiliation) was what she had actually meant to say all along.May, who has turned exercises in futility into an artform during her time in office, excelled herself this time. Nothing had changed from yesterday, when nothing had changed from the day before. Except this time she wanted to appear determined and steely instead of sweaty and terrified. She had looked into the abyss of her own career and decided that if she was going down then she would do her best to take her party and the country with her.The Salzburg summit hadn’t gone very well, she began. Nothing like a statement of the obvious to get things rolling. But now she wanted to make some things very clear to the EU. Cue her best death stare. The one she usually reserves for Boris Johnson. What she was clear about was that the Chequers plan – rubbished by many Tories, dismissed by the EU leaders and without a prayer of getting through parliament – was still the plan she intended to get through parliament and get the EU to accept.As a denial of reality it was already a bravura performance, but within minutes things had lurched into another space-time continuum. One that even Stephen Hawking could never have imagined. Everything was basically the EU’s fault. It was the EU that had forced the UK into leaving the EU. It was the EU that was making the UK confront the possibility of a hard Irish border because the UK had voted to leave. She had fallen over backwards to come up with a sensible solution and the EU had come up with none of their own. Other than, of course, to make it clear right from the start that the Canada and Norway models were the only options available and there could be no cherrypicking. Madness.“I’ve never treated the EU with anything other than respect,” she said, her bottom lip quivering with what she hoped was righteous indignation. And she wanted some respect back. She had a point. She could have handled things better – face it, almost anyone could – but the EU could also have been slightly less charmless. But then they were probably only following the example of Boris and the other Brexiters who make a point of disrespecting May on an almost daily basis. Maybe Donald Tusk and Emmanuel Macron had got the impression she liked being treated that way.May appears now as a woman with almost no respect for herself. Otherwise she would have long since walked away from a job she clearly does not like and a Brexit in which she does not believe. She knows she is compromised and she hates herself for it. It shows in every gurn, in every awkward hand gesture.With a quick 180-degree turn, she left the room. A statement that had been meant to make her appear resolute had only highlighted her weakness. An exercise in damage limitation – to wash away the sins of Salzburg – that had always been doomed to failure. When you don’t having anything to say, it’s usually best to say nothing. But May just couldn’t stop herself from carrying on digging."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7ef739b6774f195bdc7c95af7a56bebba7762c9/7_0_1167_700/master/1167.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4df7227ce8218f8f51f310de83d6377b","title":"european press no more forgiving than british over salzburg summit theresa may","story":"If she was hoping for a small crumb of comfort after what the vast majority of the British media saw as a “humiliating” and “disastrous” Salzburg summit, Theresa May did not find it in the pages of the European press.Coverage of the meeting, at which May was bluntly informed that the core components of her Chequers plan “will not work”, was generally focused as much, if not more, on the EU’s disagreements over migration policy as it was on Brexit.But the conclusion of the continental media, few of which made events in Salzburg their top story, was that the prime minister’s predicament was wholly predictable – the EU’s view of Chequers has been known since it was published, many pointed out – and entirely her problem. Commentators were downright scathing.Sheila Sitalsing in the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant said May had “stormed the European continent like a Don Quixote”, Chequers plan and Brexit conditions under her arm: Britain wanted to “keep playing footie and snacking at the canteen, without paying any subs, wearing the club strip or doing bar duty”.The EU27 had “sent her packing in Salzburg”, Sitalsing said, where May had “desperately sought to win sympathy for a Brexit that would not send her population straight back to the Middle Ages”.Her threat that if she was replaced things might get worse “did not impress” EU leaders – but May still seems to believe their hard line “is just a negotiating tactic”. She has got it all wrong: “Poor Theresa May. Poor United Kingdom.”In the Spanish paper El Pais, Álvaro Imbernon Sainz said that since May took office in July 2016, her entire negotiating strategy had been “to postpone decision-making as much as possible, without putting together any kind of clear vision” – but the chickens were now coming home to roost.“The problem is that the differences between the two sides are not technical, but on fundamental principles, and time is beginning to run out,” he said. “Like a bad student who puts off the moment to sit down and study, it’s now up to the UK to make up for lost time.”Britain must “rediscover British pragmatism. For this, the Conservatives, and to a lesser extent Labour, must agree on a coherent and realistic position. Otherwise the historians of the future will be extremely hard on the current British political class”.In France, Le Figaro said May had been “caught in the trap of her ‘it’s me or chaos’” strategy. The prime minister’s Brexit plan was “dead and buried”, the paper said, after she “put her allies up against the wall” by insisting a no deal was the only alternative. “Unfortunately, her plan has met unanimous opposition.”For Le Monde, the EU27 had made plain that “the moment of truth” had come. The bloc’s leaders were “clearly singing from the same hymn sheet” and used the summit to sound the alarm, the paper said: “Brexit talks are in the closing straight – and the EU27 have, for the moment, no intention whatever of softening their stance.”The meeting was above all aimed at “putting maximum pressure on the British prime minister a few days ahead of her party’s annual conference”, it said, adding that the October final deadline set by Donald Tusk, the European council president, for progress on the Irish border was clearly significant.The paper quoted the French president, Emmanuel Macron, saying he had “perfectly summed up” the Europeans’ position on Brexit: Chequers “is not acceptable because it does not respect the integrity of the single market … Leaving the EU cannot be done without costs or consequences.”Tusk “flatly rejected Britain’s plan for future EU-UK trade relations”, wrote Germany’s Die Welt, adding that the EU27 had “categorically thrown out” May’s Chequers plan quite simply “because it fears it would lead to unfair competition from British firms”. Brexit talks, the paper said, “are deadlocked”.The Frankfurter Algemeine Zeitung took the same line, quoting Tusk as saying “May’s Brexit plan will not work” and that negotiations were now at a standstill after “both sides camped firmly on their positions and no agreement was reached”.The Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad said the EU 27 had “approached the British prime minister positively, but given little away”. Britain had “high hopes” of the summit, it said, but “the harvest was meagre”.The EU was walking a tightrope, the paper said: it had to be reasonably positive towards May while not budging, because: “British political drama is the greatest uncertainty around Brexit, and the horror scenario is that whatever is agreed with May proves worthless if she is replaced.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f7d29d97465ec6daefb29509f4a188df6e88ff8/0_30_1728_1037/master/1728.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9927fd78636eac098bf68b764ff0206","title":"former tory mep leader criticises partys stance on supporting hungary","story":"Conservatives voted against EU sanctions process to protect democracy in HungaryA former Conservative MEP leader has condemned the party’s decision to vote with Viktor Orbán in opposing a European Union sanctions process to protect democracy in Hungary, amid growing criticism of the Tory party’s drift to the right.Edward McMillan-Scott was leader of Conservative MEPs between 1997 and 2001, but clashed with David Cameron over the decision to withdraw from the centre-right European People’s party in 2009. A former European parliament vice-president, he eventually became a Liberal Democrat and argues the Conservative party has moved away from its moderate tradition.“This is no longer the Conservative party that I belonged to for 25 years,” he told the . “I was leader of the Tory MEPs for four of those years and tried to fight the hard-right from within. But they are now dominant.”He said the party was “colluding” with nationalist governments in Poland and Hungary, a decision he traced back to Cameron’s decision to quit the EPP and launch a new Conservative group in the European parliament with controversial allies. “The Tory party, to its shame, has propitiated right from the outset what is the alt-right movement in Europe.”Conservative sources dismissed McMillan-Scott, who lost the party whip, but similar concerns have been made by Tory moderates.Julie Girling, an MEP who is suspended from the party over Brexit, said some “sensible people” voted against action on Hungary, because they followed the whips without questioning.The MEP for the South West of England and Gibraltar, who now sits in the EPP, voted in favour of starting the sanctions procedure.“The whole hard right of the party has basically seized the agenda,” she said. “In order to be a member of the Brexit club you have to subscribe to all of this hardline rhetoric and to me personally it is not possible to do so … There is no room for discussion any more either you are with us, or you are our enemy.”The debate blew up earlier this month when Conservative MEPs voted with Orbán’s Fidesz party against triggering a disciplinary procedure aimed at protecting the rule of law in Hungary. Despite opposition, the vote was carried with a narrow majority, although it is unlikely Hungary will ever face the ultimate sanction, losing EU voting rights.The Tories have also come under fire for protecting Poland’s Law and Justice (PiS) party, the governing party, also their European parliament allies.Poland is subject to the EU’s disciplinary procedure, over sweeping changes to the court system that has given the government de-facto control of the judiciary.At a meeting of EU affairs ministers last Tuesday, France and Germany made a joint statement in protest at the judicial changes, saying Europe needed to stand up for “common values” ahead of European elections in May 2019. Represented by the Brexit minister and former MEP who helped create the Tory-PiS alliance, Lord Callanan, the UK was silent in the debate. “The internal affairs of Poland are a matter for them,” Callanan said.Conservative insiders are fed up with the deluge of criticism, insisting others have got it wrong, by handing Orbán an easy win that feeds his nationalist narrative. MEPs have overstepped their powers, the MEP Daniel Dalton has said. “Contrary to what our political opponents and some in the media are trying to portray, this in no way signalled approval or support for any of the policies of the Hungarian government.”“This is not a drift to the right,” said one Conservative source. “It is nothing to do with the direction of the Conservative party. It is solely to do with the best way to tackle Viktor Orbán.”Ashley Fox, the leader of Britain’s Conservative MEPs, frames the Polish and Hungarian questions as matters of national sovereignty. “How many warnings does the EU’s detached elite need about imposing its views and values on countries with varying cultures, histories and attitudes? Has nothing been learned from Brexit?”he wrote on Conservative Home earlier this year.But the argument has dismayed MEPs from other parties. “There is no way they would allow silencing of independent media in their own country and it surprises me and disappoints me that they are willing to overlook that in a country like Hungary,” said Judith Sargentini, the Dutch MEP who drafted the report calling for the EU to launch the disciplinary process. “It is simply about Brexit. It is simply about Theresa May needing all the support she can get.”Sophie in ‘t Veld, a vice-president of the Liberals in the European parliament, told the  in July that Conservative MEPs had trampled on their legacy. Speaking on Friday, she said the Conservative stance on Hungary and Poland was part of a wider pattern seen across European Christian Democrat parties and the US Republicans.The policy of non-interference may have boosted Theresa May’s support on Brexit from Poland and Hungary. But the two countries have minor influence among the EU 27, while EU membership underpins their economies.“The Polish government is so isolated,” in ‘t Veld said. “If the price would be to break up the internal market, then I think the Polish government is going to stick with the EU27 line.”At the EU summit in Salzburg, Orbán kissed May’s hand and said he was opposed to “punishing the British”, but did not speak up for the British prime minister during the EU27 Brexit debate.“He is many things,” in ‘t Veld said, “but he is not stupid.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e7b1c630b893a1f544ffd0daaa54ee4ddd4b9b4/0_77_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=044473389bc76ff0448bb7c26968136b","title":"theresa may demands respect from eu in brexit negotiations","story":"PM gives combative speech after rejection of Chequers plan, stoking ‘no deal’ fearsTheresa May has accused the European Union of not treating the UK with respect in a deliberately combative address that prompted a sharp fall in the pound amid fears that it made a no deal Brexit more likely.Twenty-four hours after her Salzburg humiliation, the prime minister gave a hastily arranged televised Downing Street statement in an effort to reassert herself.Speaking from a lectern with two union flags behind her, May tried to accuse her counterparts of bad faith: “I have treated the EU with nothing but respect. The UK expects the same. A good relationship at the end of this process depends on it.”Her remarks came a day after the Salzburg summit where EU leaders frustrated by May’s insistence on sticking rigidly to her controversial Chequers negotiating plan embarrassed her when EU council president Donald Tusk unexpectedly declared it “would not work”.May retaliated on Friday, and said: “Yesterday Donald Tusk said our proposals would undermine the single market. He didn’t explain how in any detail or make any counter-proposal. So we are at an impasse.” She called on the EU to spell out “what their alternative is”.But Tusk, the European council president, hit back hard at the prime minister accusing her of bringing a “surprisingly tough and in fact uncompromising” attitude to the Salzburg summit. He denied May’s claims that the EU had failed to explain its position to the British negotiators, claiming to have spelled out the problems in detail in recent weeks, although he insisted that “a compromise, good for all, is still possible”.Despite the heated rhetoric and plunge in sterling, EU officials are understood to be working on a counter-proposal to Chequers, which is likely to appear in early October, after the Conservative party conference and a week before a make or break Brexit summit in Brussels.No 10 is calculating May can win support by appearing to stand up to the EU, although her critics in the party believe this would be the moment to give up the Chequers plan, or risk facing hostile activists at the party’s annual conference in just over a week.Several cabinet ministers put out statements of support. Penny Mourdant, the international development secretary, again emphasised the possibility of a no deal, saying that while voters “still want a deal” they would be “content to go without one, even folk who voted remain”.But Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair of the European Reform Group of hard Brexit Tories, said that Salzburg was a failure and repeated that it was time to abandon Chequers. “There is still no reason to suppose that Chequers can work either for the UK or the EU”.Chequers proposes that the UK shares a common rulebook for goods and services after Brexit in an attempt to prevent a return of customs checks for goods crossing the Irish border, a plan so unpopular on the right of the Tory party that Boris Johnson and David Davies resigned rather than support it.That would imply the UK would have to align itself more broadly to EU rules after Brexit to avoid a return to a hard border in Ireland, a proposal that could be difficult for May to sell to her party.Hard Brexiters will step up their campaign against Chequers in the run up to the Tory party conference on Monday. David Davis and other senior right-wing politicians are expected to attend an event at which alternative “Canada plus” trade proposals will be announced.The EU, however, has said that while it would be prepared to discuss a Canada-style deal, that would mean not just taking the UK out of the single market and customs union, it would also mean the return of border controls in Ireland.The prime minister also signalled that the UK would unilaterally safeguard the rights of the EU citizens living in the country in an attempt to reassure them that the impasse in negotiations would not affect their status.“There are over 3 million EU citizens living in the UK who will be understandably worried about what the outcome of yesterday’s summit means for their future. I want to be clear with you that even in the event of no deal your rights will be protected. You are our friends, our neighbours, our colleagues. We want you to stay,” May said.Ministers are expected to confirm details in a couple of weeks, after the party conference season.The prime minister repeatedly rejected an EU backstop proposal that would see Northern Ireland remain inside the customs union if the UK was unable to agree a free trade agreement with Brussels in the orce talks.Ratcheting up the language on the issue, May said: “It is something I will never agree to – indeed, in my judgment it is something no British prime minister would ever agree to. If the EU believe I will, they are making a fundamental mistake.”In a rare direct criticism of a serving prime minister, Tusk made reference to the criticisms of Michel Barnier by the British government, and the refusal of the British side to work on a solution to the Irish border issue by October, as previously promised.“The UK stance presented just before and during the Salzburg meeting was surprisingly tough and in fact uncompromising”, he said. “The response of the EU27 leaders was to reiterate our trust in chief negotiator Michel Barnier and to reiterate our position on the integrity of the single market and the Irish backstop.But he added: “While understanding the logic of the negotiations, I remain convinced that a compromise, good for all, is still possible. I say these words as a close friend of the UK and a true admirer of PM May.”In a statement, Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, criticised both the prime minister and the European Union: “Theresa May’s Brexit negotiating strategy has been a disaster. The Tories have spent more time arguing among themselves than negotiating with the EU.“From day one, the prime minister has looked incapable of delivering a good Brexit deal for Britain. The political games from both the EU and our government need to end because no deal is not an option.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/5/1399294269797/Libby-Brooks.jpg?width=140\u0026amp;height=140\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c24da21f9bbc736be7bad58838a7214d\" alt=\"Libby Brooks","title":"theresa may makes statement outside no 10","story":"Prime minister says UK needs to hear from EU on what real alternatives areThat’s all from the blog today, thanks so much for your comments. You can read the full story here:Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon has described May’s statement as “dreadful” and her tactics “hugely damaging”.“The Prime Minister’s statement was dreadful. The EU’s view of the Chequers plan was bluntly and clearly expressed in Salzburg yesterday, but should not have come as a surprise to the UK Government, given that it was not a new position.“Clearly, the Prime Minister has not been listening – Chequers is a dead duck but if her tactic now is to try and double down on those proposals and then seek to blame the EU for a no-deal outcome, then she will do huge damage to all of those she is supposed to serve.“It would be an abdication of responsibility of huge and historic proportions and an approach for which Theresa May and the Tory party would pay a very heavy political price, especially in Scotland, which overwhelmingly rejected Brexit and whose interests in this process have been ignored at every turn by the UK Government.“What the latest development shows more clearly than ever is that the only remotely workable way for Brexit to happen is for the UK to stay in the single market and customs union. If the Prime Minister is not prepared to do that, then Brexit shouldn’t happen. A ‘No deal’ or ‘no detail‘ Brexit are simply not acceptable – particularly for Scotland, where we did not vote for any of this.”Yesterday, Sturgeon wrote to the leaders of the UK’s opposition parties asking them to join her in pressing for an extension to next March’s deadline for leaving the EU to avoid “an economic cliff edge”.Cabinet ministers have been responding on Twitter, including some warning the EU in stronger terms.The Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who has been an advocate for a soft Brexit, said she has spoken to May this afternoon and been reassured of her commitment to get a negotiated deal.Business leaders have reacted with some alarm to the comments by the prime minister on the distance between the two sides.CBI director Carolyn Fairbairn said negotiators on both sides must change tack. “Rejection of Chequers helps nobody,” she said. “Pragmatism must come before politics. Every day lost in rhetoric is lost investment and lost jobs.”Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), also reproached both sides for the impasse. “While the Prime Minister’s determination to reach a deal is appreciated, businesses tell us over and over that the time for posturing from both sides is over,” he said. “Many firms are hugely worried about a messy and disorderly outcome, and the potential impact on their ability to trade and grow. Others could be caught flat-footed. Both sides must make every effort to avoid this scenario.”Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair of the European Reform Group of hard Brexit Tories, said the summit was a “failure” and that the EU was not acting in good faith. However, he praised the prime minister, saying she had showed “steely resolve.”He said it was time to admit the Chequers plan would not work for both the EU and the UK and start making plans for a Canada-style free trade deal. May made it clear in her speech that the EU has said it cannot countenance such a deal without Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union to prevent customs checks on the border.“It is time for the government to start putting forward as its plan a Canada-style free trade agreement for the whole of the UK. This is the most realistic approach and similar to the EU’s proposal,” he said. “Moreover, as every vote in parliament has so far shown, it is the one way which could command a majority in the House of Commons.“On the matter of the UK’s border with Ireland, the EU can have the solutions proposed by the ERG that respect the integrity of the Single Market and which have been supported by the DUP,” he said.“The Prime Minister has shown steely resolve at the eleventh hour and is standing up to the EU bullies. The next step is to say to the EU £40 billion and free trade or World Trade terms.”The pound is on course for its biggest one-day drop in 2018 against the dollar, after Theresa May said Brexit negotiations with the EU had reached an “impasse”.Traders took fright as May’s comments were taken as a sign that a no deal Brexit is an increasingly likely outcome of talks, creating uncertainty which unsettles traders.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said that “no deal is not an option” and slammed the government’s negotiating tactics. However, his response does not include a demand that May drop her current plans and, interestingly, also calls on the EU to end the “political games.”Theresa May’s Brexit negotiating strategy has been a disaster. The Tories have spent more time arguing among themselves than negotiating with the EU.From day one, the Prime Minister has looked incapable of delivering a good Brexit deal for Britain. The political games from both the EU and our Government need to end because no deal is not an option.EU sources were relaxed about May’s speech. They see it as as a “positioning” ahead of the Tory party conference after what they see as a self-inflicted wound in Salzburg.May’s demands that the EU come up with alternative proposals are seen as domestic politicking as the EU’s position in Brexit has been clear from the outset.While May’s failure to come with a proposal on the Irish border nine months after agreeing to one incensed EU leaders, it is said that it was Downing Street’s briefing to British journalists that some member states were being more sympathetic to the UK than others that prompted Macron to intervene. Nigel Dodds, deputy leader of the DUP who back up May’s minority government, said there was “utter inflexibility and bullying tactics” from the EU. He said the EU was not negotiating in good faith or within the parameters of the Belfast agreement. “It seems to be their way or no way,” he told the BBC. He said there would be no regulatory barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK that the DUP could accept.Dodds said the issue of Northern Ireland had been “abused” by remainers and EU leaders. “The border issue has been elevated to a far greater extent than it should,” he said. The Lib Dems are the first out of the traps to comment on the prime minister’s statement. The party’s Brexit spokesman Tom Brake says May should recall parliament, an idea unlikely to be popular with Labour who have their party conference next week.Two years down the line and the only consensus the PM has made across Parliament and the EU is that Chequers is unworkable,” he said. Instead of pontificating to television cameras, May must now recall Parliament to explain how she got the country into this terrible mess, what her plan is to get us out of it, and when we can have a people’s vote and an exit from Brexit.Here’s some more of the reaction:From the New Statesman’s Stephen BushFrom the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg:From the ’s Jennifer Rankin:From the WSJ’s Bojan Pancevski:Here are some of the key quotes from May’s statement in Downing Street. On the progress of the negotiations:I have always said that these negotiations would be tough - and they were always bound to be toughest in the final straight. While both sides want a deal, we have to face up to the fact that - despite the progress we have made - there are two big issues where we remain a long way apart. In plain English, this would mean we’d still have to abide by all the EU rules, uncontrolled immigration from the EU would continue and we couldn’t do the trade deals we want with other countries. That would make a mockery of the referendum we had two years ago. On a Canada-style free trade deal and a customs border down the Irish Sea: It is something I will never agree to - indeed, in my judgement it is something no British Prime Minister would ever agree to. If the EU believe I will, they are making a fundamental mistake.On the Irish backstop:The EU is proposing to achieve this by effectively keeping Northern Ireland in the Customs Union. As I have already said, that is unacceptable. We will never agree to it. It would mean breaking up our country. We will set out our alternative that preserves the integrity of the UK. On red lines in the negotiations:As I told EU leaders, neither side should demand the unacceptable of the other. We cannot accept anything that threatens the integrity of our union, just as they cannot accept anything that threatens the integrity of theirs. We cannot accept anything that does not respect the result of the referendum, just as they cannot accept anything that is not in the interest of their citizens.On her treatment in SalzburgThroughout this process, I have treated the EU with nothing but respect. The UK expects the same. A good relationship at the end of this process depends on it.At this late stage in the negotiations, it is not acceptable to simply reject the other side’s proposals without a detailed explanation and counter proposals.On the referendum result: The referendum was the largest democratic exercise this country has ever undergone. To deny its legitimacy or frustrate its result threatens public trust in our democracy. That is why for over two years I have worked day and night to deliver a deal that sees the UK leave the EU. I have worked to bring people with me even when that has not always seemed possible.On the prospect of no deal:No one wants a good deal more than me. But the EU should be clear: I will not overturn the result of the referendum. Nor will I break up my country. We need serious engagement on resolving the two big problems in the negotiations. We stand ready.

It has now confirmed it is conducting an internal review of its data-sharing policies relating to non-UK nationals over a period of several years.In response to a complaint from the Public Interest Law Unit (PILU) about St Mungo’s dealings with migrant rough sleepers, the Information Commissioner’s Office said: “It appears likely that St Mungo’s passed locations of rough sleepers to the Home Office.” It added: “It appears feasible that the personal data of rough sleepers may have been passed from St Mungo’s outreach teams to the Home Office without the consent of the iniduals concerned.”It cited undated internal guidance from St Mungo’s that stated there were times when there was a public interest defence to sharing information about inidual migrant rough sleepers with outside agencies without their consent.St Mungo’s has previously acknowledged passing on details but said it did so when people wished to return home. In a statement, the charity said it was finalising an internal review of the practices.The charity’s website says of its policy when working with rough sleepers: “We gradually build up trusting relationships, working with people to offer them routes out of homelessness and towards recovery … Where appropriate, we assist people with reconnection – helping them to return to their home towns in the UK and abroad.”The investigation by the information commissioner focused on the period before 14 December 2017. On that date the Home Office policy on migrant rough sleepers was halted after the high court ruled it to be unlawful and discriminatory.The government is to pay hundreds of thousands of pounds in compensation to some of those identified during such patrols as a result of the court ruling. In the year to May 2017, 698 homeless EU nationals were targeted and removed from the UK.The complaint from the PILU to the information commissioner focused on how St Mungo’s handled private and sensitive data about its migrant rough sleeper clients and the impact of the charity’s role on the unlawful arrest, detention and removal of some of these rough sleepers by the Home Office.A PILU spokesman said: “The information commissioner’s report is significant. It confirms the sharing of data between St Mungo’s and the Home Office immigration enforcement teams, something that St Mungo’s has vehemently denied. There is an ethical question about whether St Mungo’s compromised their independence as a charity and undermined their reputation.”The information commissioner found that because St Mungo’s cited a public interest defence there was no breach of data protection rules.The charity’s policies changed after the December 2017 court ruling and the information commissioner said St Mungo’s “current information rights practices do not raise any concerns with us”.A St Mungo’s spokesperson said: “We are pleased that the ICO has concluded that the current information rights practice of St Mungo’s does not raise any concerns with them. To reiterate, our policy is that we do not share information about iniduals with the Home Office, except when an inidual has given their consent, or in situations where people are at significant risk to themselves or someone else.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1c432c66809c284fdcbe1ee17fe65ec68184665/125_545_4071_2443/master/4071.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1befdb9d4fe1885ce2f3d68f2e37cb9","title":"anthony joshua alexander povetkin boxing wembley","story":"A lot of casual fans want to see Anthony Joshua banging people out in a couple of rounds but an opponent who is more resistant has to be broken down first. Joshua is smart. He knows that. And given he has a four-inch height and seven-inch reach advantage over Alexander Povetkin I expect him to start on the outside, dominating with his jab and gradually wearing down Povetkin, much like Wladimir Klitschko did during his wide points victory over the Russian in 2013.I wasn’t impressed with Povetkin’s last performance against David Price, even though he finished it with a peach of a knockout, because the Russian was in serious trouble at the end of the third. Price is a big puncher but he’s not the fastest – whereas Joshua is more explosive and can bang even harder. I would give it two or three rounds to see what Povetkin has got and then start throwing a couple of power shots behind the jab to test his chin. And as soon as you get him going – finish him.I struggle to see how Povetkin can win this. I’m not doubting his pedigree – like Joshua he is an Olympic super-heavyweight champion – and puts his shots together nicely. Having been brought up in the Russian system he is also correct in what he does, although that makes him easier to read. His best hope is to weather the early storm by keeping his defence tight and as Joshua fades get in close with his big hooks and uppercuts. It’s not an impossible scenario but I can’t see it happening.Joshua’s last performance against Joseph Parker was criticised because there was no knockout but I saw it differently. Don’t forget Parker was unbeaten and had never been put down – yet Joshua’s trainer, Robert McCracken, devised a gameplan that gave his man an easy night. Meanwhile Dillian Whyte only just clung on to beat Parker. There will be pressure on Joshua to get the knockout with 80,000 in Wembley baying for blood but there is no need to take risks. The knockout will come.Some people think Joshua has stamina issues – he looked desperately tired against Klitschko and Carlos Takam. But a good young one will always beat a good older one and at 39, time is not on Povetkin’s side. He has also shown chinks in his armour, especially against Price. While the Russian will be competitive for three rounds, I expect him to be gassing by rounds five or six. Which is when I expect Joshua to get him out of there.Dominic Ingle is the trainer of the WBO world middleweight champion Billy Joe SaundersStrengths: Joshua is the epitome of a modern heavyweight - 6ft 6in tall, strong and explosive, and with tremendous power in both hands. Twenty knockouts in his 21-0 record tells its own story and, at 28, he is still improving.Weaknesses: There are some question marks over his stamina. But while he looked out on his feet against Wladimir Klitschko he was able to get a second wind to win in the 11th round, and also overcome a flat spot against Carlos Takam to win late.Last fight: A wide - if not wildly exciting - points victory over the New Zealander boxer Joseph Parker in April. However Joshua showed improved defence and was rarely troubled in winning his 21st professional fight. Outside interests: Joshua says that if he wasn’t a fighter he would be a businessman, and he already owns four companies under the AJBXNG banner. Also enjoys travelling when he is not training. Strengths: The Russian has an impressive pedigree, having won the 2004 Olympic super-heavyweight title. He also has a good jab, effective combinations and significant power. Only one defeat on his record - to Wladimir Klitschko in 2013.Weaknesses: At 6ft 2in he is small for a modern heavyweight and at 39 his best days are surely behind him. Looked to breathing heavily after three rounds in his last fight before overcoming David Price.Last fight: A fifth-round knockout of Price on the Joshua-Parker undercard. However Povetkin was buzzed in the first round, and sent onto the ropes in the third, before a thunderous hook brought him victory.Outside interests: A self-confessed adrenaline junkie, who enjoys parachute jumps from planes and helicopters. However he has given up riding motorbikes because it is too dangerous.

Burns, who has passed 1,000 first-class runs for the fifth season running and led Surrey to the title this year, owes his call to that weight of runs.Asked about the 28-year-old left-hander, Smith said: “Burns has impressed with his consistency. I don’t get hung up on the next Alastair Cook narrative. That’s not how you select. If he was right-handed and slogged sixes – and that was the best thing to do – we’d do that. There will be a new look at the top, inevitably, and one of the candidates is Burns.”Denly, a right-hander who played nine ODIs for England as an opener in 2009, has been batting at No 3 for Kent this season. But Smith sees him as another option to open while the 32-year-old’s leg-spin has also matured. He is also the leading cricketer in the cross-format MVP rankings, with the national selector also making a note of his success in the pressured environments of franchise Twenty20.“I played with Joe when he was a very young man,” said Smith. “You could see he was a fantastic natural athlete, a brilliant mover, talented batter, bowled leg-spin, everything came very easily to him. What’s happened to Joe is he’s evolved into this really calm, measured performer but that touch of class is still there. It’s in his DNA.“I think with players who get opportunities late in their careers you just want to know that touch of class is there, and there definitely is with him. So that counts in his favour.”If Denly is a late bloomer, then Jennings is an investment England are unready to give up just yet. The left-hander averaged 19.2 over six Tests this year but Smith pointed to 20 as the mean for openers during the English summer, prior to the Oval. There remains a belief that sunnier times lie ahead for a player who made a century on debut in India in 2016.Smith, who included 20-year-old Ollie Pope as a middle-order reserve, accepted that a reluctance to blood two new openers was “in the mix” regarding the selection of Jennings, but added: “To me what I’m seeing is someone who has the temperament to handle how difficult Test cricket is. He’s batted as well as everyone else opening over the summer.“He has a Test match hundred in Mumbai when the ball spun extravagantly. He can draw on that. He has come through a really tough summer and sometimes in international sport getting through something difficult can put you in good stead.”For Anderson and Broad it was a case of the winter workload being manageable for the senior new-ball pairing but whether both make the starting XI remains to be seen. There has not been a Test draw on Sri Lanka’s turning pitches for four years, with three of every four wickets falling to spinners. England have three full-time options here, to go with Denly and Root’s part-time bowling, in Moeen Ali, Adil Rashid and Jack Leach.It is a surprise there is no fourth spinner, given all three may well play, and instead England have opted to take a plethora of seaming options with Ben Stokes, Sam Curran and Chris Woakes the all-rounders, and Stone’s pace offering a significant point of difference.Ashley Giles, the Warwickshire cricket director, has already warned against overburdening Stone and Smith said: “He has been troubled by injuries, there’s no secret there. We want to catch Olly when he’s at his best, when he’s in form, bowling fast, bowling accurately and with skill, but also to manage his workload so he doesn’t get injured.“In Olly’s case he’s quick and he’s getting his wickets at 12 and his strike rate is 22. It’s a bonus the fact he’s got that pace. He’s not there just because he’s fast. He’s there because he’s doing a really good job and obviously it’s a great asset he has that extra pace as well.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d862b509b7b4132f47816b39f75429235f561f03/309_0_4482_2691/master/4482.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e32567cb27f610b4bfa204c48eb373d","title":"saracens mark mccall high tackle situation","story":"The Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall, has suggested the introduction of a sanction in between yellow and red cards as a possible solution to the debate currently raging over high tackles.Will Spencer’s red card and subsequent four-week ban for a dangerous tackle during Leicester’s defeat by Wasps last Sunday has polarised opinion between those who claim “the game has gone soft” and others who believe the referee Ian Tempest was simply applying the law amid World Rugby’s concerted effort to reduce head injuries.The Leicester interim head coach, Geordan Murphy, has since expressed his regret at claiming the sport has gone “too PC” but does believe the ensuing debate has created a “watershed moment”. One theory gathering momentum is to borrow from Gaelic Football and introduce a black card for the offending player, who is replaced by a substitute – possibly after a 10-minute sin-bin – thereby penalising the inidual but not overtly punishing his team.“It’s complicated because it’s our responsibility as coaches to technically work with our players to minimise the risk of these things happening,” said McCall. “At the same time, these things happen fast, the ball-carrier is carrying the ball at whatever miles per hour, the defender is coming off the line at whatever miles per hour, a slight movement from the ball-carrier can cause what happened and it’s really, really, really fine margins. Especially if you’re tall.“Player welfare is unbelievably important. Whether red cards are the solution I’m not sure. It’s difficult because we don’t want head injuries in the game. I just so often feel that a red card should be really, really obvious to everybody and that’s probably changing at the moment.“I understand all the issues and I don’t have any big solutions other than is there a way of punishing it in a different way that does change the behaviour of that particular player but doesn’t necessarily result in 15 against 14 every match because I don’t think anybody necessarily wants that.”Saracens, whose Premiership and European success in recent years has been based on ferocious defence, conceded a number of penalties for high tackles in their season-opener against Newcastle – Tempest was also the referee that day – and McCall revealed he has implemented tailor-made training drills to encourage his players to tackle lower. “You work on them as technically as you can,” added McCall. “You try to do that in training when they’re as fatigued as possible because that’s sometimes when things can occur.”Meanwhile, Jamie George, the Saracens and England hooker, believes he is at an advantage compared to taller teammates such as Maro Itoje and Will Skelton but acknowledges the tightrope current players are having to walk. “It is very difficult for us,” said George. “I completely agree with looking after the players but there has just got to be a bit more of a feel for it. Sometimes when a ball carrier is going low it is very hard not to make contact above the ball but we have put a big responsibility on extra tackle technique.“You have to wrap the ball, you can’t get away with not. You look at the best teams in the world, the All Blacks, us to a certain extent, Leinster, they have got the best defences and they make the most dominant tackles. We know how important the physicality side of it is. The main thing is we as players, whether we agree or disagree with what is going on, we have to adjust.”On Saturday, Willie le Roux returns from international duty to make his first start for Wasps against Sale while Kyle Sinckler is back for Harlequins’ trip to Bristol. Elsewhere, Dave Attwood and Taulupe Faletau are back to bolster Bath’s pack for the visit of Northampton."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98be0752473136d9448546276faf3077d313750d/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8d3cac69399cd5e56ce80c5067297b8","title":"thomas bjorn europe captain ryder cup interview","story":"From Friday on the outskirts of Paris a golf team united by the flag of Europe, led by a Dane, will take on the might of the United States. When it arrives, the Ryder Cup is the most significant sporting event in the world. This time as Brexit looms and questions regarding what a European identity actually means cast a shadow over society, the broader picture is impossible to ignore.Thomas Bjørn, Europe’s captain, will not go down the predictable route of refusing to link sport and politics. On the contrary Bjørn seems of a mind to make Europe, the existing if fractured concept, a cornerstone of his work.“I think sometimes what is forgotten, in the political discussion, is how great this continent is,” Bjørn says. “From all the way down in Greece, to Iceland, there are so many great countries and so much natural common ground. It is such a small continent compared to the others but together we have so much history and so many great things going for us. I think that is forgotten a little bit in the political picture.“It means a lot more to us as golfers because we grow up with the European Tour. The backbone of that tour is still our European events. It is part of the life we live. It has a meaning.“I think a lot of people in their everyday life have a hard time relating to what Europe is. Something that gets a little bit into people’s minds, in my opinion, is ‘What is Europe?’ and ‘What is the European Union?’ So you have Norway and Switzerland and soon to be the UK as part of Europe but not the EU. For some people that leads to ‘Who is what?’ and ‘What is what?’“The identity of Europe in the Ryder Cup comes from the team how they see themselves, through different countries, as Europe coming together. That, for me, is a thing the Ryder Cup does so well. It brings us together. You adapt an approach towards Europe, which you know is an essential part of what you do. When you get in that team room you are in it for yourself, your country and your continent.”Bjørn speaks from a position of authority. He is the embodiment of the European Tour, a domain he has featured in more than 500 times as a player. When growing up in Silkeborg, a small town in eastern Jutland, he had to battle a mother who was adamant young Thomas would not be a golf professional. “She didn’t think that was a way to make a living. She was clearly against it.”Bjørn removed himself from a rocky relationship with his country’s golf federation to turn professional on his own terms. “If I was going to continue to play golf, I wasn’t going to continue in that environment,” he says. “The sacrifice as a teenager was enormous, to let people dictate how my life was going to look as an amateur golfer.”Bjørn applied the logic of “bleeding hands and hard work.” Now, he is the first Scandinavian to captain Europe. “There was a feeling Denmark had its place in the golfing world, which wasn’t anywhere,” Bjørn says. “That didn’t motivate me, what did was me driving to be as I could be. I hear youngsters now say they want to be Tiger Woods or Rory McIlroy. No you want to be you. Tiger and Rory don’t try to be somebody else.”Bjørn is hugely respected but admits his own nature – complex, with traces of obsession – has rendered elements of captaincy tricky. He has refused not only to consider the likelihood of defeat or victory but what life involves after the show is over.“I wouldn’t like to be the hero if we win,” Bjørn says. “I wouldn’t like to be the villain if we lose. Nobody likes being the villain. As a golfer, I would tell my caddie or my coach ‘This is what I want, this is what we are doing.’ It doesn’t work like that in this role because there are so many little pieces that impact every decision and it has to work for everyone.“I think about the 12 players, dealing with situations that could arise and how I see the week progressing. Through that process, hopefully they play the golf to deliver a result. I trust them with everything I have because I think this is a wonderful team and a wonderful group of guys. I have committed myself to this time. On the 1st of October, I don’t know what is going to happen in my life, I honestly don’t. I have made no decisions about continuing to play golf, about whether I will do something completely different, about whether I will stay in the game. Those players deserve my full attention.“It will be a very empty feeling afterwards because for 20 months, this has been everything to me, on my mind constantly. Hopefully a picture will form itself afterwards.”There is a sombre element attached to Bjørn’s role. In 2006 he launched a stinging attack on Europe’s “most pathetic captain” Ian Woosnam after objecting to the circumstances by which he found out about failure to earn a wildcard pick for the K Club. An apology was instantly made but damage had been done. Scar tissue lingers, as made clear by Bjørn’s emotion when discussing the scenario.“It is a shame because Woosie did so much for me early in my career and it all turned out very wrong,” Bjørn says. “He meant so much to me. “It was blown out of proportion. Certain things were said that weren’t right, certain things were done that weren’t right. I have tried for 12 years now to put a lid on it but sometimes when something like that happens, you can’t really put it back in its box.“The sad thing for me is I don’t have a relationship with a man that meant so much to me. I played my first Ryder Cup match with him. I sit here as Ryder Cup captain and, if everything had turned out the right way, he would probably be a big part of my life … I would be having conversations with him about what was going to happen in Paris.” Instead Bjørn and Woosnam have been reduced to small talk at the past two Masters.Bjørn has already had to withstand something of a storm. When selecting the experienced Ian Poulter, Henrik Stenson, Sergio García and Paul Casey as wildcards, the allegation was of an old pals’ act.“I think you’d have found if it was old pals there would be one or two others playing,” Bjørn says. “Some of the guys left out are very close to me and I was never scared of making tough decisions. Now, if people think I made these decisions on the back of them being pals then they don’t know me very well and that’s OK. That mostly comes from people who have no idea who I am, what I think and what I believe in.“It disappoints me if people, who I think know me, would think like this. People who don’t know me and have no concept of who I am? That’s fine. You actually couldn’t come up with a thing that is more not me.”If Bjørn is central to this Ryder Cup, there is no doubt about its most high-profile figure. Tiger Woods, who has rescued his career from the depths of despair, will don US colours once more. “The game of golf is where it is today primarily because of what he did for the game in the late 90s and early 2000s,” Europe’s captain says. “He changed the face of the game and brought it to the masses. As a golf fan, which I am, you cannot be anything other than excited about Tiger back in the Ryder Cup team.”Bjørn played in his third Ryder Cup in 2014 when the captain, Paul McGinley, turned to Sir Alex Ferguson to inspire participants with a rousing pep talk. Bjørn’s Liverpool leanings did not prevent him from being captivated but there will be no appearance of Jürgen Klopp at Le Golf National.“With Alex the timing was unbelievable so many things fitted in perfectly,” Bjørn says. “That was Paul’s brainchild and his way of doing things. You have to be careful, I don’t want to imitate Paul McGinley. Paul would be the first person to say that to me. Jürgen Klopp would be for me, I don’t think that would be for the team.”Or for Europe. Over three days in France, Bjørn will be adamant it is all for Europe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/908265e5979c1f038be88d1b9c7ea704c85cc478/0_108_4887_2933/master/4887.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=602e8e93410dbf13741f54248e3fc21b","title":"wada head russia reinstatement triumph money over clean sport","story":"• David Howman accuses Wada of bowing to pressure• Russia now only must admit ‘certain iniduals’ were to blameThe World Anti-Doping Agency’s decision to reinstate the Russian Anti-Doping Agency is a triumph for money over clean sport, according to the agency’s former director general.David Howman, who ran Wada from 2003 to 2016 and is now the head of the Athletics Integrity Unit, strongly criticised the president, Sir Craig Reedie, for caving in to pressure from the International Olympic Committee and sports federations eager to stage events in Russia again.“I am a little disappointed, to say the least,” Howman said. “This looks like they have taken the decision to deviate from a carefully put-together roadmap for entirely pragmatic reasons. Wada has gone from being an organisation that cared about clean athletes to one that cares about international federations that have not been able to stage events in Russia: it’s money over principle. That is a quite a difference, quite a swing, from what Wada once was.”Rusada was suspended in November 2015 when its central role in the Russian doping scandal was first confirmed by an investigation led by the former Wada president Dick Pound.The Canadian legal expert professor Richard McLaren conducted a second, much wider investigation in 2016, and its findings shocked athletes and sports fans around the world, forcing the IOC to block its member federations from staging events in Russia until it had a compliant national anti-doping agency again. One consequence of Rusada’s reinstatement is that Wada does not have to declare international boxing federation AIBA non-compliant for giving its 2019 world championships to Sochi.The IOC has been pushing Wada hard to make such headaches go away and all six of its representatives on the 12-strong ExCo voted for the compromise deal on Thursday, with the IOC member Reedie also backing it. In fact, the deal, which was only finalised between Reedie and the Russian sports minister, Pavel Kolobkov, last week, sailed through by nine votes to two, a result that provoked a furious response from athletes groups and national anti-doping agencies.Instead of Russia having to acknowledge its doping was state-sponsored and grant unconditional access to the Moscow laboratory’s data and stored samples before reinstatement (in line with the mutually-agreed “roadmap to compliance” Howman referred to), it now only has to admit that “certain iniduals” were to blame, and the lab access comes with conditions and a new timetable. Like many in the anti-doping community, Howman is at a loss to understand why Wada has agreed to this.On the issue of the IOC’s influence, the former IOC executive committee member said Wada had always “managed to walk the fine line” between the desires of its two sponsors, national governments and sport, “until Russia came along, because it was too big, too rich, too powerful”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be41e6404cc3b075a1d1fd9b47259f8d9ef17a92/0_0_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8ae0ffcdc7795ff6d24fbe205d95a6a","title":"county cricket updates yorkshire hampshire and more","story":"• Follow the (weather-affected) action from around the grounds• How Surrey created the greatest cricket production line• Leave comments below the line or tweet @tykestravelsSurrey director of cricket Alec Stewart has called on the ECB to look into ways of preventing a repeat of his side’s abandoned final day against Somerset at Taunton after high overnight winds blew the covers off the pitch and left it wet and unplayable. The champions were on course to win their 10th successive Division One game, only for umpires Tim Robinson and Alex Wharf to call the game off at 9am with tyres marks from the covers imprinted close to the popping crease at the River End of the ground. This was a game with no bearing on the title picture, meaning a pretty relaxed view from Stewart and the visiting camp as they were left contemplating a draw. However, he said: “These things don’t happen too often, but imagine if this game had potentially been a Championship decider, which at one stage it was looking to be a few games ago. A lot more would have been said.“It’s probably worth the ECB looking ahead, should this sort of thing happen again. What would happen? Is it just an abandoned game? Is it the home side’s responsibility to ensure the covering and everything is of the right standard? I’m sure Somerset haven’t done this on purpose in any shape or form, but we were trying to win 10 on the bounce. It’s been taken out of our hands in a game where we were well ahead.” It is the second time in successive home games that the spotlight has been thrown on the Taunton pitch following controversy surrounding their tie with Lancashire earlier this month when there was a suggestion of excessive turn. In this game, Somerset would have resumed on 168 for three in their second innings, trailing by 171. Their coach, Jason Kerr, said: “The weather was atrocious overnight. We had to put the situation in the game to one side. It was about the safety of the players and the condition of the surface. Had Morne Morkel bowled on that, it would have been very interesting and certainly not safe for the batters.”It was a similar outcome at Headingley between Yorkshire and Hampshire, although not with the drama as heavy overnight and morning rain left the playing surface too wet. Both sides were left with eight points for a draw. Hampshire are already safe, while Yorkshire now need a maximum of two points for safety in next week’s final round clash at relegated Worcestershire. Had play started, Yorkshire would have been 287 for five in their second innings, leading by 314. Meanwhile, Yorkshire coach Andrew Gale has revealed that Adil Rashid is on the verge of committing his future to the club, while Jonny Bairstow, also out of contract, “wants a bit of time”. Warwickshire secured Division Two promotion alongside Kent by batting out their final day against Sussex at Hove to secure the draw they needed. Opener Dom Sibley hit an unbeaten second-innings 144. Warwickshire closed on 381 for three, a lead of 478. Ian Bell went for an x-ray having taken a blow to his right thumb from a rising Oliver Robinson delivery on five, although suffered only bruising. Kent, ahead on most wins, and Warwickshire are level on points at the top ahead of next week’s title decider at Edgbaston. Derbyshire, chasing 328 to beat Middlesex at Lord’s, were bowled out for 210. Billy Godleman carried his bat for 102 not out. Only five overs were bowled on day four at Bristol as Gloucestershire drew with Northamptonshire. North-east based former Australia batsman Marcus North has replaced Geoff Cook as Durham’s new director of cricket. Derbyshire, chasing 328, are all out for 210, losing their last four wickets for 18. Tim Murtagh finished with four-for. Billy Godleman, on 102 not out, becomes first Derbyshire batsman to carry his bat since 2013 when Chesney Hughes did it against Yorkshire here at Headingley. And a final note before I dash to write my round-up of the day, on a more positive note than the day started with – the word on Ian Bell’s thumb is promising: it appears to be just bruised.Sam Hain is out for 90 at Hove and Derbyshire are 205 for 8 at Lord’s, although Billy Godleman has his century and is unbeaten on 102. The 123 more needed to win for the visitors is a real stretch. Tim Murtagh leads the way with three wickets for Middlesex.It seems the only thing left in that Sussex v Warwickshire game is to see whether Sam Hain can complete his century. He has reached tea on 77. Warwickshire are millions ahead, but – more importantly – on the way to promotion.Derbyshire are 182 for 6 as they approach tea at Lord’s, needing 146 more. Opener Billy Godleman is holding things together with an unbeaten 93, while Anuj Dal has just arrived at the crease. Warwickshire are still batting at Hove … 334 for 2 with a lead of 431. Dom Sibley has 128 and Sam Hain 68. A closer look at Somerset’s pitch …Derbyshire are 119 for 4 against Middlesex, having lost Alex Hughes and Harvey Hosein in the last hour. Hughes was ousted by Martin Andersson, the seamer who was on loan at Derbyshire a fortnight ago before being recalled. The visitors require 209 more for victory.Warwickshire are still batting, making absolutely certain of promotion rather than going all out for victory against Sussex at Hove. They are 289 for 2, leading by 390. Dom Sibley is unbeaten on 113 and Sam Hain 50. While I was getting some quotes following this Yorkshire v Hampshire draw, they have abandoned the game in a draw at Bristol, where they was only five overs possible on day four between Gloucestershire and Northamptonshire before more rain.So just two matches are in play now, both in Division Two. Warwickshire lead Sussex by 346 at lunch at Hove. They are 249 for 2 in their second innings. At Lord’s, Derbyshire are 108 for 3 chasing 328 to beat Middlesex.Some reaction from Yorkshire coach Andrew Gale as his side close in on Division One safety. He said: “I thought it was a good solid week. We spoke before the game about how we’re probably playing our best cricket of the season towards the back end, and we’ve got some confidence back. We had a good solid draw at Trent Bridge and then beat Lancashire in a close battle.Play has been abandoned here at Headingley, so a draw. Eight points for Yorkshire leaves them needing a maximum of two points from next week’s clash with Worcestershire at New Road to secure safety.Ian Bell has been forced to retire hurt at Hove after being hit on the thumb by a rising delivery from Oliver Robinson. He has gone for an x-ray. Warwickshire 191 for 2, leading by 288. They are due to start at Bristol any time now.Wickets at Hove and Lord’s. Warwickshire are 168 for 1 in their second innings against Sussex, leading by 265. Will Rhodes has just been trapped lbw by former Yorkshire teammate Oliver Robinson for 88. At Lord’s, Derbyshire are 33 for 1 in their chase against Middlesex. Tim Murtagh has removed Luis Reece this morning.A little more on events at Taunton, where high winds blew the covers off the pitch at the River End of the ground overnight, with a tyre mark even left on the pitch, as you can see here … The mopping up process had started at Headingley, but it has started raining again. They have started at Hove and Lord’s, the latter where Derbyshire are 15 for 0 chasing 328 against Middlesex. There will be an inspection at 11am at Bristol ahead of day four between Gloucestershire and Northants. This just in from the Press Association:Surrey director of cricket Alec Stewart expressed his frustration at his side’s hopes of a 10th successive victory being wiped out by elements beyond their control.While he was quick to absolve Somerset of any underhand tactics, Stewart has suggested the England and Wales Cricket Board look into the matter to prevent a repeat.He said in a video posted on Surrey’s Twitter account: “I’m sure Somerset haven’t done this on purpose in any shape or form but we were trying to win a game, were trying to win 10 on the bounce and it’s been taken out of our hands in a game where we were well ahead.“These things don’t happen too often but imagine if this game had potentially been a championship decider, which at one stage it was looking to be a few games ago. Just say Somerset were ahead and then we were here and this had happened, a lot more would have been said.“It’s probably worth the ECB looking ahead, should this sort of thing happen again, what would happen. Is it just an abandoned game? Is it the home side’s responsibility to ensure the covering and everything is of the right standard?“You can tell we are very, very frustrated and disappointed, as are Somerset, because they wanted to try to save the game and well done to them for trying to do that. It’s just a real frustration all round.” Drama at Taunton, where the covers have blown off in an overnight storm, leaving conditions unplayable. So that match finishes in a draw, leaving champions Surrey with 13 points and Somerset five. Somerset were 168 for 3 in their second innings overnight, a deficit of 171. That means Surrey’s nine-game winning streak comes to an end.Here at Headingley, it is not quite as dramatic a scene, but I suspect the game will go the same way. Heavy rain overnight, and there has been no attempt yet made to start the mopping up process. Umpires Graham Lloyd and Michael Gough have called an early lunch at 12pm. They will call it off shortly afterwards. Yorkshire are 287-5 in their second innings, leading by 314. Eight points for the draw will leave them needing a maximum of two points from next week’s final round clash with Worcestershire at New Road to secure Division One safety. Hampshire are already safe. In Division Two, there are three games still in play. At Hove, Warwickshire (141 for 0 in their second innings) lead Sussex by 238 and are chasing a win which would take them back above Kent to the top of Division Two. A draw, which would be enough to secure promotion, would leave it level pegging ahead of next week’s clash between the two sides at Edgbaston – a title decider. At Lord’s, Middlesex will begin day four on 199 for 7 in their second innings, leading Derbyshire by 327, while Northamptonshire have a first-innings lead of 48 over Gloucestershire at Bristol. There was no play possible there yesterday. The sun is shining at all three venues."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25214875c5af4c96733a6243aedc388f2cfa6eab/1386_512_1693_1016/master/1693.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c21042c560830f0c986856c7fc249817","title":"national theatre wales accused of favouring english artists","story":"Playwrights and actors write letter claiming NTW is ridding itself of its theatrical identityForty playwrights and actors have launched a withering attack on National Theatre Wales (NTW), accusing it of favouring English artists and companies over homegrown or home-based ones.In an open letter, the Welsh artists claimed NTW, which has been celebrated in the past for imaginative productions staged on beaches, mountains and factory floors, seemed be taking pride in “ridding itself of a theatrical identity and even its nationality”.They also argued the company was staging too few productions, pointing out that despite receiving about £1.5m a year from Arts Council Wales, only one project was listed for the rest of 2018 – an exhibition of photographs taken with disposable cameras.NTW has won praise in previous years for productions such as The Passion starring Michael Sheen, set in and around Port Talbot in south Wales, and The Radicalisaion of Bradley Manning, which opened at Chelsea Manning’s former school in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire.But the writers of the letter claimed NTW had lost its way, citing a production called English, which was staged in the spring.It was billed as “an exuberant A to Z of language and identity” but the writers said it failed to address the crucial and fundamental question of what the English language meant in Wales. The writers expressed anger that a company based in Manchester, Quarantine, was brought in to create the show and another based in the north-west of England has been brought in to deliver a flagship project in 2020.The letter added: “Non-Welsh and Wales-based artists and companies need to be world-class and engaged only to support a Welsh or Wales-based artist. The practice of engaging companies and artists outside of Wales to respond to Welsh stories has to end.”One of the signatories, the Cardiff playwright Lisa Parry said English caused enormous hurt and anger within the community. “It’s an anger that hasn’t been acknowledged by NTW,” she said. “They don’t seem to want to engage with the country for which they are meant to be making work.“That’s not parochialism. A playwright lives and breathes their community and can reflect and engage with its stories and concerns through lived experience. But it’s as if NTW doesn’t want to show that truth. The talent here is phenomenal and yet NTW won’t engage with it.”Mari Izzard, who is rehearsing Lord of the Flies at Theatre Clwyd in Flintshire, north Wales, said: “Their decision-making process is making us feel that WelshWales-based artists’ work isn’t good enough. Wales-based and Welsh artists should be at the priority, otherwise you may as well not have Wales in the title at all.”The playwright Gary Owen said he attended the final night of English in Cardiff. “There were 34 people in the audience and nine were NTW staff members or crew members. Aside from the content of the show, that tells you something is going badly wrong.”Another writer, Alun Saunders added: “Wales has an incredibly rich culture and history our stories are now too often being told by those with little or no knowledge or vested interest in them.”A spokesperson for NTW said it was aware of the letter and claimed much of its content was “factually incorrect”. “Our door is and always has been open to artists,” it said. “Our artistic director had already made plans to meet many of the letter’s signatories in November, but if they would prefer to meet sooner, we are more than happy to do so.” NTW declined to identify what it believed was incorrect in the letter.The Arts Council of Wales, NTW’s main funding source, said it welcomed the debate. A spokesperson said: “We are aware that since its creation, National Theatre Wales has existed to challenge everyday notions of what theatre could, and should be, in the 21st century and has done this boldly and imaginatively.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fc37667333c3305d1a6920b4caa2259f4723d0c/0_0_1748_2480/master/1748.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026usm=12\u0026fit=crop\u0026crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026bm=normal\u0026ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=6011b38f9c402bc8fad97ab69eed4b97","title":"brett kavanaugh christine blasey ford hearing pushed back","story":"President questioned Christine Blasey Ford’s credibility on Friday and claimed Democrats are trying to ‘destroy’ KavanaughDonald Trump cast doubt on the woman who accused his supreme court pick Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, and on Friday blamed opponents for trying to “destroy” his nominee, while chivvying for a vote.It emerged on Friday afternoon that Senate Republicans are likely to propose moving a committee hearing onthe allegations to Wednesday, CNN reported, citing two sources familiar with the negotiations. The sources also suggested that California professor Christine Blasey Ford would testify first, then Kavanaugh, and that Republicans are not willing to subpoena any outside witnesses, as Ford requested, CNN reported. She had also reportedly requested to testify second.After days of restrained comments about the allegations from the California professor Christine Blasey Ford, Trump tweeted on Friday, questioning her account of what happened between her and Kavanaugh at a party in 1982 when they were in high school and she was 15, he 17. Kavanaugh denies the allegations.“I have no doubt that, if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents,” Trump said. “I ask that she bring those filings forward so that we can learn date, time, and place!Trump said he believes Kavanaugh is “under assault by radical leftwing politicians”. In the tweets on Friday morning, he said that Kavanaugh has an “impeccable reputation” and that Democrats “don’t want to know the answers, they just want to destroy and delay”.A Senate panel vote on Kavanaugh’s confirmation, scheduled for Thursday, was delayed after Ford’s allegations came out last week.Ford told a Senate committee she would be willing to testify later next week as a Friday morning deadline set by the Republican-led Senate judiciary committee for her to confirm whether she would testify on Monday came and went. The panel had scheduled a hearing for 10amon Monday, which is now in the balance.The president further weighed in late Friday morning with another tweet demanding: “Let her testify, or not, and TAKE THE VOTE!”The full tweet again criticized the committee Democrat Dianne Feinstein for not revealing the letter she received with Ford’s allegations sooner.Within minutes, women, including leading feminist writers, began tweeting alongside the hashtag #WhyIDidn’tReport, which began trending, about bad experiences when reporting sexual violence to the authorities, especially as teens.Jessica Valenti tweeted: “The only time I ever went to the police was after a man tried to pull me into his car when I was 19. The beat cops were annoyed that I didn’t know the make of the vehicle, or if it had two doors or four.” She added that she had been terrified the police would not believe her.Another woman wrote: “I was drunk, he was a varsity athlete. I couldn’t ‘prove’ anything.”Many police departments and courts do not have a good record on dealing with sexual assault victims, despite more of them speaking out in recent years.Ford is asking for the hearing on Capitol Hill in which she will testify against Kavanaugh be moved to next Thursday. The GOP later appeared to be offering Wednesday.Meanwhile, it was reported that Ford will meet with the FBI on Friday afternoon as part of its investigation of death threats she has received since agreeing to come forward with her allegations.The California professor is willing to come to Washington to give her account and be questioned by senators, but doesn’t want Kavanaugh in the same room, her attorney told judiciary committee staff in a 30-minute phone call later on Thursday. The conversation also touched on security concerns and others issues, according to a Senate aide who spoke to the Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because public discussion of the matter was unauthorized.Ford is willing to give her account to the Republican-majority judiciary committee, whose senators need to vote on Kavanaugh’s confirmation before it goes to a full Senate vote.But she will only appear if agreement can be reached on “terms that are fair and which ensure her safety”, the attorney, Debra Katz, said in an email to the committee revealed earlier on Thursday. On Thursday night, Donald Trump, who had been uncharacteristically restrained in his comments on the crisis, challenged Ford’s story, during an interview with Fox News while at a rally in Las Vegas.“I think it’s a very sad situation,” said Trump, asking: “Why didn’t somebody call the FBI 36 years ago? … What’s going on?”While he said Ford should “have her say”, he made clear he was done waiting: “I don’t think you can delay it any longer. They’ve delayed it a week already.” Kavanaugh, 53, currently a judge on the powerful US court of appeals for the DC circuit, has repeatedly denied her allegation. It also emerged this week that a prominent Yale law professor told students it was “not an accident” that Kavanaugh’s female law clerks all “looked like models” and would provide advice to them about their physical appearance if they wanted to work for him.Taylor Foy, the spokesman for Republicans on the panel, said after the Thursday phone call that Grassley “will consult with his colleagues on the committee. He remains committed to providing a fair forum for both Dr Ford and Judge Kavanaugh.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8b751bc95cfd9ab9d699a11a0defc98a0044637/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65ef4a5eebcbf265f03db77dbba69bd5","title":"what masculinity means when youre gay bi or trans ","story":"We’re in the middle of a ‘genderquake’ where the qualities traditionally associated with men are changing daily. So how do three LGBT guys define manliness in 2018?Here, three men – one gay, one bisexual and one trans – reveal what modern masculinity means to them.Throughout my school years I felt that I couldn’t do anything right. I was always a very dainty child, and growing up on a council estate I felt like an alien who’d been dropped down from outer space. I had a girlie voice and feminine mannerisms, and everything I did was jumped on.When I went to university, I started to get good-looking girlfriends, and people left me alone, but I was still repressing myself. Being with women didn’t feel quite right I just didn’t want to be gay.Eventually, at 24, I came out and life began. But even though I’d started to care less about conforming, I still battled with a lot of internalised homophobia. In the gay community, masculine men are seen as more attractive, so again I ended up compromising myself.I still have days where I’m conscious of my behaviour being “too” effeminate, especially when I’m in a professional capacity or meeting someone for the first time, but I’ve become more accepting of myself with time. Sometimes I feel sorry for straight men who can cry at a football match but would feel embarrassed and unmanly telling their partner they love them – I think that’s really sad.In a way it’s quite freeing that it’s generally OK for a gay man to be seen as emotional, and that it isn’t seen as a sign of weakness. I think straight people can benefit from having an LGBT friend, because we have a different perspective, informed by our experiences. In a way, I’m glad that I haven’t necessarily had the easiest ride, because it’s made me a more rounded person.When I was single and using dating apps, I found that things would be going well until I mentioned that I dated both men and women – then women would stop replying or suddenly realise that they weren’t over their ex.My girlfriend gets strange comments, like, “Are you the one dating a gay guy?”, and my masculinity has definitely felt under attack at times. I’ve found myself wondering whether I’m manly enough – I think those are feelings that a lot of men struggle with, whether gay, straight or bi.We’re all supposed to aspire to being super macho, but I hope we’re starting to realise that there’s more than one way of being a man. In fact, my girlfriend would say that dating a bisexual man is better, because I have a more flexible mindset. I don’t assume that she’ll do the washing up because she’s a woman, or that I’ll do the DIY because I’m a man. She tells me I’m one of the manliest people she knows, not because I have the deepest voice or the broadest shoulders, but because I know who I am, and I never feel the need to pretend to be anyone else.For as long as I can remember, I’ve felt male. Even when I was four years old, my mum remembers me crying and telling her I felt like a boy trapped in a girl’s body. Then, when I was eight, I played on a boys’ basketball team and nobody thought to question it.It was only when I started high school that things got weird. I tried to fit in because I didn’t want to get teased, but I’d overhear people asking, “Is that a boy in a skirt?” My mum would help with my makeup and take me shopping, but it felt like I was doing drag. Coming from a small town, I didn’t even know what it meant to be trans all I knew was how I felt.Then, once I started to transition, I made a lot of effort to be ultra masculine, spending lots of time in the gym so that I’d “pass” as a man. These days, I’m much more comfortable with myself and I’m not afraid of my feminine side, because I know it doesn’t stop me being male.People sometimes think I’m gay, because I can be a bit camp, and I’m OK with that. I do comedy videos online, and, funnily enough, most of the characters I’m known for are women. Some people don’t realise I’m trans and post comments saying, “If you like being women so much why don’t you just become one?” I think: “Been there, done that!”Photography: Dan Wilton for Do what feels right with Philips: whether that’s being true to yourself or a finding grooming routine that works for you.

He owns the rival media company Mediaset, and Foa was a journalist at his newspaper, Il Giornale.The source said Foa’s appointment was likely to be detrimental for journalism in Italy. “Foa is a guy who is really in love with the Catholic religion, he hates the EU and loves Russia and Putin, so all of these are red signals that it will be bad for information.”Foa has also repeatedly criticised the Italian president, Sergio Mattarella. When Foa was first mooted for the Rai role, the journalists’ unions FNSI and Usigrai described the potential appointment as “a fatal blow to the autonomy and independence of the public service”.Fake stories shared by Foa on social media have included one during the 2016 US presidential election campaign about Hillary Clinton participating in satanic dinners and another about a supposed plan to overthrow Donald Trump."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/969ce2aba49130faec161ed31422a0821b9bf0bc/0_131_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1762ff81e5239c662863a8b39d70ab7e","title":"kim jong un all fingers and thumbs in bid for instagram diplomacy","story":"North Korean leader struggled to make ‘finger hearts’ gesture popular on social mediaDoing something “for the ‘gram” is not typically associated with international diplomacy, but this did not stop Kim Jong-un making a heartfelt attempt at a South Korean Instagram trend during a summit this week.“Finger hearts”, a popular social media pose in South Korea, involves people crossing the tips of their forefingers and thumbs, as though about to click their fingers or make a money-grubbing gesture. Also known as “baby hearts”, it is so called because the crossed fingertips are subtly reminiscent of a heart shape.The North Korean leader attempted the gesture while posing for photographs with South Korea’s president Moon Jae-in on Paektu mountain on Friday, the Korea Herald reported.“How do you do it? I can’t quite make the shape,” Kim was reported to have said, as he stood beside his wife, Ri Sol-ju, who supported him in the effort.Kim “ultimately succeeded in making the gesture”, reported the Korea Herald, citing the account of South Korean presidential office Cheong Wa Dae’s spokesperson, Kim Eui-kyeom.Baby hearts have been a go-to gesture in Korea for years, photographed as far back as 2010, but gaining in recognition overseas through social media.Like the relatively strident “hand heart” popularised by Taylor Swift, finger hearts are an expression of love, gratitude, goodwill and gwiyeobda (cute or charming, similar to kawaii in Japan).Its spread is tied to the increasingly global, and social media-driven, popularity of K-pop bands such as BTS, who often make finger hearts to show their appreciation for their fans.The K-pop artist G-Dragon claims to have invented the gesture, sharing a photograph of him as a child appearing to be doing finger hearts with his many millions of followers on Instagram in October 2016.In the caption he wrote: “I was the original finger heart.”His assertion was challenged shortly afterwards by the comedian Yang Se Hyung, who posted his own seemingly telling childhood snap.“Hey y’all. I was the original. #Yang Se Hyung # The one who created the finger heart #Reported by mother #Agree?”The official gloves for the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang had the relevant fingertips in red, to achieve maximum finger heart effect. Athletes embraced the gesture with varying levels of gusto.Visiting celebrities are often exhorted to attempt them for photos and they are a staple shot on red carpets. Tom Cruise and Simon Pegg were photographed doing very focused finger hearts at the Mission: Impossible – Fallout premiere in Seoul in July, as were the Black Panther cast in February.As Vulture wrote, of the finger hearts reverberating across the world: “Call the Blue House, because cultural diplomacy is taking place!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbb045412afbd1c366d1ebb4d1029a555c774c82/0_288_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e49478807e31b49566a54695e7b8f38","title":"voulez vous return your pebbles to our mamma mia beach","story":"Greek islanders want tourists to stop pinching marble stones from bay on Skiathos, where parts of Abba movie were filmedUsually at this time of year, Greek beaches are basking in the sunlight of summer’s dying days. But recently the news has been less luminous. First came the terrifying footage, taken by tourists, of a landslide on Zante’s Navagio beach. The collapse of the cliff face only narrowly missed holidaymakers sunbathing on its shores below.Now comes the news that a bay on Skiathos – the island that served, partially, as a backdrop for the first Mamma Mia! film – is losing its smooth pebbles so fast campaigners have been forced to take drastic action.This week containers emblazoned with the words “Lalaria Beach return pebbles box” appeared at Skiathos’s airport as locals stepped up the campaign to save the beach from tourists who crave one of its famously smooth marble stones. “We’ve had no other choice,” said Thodoris Tzoumas, who heads Skiathos’s cultural association. “Lalaria may not have suffered a landslide but human intervention is such that its natural beauty is being destroyed at an alarming rate.”Thanks to pebble pinching whole chunks of its stony shoreline have vanished.The appearance of the honesty boxes follows the announcement of fines up to €1,000 (£894) for tourists found in possession of Lalaria’s celebrated marble stones. Posters have also been pasted on local cruise boats and a billboard placed on the beach exhorting holidaymakers to “take a picture not a pebble”.“Lalaria is not a protected site so the fines were announced in extremis,” the island’s harbour master chief, Nikolaos Katsambas, told the . “Now that all these measures have been taken we hope they will have a deterrent effect.”Campaigners claim the marbles have been disappearing at an alarming rate. Lalaria, on Skiathos’s northern coast, first became famous in the 1970s when the Greek tourist board, attracted by its crystal clear waters, made the bay the country’s poster beach. It shot to global stardom, however, when Hollywood producers used Skiathos as one of the film locations for the first Mamma Mia. This summer’s release of Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again has lured even greater numbers of tourists, with many visiting the island to get married or renew vows.A spokeswoman at the local town hall said tourists were not the only culprits. “Residents here have also been taking them to build fancy walls in their gardens and mosaic floors in their homes,” lamented Athina Papageorgiou. “Nature can’t keep up with replenishing the disappearing stock.”According to the island’s cultural association, the larger marbles have almost entirely been eradicated from the beach. “In the past, winds lashing the rocks during the winter months would make up for the losses. But we’ve lost so many over the last decade that that’s no longer enough,” Tzoumas sighed.As part of the campaign, coastguard officers have also begun conducting inspections as tourists alight from boats running daily cruises to Lalaria, which is only accessible by sea. “They are down there every day and even boat captains are issuing warnings over loudspeakers,” the campaigner added.Authorities at Skiathos’s airport have reportedly long complained of the inexplicably large amount of pebbles discovered in travellers’ luggage.But the appearance of the honesty boxes – following the threat of fines – may be working. “We’ve been pleasantly surprised at the result,” said Tzoumas. “They have only been there a few days and they are beginning to fill up. It’s the last chance for pebble thieves to part with these beautiful stones if they don’t want to be found with them.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Historic move follows an Access to Information on the Environment request made by campaign group Right to Know regarding discussions about CO2 emissionsHeroin, cocaine and gun cartridges found during search targeting organised crimeDublin village chosen by TimeOut magazine for efforts made to revive Victorian buildingsVideo footage appears to show car hitting rider in Dublin before being driven offTransparency of office\u0026rsquos spending has been raised as an issue in election run-upDublin points to influence of Tory party politics but says UK\u0026rsquos position is unchangedTaoiseach says talks are going through \u0026lsquorocky patch\u0026rsquo but he is hopeful of progressMinister: \u0026lsquoI make Government policy, but don\u0026rsquot ask me for details.

Photograph: Cyril ByrneIreland’s first driverless passenger-carrying vehicle has arrived on the streets of Dublin.The EZ10 driverless shuttle, built in France, has no steering wheel, no wing mirrors and, of course, no driver.It has a top speed of just 24 kmh, will win no awards for aesthetic design as it resembles a high-tech milk float, and it is powered entirely by electricity.Its first public outing involved it trundling up and down a section of the Dublin docklands opposite the Convention Centre on Friday. The public will get a chance to glimpse the future when it takes passengers on Saturday and Sunday.The shuttle is in Ireland as part of European Mobility Week, which ends on Sunday and is designed to promote modes of transport other than the private car.The EZ10 has won the approval of Dublin City Council chief executive Owen Keegan, who has a well-documented dislike of private cars in the city centre.While he forecast such driverless vehicles were “inevitable”, he acknowledged regulatory and technical issues would have to be dealt with first.Mr Keegan said he was “pretty confident” that in “the next five to 10 years” driverless vehicles would “make a major contribution in terms of sustainable transport” on Dublin’s streets.He was also convinced driverless vehicles could be safer than the alternative.He envisaged such vehicles would work transporting people from bus and train stops to their eventual destination. “We are talking about the last mile. I think a fleet of semi-autonomous vehicles could make a major contribution.”He said they would operate on the road in an environment where there would be “very few” single-occupancy cars on the streets of the capital in the future.The EZ10 has already arrived in several cities across Europe. One operates in Paris, where it transports up to 15 people at a time from the Chateau de Vincennes metro station to Bois de Vincennes, the city’s largest public park.In Sweden, the vehicles mix with other traffic in the new Stockholm suburb of Barkarby. In Frankfurt in Germany, they ferry students to and from the University of Frankfurt.The EZ10 operates via GPS and artificial intelligence. It can read road signs and automatically brakes when in danger of a collision.The vehicle is built by EasyMile, in Toulouse, and 100 are now in service.EasyMile spokesman Clément Delbouys said the company was targeting Dublin as a future destination.“The idea is now that we are here, we really want to provide a service for Dublin. It could be at the university, the port or the airport. We want to showcase what we can do on the streets of Dublin.”Mr Delbouys said most countries had to amend their legislation to allow for driverless cars and Ireland could follow France in that regard."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3637424.1537552747!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish government welcomes substance if not the tone of theresa may s statement","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDublin believes Theresa May’s domestic political needs, especially the forthcoming Conservative Party conference, influenced the tone of her remarks of her Downing Street statement on Friday. Photograph: Paul GroverPool PhotoThe Irish Government has welcomed Theresa May’s commitment to bring forward new proposals on the backstop, which it said it has been seeking for months, despite the bullish tone of her Downing Street statement.Senior Irish sources said they had expected a reaction from the British prime minister after the public rebuff by EU leaders at the Salzburg summit, and they were frank about the poor state of the negotiations and the uncertain prospects for agreement in the coming months.Dublin believes Mrs May’s domestic political needs, especially the forthcoming Conservative Party conference, influenced the tone of her remarks on Friday. However, one senior source pointed out that once the angry reaction to the summit was set aside, the substance of Mrs May’s position had not altered.In a statement to The , spokesman for Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said:“We welcome that in her statement at Downing Street, Prime Minister May reiterated the UK’s commitment on the need to avoid a hard border and confirmed again that they are committed to implementing the agreement reached last December through a backstop in the Withdrawal Agreement.“It is good that Prime Minister May confirmed that she will bring forward proposals on the backstop text - we have been asking the UK to do this since March.“The place for that to happen and for these negotiations to conclude successfully is Brussels, between the EU task force and the UK team,” the statement concluded.Sources pointed to the section of Mrs May’s statement where she seemed to indicate there could be regulatory ergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK as long as the Stormont Executive and Assembly consent.But DUP leader Arlene Foster reacted with a statement promising to veto any new regulatory barrier between the North and Great Britain.Earlier, speaking at the National Ploughing Championships, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the Brexit negotiations are now entering a “rocky patch” but expressed confidence that a deal will be ultimately brokered between the European Union and the United Kingdom.Mr Varadkar said there had been a lot of assertions in the British media in the past couple of weeks that has been way off the mark and had led to false expectations in Britain as to the outcome.“There was a sense created in the UK press that there was ision around the EU table, among the EU 27. There is not. The EU is totally united, not just united behind Ireland but also united behind the single market,” Mr Varadkar said.“Perhaps the sense was created that prime minister May would come away with something more positive than occurred. I don’t think anyone in the EU or Ireland is to blame for that.“Ultimately the problems that are created for Britain and the British government are being created as a consequence of Brexit and nobody in EU and Ireland is to blame for that,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillMinister for Transport Shane Ross told a residents’ association meeting in his constituency on Wednesday evening he had nothing to do with the BusConnects plan and had no responsibility for the National Transport Authority, according to people present.Mr Ross also indicated that he would be making his own submission to the ongoing public consultation on the plan and objecting to some aspects of it.According to one person present, when he saw a proposed route map for the Bus Connects plan at the meeting, he told attendees: “Don’t mind this map.”The Bus Connects scheme involves changes to bus routes into Dublin city, and a €2 billion investment in the network. However, elements of the plan have caused controversy, as it involves the withdrawal of some bus routes to the city centre.Mr Ross was speaking at the agm of the Nutgrove Loreto Community Association, in the Rathfarnham-Churchtown area of his constituency.Earlier that day, Mr Ross had defended the plan in the Dáil. “There are always significant concerns when something as major as this happens . . . However, the changes are necessary and people will come to accept them because they will get them from one place to another much more quickly.”Mr Ross said he understood there were difficulties with the plan and said there would be “some adjustments made to it” on foot of public consultations.However, he also criticised the Opposition for a Dáil motion that opposed the plan.“Today, we also have the language of condemnation from members of the Opposition,” Mr Ross said.“They should get their act together and decide which side they are on. They cannot be on both sides on this one. I know it is difficult. “Green TD Catherine Martin, who was present at the meeting, said Mr Ross’s comments were “quite extraordinary”.“Rather than washing his hands he should ensure that that the new routes improve the quality of life for the daily commuter,” she said.Fianna Fáil councillor Shay Brennan, who was also present, said that he was “surprised to hear that the Minister is making a submission on his own policy”.“I presume he’s doing so as a local representative and not as Minister,” Mr Brennan added.Green leader Éamon Ryan said: “It’s an absolute disgrace and shows a complete lack of leadership in transport.”“The Minister is making a submission, when he should be running policy. No wonder we’re in transport gridlock.”Mr Ross will be relaying his constituents’ concerns about certain aspects of the Bus Connects Project – as he is encouraging all other TDs to do during the public consultation process, a spokeswoman for the minister said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3637167.1537550327!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit may says eu must come up with alternative proposals","story":"British prime minister Theresa May has said that the EU must present alternative Brexit proposals after the UK\u0027s Chequers proposal was rejected during a summit in Salzburg. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Britain’s prime minister Theresa May says it is ’not acceptable’ for EU leaders to reject her plan in the absence of an alternative.

Photograph: PA  The EU must now come up with an alternative to her Brexit proposals, British prime minister Theresa May has said.The British PM said that talks had reached an impasse after the bloc’s leaders rejected her plans without explaining why. At a summit in Austria on Thursday, EU leaders said they would push for a Brexit deal next month but rejected Mrs May’s “Chequers” plan, saying she needs to give ground on trade and arrangements for the Border. “It’s not acceptable to simply reject the other side’s proposals without a detailed explanation and counterproposals,” said Mrs May in a televised statement on Friday. “So we now need to hear from the EU what the real issues are, what their alternative is, so that we can discuss them. Until we do, we cannot make progress.” Mrs May said the Brexit negotiations were at an impasse. She also said the best outcome from the negotiations was for her country to leave the bloc with a deal but exiting with no deal would be better than a bad one. European Council president Donald Tusk struck a conciliatory note in responding to Mrs May’s statement on Friday evening.The EU fully respected the UK’s decision in the Brexit referendum two years ago and was focused on finding a deal that would minimise the damage resulting from Brexit. “Also important to us is to create the best possible relations between the EU and the UK in the future.”While some of Mrs May’s proposals from Chequers indicated a “positive evolution” in the UK’s approach, on the Irish question and the rules of economic cooperation, they will need to be “reworked and further negotiated”.Mr Tusk described the UK stance just before and during this week’s Salzburg summit as “surprisingly tough and in fact uncompromising” but said he believed a compromise was still possible.Under Mrs May’s Chequers proposal Britain would remain aligned with EU regulations for goods and agricultural products but not for services, gaining partial access to the single market without having to accept all its responsibilities such as the free movement of people. The EU insists there can be no return to a hard border in Ireland, with Northern Ireland remaining in the bloc’s customs union or effectively establishing a border in the Irish Sea if no alternative deal is reached. This arrangement is known as the backstop.However, Mrs May said she could not agree to any deal which treated Northern Ireland differently to the rest of the United Kingdom. “I will not overturn the result of the referendum nor will I break up my country,” she said. “We need serious engagement on resolving the two main problems in the negotiations and we stand ready.” Earlier on Friday Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the Brexit talks are entering a “rocky patch”. But he expressed confidence a deal will be ultimately brokered between the EU and the UK and said he was determined to avoid a cliff-edge scenario next March.Mr Varadkar said there had been assertions in the British media in recent weeks that had been way off the mark and had led to false expectations in Britain as to the outcome. Speaking from the National Ploughing Championships in Screggan, Co Offaly, he said “there was a sense created in the UK press that there was ision around the EU table, among the EU 27. There is not. The EU is totally united, not just united behind Ireland but also united behind the single market. “Perhaps the sense was created that prime minister May would come away with something more positive than occurred. I don’t think anyone in the EU or Ireland is to blame for that.“Ultimately the problems that are created for Britain and the British government are being created as a consequence of Brexit and nobody in EU and Ireland is to blame for that.” Britain’s Brexit secretary Dominic Raab claimed on Friday morning some EU leaders had shown unstatesmanlike behaviour in Salzburg.“We’ve already compromised hugely with the Chequers proposals. We’ve engaged and we want to hear more about what the real critique of it is and we’ve got no other credible alternatives on the table,” Mr Raab told the BBC.“What we’re not going to do is be salami sliced throughout this negotiation in a typical style that the EU engages in without movement on the other side.”Many newspapers led their front pages with a Reuters picture showing Mrs May, dressed in a red jacket, standing apparently aloof and alone from a mass of suited male EU leaders. Few diplomats expected any breakthrough from the Salzburg summit as the EU has repeatedly made clear that Mrs May must rework the Chequers proposals. The tone of some of their comments, particularly the irony of European Council President Donald Tusk, left May exposed at home as she heads into what is expected to be a tumultuous annual conference of her Conservative Party on September 30th. – AgenciesDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Jack TaylorReuters Theresa May’s defiant words in Downing Street may have been bombastic enough to have bought her the respite she needs from her Brexiteer critics to get through the Conservative Party conference later this month.That had been her hope from the Salzburg summit, where she expected the other EU leaders to offer warm words and a stay of execution for her Chequers plan. Instead, according to much of the British press, the prime minister was the victim of an ambush when EU leaders declared her plan unworkable and said there would be no Brexit deal without a legally operable backstop for the Border.But if the prime minister was ambushed by anything it was by the reality that her plan for partial access to the single market was always doomed and by her own disastrous strategy for keeping it alive. It was Britain, not the EU, that hyped the Salzburg meeting in advance as a moment of truth for Brexit, spinning that it was May’s chance to sell the Chequers plan directly to the other leaders.But during her 10-minute presentation after dinner at the Felsenreitschule on Wednesday night, May presented Chequers not as a first step towards a deal but as a take it or leave it offer. Then on Thursday morning she told Taoiseach Leo Varadkar that there could be no deal on the backstop by next month’s EU summit. May on Friday accused the EU of treating Britain with disrespect but it was her intransigent message that provoked the other leaders into plain speaking, declaring Chequers dead and warning that there would be no November summit and no withdrawal agreement without progress on the backstop.In her Downing Street statement, the prime minister ruled out two of the options still on the table after the remains of Chequers have been taken away: remaining in the European Economic Area like Norway and the Canada-style free trade agreement favoured by her Brexiteer backbenchers. One of her arguments against a Canada-style deal is that it does not address the issue of keeping the Border open so it would mean falling back on the backstop.In his presentation to EU leaders in Salzburg, Michel Barnier identified four categories of checks on goods arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK that would be required under a backstop: customs, VAT, regulatory compliance and Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS). Companies in Great Britain could make customs and VAT declarations online, with barcode scanning taking place at British ports, on ferries or in Northern Ireland.Regulatory compliance would be enforced in the market, requiring no checks at any border. SPS checks would have to be conducted at Northern Irish ports as they are now, although the volume would increase from 10 per cent checked now to 100 per cent after Brexit.May has not ruled out regulatory checks on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland but insist that there can be no customs border in the Irish Sea and that the North cannot be part of a different customs territory from the rest of the UK. MPs in all parties supported an amendment to a customs Bill before the summer recess endorsing that position, although the Bill is still in the Lords and has not become law.If Britain and the EU agree a regime for regulatory checks between Britain and Northern Ireland, can they find a creative formulation to allow different customs rules to apply in the North too? EU officials point to the example of the Canary Islands, which are part of Spain and thus of the EU but are not part of EU territory for the purposes of VAT. Still, under the EU’s proposals, if Britain were in future to negotiate a trade deal with China or the United States that involved changing tariffs, Northern Ireland would have to retain the same tariffs as the EU.May is likely to maintain her defiant tone about the EU at least until after her party conference is over. But her negotiators will be back in Brussels next week, working with Barnier’s team on the tedious details of the untidy compromise on which the future of Brexit and the Border depends.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Last week the Labour party formally backed a duty of care as its policy.A culture department spokesman said: This winter we will publish a White Paper, setting out new laws to tackle the full range of online harms and set clear responsibilities for tech companies to keep UK citizens safe.“We are considering all options, including what legislation will be necessary and whether a regulator is needed.”Some campaigners remain concerned the government may still back away from statutory regulation.Margot James, the minister responsible for the internet at the culture department, said: “The issue we have to settle is whether to regulate or not.”Jeremy Wright, the culture secretary, has adopted a cautious approach since taking over from Matt Hancock this summer. This week he warned he would not rush into creating “flawed” legislation but wanted to get it right.Duty of care puffHe revealed he will visit Germany next week to review its laws against online hate speech. Along with Australia and France, it is one of the few countries to have successfully introduced legislation to crackdown on the internet firms.In the past week both of Britain’s key regulators – Ofcom and the information commissioner – have backed new regulation on the tech giants.Sharon White, Ofcom’s chief executive, outlined a potential blueprint for regulating social media platforms, saying they should be forced to remove inappropriate material quickly or face fines.Elizabeth Denham, the information commissioner, said voluntary regulation of the tech giants was no longer sustainable. She said: The time has come for more rules and more controls to protect iniduals against some of the harms that are of deep public concern.Duty of Care campaign | Read moreResearch published by the two revealed one in five Britons – 12m people – had been harmed by online content or conduct with social media firms blamed for the vast bulk.Ministers refused to be drawn on whether there would be a new regulator for the tech firms or if responsibilities could be taken over by Ofcom.A green paper earlier this year proposed a statutory code of conduct for tech giants, who would also be forced to publish annual reports on how quickly and effectively they took down harmful content.Andy Burrows, NSPCC Associate Head of Child Safety Online, said: “Children face unacceptable risks when using social networks, so tough regulation is needed to keep them safe and any legislation must have child safety at its heart.”Duty of Care CampaignPlease review our commenting policyTheresa May\u0026#39s

instincts\u0026#34.  Church of EnglandThe Archbishop of Canterbury’s views on welfare and Brexit do not reflect those of ordinary Anglicans, research has found.A study found that the majority of Church of England Christians supported Brexit, with 66 per cent of Anglicans voting Leave, compared to a national average of 53 per cent. The research, published in the journal Religion, State and Society, found that Church of England Christians were unpersuaded by their bishops, who were overwhelmingly Remain-leaning. Identifying as Anglican is an important independent predictor of voting Leave even when other relevant factors like age and region are corrected for, the paper, by Greg Smith, of the William Temple Foundation and Linda Woodhead, professor of Politics, Philosophy and Religion at Lancaster University, concluded. In June Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, described the European Union as the greatest dream realised for human beings since the fall of the Western Roman Empire. Ahead of the 2016 referendum the Archbishop said he would vote to remain in the EU, warning of economic damage and succumbing to our worst instincts.The Archbishop of York, John Sentamu, also voted remain, writing in the Daily  shortly before the referendum that staying in the EU was more likely to lead to mutual flourishing and to encourage peace. Just one Church of England bishop, Mark Rylands, Bishop of Shrewsbury, is on record as supporting Brexit, the paper says. Figures also suggest that Anglicans are at odds with their Archbishop on welfare spending, argued the authors in a blog post published by the LSE. The article suggests that Anglicans take a positive view of English culture and ethnicity, and regard the EU as a threat to their heritage, values, identity and parliamentary sovereignty. The pair argue that British evangelicals have a more global, cosmopolitan outlook than their American counterparts, and Welby\u0027s views reflect the views of British evangelicalism more generally. .html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only

LeedsEarlier polls carried out by Professor Woodhead in 2013 show that Church of England Christians are centre-Right politically, but liberal in terms of personal morality, and take a negative view of the EU, with a quarter stating that they can see no benefit at all in being a member. Active churchgoers, a small group among those who identify as Anglicans, are more likely to say they voted Remain, but are still in a minority. Separate polling carried out for the Westminster Faith Debates four years ago found that 60 per cent of Anglicans think the welfare budget is too high. In a recent speech to launch an IPPR report the Archbishop of Canterbury argued that higher taxes were needed to improve society.  In this week\u0027s Church Times Nick Baines, the bishop of Leeds, who leads on Europe for the Lord Spiritual, said church leaders should tell the truth about Brexit regardless of “what people think they want to hear. He added: Having been involved in the detail of the legislation, and having listened to hours of debate, I can see Brexit turning out only to be bad for the country — especially for the poorest communities — and bad for Europe.Church of EnglandPlease review our

walked into a telephone box on the seafront to call her parents at their home in south London. Jessie had that week received good results in a college assessment, and was looking forward to the visit of a penfriend from Australia. She told her mother she would be home on Friday.On Friday night there was no sign of Jessie. ‘We thought she must have missed the last train,’ her mother Valerie says. ‘But in the morning there was still no phone call. So I went shopping and came back, and I just thought, there’s something not right. I said to John, “I’m going to go down to Eastbourne.”’At the house...To continue reading this articleStart your free trial of PremiumAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekAccess one Premium article per weekRegister for freeAlready have an account?

mostly those requiring work with various chemicals, heavy machinery or complex vehicles - that are considered dangerous for women’s health. It was adopted in 1974 and last revised in 2000. According to Mr Topilin, women will now be allowed to take jobs in six out of these 39 categories: bread-making, sea, river, air and railway transport, driving heavy trucks and specialised vehicles. It wasn’t immediately clear which professions in particular will be taken off the list. At the moment, women are not allowed to do work that involves operating heavy machinery in baking, being a member of deck and engine crews on ships, driving different kinds of trains and doing certain types of maintenance work on trains, planes and ships. Svetlana Medvedeva finally wins her battle to become a ship captain on the seas“Adopting an amended list will give women more job opportunities,” Mr Topilin was quoted by the TASS news agency as saying. “A decree to that effect will be signed in the nearest future.”The minister said it was important to revise the list as the job market tightened - for women and men - because of the increasing role of technology and modern equipment in production. The issue of professions that are banned for women in Russia made headlines in 2016, when the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women sided with 30-year-old Svetlana Medvedeva, who had been trying to become a ship captain since 2012. Ms Medvedeva studied to become a navigation officer and hoped to become a captain one day. She worked as a sailor, but when she applied to become a captain of a private passenger ship in Russia’s southern city of Samara, the employer turned her down, citing the list.Ms Medvedeva sued the company, but to no avail. In 2013, her lawyers lodged a complaint to the UN. Three years later, the organisation sided with her and urged Russia to revise the list and eliminate discrimination. Ms Medvedeva told the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper last year that she was given the captain’s position after the UN ruling.President Vladimir Putin attends a conference of the Eurasian Women\u0026#39s Forum which campaigns for women\u0026#39s rights in modern societyMr Topilin said on Friday that in addition to revising the list the government will continue to work on closing gender pay gap, which is almost 30 percent in Russia. “The gender pay gap shortened from 36.8 percent in 2001 to 28.3 percent in 2017. It is necessary to continue working on closing it,” he said.Please review our commenting policyTheresa May\u0026#39s tactics left EU leaders \u0026#39shocked\u0026#39 - and Donald Tusk deeply unconvincedComment: We should revive our treason law and put the likes of Anjem Choudary behind bars for lifeRape conviction review will only examine a fifth of casesDonald Trump breaks silence to attack Supreme Court nominee\u0026#39s accuserComment: Theresa May\u0026#39s withering riposte to the EU was the speech of her lifeJudge calls airport\u0026#39s drop-off charge a \u0026#34disgrace\u0026#34 as teacher avoids jail for driving into workerAristocrat appears in court after neighbour complains shooting events on his estate are \u0026#39too noisy\u0026#39The Greek town with serious spider websMerkel coalition under renewed pressure over U-turn on spy chief rowWHO releases \u0026#39investment case\u0026#39 for boosting economic growth and saving 30m lives over five yearsUkip civil war as Nigel Farage and party leader clash over giving Tommy Robinson membership Sign up to the \u0026#39s party conference WhatsApp updates for all the latest news, exclusives and analysisArchbishop\u0026#39s views on Brexit and welfare state are opposite to most ordinary Anglicans, poll suggests \u0026#39Theresa May is embarrassing\u0026#39 - Our readers react to this week\u0026#39s top stories Defiant Theresa May tells EU \u0026#39show us some respect\u0026#39 as she refuses to back down on Brexit planSarah drops out of top 100 baby names for first time in over a centuryDozens of child migrants forced to sleep in police stations as Barcelona\u0026#39s reception centres full Comment: Labour can\u0026#39t risk backing a second referendum if the PM rallies the public against the mocking EUEuropean Court to rule whether MPs can unilaterally cancel BrexitWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"something has gone wrong now class 24 year olds children","story":"Structural obstacles prevent the young from being actors in their own livesParents need to stop infantilising their offspring By the time she was 25, the Virgin Queen had suffered years of house arrest, survived several attempts on her life, and was reigning as England’s monarch.

Oliver has been the most popular boys\u0027 name since 2013 while Olivia replaced Amelia in top place in 2016.Olivia was the most popular name for baby girls in each of the nine English regions in 2017 as well as in Wales, with Amelia the second favourite everywhere except the South West of England where Isla was in second.Although Oliver did rank top nationally, unlike Olivia, it was not universally popular. Muhammad was the top boys\u0027 name in London, Yorkshire and the Humber and the West Midlands while Harry was top in the North East for boys for the second year running.There was relatively little movement in the top 10 spots for both boys and girls. Lily replaced Poppy in the top 10 girls’ names for England and Wales in 2017, compared with 2015. Leo replaced Thomas in the top 10 for boys’ names for England and Wales in 2017, compared with 2016.The statistics, compiled by the ONS, are derived from the names as they appear on the birth certificate of the child and, as such, don\u0027t factor in differing or similar pronunciations.

Grouping names with similar pronunciation would change the rankings.Nick Stripe, Vital Statistics Outputs Branch, Office for National Statistics said: Although Oliver and Olivia remained the most popular baby names in 2017, some fascinating changes took place beneath them.Leo entered the boys’ top 10 for the first time, whilst Hunter rocketed into the top 100, also for the first time, reaching number 78.Sarah, the most popular name for baby girls throughout much of the 1970s and 1980s, dropped out of the top 100 for the first time since our records began in 1904. Brand new entries into the top 100 for girls include the names Aurora and HallieThere were only two new entries into the top 100 most popular boys’ names in 2017 for England and Wales: Hunter and Ralph replaced Aaron and Jasper, which were in the top 100 in 2016.There were six new entries in the top 100 most popular girls’ names in 2017 in England and Wales: Aurora, Orla, Edith, Bonnie, Lyla and Hallie replaced Lexi, Zoe, Maddison, Sarah, Felicity and Lydia.The influence of popular culture continues to seemingly provide inspiration for new parents.

They include other software tools such as frustration free setup, which allows new devices to be set up without fiddling with controls.The Guard feature is set by saying something to Alexa such as Alexa, I\u0027m leaving. At that point, she will start her watch – or listening – and report anything unusual.As well as listening out, Alexa can also turn lights on and off in a randomised way that makes it appear that someone is still in the house. And it will connect up with alarm systems from companies like Amazon-owned Ring to make sure all of those tools are working together.As well as listening out for suspect noises, Alexa will also check to see if users are whispering. If they are, it will start to listen too, ensuring that it doesn\u0027t wake people up.Amazon said that both of those listening features rely on advanced artificial intelligence that has been trained in detailed ways to recognise those sounds and react to them.Other new Alexa features announced at the same event include Hunches. That allows the assistant to learn about how you use your house, and warn you if you seem to be deviating in a usual way – if it sees you\u0027re going to bed but have left your living room light on, for instance, it will alert you and ask if it needs to be turned off.And in the event of the internet going down, which normally kills all the feature of\u0026nbspAlexa, Amazon is also introducing local voice control so that devices can still be controlled.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/21/14/pound.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/21/14/pound.jpg","title":"pound sterling latest updates brexit theresa may eu deal trade irish customs","story":"Created with Sketch.The currency fell to $1.3092\u0026nbspas the Prime Minister delivered a special statement in Downing Street after her Chequers Brexit plan was rejected by EU leaders in SalzburgClick to followThe IndependentWithout an agreement on the Irish backstop the UK risks an economically disastrous rupture with the EU on 29 March next yearPound sterling slumps as Theresa May admits \u0027impasse\u0027 in Brexit negotiationsThe pound plummeted on Friday as Theresa May admitted that the Brexit talks have reached an “impasse” and angrily criticised the EU for its “unacceptable” rejection of her own Chequers plan in Salzburg this week.The currency dipped to $1.3092\u0026nbspas the Prime Minister delivered a special statement in Downing Street, down 1.3\u0026nbspper cent on the day.Sterling jumps as Barnier says Brexit deal by November is ‘realistic’Pound rises after EU says it is ‘determined’ to reach Brexit dealSterling recovers as Germany softens stance on Brexit trade dealThis put sterling on course for its biggest one-day drop against the US currency so far in 2018, according to the Reuters news agency.Against the euro\u0026nbspthe pound slipped 1.11 per cent to $1.1138.Ms May also, once again, firmly ruled out the European Union proposal for customs checks in the Irish sea as a Brexit backstop to avoid a hard border on the island.“We are at an impasse,” she said.\u0026nbsp”I will not overturn the result of the referendum nor will I break up my country”.Either there is compromise or a no-deal but the risks of no-deal have risen, said Sarah Hewin of Standard Chartered.Sharpest one-day fall of 2018?Ms May was speaking a day after EU leaders in Salzburg brutally\u0026nbsprejected her plan for future trade arrangements and dealing with the Northern Irish border put together, at the cost of losing two Cabinet ministers, in her official country residence of Chequers over the summer.Without an agreement on the Irish backstop the UK risks an economically disastrous rupture with the EU on 29 March next year.In a sign of just how much the Salzburg rebuttal has rattled the Prime Minister, she said it was “not acceptable” for the EU to reject her plan with no alternative at such a late stage.“Throughout this process I have treated the EU with nothing but respect. The UK expects the same, a good relationship at the end of this process depends on it,” she said.“At this late stage in the negotiations, it is not acceptable to simply reject the other side’s proposals without a detailed explanation and counter proposals.

It would also risk collapsing her Government, since Northern Ireland’s DUP, on whose votes her government relies, also vehemently rejects the proposal.In her statement, the Prime Minister said it would mean Northern Ireland would be “permanently separated economically from the rest of the UK by a border down the Irish Sea” and that no UK prime minister would ever agree to that“If the EU believe I will, they are making a fundamental mistake,” she said.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/21/10/gettyimages-1037046240.jpg","title":"iphone xs deals buy order uk networks pay monthly ee three virgin","story":"Created with Sketch.The iPhone XS Max and the iPhone XS on display at the Apple Regent Street store during their launch on September 21, 2018 in London, England.EE, Three, Virgin Mobile and other UK carriers are scrambling to offer the cheapest way to get buy\u0026nbspApple\u0027s new handsetsClick to followThe Independent TechThe\u0026nbspnew iPhone Xs and Xs Max are finally available to buy in the UK, just over a week after Apple unveiled its most-expensive ever handsets.Apple showed off a whole host of new features in its launch event: upgraded camera smarts, a stunning new gold colour, and improvements to the speed and performance of the phone. But they come at a cost, and one that is not easy to swallow.And from Friday the Xs and Xs Max have gone on sale in the UK and around the world, meaning UK networks are battling to offer customers the best deals on the new iPhones.(The iPhone Xr, which might offer considerably better value for money, is not going to be released until October. It might be well worth waiting for: it has many of the same features as the Xs, but starts at £749 rather than £999.)Here are the various ways to buy an iPhone Xs now.Buying a phone is not necessarily the cheapest way of buying an iPhone, and it requires you to have the most amount of money to hand. But the flip side is that you get everything sorted out in one go, you won\u0027t have payments hanging over your head, and you\u0027re free to do what you want with the phone.iPhone XS launch in September 2018111 Tim Cook speaks about the iPhone XS and XS MaxTim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks about the iPhone XS and XS Max at an Apple Inc product launch event 211 Tim Cook speaking at the iPhone launchTim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks on stage at the end of the Apple Inc311 Tim Cook speaking during the event411 Phil Schiller, Apple\u0027s senior vice president of worldwide marketingPhil Schiller, Apple\u0027s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, speaks about the Apple iPhone XS and Apple iPhone XS Max511 Phil Schiller speaks about the new iPhone XRPhilip W.

So it can be worth going through your network, and paying upfront for the phone with them while still committing to a phone plan.If you\u0027re on the other side of that situation – you don\u0027t want to pay upfront at all, and offset the cost through the length of the plan – then there are plenty of ways to do that. Obviously, you will pay for it in that the price over the two years will add up to significantly more, but you\u0027ll also have the benefit of never having to make such a significant outlay.There are plenty of networks offering limited upfront payments, such as Virgin Mobile, which claims to have the cheapest deal with no upfront costs. You can get the Xs for £41 per month without any initial payment, and pay an extra £9 for a full 50GB per month.The least painful way to get the iPhone Xs or Xs Max is probably to go somewhere in between. Which is best will depend on how much you want to pay upfront and what sort of allowances you want, of course, but the networks are falling over themselves to offer you deals on the new phone.Three, for instance, is asking for £59 for all you can eat data with a £99 payment at the beginning. It\u0027s not the cheapest deal, but unlimited data is rare, and it is decent.The Max is £5 more from Three. And you can add another £6 on top per month to get some AirPods, too.If you\u0027re concerned about committing for two years – especially when next year\u0027s iPhone is likely to offer more spectacular upgrades than the Xs – then you might want to consider Sky Mobile, which allows people to upgrade every year with its Swap12 plan.\u0026nbspThe Xs starts at £59 per month on that plan, with a £99 upfront payment.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/21/14/pound.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/21/14/pound.jpg","title":"pound sterling latest updates brexit theresa may eu deal trade irish customs","story":"Created with Sketch.The currency fell to $1.3092\u0026nbspas the Prime Minister delivered a special statement in Downing Street after her Chequers Brexit plan was rejected by EU leaders in SalzburgClick to followThe IndependentWithout an agreement on the Irish backstop the UK risks an economically disastrous rupture with the EU on 29 March next yearPound sterling slumps as Theresa May admits \u0027impasse\u0027 in Brexit negotiationsThe pound plummeted on Friday as Theresa May admitted that the Brexit talks have reached an “impasse” and angrily criticised the EU for its “unacceptable” rejection of her own Chequers plan in Salzburg this week.The currency dipped to $1.3092\u0026nbspas the Prime Minister delivered a special statement in Downing Street, down 1.3\u0026nbspper cent on the day.Sterling jumps as Barnier says Brexit deal by November is ‘realistic’Pound rises after EU says it is ‘determined’ to reach Brexit dealSterling recovers as Germany softens stance on Brexit trade dealThis put sterling on course for its biggest one-day drop against the US currency so far in 2018, according to the Reuters news agency.Against the euro\u0026nbspthe pound slipped 1.11 per cent to $1.1138.Ms May also, once again, firmly ruled out the European Union proposal for customs checks in the Irish sea as a Brexit backstop to avoid a hard border on the island.“We are at an impasse,” she said.\u0026nbsp”I will not overturn the result of the referendum nor will I break up my country”.Either there is compromise or a no-deal but the risks of no-deal have risen, said Sarah Hewin of Standard Chartered.Sharpest one-day fall of 2018?Ms May was speaking a day after EU leaders in Salzburg brutally\u0026nbsprejected her plan for future trade arrangements and dealing with the Northern Irish border put together, at the cost of losing two Cabinet ministers, in her official country residence of Chequers over the summer.Without an agreement on the Irish backstop the UK risks an economically disastrous rupture with the EU on 29 March next year.In a sign of just how much the Salzburg rebuttal has rattled the Prime Minister, she said it was “not acceptable” for the EU to reject her plan with no alternative at such a late stage.“Throughout this process I have treated the EU with nothing but respect.

After recent collaborations with\u0026nbspCardi\u0026nbspB,\u0026nbspSZA,\u0026nbspFuture, and\u0026nbspKendrick Lamar, speculation is rife about who, if anyone, the California band might collaborate with.\u0026nbsp “We very actively want to play the Super Bowl,” Levine said in a 2015 interview, via the Hollywood Reporter.\u0026nbspIn February 2015, Katy Perry set the halftime viewership record when 120.7 million people tuned-in during Super Bowl XLIX.

A substantial minority of Labour supporters voted Leave in 2016. Many Labour MPs fear that support for a referendum could cost them votes at the next election.“YouGov’s figures do not bear this out. Of the YouGov respondents who currently support Labour and voted Leave in the Brexit referendum, only 6 per cent put Brexit at the top of their concerns and say they would not, or be less likely to, vote Labour if the party backed a popular vote.“This is just two per cent of all Labour supporters, or just over 200,000 voters\u0026nbspin all.”All 27 EU leaders believe May\u0027s Brexit trade plan \u0027will not work\u0027The best comments from the Reddit AMA with Alastair Campbell\u0027It\u0027s ok to change your mind over Brexit\u0027, explains new short filmLabour could stop Brexit from destroying Britain\u0027s heartlandsProsecco exports from Italy to UK fall for first time in 10 yearsMacron urges EU leaders to stand firm against May in Brexit talksHe explained that once these voters were subtracted from those gained by a pledge to back a new referendum, the net increase is some 1.5 million\u0026nbspvotes.Mr Kellner added: “Like all such hypothetical exercises, different ways of asking the questions and doing the sums will yield different results.“But the nine-to-one gulf between the non-Labour target voters and the at-risk Labour supporters leaves no doubt that by backing a popular vote on Brexit, the party would end up making significant gains in votes and seats. In a tight general election, it could make the difference between returning to government and remaining in opposition.”With those figures layered on the whole country, Labour would stand to gain around 60 seats across the UK.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina

by the group Represent Us, drilled down into specific constituencies by polling in 107 marginal seats across the UK with a majority of less than 3,500.Across the 82 seats in England and Wales it found Labour would leapfrog the Tories in vote share with a pledge to back the new vote, going from a point behind in 2017 to a point in front, down in large part to stealing support from the Liberal Democrats.That would indicate Labour holding its 35 most marginal seats in England and Wales and winning a further 16 from the Conservatives – despite at least 38 of these having backed Leave in 2016.Backing a new referendum would also allow Labour to minimise potential losses against a dominant SNP in Scotland, according to the ICM data.Dozens of motions have been tabled ahead of Labour’s conference in Liverpool in a bid to get the party to vote on backing a new referendum on Brexit, with several unions having already thrown their weight behind the idea in the run up.There is also set to be a rally for a People’s Vote on Sunday in Liverpool right outside the party’s main conference event.The Independent understands that the leadership will likely stick to its commitment to keep the option of a vote on the table, without giving explicit support to one.Labour MP for Tottenham David Lammy urged his party to back a new referendum, saying: “What these figures show is that supporting a People’s Vote is also the right thing for the party to do if we want\u0026nbspto win a general election.“This should concentrate some minds at our conference in Liverpool next week.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account

cherrypicking","story":"Created with Sketch.Prime Minister offered to have her cake or eat itClick to followIndy PoliticsRelated video: All 27 EU leaders believe Theresa May\u0027s Brexit trade plan \u0027will not work’, says Donald TuskEU council president mocks Theresa May on Instagram with \u0027cake\u0027 gag after Salzburg humiliationThe president of the European Council has rubbed salt into the wounds of Theresa May’s Brexit humiliation in Salzburg by mocking her negotiating strategy on Instagram.\u0026nbspDuring the summit Donald Tusk ushered the Prime Minister over to a strategically positioned tray of cakes and offered her a morsel to eat.It was only after the closing of proceedings that it became clear that the former Polish prime minister had something else in mind than Ms May’s appetite.He posted a picture on Instagram of the prime minister and himself at the cake stand with the caption: “A piece of cake, perhaps? Sorry, no cherries.”The rinsing is a reference to a running joke in Brussels that Britain wants to “have its cake and eat it” in talks. The UK has also been accused of “cherrypicking” because it wants to stay in the parts of the single market it likes but not the parts it doesn’t like.The EU insists that its single market can only be taken as a package at a press conference concluding the summit on Thursday Mr Tusk said all 27 EU leaders agreed that Ms May’s Chequers plan could not work, not least because it cherry-picked the single market.The “cake” gag originated after Boris Johnson proclaimed that Britain could “have its cake and eat it” – comments which were seized upon by EU leaders and officials.The “philosophy of cake”, as Mr Tusk has previously described it, has also now more generally entered the Brussels lexicon in areas beyond Brexit as a description of a negotiating party being unreasonable and wanting advantages without responsibilities.The Prime Minister was visibly shaking and upset at her press conference at the end of the Salzburg meeting following the full-throated rejection of her plan by the other EU leaders, which sources ahead of the summit did not expect in such vivid terms.\u0026nbspBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

The results of our analysis have been known to the British side in every detail for many weeks. After intensive consultations with Member States, we decided that for the good of the negotiations, and out of respect for the efforts of PM May, we will treat the Chequers plan as a step in the right direction.”Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

No, because we are entering the final phase of those negotiations to get the deal and we remain resolute in getting that and getting that deal for our country.”Mr Brokenshire\u0026nbspinsisted that Ms May\u0027s plan was still the only viable option as the EU\u0027s preferred option would risk breaking up the United Kingdom by creating a hard border in Ireland.The easy thing for the prime minister to do would be to go with one of those two options that are being proffered, he said.EEA, which does not deliver on what the people voted for in the EU referendum on freedom of movement, or Canada, which would effectively break up the UK.Woman set to become UK\u0027s first Roma barrister on Brexit insecurityWe are so bored with Brexit we\u0027ll agree to anythingMacron calls Brexit campaign leaders \u0027liars\u0027, in extraordinary attack\u0027It\u0027s ok to change your mind over Brexit\u0027, explains new short filmLabour could stop Brexit from destroying Britain\u0027s heartlandsThe Chequers deal is a workable, credible deal to meet our ambitions.They have said that it\u0027s about the integrity of the single market and we believe the Chequers deal responds to that, and it\u0027s for the EU to engage with what\u0027s on the table, which is actually Chequers Two.The government is preparing hard for a no-deal Brexit if the impasse over Northern Ireland cannot be broken, said fellow cabinet minister Chris Grayling.The transport secretary told Newsnight:\u0026nbspWe\u0027re not going to accept a border between Northern Ireland\u0026nbspand the rest of the United Kingdom.We are now preparing hard for the option of a no-deal Brexit.

\u0027unacceptable\u0027 and demands European leaders show UK respect in Brexit talksTheresa May has demanded EU leaders show Britain respect, branding their public rejection of her Brexit proposals “not acceptable”.In a statement at Downing Street, the prime minister hit out at the way European Council president Donald Tusk discarded her plans without giving a detailed explanation or offering alternatives.Ms\u0026nbspMay said neither of the options previously offered by the EU were acceptable, stated\u0026nbspthat talks are now at an “impasse” and\u0026nbspunderlined her willingness to walk away if needs be\u0026nbsp– finishing with the words “we stand ready”.But the prime minister also made a new pledge to guarantee the rights of EU citizens living and working in the UK, even in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspHer intervention won approval from cabinet Brexiteers and, to an extent, from MPs on Conservative benches, steadying a volatile political situation which hours earlier had seen critics predicting the collapse of her strategy.Mr Tusk had surprised British officials by making an unexpectedly strong statement at the end of a summit in Salzburg this week, saying Ms May’s proposals for Brexit “will not work” and following\u0026nbspit up with a social media post mocking her negotiating strategy.With pressure mounting, Ms May\u0026nbspacknowledged from inside No 10 that Mr Tusk said the UK proposals would undermine the single market, but added: “He didn’t explain how in any detail or make any counter-proposal.\u0026nbspSo we are at an impasse.”She said: “Throughout this process, I have treated the EU with nothing but respect.\u0026nbspThe UK expects the same.\u0026nbspA good relationship at the end of this process depends on it.“At this late stage in the negotiations, it is not acceptable to simply reject the other side’s proposals without a detailed explanation and counter proposals.Throughout this process, I have treated the EU with nothing but respect.\u0026nbsp The UK expects the same. A good relationship at the end of this process depends on it.“So we now need to hear from the EU what the real issues are and what their alternative is so that we can discuss them.\u0026nbspUntil we do, we cannot make progress.”The prime minister said she would continue preparing a no-deal scenario, but with it looking like a more likely outcome then ever, she went on to make a new commitment to the three million EU citizens currently living in the UK.She said that even in the event of no deal\u0026nbsptheir rights would be protected, calling them “our friends, our neighbours, our colleagues”.Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Sorry, no cherries.”It is a reference to a running joke in Brussels that Britain wants to “have its cake and eat it” in talks, while Britain has also been accused of “cherrypicking” because it wants to stay in parts of the single market but not others.Ms May said in her statement that the EU’s first offer, of staying inside the European Economic Area and customs union, would make a mockery of the referendum result.She said that the second EU plan, of a trade deal, but with Northern Ireland effectively remaining\u0026nbspin the single market and customs union, had already been unanimously rejected by parliament.The prime minister went on: “It is something I will never agree to – indeed, in my judgement it is something no British prime minister would ever agree to.\u0026nbspIf the EU believe I will, they are making a fundamental mistake.“Anything which fails to respect the referendum or which effectively ides our country in two would be a bad deal and I have always said no deal is better than a bad deal.”She won some support from cabinet Brexiteer Penny Mordaunt, one minister who is rumoured to have been be unhappy wit the PM’s broad approach.Ms Mordaunt\u0026nbsptweeted: “Speaking to constituents today, it is clear that EUs behaviour in recent days is increasing support for us leaving the EU.”She added: “Ppl still want a deal but content to go without one, even folk who voted remain.

This makes the prime minister’s task harder and she is right to remind them that no deal is better than a bad deal.”Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\u0026nbspargued\u0026nbspthat the prime minister had shown herself to be “incapable of delivering a good Brexit deal”.He said: “Theresa May’s Brexit negotiating strategy has been a disaster. The Tories have spent more time arguing among themselves than negotiating with the EU.“From day one, the prime minister has looked incapable of delivering a good Brexit deal for Britain.“The political games from both the EU and our government need to end because no deal is not an option.”Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general, urged Brexit negotiators on both sides to change tack.She said: “The events of the last 24 hours have made one thing abundantly clear – negotiators on both sides must change tack. Rejection of Chequers helps nobody.“The stakes could not be higher. Jobs, wages and living standards are at risk, on both sides of the Channel.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/19/09/fur-ban-la.jpg","title":"la fur ban los angeles sale san francisco california","story":"Created with Sketch.Supporters hope action will encourage similar bans around globeClick to followThe Independent USThe proposed law is backed by animal activists, who say that the multimillion-dollar fur industry is rife with cruelty Los Angeles is taking steps to become the largest US city to ban the sale of new fur products.Following the lead of San Francisco and two smaller California municipalities, Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously to direct the city attorney to draft legislation banning the manufacture and sale of fur clothing and accessories.“This is something that is not just a good legislative win, it’s a moral win,” councillor Bob Blumenfield said. “We feel like we’re evolving as a city, as people to stop this kind of unnecessary cruelty.”\u0026nbspThe draft bill\u0026nbspmust gain final approval by the council and then be signed by the mayor, Eric Garcetti, to be enacted.Supporters said they hoped adopting a fur ban in the nation’s second largest city, which is also one of the world’s major fashion centres, would encourage similar bans around the globe.“Los Angeles is one of the fashion capitals of the world, and if we can do it here, we can do it anywhere,” councillor\u0026nbspPaul Koretz, a sponsor of the measure, told a news conference before the vote. “We hope that New York City and Chicago and Miami are all watching.”Under the plan tentatively approved on Tuesday, a fur ban would go into effect in January and be phased in over two years, giving retailers until 2020 to sell off existing inventories. Used fur products would be exempt.The council is considering an exemption for products used for religious purposes, such as fur hats worn by Orthodox Jews,\u0026nbspas well as for items made from pelts legally taken under the authority of a California fur-trapping license.Major fashion companies, including Michael Kors, Armani and Gucci, have also moved away from using fur. Earlier this month, Burberry said it would stop selling real fur.\u0026nbspActivists have condemned the fur industry as inhumane, arguing that the animals are subject to brutal conditions and torturous deaths.However, Keith Kaplan, a spokesman for the Fur Information Council of America, said that while full-length coats of sable and mink may not be as popular as they once were, fur is still found in around 70 per cent of the world’s latest autumn fashion collections.“If consumers weren’t buying it, fashion houses wouldn’t be designing it, and manufacturers wouldn’t be making it,” he said.He also disputed as “bogus” claims by animal rights groups that the methods employed by the fur industry are inherently cruel and inhumane.Retail fur sales globally accounted for $35.8bn (£27.2bn), and the fur industry employed more than one\u0026nbspmillion people in 2014, the latest year figures were available from the industry, Mr Kaplan said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMPs to ban import of animal furResponding to news of the ban, Humane Society International (HSI) called on the British government to work towards making the UK the first country in the world to ban the sale of animal fur.Farming fur was made illegal in the UK in 2000, and EU law bans fur from domestic cats, dogs and hunted seals. However, Britain imports fur from other species including foxes and rabbits.Claire Bass, HSI UK’s executive director, said:\u0026nbsp“A cruel product like fur has no place in the City of Angels, and we applaud the Los Angeles City council for taking a moral stand.“Now it is time for the UK government to show equal compassion and listen to the vast majority of British people who want the UK to become the first country in the world to fully ban the sale of animal fur.“Our government has stated its ambition for the UK\u0026nbspto be ‘a world leader in animal welfare’, blazing a trail as the first country to outlaw the cruel and unnecessary fur trade would show that this ambition will be delivered with actions, not just words. The sale of cat, dog and seal fur is already banned here so now let’s finish the job and ban fur full stop.”Additional reporting by agenciesEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/21/14/venezuela-passport-office.jpg","title":"venezuela passport leave economy maduro colombia border immigration","story":"Created with Sketch.UN says 2.3 million people have left the country since 2015, but those without a passport are unable to escapeClick to followThe Independent USPeople wait in line outside Saime offices in Caracas  After a year struggling to make ends meet under Venezuela’s crushing hyperinflation, Jennyfer and her boyfriend decided to flee the country. Everything was ready, except a small but important detail: Jennyfer’s passport.It is now five months since Jennyfer Avero applied for her travel document. But, until today, the 23-year-old craftswoman from Caracas hasn’t anything about the state of her request.\u0026nbspLast month, her boyfriend Javier left for\u0026nbspEcuador, becoming part of one of the biggest exoduses in Latin American history. And in the meantime, Jennyfer continues to wait, hoping she will join him soon.“I have no alternative,” she says. “I wouldn’t like to leave without a passport.”Venezuela’s intensifying economic and political crisis has pushed hundreds of thousands to flee the country. They are in search of food, security, medicine and jobs.But not everyone\u0026nbspthat makes the decision to leave has a valid passport. Venezuelans face multiple difficulties when trying to obtain this document. Some people can wait months, or even years, to get it. The process can be complicated, expensive and sometimes illegal.Day after day crowds queue up outside the headquarters of the passport agency, known as Saime, in Caracas.Saime has more than 200 offices nationwide, however many people come to the headquarters in Caracas hoping to get a passport. Here the possibilities are greater, users say.Everyone is here – women, children, couples and elderly people. Some arrived before dawn\u0026nbspothers, those who came from afar, spent the night here. Much of them share the desire to leave the country for good.“This is the fourth time in three months I’ve come here,” says Jose Di Marco, while standing in line.Di Marco travelled 713km by bus from the town of Puerto Ordaz to Caracas. For the second consecutive day, the 20-year-old student has been sleeping at a nearby square to avoid losing his spot in the queue.He should be travelling to Ecuador at the end of the month. He has been awarded a full scholarship to study performing arts, but if he doesn’t arrive in time it will be taken away.Without answers about the status of his application, which he has been processing since 2016, he’s starting to feel desperate.“I’ve thought about leaving without a passport, I can’t waste more time,” he says.AFPGetty Images)The passport system began to fail two years ago. In theory, the process is easy. It’s done through a web page in which the citizen requests an appointment, attends the appointment and is given the passport within a couple of weeks. But often, users say, the website crashes and the appointment gets cancelled or people’s data just disappears from the system.“It’s as if I had never attended the appointment,” says Delia Cabral, 52, whose data disappeared from the website after she went to her meeting.The accountant has been waiting since May for her passport. Her daughter is waiting for her in Spain.It’s as if I had never attended the appointment\u0026nbspExperts say that Caracas’s telecommunication infrastructure is one of the weakest in the region, so it is not surprising that high-traffic websites collapse.In July, a new head of Saime was named. He promised a complete renovation of the website, as well as a profound restructuring of the organisation. However, the system still seems to be failing.The passport agency has blamed shortages of materials, like paper and plastic, for the delays.Venezuela has been suffering from shortages of food, medicines and other basic goods for many years now. The lack of passports is just one of them.The legal price of a passport in Venezuela is 18 bolivars, or $0.30 (£0.23) at the black market exchange rate. However, tired of waiting, some Venezuelans choose to pay for the service of officials who can speed up the process for $1,000, at the very least. A prohibitively expensive amount for most Venezuelans,given the monthly minimum wage is $18.Maduro urges Venezuelan migrants to return home from ‘economic slavery’ in other countriesThis is an illegal practice for which several Saime officials have been arrested in recent months. The institution also blames those members of the “mafia”\u0026nbspinside the passport agency for the delays.The economic and social crisis has become so unbearable that hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans consider escaping the country to be their only option – a feeling that has only increased over the past few months.President Nicolas Maduro denies the existence of a migration crisis and blames his critics for inflating the numbers.The government typically does not publish data, but the UN estimates that 2.3 million Venezuelans have fled the country since 2015, especially to neighbouring countries like Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil. In August, the UN warned the migration exodus was reaching a “crisis moment”,\u0026nbspakin to the situation in Mediterranean.\u0026nbspLast month, Ecuador and Peru tightened their migration controls for Venezuelans, requiring them to show valid passports at the border. That decision left many Venezuelans who had been travelling without passports in limbo.The measure was later overturned. Over recent weeks, 11 Latin American countries agreed to allow Venezuelans to enter their countries even if their passports have expired.While this is a relief for those who haven’t been able to renew their travel documents, nothing changes for those who have never had a passport, like Jennyfer.“It makes no difference for me,” she says “I’m still stuck in here.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/10/08/muslims-china.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1875  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/10/08/muslims-china.jpg","title":"china uighurs human rights muslims orphanages xinjiang province reeducation","story":"Created with Sketch.‘It’s like my kids are in jail,’\u0026nbspsays 29-year-old mother living in exileStaff and agenciesClick to followThe IndependentChina is putting Uighur children in \u0027orphanages\u0027 even if their parents are aliveChinese authorities are putting the children of Uighurs and other ethnic minority groups into dozens of state-run orphanages across the western Xinjiang region even if their parents are not dead, as some 1 million adults in their families are sent to internment camps.The orphanages are the most recent manifestation of Beijing’s efforts to systematically distance young Muslims in Xinjiang from their families and culture. Uighurs fear such efforts are erasing their ethnic identity, one child at a time.\u0026nbspIn Istanbul,\u0026nbspa dozen Uighur families spoke to reporters during the Muslim holy festival Eid al-Adha, which comes with large family reunions. Tables in every home were resplendent with traditional Xinjiang dishes like homemade noodles, freshly butchered lamb and crispy naan.\u0026nbspBut the Uighurs who fled China to avoid detention described the\u0026nbsppainful absence of the children they left behind – who they believe are now in the hands of the very government tearing their families apart.\u0026nbspSome did not want their full names used for fear of retribution against relatives still in Xinjiang.Every morning, Meripet wakes up to her nightmare: the Chinese government has turned four of her children into orphans, even though she and their father are alive.\u0026nbspMeripet and her husband left the kids with their grandmother at home in China when they went to nurse Meripet’s sick father in Turkey. But after Chinese authorities started locking up thousands of their fellow ethnic Uighurs for alleged subversive crimes such as travel abroad, that\u0026nbspvisit became exile.\u0026nbspThen\u0026nbspher mother-in-law was also taken prisoner, and Meripet learned from a friend that her offspring, aged between three and eight,\u0026nbsphad been placed in a de facto orphanage in the Xinjiang region\u0026nbspunder the care of the state that broke up her family.\u0026nbsp“It’s like my kids are in jail,” Meripet said, her voice cracking. “My four children are separated from me and living like orphans.”\u0026nbspMeripet’s family is among tens of thousands swept up by President Xi Jinping‘s campaign to subdue a sometimes restive region, including the internment of more than 1 million Uighurs and other Muslim minorities that has alarmed a United Nations panel and the US\u0026nbspgovernment. The UK Foreign Office also believes Beijing has “introduced intrusive security and surveillance measures and cultural restrictions” aimed at the Uighur people, including “re-education camps”.Now there is evidence that the government is placing the children of detainees and exiles into dozens of orphanages across Xinjiang.\u0026nbspThe institutions are the latest example of how China is systematically distancing young Muslims in Xinjiang from their families and culture,\u0026nbspinterviews with more than a dozen people and a review of procurement documents suggest. The government has been building thousands of so-called “bilingual” schools, where minority children are taught in Mandarin and penalised for speaking in their native tongues. Some of these are boarding schools, which Uighurs say can be mandatory for children and, in one Kazakh family’s case, start from the age of five.\u0026nbspBut Uighurs fear that these measures are essentially wiping out their ethnic identity, one child at a time. Experts say what China is doing echoes how white colonialists in the US, Canada and Australia treated indigenous children – policies that have left generations traumatised.\u0026nbsp“This is an ethnic group whose knowledge base is being erased,” said Darren Byler, a researcher of Uighur culture at University of Washington. “What we’re looking at is something like a settler colonial situation where an entire generation is lost.”\u0026nbspFor Meripet, the loss is agony it is the absence of her children and the knowledge they are in state custody. A year and a half after leaving home, the 29-year-old mother looked at a photo of a brightly painted building surrounded by barbed wire where her children are believed to be held. She fell silent. And then she wept.\u0026nbsp“When I finally see them again, will they even recognise me?” she asked. “Will I recognise them?”\u0026nbspWhen Mr Xi came to power in 2012, an early challenge to his rule was a surge in violent attacks that killed several hundred people and which Beijing pinned on Uighur separatists. Since then, he\u0026nbsphas overseen the most extensive effort in recent years to quell Xinjiang, appointing in 2016 the former Tibet party boss Chen Quanguo to lead the troubled region bordering Afghanistan.\u0026nbspChen rolled out unprecedented security measures such as the internment camps that hold Muslims without trial and force them to renounce their faith and swear loyalty to the ruling Communist Party. China has described religious extremism as an illness that needs to be cured through what it calls “transformation through education”. Former detainees say one can be thrown into a camp for praying regularly, reading the Quran, going abroad or even speaking to someone overseas.\u0026nbspThe camps are among the most troubling aspects of Mr Xi’s campaign to assert the party’s dominance over all aspects of Chinese life, which has drawn comparisons with Mao Zedong. Authorities heeding Mr Xi’s call to “Sinicise” religion across the country have shut underground churches, burnt\u0026nbspBibles, replaced pictures of Jesus with ones of the president, and toppled crescents from mosques. The party also has beefed up its ability to track the movements of its 1.4 billion people, with Xinjiang serving as an important testing ground.\u0026nbspIn Xinjiang, detention has left countless children without their parents. Most of these families in China cannot be reached by journalists. However, reporters interviewed 14 Uighur families living in Turkey and one Kazakh man in Almaty with a total of 56 children who remain in China.\u0026nbspThe families say that among these children, 14 are known to be in state-run orphanages and boarding schools. The whereabouts of the rest are unknown because most of their adult relatives in Xinjiang have been detained.\u0026nbspSome interviewees, like Meripet, requested that they be identified only by their first names because they feared official retaliation against their relatives. Others insisted their full names be used despite the risks, saying they were desperate for their stories to be heard. They pleaded with reporters to track down their families in Xinjiang, and one interviewee pressed a piece of paper into a reporter’s hand with a Chinese address scribbled on it.\u0026nbspThe regional government appears to be moving quickly to build centres to house the children of these exiles and of detainees. A review of procurement notices in Xinjiang has found that since the start of last year, the government has budgeted more than $30m\u0026nbsp(200 million Chinese yuan, £22.7m) to build or expand at least 45 orphanages, known variously as “welfare centres” and “protection centres”, with enough beds to house about 5,000 children.\u0026nbspIn July and August alone, the government invited bids for the construction of at least nine centres for the “protection of disadvantaged children” in the Xinjiang city of Hotan and several counties in Kashgar, Aksu and Kizilsu prefectures, inhabited primarily by ethnic minority groups. Most orphanages have a minimum of 100 beds mandated by the government, and some are much larger. One notice called for an orphanage in Moyu county with four four-story dormitories, coming to 22,776 sq\u0026nbspmetres in size – bigger than three\u0026nbspfootball pitches.\u0026nbspThese numbers do not include kindergartens and other schools where some children of Uighur detainees are being housed. It’s impossible to tell how many children of detainees end up at these schools because they also serve other children.\u0026nbspShi Yuqing, a Kashgar civil affairs official, said that “authorities provide aid and support to everyone in need, whether they’re the children of convicted criminals or people killed in traffic accidents”. But such services may not be welcome. A government report from Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture in June last year acknowledged that relatives were resistant to “handing over” their extended families’ kids to the orphanages because they “lack trust or confidence” in the centres.\u0026nbspA friend told Meripet last November her four children were living in the Hotan City Kindness Kindergarten in southern Xinjiang. The friend said Meripet’s sister-in-law had visited her children and was permitted to take them home for one night only.\u0026nbspThe school looks like a house-sized castle, with a bright marigold facade, orange turrets and blue rooftops. Its entrance is blocked by an iron gate and a walled enclosure lined with barbed wire. “We Are Happy and Grateful to the Motherland”, say the red characters emblazoned on one fence.\u0026nbspThe principal, who gave only her last name, Ai, told reporters that the institution was “just a normal kindergarten”. But the authorities’ anxiety was clear: armed police officers surrounded the reporters’ car minutes after their arrival at the school and ordered them to delete any photos.\u0026nbspGu Li, a propaganda official for Hotan who also immediately appeared on the scene, added: “There are really young kids here – some of them may even be orphans whose parents have died.”\u0026nbspHotan City Kindness Kindergarten (AP)A report published this February in the Xinjiang Daily, a party newspaper, called Hotan City Kindness Kindergarten a “free, full-time” kindergarten for children aged six and younger that provides accommodations and clothing to those whose “parents cannot care for them for a variety of reasons”.\u0026nbsp“Soon after many of the kids arrived at the school, they grew taller and got fatter, and quickly started using Mandarin to communicate,” the article said. Another state media report in January said $1.24m had been invested in the kindergarten.\u0026nbspSatellite imagery shows that the kindergarten had been constructed less than three years ago, just as an initiative was launched to strengthen “bilingual” education in Xinjiang. More than 4,300 bilingual kindergartens were built or renovated last year, according to the government. A report on the project in a state-run regional newspaper said such kindergartens taught children “civilised living habits”.\u0026nbsp“The children started educating their parents: your hands are too dirty, your clothes are too dirty, you haven’t brushed your teeth,” the report quoted Achilem Abduwayit, a deputy chief of the Hotan city education bureau, as saying.\u0026nbspLife in an orphanage could have a lasting psychological and cultural impact on children, said James Leibold, an expert on Chinese ethnic policy at La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia.\u0026nbsp“You grow up as a ward of the state,” he said. “They’re told to be patriotic citizens, told that the identity and religion of their parents was abnormal, if not radical, and thus needs to be eradicated.”\u0026nbspMeripet has at least an inkling of where her children are. Her brother, a 37-year-old doctor named Aziz, has not heard any news of his three youngest children since his wife was taken to a re-education centre in June 2017.\u0026nbspAziz fled to Turkey more than a year ago after he received a call from his local police station ordering him to report to authorities immediately. More than half his neighbours had already been taken away to re-education centres or prison, he said.\u0026nbspNow the young doctor is often shaken awake by a nightmare in which his kids are huddling at the bottom of a cliff, their faces smudged with dirt, calling to him to hoist them up. Aziz walks for what feels like hours but cannot reach them. He awakens with their cries ringing in his ears.\u0026nbsp“If I could, I would choose not to have been born as a Uighur, to not have been born in Xinjiang,” Aziz said. “We are the most unfortunate ethnic group in the world.”\u0026nbspWorld news in picturesJapan\u0027s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe celebrates after the ruling liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leadership election at the party\u0027s headquarters in Tokyo on September 20, 2018. - Prime Minister Shinzo Abe won re-election as leader of his ruling party on September 20, setting him on course to become Japan\u0027s longest-serving premier and realise his dream of reforming the constitution.Los Angeles has moved to ban the sale of fur within its city limits.

Deadly clashes broke out earlier in the week following the release of parliamentary election results, amid allegations of fraud by Chamisa and MDC supportersThe Chinese government says all 2.9 million students attending compulsory elementary and junior high school in Xinjiang will receive Mandarin instruction by this month, up from just 39 per cent in 2016.\u0026nbspEven preschoolers are steeped in the language. A former teacher at a “bilingual” kindergarten outside Kashgar said all lessons were given in Mandarin and the entirely Uighur student body was banned from speaking Uighur at school. A colleague who used Uighur to explain concepts to students was fired, according to the teacher, who lives in Turkey but asked for anonymity because she fears retribution against family in China.\u0026nbspLike all schools in China, this one immersed children in patriotic education. Kindergarten textbooks were filled with songs like “Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China”, the teacher said.\u0026nbspDilnur, a 35-year-old business student in exile in Istanbul, said officials regularly visited her children’s kindergarten in Kashgar and asked the students if their parents read religious verses at home or participated in other faith-based activities. The questions effectively forced children to spy on their own families. A man was taken away by police after his grandson said in class that he had made a pilgrimage to Mecca, she said.\u0026nbspHer seven-year-old daughter once complained that her throat was sore from chanting party slogans. “Mama, what does it mean to love the motherland?” she asked.\u0026nbspSome bilingual schools are boarding schools, which are not uncommon in China. Xinjiang has long provided voluntary boarding school programmes that are seen as coveted opportunities for the best minority students. But several Uighurs asserted that in many cases boarding school was now mandatory for minority children, even though Han Chinese children could choose to continue living at home.\u0026nbspThe Xinjiang government did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The government has said the tuition-free boarding schools relieve parents of education and living expenses and help raise Mandarin standards, which will make their children more employable.\u0026nbspBut Uighurs say they do not want their culture erased.\u0026nbspGulzar Seley, who was detained in China along with her newborn son, is placed on a table in the home of her husband Halmurat Idris in Istanbul (AP)“If the kids are forced to speak Mandarin and live like Han Chinese every day, I’m afraid they won’t be like us anymore,” said Meriyem Yusup, whose extended family has four children sent to state-run orphanages in Xinjiang.\u0026nbspAdil Dalelkhan, an ethnic Kazakh sock merchant in exile in Almaty, said that even though his then five-year-old son could live with relatives, he was forced to stay at his preschool Monday\u0026nbspthrough Friday instead. The father called the policy a “terrifying” step towards extinguishing Kazakh culture.\u0026nbspA Uighur businessman in Istanbul, also named Adil, told a similar story. Adil’s son was nine\u0026nbspyears old when the school system automatically transferred him to a boarding school. All children of a certain age in their Uighur district were obliged to attend boarding school, Adil said. His son was only permitted to come home on weekends and holidays.\u0026nbsp“There were iron bars like we saw in a zoo in Kashgar,” Adil recalled.\u0026nbspDilnur said her neighbours too were only allowed to visit their kids at boarding school on Wednesday nights, and even then they had to hand them sweets through a fence.\u0026nbsp“The educational goals are secondary to the political goals,” said Timothy Grose, a professor at Indiana’s Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology who has done research on Xinjiang boarding schools. “They aim to dissolve loyalties to ethnic identity ... toward a national identity.”\u0026nbspA government notice posted in February in Kashgar states that children in the fourth grade and above with parents in detention must be sent to boarding school immediately – even if one parent is still at home. Students must be instilled with socialist values, the notice said, and be taught to “be grateful for education and love and repay the motherland”, and avoid the “75 types of behaviour that show religious extremism”. Such behaviour ranges from calling for “holy war” to growing beards and quitting smoking and drinking for religious reasons, the government says.\u0026nbspChina insists it guarantees\u0026nbspfreedom of religion, but Uighurs view the Chinese education system as a threat to it. In schools, children are taught to respect teachers more than their parents and may begin to criticise their parents’ Islamic faith, according to Byler.\u0026nbsp“The students, children, might question them and say, you know, this is backward, this is extremist,” he said.\u0026nbspThe Kashgar notice also said schools being modified to house students should place no more than 24 beds in one room – an indication of the programme’s size. In 2015, a sprawling new boarding school complex was completed on the outskirts of Kashgar, with the capacity to house 23,400 students and teachers, according to the state-run China Daily.\u0026nbspAbdurehim Imin, a writer from Kashgar, said a friend told him his 14-year-old daughter had been sent to a bilingual school in 2015 after his wife was arrested, ostensibly for receiving a gift of olive oil he sent her. When reporters visited what appeared to be his daughter’s school, Peyzawat County No 4 High School, a local plainclothes officer who identified herself as Gu Li said it was a bilingual boarding school. She said that while Uighur students had to study Mandarin, there were also Han Chinese students studying Uighur.\u0026nbspYet the exterior of the school bore bright red lettering that said: “Please speak Mandarin upon entering the schoolyard”. Barbed wire around the campus extended for miles, with rows of tall apartment buildings marked as dormitories.\u0026nbspA historian at the University of Sydney, David Brophy, said the move towards boarding schools brought to mind Aboriginal children in Australia who were forcibly separated from their families in the 1900s and placed into state-run institutions that discouraged indigenous identity.\u0026nbsp“Should China’s policies continue in this direction, we may be talking about a Chinese version of the Stolen Generation,” he said.Since coming to Istanbul by himself in 2014, 42-year-old Imin, the writer, has led a solitary existence in a dimly lit apartment with bare walls and stacks of writings. For the first year, he avoided looking at photos of his children.\u0026nbsp“We are dying every day,” Imin said. “We cannot see our kids, we cannot see our parents. This is an eternal torture.”\u0026nbspIn December, he was sent a photo of his daughter wearing a traditional Chinese “qipao”. He deleted the picture because he could not bear to look at it, he said, and could not sleep for nearly a month.\u0026nbspImin also has four other children in Xinjiang. Last summer, a friend who had visited his home in Kashgar told Imin that two of them had been killed in a traffic accident while his wife was in prison. He does not know where the other two are.\u0026nbspFeeling helpless, he wrote verse after verse in mourning:\u0026nbsp“I will go... to tear down your dark, endless night ...\u0026nbspI will go, to embrace again my hometown ...\u0026nbspI will go, bearing my sorrow to your tomb.”\u0026nbspElsewhere in Istanbul, Meripet’s house was quiet during Eid al-Adha, a Muslim holy festival heralded by large family reunions. In a room at the end of the hall, there rose the distant laughter of relatives’ children.\u0026nbspShe flipped through the photographs she keeps in her purse: Abdurahman, the oldest Adile, her only daughter and her two younger sons, Muhemmed and Abdulla. Meripet has a fifth child, a son named Abduweli who was born in Turkey. She calls him “my only light”.\u0026nbsp“Sometimes I wonder if I will go crazy from this pain,” she says. “I have only been able to keep living because I know there is hope – I know one day I will see my children again.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/28/10/nawaz-sharif2.jpg","title":"nawaz sharif impeachment ex prime minister pakistan release suspended sentence","story":"Created with Sketch.Decision follows three-time prime minister\u0027s disqualification\u0026nbspfrom holding office by Supreme Court in July 2017Click to followThe IndependentOn Wednesday, the Islamabad High Court suspended the 10-year sentence for disgraced former prime minister Nawaz Sharif A Pakistani court has ordered the release of jailed former prime minister\u0026nbspNawaz\u0026nbspSharif\u0026nbspand his daughter, suspending the sentences they received from a lower court in July and prompting celebrations among supporters waiting outside.On\u0026nbspWednesday,\u0026nbspthe Islamabad High Court suspended the 10-year sentence for\u0026nbspSharif\u0026nbspand the seven-year term handed\u0026nbspto his daughter, Maryam, over corrupt practices linked to his family’s ownership of upscale London flats.“Justice has been served and I congratulate\u0026nbspNawaz\u0026nbspSharif‘s supporters,” former foreign minister Khawaja Asif, a staunch\u0026nbspSharif\u0026nbspally, said outside the courtroom where\u0026nbspSharif‘s supporters were seen celebrating wildly.The\u0026nbspSharifs’ convictions are still under appeal with the same Islamabad High Court.But a judge on Wednesday ruled they should be freed immediately while the case continues.Three-time prime minister\u0026nbspSharif\u0026nbspwas ousted and disqualified from holding office by the Supreme Court in July 2017 and jailed earlier this year in absentia.Supporters of Nawaz Sharif celebrate the suspension of his prison sentence in Lahore, Pakistan (AP)He was arrested on 13\u0026nbspJuly upon returning from London, where his wife was receiving treatment before her death this month.Sharif\u0026nbsphas repeatedly called the cases against him politically motivated, suggesting collusion between the powerful military and courts to destabilise his Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz\u0026nbsp(PML-N) party and throw him out of power.World news in picturesLos Angeles has moved to ban the sale of fur within its city limits.

But even worse, Northern Ireland would effectively remain in the Customs Union and parts of the Single Market, permanently separated economically from the rest of the UK by a border down the Irish Sea.Parliament has already - unanimously - rejected this idea.                Dominic Raab REFUSES to rule out further concessions to EU                Dominic Raab blasts EU\u0027s \u0027computer says NO!\u0027 approach to Brexit talksCreating any form of customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK would not respect that Northern Ireland is an integral part of the United Kingdom, in line with the principle of consent, as set out clearly in the BelfastGood Friday Agreement.It is something I will never agree to - indeed, in my judgement it is something no British Prime Minister would ever agree to. If the EU believe I will, they are making a fundamental mistake. Anything which fails to respect the referendum or which effectively ides our country in two would be a bad deal and I have always said no deal is better than a bad deal.But I have also been clear that the best outcome is for the UK to leave with a deal. That is why, following months of intensive work and detailed discussions, we proposed a third option for our future economic relationship, based on the frictionless trade in goods. That is the best way to protect jobs here and in the EU and to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern\u0026nbspIreland,\u0026nbspwhile respecting the referendum result and the integrity of the United Kingdom.Yesterday Donald Tusk said our proposals would undermine the single market. He didn\u0026rsquot explain how in any detail or make any counter-proposal. So we are at an impasse.The second issue is connected to the first. We both agree that the Withdrawal Agreement needs to include a backstop to ensure that if there\u0026rsquos a delay in implementing our new relationship, there still won\u0026rsquot be a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.                Pound live: Sterling slides against dollar and euro as May speaks                Macron REFUSES to respond to Theresa May\u0027s Brexit speechTheresa May speech : Mrs May in Salzburg (Image: Getty)But the EU is proposing to achieve this by effectively keeping Northern Ireland in the Customs Union.As I have already said, that is unacceptable. We will never agree to it. It would mean breaking up our country.We will set out our alternative that preserves the integrity of the UK. And it will be in line with the commitments we made back in December - including the commitment that no new regulatory barriers should be created between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK unless the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly agree.As I told EU leaders, neither side should demand the unacceptable of the other.We cannot accept anything that threatens the integrity of our union, just as they cannot accept anything that threatens the integrity of theirs.We cannot accept anything that does not respect the result of the referendum, just as they cannot accept anything that is not in the interest of their citizens.Throughout this process, I have treated the EU with nothing but respect. The UK expects the same. A good relationship at the end of this process depends on it.At this late stage in the negotiations, it is not acceptable to simply reject the other side\u0026rsquos proposals without a detailed explanation and\u0026nbspcounter proposals.Theresa May speech: Mrs May said she expected the EU to treat the UK with respect (Image: Getty)So we now need to hear from the EU what the real issues are and what their alternative is so that we can discuss them. Until we do, we cannot make progress.In the meantime, we must and will continue the work of preparing ourselves for no deal.In particular, I want to clarify our approach to two issues.First, there are over 3 million EU citizens living in the UK who will be understandably worried about what the outcome of yesterday\u0026rsquos summit means for their future.I want to be clear with you that even in the event of no deal your rights will be protected. You are our friends, our neighbours, our colleagues. We want you to stay.Second, I want to reassure the people of Northern Ireland that in the event of no deal we will do everything in our power to prevent a return to a hard border.Let me also say this.The referendum was the largest democratic exercise this country has ever undergone. To deny its legitimacy or frustrate its result threatens public trust in our democracy.That is why for over two years I have worked day and night to deliver a deal that sees the UK leave the EU.I have worked to bring people with me even when that has not always seemed possible.No one wants a good deal more than me.But the EU should be clear: I will not overturn the result of the referendum. Nor will I break up my country.We need serious engagement on resolving the two big problems in the negotiations. We stand ready.

Michel Barnier is doing well, he has our full support. He has taken a step towards the British. Now we expect a willingness to compromise from the British hopefully to bring about a deal.We will propose today there is an extraordinary summit in November and if the member states support this, it will happen.

Heres what you need to know.After a marathon session of talks at Chequers on July 6, Theresa May managed to secure a Brexit plan which will be assessed by the EU.Her Brexit plan will see the UK remain closely tied to Brussels.It also includes the creation of a new UK-EU free trade area for goods with a common rulebook.This rulebook could limit the UKs ability to strike trade deals with countries such as the US — for whom securing market access for American farmers would be a big prize.Mrs May hopes to get an agreement hammered out at a series of summits with EU leaders this autumn, and bring it back to Parliament for approval.But her plans were dealt a blow at crunch talks in Salzburg with other EU leaders in September.The PM was ambushed by EU bullies who dismissed her Chequers plan out of hand.Maltese and Czech leaders told Britain to hold a second referendum, employing the same tactic that the EU has used in Ireland and Denmark before.Once a deal has been agreed —  ever — MPs will be asked to approve it.In a Panorama interview in September 2018 she said MPs had a simple choice between her Chequers plan or no deal.She told the BBC current affairs programme: I think that the alternative to that [the Chequers plan] will be not having a deal.Opposition to the plan in the Conservative Party centres around the European Research Group of Hard Brexit supporting MPs led by Jacob Rees-Mogg.His voice had been among the loudest voicing their objection to the plan and he urged MPs “chuck Chequers”.Up to 80 Tory MPs are prepared to vote against Theresa Mays Chequers plan, Steve Baker, a former Brexit minister and ERG backer has warned.A group of about 50 Tory MPs have met to discuss how and when they could force her out of her job, the BBC reported.Also voicing his opposition to the Chequers deal has been Boris Johnson.He said Theresas Mays had wrapped a suicide vest around the British constitution and handed the detonator to Brussels.The former Foreign Secretary later claimed Mrs Mays disastrous plans for the Irish border would leave Britain at a loss.Boris Johnson said the European Unions fallback position for the Irish border would mean Northern Ireland was annexed by Brussels.Along with former Brexit secretary David Davis, Mr Johnson resigned in protest following the Chequers meeting.Several other MPs also quit their ministerial posts over the issue, including Steve Baker, Maria Caulfield, Ben Bradley and Robert Courts.The party will vote down any Brexit deal brought back from Brussels by Theresa May, according to shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry.The Corbyn ally said the party will oppose it to try to force an election by Christmas.Speaking to the FT she said a deal which meets her party’s tests was “not going to happen”, and therefore the Prime Minister would be forced to quit.Without the support of the opposition party, it would need just a handful of Tory rebels to vote against her to see it defeated.Theresa Mays initial plans brought her on side with those Conservatives who favour a soft Brexit.The Prime Minister has also been seeking grassroots Tory support for the plan.Among those voicing support for the Prime Minister has been Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who was a prominent member of the Leave campaign.He said he was confident that the Prime Minister will go into the Conservative Party conference and beyond, securing a good Brexit deal for Britain and continuing to ensure the country enjoys good economic growth and we take advantage of Brexit.A plan may have been cooked up but it still needs to get past the EU — and the continent’s leaders are showing no sign of compromise.Angela Merkel is already rubbishing our proposal.The Napoleonic Emmanuel Macron thinks he’s a political messiah, and he’d rather see us punished than give up on his federalist promised land.And Michel Barnier’s dangled “concessions” amount to a demand for total UK capitulation.With that level of zeal and stubbornness, it’s no wonder we voted in our millions to leave.We must now go to Brussels with an offer that guarantees control of our borders and sign our own trade deals.But we mustn’t for a second think that they’ll just say yes to it, nor can the PM let them fatally weaken it.It is galling that ministers have spent more time fighting between themselves than preparing for a “no deal” exit.But it isn’t too late.New technology can ensure that Whitehall and our borders are ready for a clean break, which considering the strength of our economy and our companies is nothing to be scared of.The PM has dumped many of her earlier Brexit slogans. But she should remember one in particular now.No deal really is better than a bad deal, and we must still prepare for it."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000362629026.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"leo mckinstry opinion immigration multiculturalism debate","story":"Mass immigration is transforming the size and the nature of our population.Between 2001 and 2016, the number of people living in the UK increased by 6.6million to 65.7million. And the influx continues.Latest statistics show the number of migrants who settled here in the year to March 2018 was 614,000, equal to a city bigger than Bristol. Net migration was around 270,000.Yet the revolution has been imposed by the ruling elite without any consent. No British citizen was ever asked to vote for this upheaval. No major party ever sought a mandate to open our doors.This helps to explain why the British public has such profound distrust in MPs on the question of immigration, as revealed in a major new opinion survey published this week.In the biggest consultation of its kind, involving 20,000 interviews, just one in six people showed any faith in the Government to tackle migration, while only 13 per cent felt that politicians are “open and honest” about the issue.These findings are not the result of bigotry or prejudice. Britons have been remarkably tolerant in the face of change.Indeed, that shines through the survey, which discovered that 65 per cent of people believe migrants bring valuable skills to the economy and the public sector. Similarly, 59 per cent think that ersity benefits our national culture.But British decency has been exploited by the political class to implement its agenda, with the result that disillusion is now widespread.People are rightly fed up with politicians who indulge in denial and deceit about the reality of mass immigration.A classic example was the phoney claim from the last Labour Government that, when the former communist countries of eastern Europe joined the EU in 2004, just 13,000 of their citizens would come to the UK. In fact, more than a million did.Even worse has been the attempt, particularly by the Left, to suppress open discussion by hurling accusations of racism against critics of mass immigration.A climate of censorship now prevails where public figures are expected to parrot the fashionable orthodoxy, and ordinary citizens are afraid to voice their concerns.Yet the anxieties of the public are all too genuine. Immigration has imposed more strain on our civic infrastructure, reflected in the shortage of affordable housing, the never-ending NHS crisis, the growth in the welfare burden and dficulties for parents in finding school places for kids.The import of cheap foreign labour has meant lower wages and job insecurity. Just as disturbing is the erosion of solidarity because of this upheaval.Social cohesion cannot exist without real integration, as the public recognised in the survey.The majority of respondents, 88 per cent, agreed with the idea that “migrants should learn English” and 85 per cent believe that migrants “should share our values”.But the multicultural ideology, which has long been the creed of the state, works in the opposite direction.It encourages migrants to cling to the practices and languages of their native lands, fuelling ision. As does the institutionalised acceptance of sharia law, which arguably offers more protection to men than women, undermining the traditional concept that we are all equal before the law.The consequences of multi-culturalism are seen at their most corrosive in the failure by the state to tackle serious crimes perpetrated by ethnic minorities, such as the organised abuse of girls by mainly Asian gangs in places like Rotherham and Derby.More concerned to uphold the illusion of cultural ersity’s success than to protect victims of crime, the police and other authorities indulged in a cover-up. It was only exposure of the abuse by journalists that finally forced them to act.That mix of official dishonesty and paralysis only undermines our society. There is a lesson for us from Europe, where the political order is threatened by growing public anger over immigration.In 2010, German Chancellor Angela Merkel declared that “this multi-cultural approach has failed.” But she did nothing to reverse the policy. Instead, she opened the door even wider, especially in 2015 when she allowed in more than a million migrants.The crime that followed has led to public outcry.Britain has always been renowned for its avoidance of extremism. But we will avoid the same fate only  the state adopts a new approach on immigration, including more political honesty, tighter border controls and an emphasis on British values.That is not racist. As the public knows, it is a recipe for greater harmony.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The EU has to know that she is unafraid to walk away  need be.What does her blundering Remainer Chancellor do?Volunteers his own apocalyptic warning about No Deal reversing our progress since the 2008 crash.Mr Hammond has leapt on the IMF’s latest doom-laden predictions and swallowed them whole, despite its abysmal forecasting record over the financial crisis, austerity and the Brexit vote.The Chancellor has already hampered vital No Deal preparations, undermined the new Brexit Secretary and only last week suggested delaying our departure.Now, at a stroke, he has sabotaged our negotiating hand and boosted the EU’s.It is a measure of the weakness of Mrs May’s position after the loss of her majority that Mr Hammond is still in his job.REMEMBER Brussels mocking the Brexiteers’ idea of high-tech customs checks to solve the Irish border problem?The technology didn’t exist, they said. It was a “fantasy island unicorn model”.Triumphant Remoaners piled in. It proved Brexiteers were clueless, they chirped. And Downing Street then ­produced its convoluted alternative.Except the EU, in the form of Michel Barnier, now believes in the fantasy island unicorn model too. The trouble being it wants it used between Britain and Northern Ireland instead of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.And the DUP, whom Theresa May needs for her survival, won’t wear that. Nor should they, since it ides the UK.Funny though, isn’t it, how Brussels move the goalposts when it suits them? They have negotiated in bad faith all along.TOO many politicians are in denial about the soaring cost of the NHS and social care. So we applaud Health Secretary Matt Hancock’s imaginative plan to sort the latter.The new lelong insurance system he is considering, compulsory for all workers unless they take a risk and opt out, looks a practical idea to fund part or all of an OAP’s care costs.It would give them peace of mind that they wouldn’t have to spend their savings or the proceeds from their home.Maybe it will work. Maybe not. Regardless, it is to Mr Hancock’s credit that he is starting a grown-up conversation at last over future funding of health.For too long progress has been stymied by the Left using any change to the NHS as a political weapon.But the structure of a health service designed in 1948 now needs a radical rethink.It is time reality dawned.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And they’re right to be.As recently as 1991, a third of those aged 16 to 24 owned their own home.Now, that figure is ten per cent.For those aged 25 to 34, the rate has fallen from 66 per cent to 38 per cent.Home ownership rates in Britain are now the fourth lowest in the EU, and we have the second highest proportion of social housing, i.e., people living in homes provided by the State.Earlier this year, we at the Centre for Policy Studies commissioned polling asking young people how government could make their lives better.The top answer was clear — they want housing to be more affordable.And not via cheaper rents — by a three-to-one margin, they wanted the Government to prioritise home ownership.Strikingly, only three per cent of those aged 18 to 24 told us they never wanted to own their own home.They just can’t see themselves being able to afford it for years — often decades.This is a crisis with many causes.The persistent failure, stretching back decades, to build enough new homes. A dysal planning system.Existing homeowners who don’t want their communities disrupted or their views spoiled.A Labour government that made it much easier for buy-to-let landlords to snap up those homes that were being built, and much harder for first-time buyers to do the same — and a financial crash which made that problem so much worse. Yet it’s also a crisis with many solutions.Making it easier to extend or expand existing properties. Changing Green Belt regulations so we protect our most beautul countryside while building on pig farms, or beside railway stations or motorways or electricity substations or other decidedly non-green and unpleasant bits of land.Finding ways  to turn renters into owners, as Margaret Thatcher did with the Right to Buy for council tenants in the 1980s, with more than a little success.But the sad truth is that while the Government has succeeded in dragging up construction levels, it is still not thinking anywhere near radically enough.“Since my very first day in Downing Street, I have made it my personal mission to fix our broken housing system,” Theresa May told the National Housing Federation yesterday.But that mission is in grave jeopardy.A year ago, the Prime Minister endured a triple whammy of embarrassment in her party conference speech — being handed a P45 by a prankster, developing a crippling cough, then seeing the slogan behind her start to fall off.Mrs May bravely endured these trials. But she could do little about the fact that her promise in the same speech to “make the British dream a reality by igniting home ownership once again” was built around a £10billion expansion of the Help to Buy scheme.A scheme which pretty much every economist, including the Government’s own Office for Budget Responsibility, says is mostly serving to push up house prices and make colossally rich housebuilders even richer.Indeed, even as Mrs May was speaking, their collective share price spiked by £1BILLION.Yesterday, the Prime Minister ed to the subject.In a speech to the National Housing Summit, she promised another £2billion for social housing.But even on its own terms, Mrs May’s proposal isn’t a blunderbuss.It’s a pinprick. Not only is the £2billion spread over a decade but it’s a small fraction of the amount that George Osborne cut from the same budgets.And it fits a wider pattern. For all the Government’s rhetoric, the big ideas to get Britain building just aren’t there.One of the keys to David Cameron’s election victory in 2015 — right there on the first page of the Tory manesto — was a promise to extend the Right to Buy to housing associations and to build 200,000 starter homes.The commitment was to create two million more homeowners within five years.As of May 2018, not a single one of those starter homes had been built — and the expansion of Right to Buy is still lodged in the gullet of the Whitehall machine.It’s the same pattern on planning reform.Sajid Javid’s robust proposals as Communities Secretary to break up the oligopoly of the big housebuilders, free up more land and speed up development — all badly needed — were neutered by Downing Street, because it was paranoid about upsetting traditional Tory voters who don’t like the sight of bulldozers.When the Government’s new planning framework was announced in March, the headlines were about building more and higher-quality homes.But the small print made it so that councils could get away with building fewer houses, not more.I don’t doubt that Mrs May’s heart is in the right place.But  she and her team don’t pluck up their courage on housing — and take far more dramatic steps both to build more houses and create more homeowners — they’ll almost certainly lose the next election. More than that, they’ll deserve to.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A vexed issue. Complain about it and people will call you a racist.That’s a popular way of shutting down debate these days. Just screech “raaacisst” at someone.I’d go so far as to say it’s one of the reasons Leave won the referendum — because ordinary people were sick of being called racist when they simply worried about the millions of people who have arrived here in the past ten years.About seven million, in fact. An astonishing number.The Prime Minister is about to draw up her plans for immigration post-Brexit.She will be taking advice from the Migration Advisory Committee . It has suggested we allow in skilled workers who might be vital to our economy.It has also suggested we clamp down on low-skilled migrants.This seems to me a perfectly sensible argument. We should not entirely close ourselves off from the world. And there are foreign nationals here who do excellent work for our country. And pay good taxes.At the same time, the vast influx of low-skilled workers has had a terrible effect upon our country.Some towns — such as Boston in Lincolnshire — have been effectively taken over.And as the MAC found, the vast reservoir of labour has depressed the wages of British people at the lowest end of the scale. It has hurt the poorest of us.But it doesn’t only hurt us. You’ll have seen the squalid conditions in which a lot of these low-paid foreign workers live. This is exploitation, on a massive scale.How any leftie can support it absolutely befoggles me.Living below the minimum wage, crammed into rotten accommodation — all so companies such as Amazon can make a bigger profit.No wonder the big companies were the first to complain. Listen: Pay your workers a decent, living wage in future and shut up, huh?But this is an overcrowded country. It is ludicrous to suggest that the millions we have allowed in have not had a massive effect on our infrastructure.It’s why we need to pave over more and more of the countryside to build homes, for example. The MAC suggested house prices had risen as a consequence — and our homes already cost too much.There’s pressure on our schools, our hospitals and our transport networks.Well, with any luck this will all come to an end. Perhaps the Government might also abide by its pledge to get yearly immigration levels down to the tens of thousands, rather than the hundreds of thousands as it is at the moment.But at the same time we should look after the EU migrants we have already let in, and ensure they feel secure and safe living in Britain.Do all that and I’ll be a happy man. Even  the lefties still shriek “raaacisst” every few seconds.GIRLS – looking for something to wear for a night out? You’ll find it in a drawer in your kitchen.They come in rolls for about £1.50 from Asda. Yep, it’s the black bin liner, as sported here by Megan Barton Hanson.I have no idea, incidentally, who Megan Barton Hanson is, still less her boyfriend called “Wes”.BBC Radio 6 presenter Cerys Matthews says she refuses to play music made by people who went to private school.OK, Cerys. That means your entire back catalogue is banned, seeing as you were educated at the expensive St Michael’s School in Llanelli.A few weeks ago a BBC executive said he wouldn’t be commissioning comedies from public schoolboys .Spouting every right-on opinion that suddenly swings into fashion?Here’s a tip, Cerys. Play the best rock, folk and soul music you can find.The stuff that sounds the most interesting.You’ll find that auto- matically the private school musicians will be excluded anyway – including yourself.APPARENTLY President Trump’s penis closely resembles a toadstool.This is according to Stormy Daniels, who says she had an affair with Donald.The question is, though – what kind of toadstool?There are hundreds of thousands of species. Was it a fly agaric? That’s the one with a big red head covered in white spots. If so, Donald ought to get himself to a doctor.Or maybe it’s that one with a thin stalk and a big yellow head the size of a dinner plate.If so, Stormy had better get herself to a doctor.A “RELATIONSHIP expert” has warned us all about dodgy body language  we’re out on a date.Tracey Cox says we shouldn’t fidget, for a start. What, even  we’ve taken her to a ballet?Also, don’t wring your hands or sit in a slumped manner, and so on.Hmm. As a “relationship expert” I offer the following advice to blokes out on a first date in a restaurant.2. Don’t pass wind then waft the air saying “Mmmmm, Bisto!”3. When they bring the black pepper, don’t sneeze on her pasta.4. If you do sneeze on her pasta, stir it around a bit when she’s not looking.5. Don’t use a bread stick to excavate the contents of your ear.6. Don’t keep checking the football scores on your phone. And shouting loudly: “Lee Gregory! 85th minute! Get IN you f***er!”7. Don’t ask the lady at the next table  she’s up for a threesome.Follow that stuff and you can fidget away to your heart’s delight. You’ll be OK.THERE’S a crisis in our wildle. Some of our favourite species of birds or mammals are on the brink of extinction.The corn bunting, for example, and the hedgehog.As TV wildle campaigner Chris Packham rightly says, this is because we have paved over the countryside to build ever more homes.And because of the intensive farming methods – which have seen the eradication of farmland birds.Packham has drawn up a “People’s Manesto for Wildle” which includes stuff like twinning city schools with farms, so that kids grow up with an understanding of nature.There’s also a demo at Hyde Park in London on Saturday. I’ll be there. Don’t forget – as Joni Mitchell once sang, you don’t know what you’ve got ’til its gone.SO, it looks very much as  the old Irish border problem is going to be solved very quickly after all.We’re close to agreeing a deal with the European Union which will enable Northern Ireland to retain its “soft border”.The Remainers said it couldn’t be done. Totally impossible. But  we don’t want a hard border and the Irish don’t want a hard border – who is going to make us have one?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The annual ­target for new homes is 300,000 — and we doubt even that would lower prices enough for young people to afford to buy in London and the South East.In fairness, the total HAS risen to 217,000 a year, the most since 2007. But it’s still way short — and the Government’s remedies are woefully timid.Sajid Javid promised a huge shake-up when he ran housing. He was knocked back by the negativity from Philip Hammond’s Treasury. Then he moved on.We need to slash planning restrictions and defy obstructive NIMBYs. We need to stop the land-banking that sees developers hoard plots or release homes at a snail’s pace to keep prices high.We need more cash help for small builders. We should borrow billions, build affordable homes on public land and sell them at a profit for the Treasury.The Tories need to wake up or housing will sink them. Instead they are hyping up some footling new funding that only partly reverses a previous cut.It fools no one.WHY is the EU wasting time pressing for a border between Britain and Northern ­Ireland? It’s a non-starter.No Government could consider it. Especially not one entirely reliant on the votes of those most vehemently opposed to splitting up the UK, the DUP.This cannot be news to Brussels. They cannot believe Theresa May will surrender and collapse her Government.Why persist with it? The answer must be: to run down the clock — until, at the last minute, Mrs May agrees virtually anything to avoid a No Deal.Which is why Donald Tusk also still insists key areas of our wildly over-generous Chequers offer must be “reworked”.Mrs May has gone as far as she can. Two Cabinet figures have quit already. She must insist it’s take it or leave it.Only Britain has made genuine compromises in this negotiation, as despondent Brexiteers know only too well.It’s the EU’s turn.FROM child abuse images to terrorism, Facebook is a platform for evil it seems unable or unwilling to prevent.Now it is hosting ads for people- smuggling gangs luring children to their doom in the Mediterranean.A new low, even for a tech giant with apparently no moral compass.Since Facebook now admits it is a publisher, why isn’t it regulated as one?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This lot are more Bugsy Malone than Al Capone.Yesterday the leaders of the undemocratic European Union showed their true colours.This isn’t some grand project, designed to bring the peoples of Europe together in one happy union. It’s a protection racket.But even before the Prime Minister had been the subject of calculated attempts to humiliate her, we saw just how detached from reality Europe’s leaders have become.Maltese and Czech leaders told Britain to hold a second referendum, employing the same tactic that the EU has used in Ireland and Denmark before.This isn’t based on the half-baked “democratic” argument clung to by never-were and past-it grandees at home, such as Andrew Adonis and Lord Heseltine.They just want us to be given the chance to vote the “right” way.

They have refused to compromise, even while Britain has worked day-in, day-out to find agreement.They have insulted the Prime Minister, ignored their own citizens, and are willing to accept a massive economic hit for the sake of flexing their muscles.Like all good gangsters, they’re trying to rule by fear. That’s the only weapon in their arsenal on the Continent, where more and more voters are turning against an outfit that increasingly looks more at home in Sicily than Strasbourg.All they have is the chance to punish us, and prove to the rest of the continent that it isn’t worth leaving.The message they want to send? You won’t get away with it.Well, Mrs May is right to say that we’ve nothing to be scared of.Yes, it is without doubt that we need to pick up the pace on preparations for a clean-break Brexit.It is vital we show the European Union, who still seem to think we’ll roll over when it really matters, that we are ready for a new future free of their cold, dead hands.And despite no-marks such as Donald Tusk trolling the PM on Instagram, and the puffed-up pomposity of France’s Emmanuel Macron and Ireland’s Leo Varadkar, we haven’t entirely given up hope that sensible forces within the EU might find their voice in the crucial months to come — and work with the UK, not against it.The Government should be all ears  Brussels makes us an offer that works for both sides.But after yesterday’s performance, we don’t hold out much hope.Brussels has made us an offer it thinks we can’t refuse.Today we join the Prime Minister in saying no.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

French president Emmanuel Macron also heaped on the pain.While dubbing Chequers “a good and brave step” at a compromise, he insisted it is still “not acceptable, especially on the economic side”. The broadsides mark the death of the PM’s two key free trading proposals – a common rule book on goods, and a close customs partnership.Mrs May also lashed out to brand the EU’s rejection as “tactics in these negotiations” as she warned: “I’ve always said these negotiations will be tough. Im negotiating and Im negotiating hard in the interest of the British people, and to deliver on what the British people voted for in the referendum.”But when asked by The Sun  she would dump Chequers, she refused to rule out the move, instead saying: “If there are concerns, let’s hear what they are”.The PM also pledged to unveil a fresh proposal to unblock the Irish border backstop soon, which is believed to be a regulatory border down the Irish sea that will see no need for a new customs border there.TORY MPs have accused EU chiefs of talking up hopes of a second referendum to delay Brexit.Leavers hit out after Maltese PM Joseph Muscat and Czech president Andrej Babis backed Remainer calls for a rerun.Muscat claimed support among the 27 other national bosses was “almost unanimous”. Former Cabinet minister Priti Patel hit back: “EU leaders are not on the side of the British people.” Fellow Tory Marcus Fysh added: “It’s wishful thinking . . . and it has been holding up progress on the talks.”Meanwhile, French president Emmanuel Macron said Brexiteers who claimed the UK would thrive outside the EU were “liars”.Tory MP Stewart Jackson said the remarks show why Mr Macron has worse poll ratings than his predecessor, Francois Hollande.Mrs May had been expecting warm words from EU leaders to keep her compromise plan afloat. But Brussels sources said she alienated the 27 over dinner by being too aggressive in her demands, and by failing to think she could go above EU negotiator Michel Barnier’s head with the direct appeal to them the Austrian city.Downing Street claimed the public showdown was inevitable at some stage in the negotiation, as both sides try to call each other’s bluff to fold first.A No10 source: “We always knew this moment was going to come, where we looked each other hard in the eye. Just maybe not quite yet”.After the drubbing, Mrs May swtly faced calls to abandon Chequers at the Tories’ annual gathering in Birmingham to save her leadership.David Davis, who resigned as Brexit Secretary in protest at her new blueprint, said clinging on to her plan would only see her forced to make more concessions to the EU.Mr Davis told The Sun: “It is clear what the EU tactics are now. Parliament was very unlikely to support Chequers, it certainly will not allow more than Chequers. Now is the time for the Prime Minister to reset the negotiation and take Tusks March offer of a free trade plus deal.”Brexiteer MP Jacob Rees-Mogg added: Chequers now has no supporters at all. I doubt even the Downing Street cat is any longer backing the Chequers plan.And Pro-EU Tory MPs also savaged her, but demanded a dferent antidote.Pro-EU former business minister Anna Soubry tweeted: “Having been nailed to its perch this #Chequers parrot is no more, it is bereft of le, it rests in peace, it is indeed an ex parrot. So let’s face #BrexitReality take the only responsible deal - Norway plus and put it all to @peoplesvote_ukEarlier hopes yesterday of a rebellion by some EU leaders against the Brussels hard line, lead by Hungary’s Victor Orban, swtly evaporated. Mr Orban insisted eurocrats are trying to “punish” the UK’s exit decision “and the British must suffer”. But even Mrs May’s close ally, Dutch PM Mark Rutte, chided her by saying the Netherlands have “made more preparations for a no deal than the UK”.Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite dubbed the negotiatons as at “ standstill”.Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis addedd: I feel sorry for the UK.In a logical world, you might think, dear rail passenger, that Chris Grayling, the Secretary Of State For Transport, is the man in charge.After all, he is the one who pops up on TV when there is good news to announce, such as the opening of a refurbished ­station or the introduction of new trains, but you would be wrong.Grayling refuses to take responsibility, recently telling a Parliamentary committee that “I don’t run the railways”. Yet his civil servants in the Department interfere with the railways all the time.They make decisions over what ­services should be run, the fares to be charged, what new trains should be bought and which private company should operate them.Prof Glaister’s report makes clear that Grayling was deeply involved in making the decision to go ahead with the timetable changes, even though the ­industry was not prepared for them.If Grayling was not in charge, then he should have made sure that someone else was — but failed to do so.It’s clear from the report no one has overall responsibility for the ­railways, and that’s why they are in such a mess.Prof Glaister’s report highlights the fact that the railways were simply not ready to cope with the wholesale ­timetable changes, which were focused around ­services through London on the Thameslink lines and across the North, and ­overall affected nearly half — 46 per cent — of trains on the whole network.The report shows that the railway ­simply could not cope. The changes brought the service to its knees, resulting in thousands of services being ­cancelled and countless others delayed.Many passengers in May were left standing at stations for hours as ­successive trains failed to turn up.On one branch line in the Lake District, services were cancelled entirely and temporarily replaced by a diesel-hauled heritage train — which proved to be more popular than the usual service, especially as it was free.The introduction of the timetable resulted in the worst performance of the railways in more than a decade, with one in eight trains running late during this period.The after-effects are still being felt today, with daily cancellations and delays, and it will be several months before things are back to normal.Prof Glaister does not mince his words and found every part of the industry wanting. Network Rail, which is responsible for drawing up the timetable, “did not take any action” back in the autumn when it was clear there would be trouble ­implementing the new schedules.Two train operators, Govia Thameslink and Northern, “were not sufficiently aware” of the problems and failed to inform passengers when disruption ­occurred, while the Department For Transport and the Office Of Rail And Road itself watched these events unfold without doing anything or questioning whether the introduction of the timetable should be postponed.The irony is that the timetable changes were introduced to increase the number of trains available to commuters.In ­particular, in the North, the opening of the new Ordsall Chord linking ­Manchester’s two main railway stations was designed to improve services in the region.However, because Network Rail failed to ensure that more platforms were built at the biggest station, Piccadilly, rather than improvements for local passengers the result has been longer delays and ­numerous cancellations.That is precisely the sort of lack of co-ordination which happens because ­British Rail was broken up on its privatisation in the 1990s into more than 100 companies. Passengers are paying the price for that mistake today.The biggest error was to separate the services, run by companies including ­Virgin and Arriva, from the infrastructure, which is in the hands of Network Rail , when, in fact, the railways run much better as a single entity.Ironically, the Prime Minister at the time, John Major, had wanted the railway to be sold off as just four or five large companies that ran services and were responsible for the tracks and stations, but he was overruled by the Treasury, which wanted competition between ­companies — something that has simply not happened.As a result of the timetable chaos and other recent problems on the railways, such as the failure of the East Coast franchise and overspending on ­electrication schemes by Network Rail, Grayling has launched an inquiry into the state of the railways.It is the fourth such inquiry in the past decade and the others have largely been ignored.This time there is an obvious and clear solution. Create an organisation ­independent of the duffers in Whitehall who keep on interfering with the railways, and make sure it is headed by a Fat ­Controller who has power to make ­decisions over the whole railway, ­including the timetable, investment plans and ­services.Inevitably, this will at first have to be a publicly-owned body, since Network Rail is currently owned by the Government.But to appease any Tories opposed to renationalisation, Grayling could say that eventually it might be privatised — though given the experience of the crisis-ridden past 20 years, that day may well be a long time off.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

CAATSA sanctions in this context are not intended to undermine the defense capabilities of any particular country, said the officialThey are instead aimed at imposing costs upon Russia in response to its malign activities, the official said.In Moscow, Russian member of parliament Franz Klintsevich said the sanctions would not affect the S-400 and SU-35 contracts.I am sure that these contracts will be executed in line with the schedule. The possession of this military equipment is very important for China.Collin Koh, a security analyst at Singapores S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said the sanctions would do little end the evolving military co-operation between Russia and China."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT0004354522693.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"the way eu leaders belittled theresa may over chequers is driving even remainers to accept a no deal brexit claims pro eu former minister","story":"Dominic Raab said they have chosen to mess with the “wrong Prime Minister” as she prepared to deliver a statement in response to being ambushed in Salzburg yesterday.The minister also blasted Donald Tusk for his mocking social media post, saying the Brussels boss was not acting “statesmanlike”.The EU Council leader had published on Instagram a picture of himself offering Mrs May some cake, with the caption “sorry, no cherries”.This was a reference to claims the PM is asking in the negotiations for something which cannot be offered, but sparked fury among Brexiteers.It led Mr Raab to suggest there is a serious question mark about whether the EU is taking the talks seriously, adding there was a “computer says no” attitude from them.His comments come after a pro-EU former Cabinet minister said the way the leaders “belittled” Mrs May is driving even Remainers to accept a “no deal” Brexit.Stephen Crabb says the way they “sought to put down the Prime Minister yesterday” will push Brits to think “the quicker were out of this circus, the better”.The ex-Work and Pensions Secretary said it“represented everything that is bad and unattractive about the EU”.And he said Mrs May “cant back down”, and the “spectacle” in Austria left his fellow Remainers “feeling the quicker we’re out of this the better”.But Mr Crabb said the PM must not panic, saying: “One of the outcomes the EU leaders wanted from yesterday was for Britain to go away, push the panic button and re-think.“But the Prime Minister needs to stick to her guns.I actually think the Chequers proposal is not perfect but broadly represents the kind of compromising package that protects Britains industrial base, that protects agriculture and represents a positive position to take into the negotiations.The Pembrokeshire MP took aim at the EU leaders, saying: The manner in which they did it yesterday took many of us by surprise.The problem with the position the EU took yesterday is it pushes people like me further into the camp of those who say to me, as they were doing last night, ‘look, Stephen, we told you so. There is no compromise or flexibility to be found on the EU side’.Mr Crabb added: It pushes us more into a position where we say the quicker we are out of this circus the better.Asked  he was no moving more towards to the hard-Brexit group the ERG, who want to ditch Chequers, he said: “We come away having seen what happened yesterday, having more sympathy for the kind of language that they’ve been speaking.”His thoughts were echoed by former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, who said the EU leaders had “got personal”.Speaking to the  he said: “Monsieur Macron is not only out of order, hes completely wrong.“The EU is doing their classic case of trying to bully the UK in a iety of ways into taking a dferent position.”It comes after the French President described leaders of the Brexit campaign who told British voters it would be easy to get a deal after we left as liars.At the summit the European Commission tried to get Mrs May to accept a backstop proposal for Northern Ireland to remain within the EU customs area after Brexit.But the PM flatly rejected it, arguing this would draw a border down the Irish Sea, and today one of her Cabinet ministers said there are no changes on the table at the moment.Leave-backing Transport Secretary Chris Grayling insisted Britain is preparing hard for a no-deal Brexit, although he predicted a sensible agreement will be reached with Brussels.And another member of the Cabinet, James Brokenshire, has insisted its Chequers or no deal, calling it a “workable, credible deal to meet our ambitions”.The Housing Secretary told BBC Radio 4: The easy thing for the Prime Minister to do would be to go with one of those two options that are being proffered.EEA, which does not deliver on what the people voted for in the EU referendum on freedom of movement, or Canada, which would effectively break up the UK.”He added: “They have said that its about the integrity of the single market and we believe the Chequers deal responds to that, and its for the EU to engage with whats on the table.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Today, its all about the leaders peace talks with South Korea.But although almost every article makes a point of mentioning Kim Jong-un, not every story is so hard-hitting.For example, you can also find articles about newly issued stamp designs, a woman who has just turned 100 and, bizarrely, a write-up of the National Symposium on Potato Seed Production.Site: Official government websitePurpose: Promoting the party lineHere you can enjoy a tourism-board style slideshow of pictures from North Korea as well as yet another section about Kims activities.Theres also a section where you can download your own propaganda posters showing beaming North Korean women clutching bundles of corn or strong men proudly waving red flags.Address: Korea International Youth and Childrens Travel CompanyPurpose: Promoting tours around North KoreaIf all this is giving you itchy feet, then you can also check out the site where you can arrange a visit to Kims kingdom.Here, North Korea - a rogue nuclear state which has repeatedly threatened to obliterate its rivals - is described as the land of morning calm in East.The site, which offers tours around the countrys water parks, campsites and a dolphinarium, adds that North Korea warmly welcomes her visitors.However, that certainly wasnt true for American student Otto Warmbier, who died after leaving the country in a coma having been sentenced to 15 years in prison for stealing a poster.Site: Care ElderlyPurpose: A charity for elderly peopleIn general, the nations public websites are slow and clunky - resembling the UKs late-90s sites, when the internet went mainstream.And in true 90s style, many sites are littered with flashing or spinning animations, and some even play jaunty music in the background as soon as you load them up.One such site is called Care Elderly, a charity site with a lime green homepage showing propaganda stories about Kim Jong-uns boundless love for war veterans and videos of elderly Korean women playing badminton.Inexplicably, theres also a slideshow with information about pine trees - the national tree of North Korea. The site claims it was chosen because the pine represents the strong will of the Korean people.Sites: Sport and cookeryPurpose: Showcase new recipes and prove North Koreas sporting prowessIf you do find yourself peckish in Pyongyang, then youre in luck: North Korea boasts a single foodie site where you can learn how to cook pancakes as well as traditional dishes like Kimchi - made from fermented cabbages.Theres also one website for sport fans where you can keep track of the latest results in horse riding competitions, international athletics tournaments and football matches.Any and every success for North Korea is reported - including a win in an international model airline tournament and the under-16 womens football team winning the Asian championship.Unsurprisingly, defeats for the proud kingdom dont get a mention anywhere.One of the strangest quirks of North Korean internet is that almost every website features a box on its homepage called Revolutionary Anecdotes.Here, web surfers can read short propaganda stories about Kim Jong-un and his ancestors, designed to paint the nations leaders in a good light.One story tells how Kim Jong-un revolutionised a chicken farms practices after a visit, and another is about his fathers bravery in traversing a perilous mine shaft to meet the workers.These little stories can be found in every corner of North Koreas internet, regardless of whether youre visiting the website of the national insurance company or  youre just looking for dinner recipes.With so few websites, its proved easy enough so far for Kim Jong-uns government to keep the liberating power of the internet under tight control.However, as any reader of Kims online diary will know, talks with rival South Korea are ongoing, paving the way for the North to open up to the rest of the world.And as North Korea becomes gradually less reclusive, its likely that more national websites will spring up. Just dont expect to get a Facebook friend request from anyone in the Pyongyang are any time soon...Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heres the latest.Theresa May spoke from Downing Street at 2pm this afternoon to update the public on the ongoing Brexit negotiations.The scathing speech - in which she blasted EU leaders for not showing the UK respect - came in the wake of the rejection of her Chequers plans by EU leaders in Salzburg.European Council President Donald Tusk yesterday ripped up Mrs Mays blueprint for Brexit — saying it risked the integrity of the EU single market and the Northern Ireland border.Key EU leaders including Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron also said signicant progress was needed by the European Council summit on October 18  agreement on the UKs withdrawal deal was to be reached.But hitting back, the Prime Minister today said the UK has treated the EU with nothing but respect — and the UK expects the same.She added : A good relationship at the end of this process depends on it.Mrs May admitted talks had reached an impasse over two main issues where the EU and UK remain a long way apart in their Brexit negotiations.The post-Brexit economic relationship between Britain and the EU and the impact on the Irish border have become the main sticking points.Mrs May concluded her statement by saying: “The EU should be clear, I will not overturn the result of the referendum, nor will I break up my country.We need serious engagement in resolving the two big issues in the negotiations and we stand ready.”Mrs May did not resign and was not expected to.Earlier, she indicated that she will come forward shortly with new proposals on the thorny issue of the Irish border — which has emerged as the main obstacle to progress.Elsewhere, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab earlier vented his frustration over the Salzburg summit as he accused EU leaders of putting the handbrake on negotiations.Mr Raab, appearing on the BBCs Politics Live, said: Weve been rebuffed on our plans without any coherent explanation as to why, theres these sort of rather dogmatic pleas to the single market unity but our plans were very carefully crafted around that.He added: Were going to hold our nerve, stay calm and keep negotiating in good faith.Weve revved up the motor of these negotiations, Ive been out there a lot more frequently to get motoring, to make progress and the EU have just yanked up the handbrake and for the negotiations to go forward theyre going to have to take their hand off the handbrake.Mr Raab also criticised Donald Tusk for posting a picture on social media of himself offering the Prime Minister a cake with the caption sorry, no cherries.He said: I think some of the way that it was done, social media against the Prime Minister didnt feel like very statesman-like behaviour.The Brexit Secretary went on to praise Mrs May, telling the BBC that she was a very stoic, resilient character.He added: Theres a big question mark about whether the EU is really serious about the substance of these negotiations."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000409607997.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"snapchat fatima khan picture boyfriend dying","story":"Fatima Khan - dubbed The Snapchat Queen by her own lawyer - posted the chilling image online with the caption thats what happens when you f*** with me.She was jailed for manslaughter today after plotting with a love rival to harm her boyfriend Khalid Safi, 18, who she had been seeing for two years.Mr Safi was repeatedly stabbed in the chest by Raza Khan in North Acton, West London, in December 2016, after acting out the plot.Fatima Khan, 21, denied murder and manslaughter saying she was ashamed of the video - but was found guilty of manslaughter.Jailing her for 14 years today, Judge Michael Topolski QC called her cold and callous for filming her boyfriends death and posting it on social media.Earlier in her trial the court heard how the office worker was addicted to the app and loved showing off to her pals online.Before Mr Safis death Khan, from Ilford, East London, posted stories bragging about her luxury holiday in Qatar while ignoring his messages.She also branded him a lowle before recruiting 19-year-old Raza Khan, a rival for her affections, to attack Mr Safi outside a branch of Costa.Khan locked herself in the cafe toilet to make sure the victim remained at the scene until the killer arrived.Raza Khan then plunged a kne into the heart of Mr Safi, a refugee from Afghanistan who spent time in the Calais Jungle before settling in the UK five years ago.She denied planning the attack and claimed that she made the disgusting decision to film Mr Safi dying because he had previously attacked her.Prosecutor Kate Bex said the relationship between Fatima Khan and Mr Safi was clearly coming to a head in the week before murder.Mr Safi bought her a watch as a present but when he turned up at her home, she threw the gt at him out of the window.On December 1 last year Fatima Khan met up with Mr Safi after finishing work at Vigilant Security at around 5pm.The pair were captured on CCTV walking around the North Acton area, at one point entering a gym before heading to a pedestrian area outside Costa.A video recorded on her phone during their journey showed Fatima Khan insulting Mr Safi and telling him to stop crying.When Raza Khan arrived at around 6.30pm, he seemed to know exactly where he was going and confronted Mr Safi, who was armed with a screwdriver.CCTV cameras captured the pair fighting for around 15 seconds before Mr Safi collapsed with a fatal stab wound to the heart.Khan made no efforts to help her partner either during or after the attack.Instead, she ed to the scene after Raza Khan had inflicted the fatal wound and videoed Khalid Safi as he lay dying in a pool of his blood on the pavement, said Ms Bex.Khan was also heard calling a friend to pick her up, saying: Where the f**k are you? You need to hurry the f**k up. Everythings got f**ked. Fatima Khan told jurors that she had asked Raza Khan for a loan of a few hundred pounds because she was overdrawn at the bank.She said she panicked when Raza Khan arrived and the fight started and walked off.Asked why she filmed Mr Safi bleeding on the ground, she said: It is so shameful. Its disgusting. It wasnt even directed at Khalid - the message wasnt for him.I was just tired of it, getting assaulted before and him punching me again. I just wrote that so that people didnt try to assault me or harrass me.Her barrister Kerim Fuad, QC, told the court: She may be Ilfords Snapchat Queen. I do not say that to make light of it, but she is another example of a youngster who seems to live her le through the prism of Snapchat.You may think she sees more of le through her phone than with her eyes.Detective Chief Inspector Mark Cranwell labelled Fatima Khan “perverse” and “callous”.Speaking after the trial, he said: Fatima used social media to bring about a confrontation between two young men vying for her affection.She lured Khalid to a spot pre-arranged with the suspect who was named in court as Raza Khan.She posted a series of antagonising posts which she knew full well could, at the very least, result in serious harm coming to Khalid.When Khalid lay dying after being stabbed, her first thought was to capture the moment for social media - a truly perverse and callous course of action. Khalid was only 18 years old when he was killed and he had his whole le ahead of him.A petty argument over rival affections has escalated with a tragic outcome. I hope todays conviction gives Khalids family some measure of comfort and closure.A £5,000 reward for information on the whereabouts of Raza Khan is being offered by the independent charity Crimestoppers."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000433297008-e1537546762553.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"dup leader arlene foster heaps praise on theresa mays tough brexit stance against the eu","story":"Speaking after the Prime Minister savaged the bloc for slapping down her Chequers deal, and demanded they treat her with more respect, the Northern Ireland boss hailed her for standing firm.She said this afternoon: The Prime Minister is right to stand firm of disrespectful, intransigent and disgraceful behaviour by the European Union.The United Kingdom will not be treated in such a manner.Mrs May, who depends on the votes of the 10 DUP politicians to have a majority in Parliament, today stuck to her guns and refused to save in to the EUs demands.And she repeatedly said she would do nothing which would break up the UK - like the bloc has proposed with a border in the Irish Sea.The statement has pleased the Northern Irish party, who want to remain as close to the rest of the UK as they can.Ms Foster accused the bloc as using the Good Friday Agreement and history of Northern Ireland for political gains.She stormed: The European Union needs to stop misusing the Northern Ireland peace process as some form of leverage.Adding: Any new regulatory barrier would be a matter for the Northern Ireland Assembly, where the DUP would veto any attempt to undermine the economic or constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom.”Earlier Mrs May blasted the EU for only offering the UK two options, neither of which are acceptable to her.She said one of them would see Northern Ireland effectively staying in the customs union, and “permanently separated economically from the rest of the UK by a border down the Irish Sea”.The PM added: “It is something I will never agree to - indeed, in my judgement it is something no British Prime Minister would ever agree to.”And ramping up the chances of the EU exiting the bloc without an agreement, she added: Anything which fails to respect the referendum or which effectively ides our country in two would be a bad deal and I have always said no deal is better than a bad deal.In response Jacob Rees-Mogg said she “has shown steely resolve at the eleventh hour and is standing up to the EU bullies”.He added: “The next step is to say to the EU £40 billion and free trade or World Trade terms.And Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: “The political games from both the EU and our Government need to end because no deal is not an option.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A good relationship at the end of this process depends on it.\"At this late stage in the negotiations, it is not acceptable to simply reject the other side\u0027s proposals without a detailed explanation and counter proposals.\"So we now need to hear from the EU what the real issues are and what their alternative is so that we can discuss them. Until we do, we cannot make progress.\"The prime minister\u0027s address came 24 hours after the EU firmly declared her Chequers proposal for the future UK-EU relationship \"will not work\" at a summit in Salzburg, Austria.The EU\u0027s stance immediately ramped up pressure on Mrs May to abandon her Chequers plan, which is also unpopular with Conservative Brexiteers, and renewed fears of the UK leaving the EU in March next year without an agreement.But, speaking in Downing Street on Friday, the prime minister stuck to her proposals as a \"third option\" between a Norway-style relationship with the EU and a \"basic trade deal\".Mrs May claimed the former option would \"make a mockery\" of the Brexit vote, as it would keep the UK as a rule-taker from Brussels, along with continued \"uncontrolled immigration from the EU\" and a bar to signing new trade deals.The latter option of a basic trade deal would leave Northern Ireland \"permanently separated economically from the rest of the UK by a border down the Irish Sea\", the prime minister added.Repeating her belief \"no deal is better than a bad deal\", Mrs May warned: \"It is something I will never agree to - indeed, in my judgement it is something no British prime minister would ever agree to.\"If the EU believe I will, they are making a fundamental mistake.\" Confessing to the perilous state of negotiations after the EU rejected her Chequers plan, Mrs May said: \"Yesterday [European Council president] Donald Tusk said our proposals would undermine the single market.\"He didn\u0027t explain how in any detail or make any counterproposal.

Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell outlined how the party is now preparing to govern  it wins a snap General Election.  Speaking exclusively to the Daily Mirror ahead of the Labour party conference, he said: “We want to hit the deck running”.  And Mr McDonnell confirmed that a major nationalisation programme of key industries is among the party’s top priorities. He also revealed for the first time his plans to set up a Public Ownership Unit in the Treasury when Labour gets into power. The unit will be led by Labour politicians and staffed by civil servants from across Whitehall. It will be charged with implementing the nationalisation of Britain’s railways, water, energy and mail.  Mr McDonnell plans to announce details in a Queen’s Speech within days of taking power and launch the unit “immediately”. He said: “We’re going to bring back into public ownership rail, water, energy and mail. We will get this legislation through in the first Queen’s Speech - we want to hit the deck running. “We will have a unit in the Treasury itself which will organise it and brings this all together with all the relevant expertise. It will be a key unit of government to make sure that happens. “We’re now doing this \u0027preparation for government\u0027 exercise at the moment. Every shadow cabinet team has been asked to look at the last manesto, and see how we can develop it. “We’re preparing manuals for implementation and then draft legislation so it’s all on the shelf ready to go.” He added: “We’re now going to have a discussion about the first Queen’s Speech.” "},{"url":null,"title":"theresa mays brexit statement what","story":"NewsTheresa May\u0027s Brexit statement: What she said and what it actually meansThe Prime Minister tried to rescue her Brexit plans with a tough-sounding statement in Downing Street.

After her humiliation in Salzburg where EU leaders savaged her Chequers plan the Prime Minister needed to act quickly to restore her battered authority. She is not the first leader to suffer a setback abroad and then come home to deliver a belligerent speech to their domestic audience. But beneath the tough language was buried another message: she hasn\u0027t given up on Chequers yet. Here\u0027s her speech and its sub-text dissected:    What she said: “I have always said that these negotiations would be tough - and they were always bound to be toughest in the final straight.  “While both sides want a deal, we have to face up to the fact that - despite the progress we have made - there are two big issues where we remain a long way apart.”  What it means: Theresa May is clearly stung by how badly her meeting with EU leaders in Salzburg went.  She had hoped to get an endorsement for her Chequers plan but it was met with outright rejection. Her whole statement is about trying to restore her battered authority ahead of the Conservative conference.  What she said: “The EU is still only offering us two options.  “The first option would involve the UK staying in the European Economic Area and a customs union with the EU. “In plain English, this would mean we’d still have to abide by all the EU rules, uncontrolled immigration from the EU would continue and we couldn’t do the trade deals we want with other countries. “That would make a mockery of the referendum we had two years ago.”     What it means: This is a reference to the Norway option where would stay in the single market and customs union but have no say on the rules and would have to accept freedom of movement.  At the heart of this is her interpretation of the referendum result as being a protest vote against immigration.   What she said: “The second option would be a basic free trade agreement for Great Britain that would introduce checks at the Great Britain/EU border. But even worse, Northern Ireland would effectively remain in the Customs Union and parts of the Single Market, permanently separated economically from the rest of the UK by a border down the Irish Sea.”   What it means: This her summary of the Canada model. In December the Prime Minister agreed with the EU that  no alternative solution can be found then Northern Ireland will stay in the customs union and single market.  But Mrs May says she will “never agree” to this and claims it would be contrary to the Good Friday Agreement.  She could have added it is deeply opposed by the DUP who she relies upon to stay in power.   What she said: “Anything which fails to respect the referendum or which effectively ides our country in two would be a bad deal and I have always said no deal is better than a bad deal.”       What it means: This is a piece of brinkmanship by the Prime Minister. The EU knows the no deal option would be economically damaging for them but it would be calamitous for Britain.  For all the tough language it is a hollow threat. A no deal would be catastrophic for UK jobs and business and would most likely be blocked by Parliament.  What she said: “But I have also been clear that the best outcome is for the UK to leave with a deal. That is why, following months of intensive work and detailed discussions, we proposed a third option for our future economic relationship, based on the frictionless trade in goods. That is the best way to protect jobs here and in the EU and to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, while respecting the referendum result and the integrity of the United Kingdom.”    What it means: Chequers is not dead. The Prime Minister is still clinging to her plan even though it has been rejected by EU leaders, Tory Brexiteers and Labour.  She has tried to bury this beneath the tub-thumping and plastic Thatcher act.  What she said: “Yesterday Donald Tusk said our proposals would undermine the single market. He didn’t explain how in any detail or make any counter-proposal. So we are at an impasse.”   What it means: The last line is a statement of the obvious. After Salzburg it is clear the negotiations have hit a deadlock. Brussels would counter that it has been explicit from the start the reasons it rejects the UK’s proposals as they will give us a competitive advantage which other EU countries would then want leading to the break up of the single market.

Alan Craig was given a standing ovation by hundreds of right-wing activists as he made the incendiary comments in the wake of grooming scandals including Rotherham. He also claimed the issue could be traced back to Muhammad himself based on a think tank report - but the report\u0027s author told the Mirror Mr Craig had misquoted it. Mr Craig - UKIP\u0027s families spokesman who has called equalities campaigners the Gaystapo - now faces a major backlash for seizing on the issue during a charged political speech on the main stage in Birmingham. Condemning the \u0027holocaust\u0027 comment, Quilliam Foundation researcher Muna Adil added: I do not condone this alarmist language, and we did not use such language in our report. Quilliam Foundation policy director David Toube added: Alan Craig\u0027s misuse of Holocaust imagery to describe the grooming gangs case is shameful. The Holocaust constituted the industrialised murder, by the Nazi state, of over a million Jewish children. The grooming gangs cases involved a failure to prevent and, initially, to prosecute criminals who raped scores of vulnerable girls. Quilliam has spoken out loudly against the scandalous failure to address these crimes. But to compare these evil acts to the Holocaust is disgraceful.  It comes after party leader Gerard Batten has turned his focus to immigration and Islam in a bid to scoop up populist votes - prompting concern from ex-leader Nigel Farage. It also comes months after UKIP was ordered to pay \u0026pound175,000 in legal costs in relation to MEP Jane Collins losing a defamation case.  Ms Collins wrongly said three Labour MPs had known about Rotherham\u0027s abuse scandal but failed to intervene. Police estimate up to 1,510 potential victims were sexually exploited in Rotherham over a 16-year period. Of 110 suspects 80% were of Pakistani heritage, officers said. In 2014 an independent inquiry found there had been nervousness by the authorities about identying the perpetrators as predominantly of Asian origin, while others remembered clear direction from their managers not to do so.  Mr Craig told UKIP members: What\u0027s happened over the last decades is nothing less than – I use this word advisedly – a holocaust. It has been a holocaust of our children, of our daughters. If you look into this,  you meet and talk to some of the children, the level of bestiality and depravity that has been visited on these girls – most of them white English girls, not all, Sikh girls, others too – the level visited on them by the tens of thousands up and down the country is beyond belief. They\u0027ve referred to the perpetrators as men, or at very best they\u0027ve referred to them as Asian men, as  the Chinese or the Japanese were involved in doing this sort of thing. I recommend to you a report produced by some very courageous Muslims in the Quilliam foundation.  They have done their own search and they were quite shocked by their own research and I honour them for following the facts. They said quite clearly that overwhelmingly the perpetrators are from Pakistani and Muslim backgrounds.”  Mr Craig had to break for applause before continuing: “And they trace a major part of the influence back to the Islamic faith and back to Muhammad himself. “They said, and it\u0027s on page 37  you don\u0027t believe me, they said trace it back through the Pakistani culture.  In Pakistan they believe in child brides, which they trace back to Muhammad himself. “I will say no more except we need to name the problem as it really is.” Speaking to the Mirror, Quilliam Foundation chief executive Haras Rafiq said Mr Craig had misquoted part of the report and we didn\u0027t say Muhammad was responsible. Mr Rafiq said grooming by Pakistani men was a genuine issue, but populists have hijacked this debate and the lack of willingness, PC-ness, of people not wanting to tackle this. Mr Rafiq sent the Mirror the report, in which page 37 states there is a belief that Muhammad had a child bride based on a selective reading of hadith literature which is doubted by other Muslims, and is in conflict with several other historical accounts suggesting that this report is inaccurate.

As he tells Claire Donnelly, an unexpected bill and a visit from bailfs have left him with unmanageable debts. I’ve had a nightmare with bailfs, they\u0027ve ruined my finances and left me needing to use a food bank to feed my children. Having no money, having debt is a nightmare. You go to bed thinking about it and you wake up thinking about it, every day Basically I was getting my council tax paid then the benefits changed and I needed to pay 30 per cent of it myself - but I didn\u0027t know that. So I got a bill saying I owed \u0026pound373. I rang straight away and said I’d pay \u0026pound50 a month. I’m on JSA so it was a lot but I wanted to get it sorted. I almost killed myself paying it back.  I had one payment of \u0026pound50 left. One day I came out to see a letter from the bailfs taped to the wall outside my house - not even put through the letter box - saying they’d visited my home so were charging me \u0026pound235 for a visit and a late payment fee of \u0026pound75. I spoke to the council but they said it was up to the bailfs because my debt had been sold on to them. So now I’m paying back an additional debt I’ve got for no reason and my this year’s council tax. I can’t afford to do both so I’m alway falling behind on this year’s council tax. It’s like a wheel, I can’t get off. After I’ve paid the debt and just my essential bills there’s nothing left for food so we’ve had to come to the food bank twice just to get by.  I shouldn’t have to do this but it’s about surviving, that’s what you’re doing, surviving. I’ve done loads of dferent jobs, I’ve worked as a lorry driver and all sorts but it isn’t worth it a lot of the time because you can’t get a proper job with proper hours and rights. I could get agency work tomorrow but why would I? By the time you’ve set up and finished your claim you could be out of work again.

Facing an unpaid rent bill the 27-year old, from Windsor, Berkshire, was prepared to try a new career. She had discovered a friend was working as a \u0027cam girl\u0027 and, encouraged by her sister, decided to give it go and hasn\u0027t looked back. She has now been a cam girl for several months and earns hundreds of pounds each day for a few hours\u0027 work talking online to men about their sexual fantasies and sometimes taking her clothes off or using sex toys.  She said: “I used to have low self-confidence and body insecurities but since taking up camming my self-esteem has rocketed. “What I used to see as imperfections are loved by my viewers. I believe that women should be entitled to do exactly as they please with their bodies without having to fear criticism. “My job is a bit like being a therapist and while sexual fantasies are a big part of camming I can spend hours simply discussing their day.”  Lola took time out to answer some of the Mirror\u0027s questions about her le as a camgirl.  What does a cam girl do? A cam girl will be online and visible to others through a webcam that also has a chat room to communicate via typing or audio. You will be able to chat in a group session with the cam girl, or you can go to a private room where it will be one-to-one. You will be charged per minute to chat - talking in private costs more. I charge \u0026pound2 a minute to chat to me in a group where men or women can see me fully-dressed  and I charge \u0026pound3 a minute to talk to me on a one-to-one basis. The cam girl is there for you to talk to... whether it be about your day at work, your plans at the weekend... or you could talk about your deepest fantasies and then it goes from there. A cam girl will also have a profile which will tell you all about them, you can gauge what experience you will have from this profile.  Is it just talk or is there a physical element? Do you stay fully clothed? In private I do take my clothes off, or I may be dressed in a requested outfit... PVC is the most popular and usually requested by someone who likes domination or humiliation. It\u0027s something I had to get used to as I\u0027m a super nice person. Being mean to someone because they enjoy it is a hard one to crack. I own several outfits and several toys that I use during private shows. A guy tends to spend an hour on average in private chat and we talk about all the things they would like to do. Public sex is the most common, getting up to no good in bars etc. I usually listen to them and then, to put it crudely, act out what they are telling me to do to myself. Are there any extreme behaviours you have witnessed? I have chatted to men who think it\u0027s okay to be extremely demanding, rude and, perhaps some would say, aggressive in the chat. I politely tell them that I will not tolerate it and I kick them out so they cannot  to the cam. They will often email through the website begging to be allowed back into the chat. I think they believe we NEED their business... there are plenty of respectable guys and girls looking to cam. Us cam girls can be very choosy and you have to be strong in this job, you do not have to do anything you feel uncomfortable with. You are your own boss. What is your average day? My average day will consist of me logging on for 9-10am. I will update my profile, keeping it relevant, and I will make sure it\u0027s visible on the front page of the website. I am a performer, it\u0027s my job to provide a sensual virtual experience to who I\u0027m talking to. I want the person to connect with me and feel as  they are in the room. I will spend the day logged on answering calls from ious people with ious desires. I usually clock off when I\u0027ve hit my goal  around 4pm when I resume my usual day. I like to keep my alter ego separate from real le. She\u0027s feisty, sexy and seductive whereas I\u0027m bubbly, laid back and enjoy slobbing on the sofa watching box sets.  How did you get into being a cam girl? I was first introduced to webcam when me and a friend stumbled across an older friend\u0027s social media which showed she was openly caming. I never dreamt that I would have the guts to start it myself. However after a work-related breakdown and being diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression, which meant leaving my job, I thought: \u0027what\u0027s a girl to lose\u0027. I hadn\u0027t worked in seven months and my rent was due. I came across On The Record models on Instagram and within 24 hours my profile was live. What did you do before? I have worked in healthcare for 10 years and my last role was a Recruitment Co-Ordinator How much do you earn? On my first day I made \u0026pound1,700 and on a good day I can make \u0026pound700 in around 4 hours... I aim to make around \u0026pound150k in a year. Do you only work late at night? No, actually I have recently slipped into working 9-5. Perhaps it\u0027s embedded in me from my years of working in an office! If I make plans in the day, I will come home and work at night. However, early mornings are usually very busy. Most of the guys I speak to work from home, or are uni students or are on dferent time zones.. I\u0027ve been invited all over the world. I have a few regulars who cam with me from their office while they are \u0027working\u0027.  What do friends and family think of your job? My friends find what I do refreshing. They will ask me about my day at work with genuine interest. My family completely support me, it was in fact my sister who encouraged me to start camming as she thought I\u0027d be great at it. How does it affect your relationships? I am single at the moment. However, the last guy I was seeing did know about camming. He said that he was fine with it but we broke up shortly after I told him. I do believe he had an issue with it. We had a fun relationship before he knew. I would send him racy pictures and he would love it. After he found out, he would brush them off as  to say... it\u0027s not all for me. What has the money allowed you to do? The earning power is unlimited. I spent Christmas at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York and am able to holiday when I like. I\u0027m going to Amsterdam next month and for some winter sun. I have now paid my rent up front for the next year as well as saving for a mortgage for my own place. I do enjoy trips to London to stock up on designer clothes too.  How do you keep yourself in shape and looking good? I\u0027m successful on cam thanks to my curves. I used to feel conscious that I wasn\u0027t a size 8. I\u0027ve been dieting all my le... now I make money from being a size 12-14 and men go weak for my curves. It\u0027s allowed me to accept myself but I eat well and I walk everywhere. What kinds of fans do you have and what kind of things do you get asked? I talk to so many dferent kinds of people. I speak to a famous Rugby player regularly, business men, extremely attractive young men and older women who are into domination. The most common thing I have been asked is  I will go on a date with the person I am talking to. I keep it strictly work. I\u0027ve had two men tell me they love me – interestingly both were married.  Do you have any “red lines” when it comes to private chat? Have you had to end calls or break off? There are standard red tape rules - no talk of under age sex, rape or animals. I have one guy say he enjoyed role play and asked me to be \u0027younger\u0027 but didn\u0027t state how young. I didn\u0027t get a good vibe from his so I cut the chat. Looking at it now I should have asked more. If he is in his 50s then being younger could be 20 plus. I\u0027ve had a chat in role play who was very aggressive to women and wanted to talk about the violent acts he would do to me. Again, I stopped the chat. Are you ever recognised? Do you have to be careful about personal details you give out? I\u0027ve been recognised once! A guy who worked behind a bar in a restaurant in Surrey was trying to work out where he knew me from. He went bright red and we both realised but did say anything else about it. What has it taught you about men? I believe that the men I speak to come to me because they either long for intimacy or they desire a more personal sexual experience than from, say, porn. I do speak to a lot of married men and I respect that they are not cheating on their wives. I do also speak to a lot of married men who are persistent in trying to meet me, a regular of mine has actually mentioned “love” and leaving his we, we speak around five hours and he\u0027s developed feelings. This does put me off being in a relationship. I think we all have desires that we need to meet, I\u0027m all for it as long as no one is hurt in the process.  Has it led to other opportunities? I\u0027ve been invited to very exclusive places through camming and I have been asked to model away from cam. There was a chap on cam who was 78 years old, he emailed me to ask  he could pay me \u0026pound3,000 a week  I would join him for dinner twice a week at his stately home. I did decline, I keep it strictly cam. Are you friends with other cam girls/boys?  I am indeed.  Off the Record  has an amazing group of women and men. We all chat in our WhatsApp group.  One of the girls and I are planning a cheeky week in the sun this October.

The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for Sunday, with heavy rain and thunderstorms expected to hit. Gusts of 60mph could be possible and forecasters have said hail is likely.  According to BBC weather , there is a small chance of injuries and danger to le from flying debris amid the windy conditions.  Gusts could cause damage to buildings, such as tiles blown from roofs or through falling trees and branches. There is also a small risk of power cuts, longer journey times, and cancellations to road, rail, air and ferry services.  No weather warning has been issued for Saturday.   Heavy rainfall and powerful gusts brought by Storm Bronagh are set to ease as the weather system moves into the North Sea, forecasters have said. Coming hot on the heels of Storm Ali, the second named storm of the year has caused travel misery and widespread disruption, with fallen trees and flooding blocking roads and rail routes. But forecasters said the impact of Bronagh is waning, and is mostly restricted to offshore areas in the North East.  Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge told the Press Association: We have got reasonably good weather conditions anticipated over the next few days, given that Storm Bronagh is now leaving our shores. It exited the North East last night and in the early hours of the morning into the North Sea, although the back end of the storm will still cause heavy winds in offshore areas in the North East. Its influence over the weather picture is waning, and in truth it is only really going to be impacting upon those offshore north-eastern areas.

Alasdair Cunningham, 41, was on a mission to Uganda to identy villages in need of fresh water when he took the trip on the Nile. The man-eating crocodiles there can grow up to 20ft long – but Alasdair, of Corby, Northants, was pulled from the water after the drama with just bruises. The father-of-two, who runs property firm Better Sourced, said: “I managed to keep my head above water and was rescued by one of the boats sent by the rafting company. When they saw the raft go over, they all thought there would be deaths.” His business partner Samuel Leeds, of Lichfield, Staffs, shattered his kneecap on rocks and needed emergency surgery.

Angelos Sofocleous was sacked from his post at Durham University\u0027s philosophy journal \u0027Critique\u0027 after just three days for writing a tweet deemed \u0027transphobic\u0027 by fellow students.  The 24-year-old faced disciplinary action last month after he re-tweeted an article by The Spectator on his personal Twitter account, adding the comment \u0027re-tweet  women don\u0027t have penises\u0027.  The tweet sparked outrage across the social media platform, and Mr Sofocleous was dismissed from his position at the publication, as well as being \u0027forced\u0027 to resign as president-elect of Humanist Students.  The postgraduate Philosophy and Psychology student was also fired from his position as general editor of Durham University\u0027s online magazine, \u0027The Bubble\u0027. Collecting hundreds of comments, the tweet has since sparked a row around Humanism, trans rights and freedom of speech. In the now deleted re-tweet, Mr Sofocleous shared an article by Spectator writer James Kirkup titled \u0027Is it a crime to say women don\u0027t have penises?\u0027, with the comment: RT  women don\u0027t have penises\u0027. The post received backlash from former chair of LGBT Humanists Christopher Ward, among others, who claimed the post was \u0027factually incorrect\u0027 and not \u0027worthy of a debate\u0027. He wrote: As former chair of LGBT Humanists UK, the opposition I experienced from a number of longstanding Humanists members to trans people and trans issues was a stain on an otherwise great organisation. And here\u0027s the new President of Humanist Students RTing horric transphobic s**t. Standing by his tweets, Mr Sofocleous wrote: I may be wrong and women might indeed have penises, although I don\u0027t believe that to be the case. But the backlash that took place after my comments, particularly within the organisation, convinced me that, unfortunately and surprisingly, there are certain issues within the humanist movement which are undebatable.  No effort was made, beyond name-calling, derogatory comments, and ad hominem statements, to convince me of the truth of the other side\u0027s position. These events involved a retweet of mine saying \u0027RT  women don\u0027t have penises\u0027, and certain other criticisms of the transgender movement, as well as suggestions to improve the movement\u0027s actions. Sadly, these views were taken to be \u0027transphobic\u0027 by iniduals who cannot tolerate any criticism, either of their movement or their ideas, and are unable to engage in a civilised conversation on issues they disagree on. These are iniduals who think they hold the absolute right to determine which ideas can be discussed and what language can be used in a public forum. In August, Mr Sofocleous was sent an email from Ryan Lo, the president of the university\u0027s Philosophy Society, saying the group had taken a vote to relieve him of his position, deciding his tweets served to \u0027belittle trans experiences\u0027.  Writing on the Critique journal\u0027s Facebook page, Mr Lo said: Durham University Philosophy Society has a duty to act within the best interests of all of its members, therefore is committed to equality and ersity and to our democratic principles as a group of Durham Student\u0027s Union.

Jack Towers began a strict diet and exercise plan in January last year after reaching a bulging 34 stone and being warned he was at risk of developing diabetes. Before his transformation, the customer care assistant would spent around \u0026pound5,000-a-year gorging on takeaways and hiding stashes of chocolate and crisps in his car. But after sticking to a new regime of healthy cooking at home, Jack looks like a completely new man and cuts a trim figure at half his former size.   Using a Slimming World plan, the 21-year-old from Ashford, Kent, cut out fatty foods, piles of snacks and alcohol to reach his target of 15 stone.   The huge weight loss gathered him more than 92,000 followers on his Instagram account @towers_weightjourney who have been inspired by his journey and his positive attitude to le.  But it has also left him with a physical legacy which he is struggling to sht - rolls of loose skin which exercise and diet alone will not tighten, and the prospect of a \u0026pound25,000 bill to get rid of them. Jack posted photos of his new body on his social media, showing all the excess skin that shedding so many stones has left behind.   He also revealed he has had private consultations for a major operation - a post-bariatric body lt - because the operation is not funded on the NHS .  “It can be risky surgery as it is a full body lt which can be quite intense,” he said. “But after a great consultation and fantastic after-case with the team, and all involved, I’ve decided that I will be going ahead with the operation. “Unfortunately the NHS have rejected my application so I’m looking at around \u0026pound23-\u0026pound25,000 out of my back pocket but that’s how I’ve decided to go forward.” He added: “Having loose skin isn’t anything to be ashamed of, it’s part of my journey and something I’ll always be proud of.”  The NHS says funding is not generally available for cosmetic surgery unless there is a medical need and it impacts quality of le. Jack says he understands the NHS\u0027 reasoning, adding  the money isn\u0027t there, that\u0027s fine and that\u0027s le. With no plans to set up his own crowdfunding page, Jack’s social media followers and friends have decided to help out by doing it for him. Suzie Skene set up a GoFundMe page, encouraging everyone inspired by Jack to donate.

Mike Enright and Jason Baddams sparked their own scenes of laughter when they burst into an auction house in the fancy dress outfits the Trotter brothers wore in one famous episode. Stood at the back of the room, Mike, 47, entered the bidding on the prop at \u0026pound18,000 before successfully securing it for a hammer price of \u0026pound28,000. With fees added on the Del Boy fan paid a total of \u0026pound34,720 for the item, the so-called Harrison Lesser Watch.

He correctly identies it as the missing Harrison watch that goes on to sell at auction for \u0026pound6.2m, causing both brothers to hilariously faint in shock. Mike, who runs his own skip hire company, didn’t pass out after snapping up the metal alloy watch but did say: “Lovely jubbly’. Mike, from Dudley, West Midlsbds added: “I am a huge Only Fools and Horses fan and was determined to buy that watch.  “It is a lot of money but it is such a famous prop. More than 26 million people watched that episode of Only Fools and Horses. “You are never going to get another chance to buy it again. “To be honest, I thought it would go for a lot more and I would have been prepared to pay it. “I was ecstatic afterwards and went straight to the pub to celebrate.”  Mike, who is orced, said he intended to keep the watch in a safety deposit box. Auctioneer Chris Aston, of Aston’s Auctioneers of Dudley, said he almost dropped his gavel in shock when he saw Mike and Jason appear in the room. He said: “I was in the heat of auctioneering when I looked up and saw Batman and Robin enter the room. “It threw me at first but there was a lot of laughter from everyone.

Beverley Dodds, once crowned Miss Merseyside, used to lather herself with the sticky mixture so she could get a \u0027teak\u0027 tan to show off her body. Obsessed with sunbeds, she would spend so much time under the \u0027blue light\u0027 in her bedroom that her dad would complain about electricity bills. But now, she covers up everywhere she goes, hiding the body that once won her beauty crowns, after fighting the effects of skin cancer for two decades. She is encouraging other women to ditch the sunbeds and use fake tan instead. Beverley, who has battled cancer for 22 years, said: “You only get one skin, they can’t put a new one on. You should really look after it.  The 55-year-old, originally from The Wirral, Merseyside, used to go on sunbeds all the time. It was the done thing, she said. I used to model for sunbeds and they asked  I wanted the \u0026pound80 fee or a \u0026pound150 sunbed and I said ‘Oh I’ll have the sunbed’ - that\u0027s how much I used them. “I used to have it over my bed me and my sister used to use it all the time. I remember my dad used to always go on about the electricity bills. “There’d be a blue light coming from my bedroom all the time -  I only knew then what I know now about how dangerous they are.”  She added: “I sunbathed as well, I was a bit of a tanorexic to be fair. “I had a perma tan, like a dark, teak colour which isn’t really a good look actually. Beverley, said there were little or no warnings about using sunbeds at the time. The only warning was that the sunbed had to be six inches from your face, she said. “I used to wear olive oil and vinegar or baby oil and coca-cola. Or we’d wear factor 2. “And  you went on holiday and didn’t come back with a tan, people would think, \u0027What is wrong with you?\u0027 It was just a dferent style back then.  I probably was a bit addicted to the sunbeds, because when you’d lose your tan, you’d think ‘Oh I’m really pale’. But when I look back at the pictures, I’m actually really dark. However, in 1996, Beverley developed a burning itch on her legs which was eventually diagnosed as a type of skin cancer. I got these really itchy patches on my legs, they were kind of raised and I thought ‘Oh, I’ve got eczema’. “I was scratching it so much it would bleed. I went to a specialist and he diagnosed me with Bowen’s disease - it’s like a pre-melanoma but it is a skin cancer. “I was treated for it but then in 2005, I had to have a skin graft on my leg and the operations are very invasive and they hurt a lot - it’s really painful. “They take a chunk [of skin] out of you to build you up like a patchwork quilt and the scarring is terrible - I just can’t show my legs now.  “I’m always in absolute agony, my feet take a lot of battering - it hurts to walk. Beverley, who now lives in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, with her partner Russell Hipkiss, regularly undergoes dferent treatments to stop the cancer from spreading which she says are \u0027incredibly painful\u0027. “At the moment I’m going through photodynamic therapy where they put acid on your skin and then ironically they put it under light and that blisters terribly, she explained. “It takes all your skin off. The scars on her legs have left her feeling self-conscious and “unattractive”. “My legs were always my nice feature and now they’re horrible and I have to cover them as much as possible,” Beverley said.  “It’s really upsetting to me because I used to love wearing a nice dress and now I feel embarrassed by my legs. “It does knock your confidence, I sometimes put make-up on to cover the marks  I do wear a dress but it doesn’t really work and is still looks horrible. “I always have to wear a plaster as well in case they start to bleed - it does take a toll. Thank God for jumpsuits, that’s all I’ll say.” She is now encouraging women to switch sunbeds for fake tan products. “If I hadn’t gone on the sunbeds, I’d have had perfect skin and this wouldn’t have happened, she said. “I never thought I’d get skin cancer, it never entered my mind.

Graham Benbow, 55, lost his temper and attempted to drive through an open barrier at Manchester Airport after being told he would have to pay \u0026pound3 for dropping off a passenger at a departures terminal. The official tried to stop him by standing against the barrier - but ended up on the bonnet of Benbow\u0027s Mazda 3 hatchback car and was carried along the road for several hundred yards, a court heard. During the manic ride, Benbow - a psychology teacher at one of Britain\u0027s top girl grammar schools - went over a roundabout before eventually stopping for police as he was about to join the M56 motorway. The unnamed airport official was uninjured in the incident but said he genuinely believed he could die from falling off the bonnet.  But Benbow walked free after a judge said that although it was no excuse for dangerous driving , he thinks the drop-off charges are a disgrace.    At Minshull Street Crown Court , Manchester, Benbow, of Stockton Heath, near Warrington faced up to two years in jail after he admitted dangerous driving.  But he wept as he was told he would get six months jail suspended for two years with Judge Bernard Lever saying he was 100% against  the new charges introduced by the airport last July. In sentencing the judge said: Although it is no excuse for dangerous driving, I think that it is an absolute disgrace that people cannot deliver people to airports without paying an extraordinary amount. I was dropping off my cousin at the airport on Sunday and I was warned by my sister that the airport charges had been introduced so I looked for a sign when I arrived - but  I did not know I might not have seen it. The airport already does make a lot of money and does not need to charge \u0026pound3 for people to drop people off. My sister warned me that by the time you have got to the front you are allowed just minutes or seconds and they start charging you more. I saw a troop of elderly people who had been dropped off away from the airport trying to avoid these unjust charges. These were not young joggers, they were elderly people who had to be dropped off some distance away from the airport.  He told Benbow: You are fortunate indeed that I have faced these facilities myself recently. Whilst I am 100% against your behaviour and losing self control, I am 100% against the airport behaving in this manner against people who have no or little choice at dropping their families at the airport in this way. I quite understand why you lost your rag and completely flipped in the way you did but judges have to uphold the regulations that authorities at the airport are entitled to up their levy from time to time. I have to make it clear to everyone that they must not lose their temper. That does not retract from the fact that this was very dangerous driving and what you did was very reckless and dangerous. The judge said Benbow has worked for many years at a highly well-known and respected school and in a reference from the school principal, it states that he has never missed a day off work and he makes himself available for non-work days to provide additional cover. According to the reference, Benbow has been devastated by this case and very much regrets what he has done.  The judge told him: You have made a very positive contribution to your teaching and work despite the ious dficulties you have faced with depression. But people must not lose their temper so that when the official comes along and tries to do their job, you make it very dficult for them. You drove your car in an opportunistic way when you were unable to get out without paying but the compliant got onto your bonnet. You were not driving at a great speed but it is wrong to drive along the with someone of the bonnet of your car. He was trying to call your bluff and you were trying to call his bluff and I expect you were both enraged at that time. The judge did say that he accepted what happened was out of character. The incident occurred last July 23, just 13 days after the charges were introduced by the airport which claimed it would ease growing congestion.  Benbow who works at Altrincham Grammar School for Girls was in the drop off area at the airport when he encountered the official who was explaining the new fees. Prosecutor Duncan Wilcock said: The complainant is a gentleman who is employed by the airport to explain the rules and to explain what steps should be taken with regards to the drop-off charges. On 23 July this year the defendant attended the airport to drop someone off. Staff said he immediately began shouting and said he was not going to pay as there were no clear signs saying that he should. The defendant reversed his vehicle as he was going to look at the signs but at that point but he noticed one of the barriers was open and began to race towards the barrier to get away with not paying. The staff member placed himself against the barrier to stop him from doing so but the defendant did not stop. The complainant got onto the bonnet of the car and was in fear of his safety.  He remained of the bonnet for several hundred yards while the defendant continued to drive. Staff from the airport saw what had taken place and sent information via radio to the police. He went over a roundabout and stopped just before the M65 motorway. He pulled into the side of the road but when the officer tells him to pull his keys from the ignition he tried to reverse away from the officer. In a statement the complainant said he feared for his le during this incident and genuinely thought that he could die from falling off the bonnet. He said the defendant was driving in a manic manner across the roundabout.

Shannon Rich, who says she has never eaten meat in her le, hungrily ate two slices before realising what was on top. The 22-year-old and her partner Paul Davies, 22, ordered two vegetarian Roma pizzas for dinner on Tuesday, September 11 from Domino’s on Malpas Road in Newport, South Wales. On the Domino\u0027s website, the Roma pizza, which is part of the Italiano range, is said to include toppings of goat’s cheese, Roquito cherry peppers, red onions and rocket leaves on either a medium or large Italian-style pizza base. When the pizzas arrive Shannon claims she was so hungry she tucked right in and ate two slices before making the shocking discovery – and discovered ham on her meal. However, Domino’s said Shannon has been ‘reluctant to cooperate’ with their attempts to investigate the allegations.  University student Shannon said: “We ordered the pizzas and when they came they were literally smothered in ham. “We were hungry obviously when it arrived and when I opened it I just bit into it – I never saw meat on the pizza before I ate it. “I ate two slices and then I looked and saw there was meat on there. “I asked my partner and said ‘oh my god is that meat?’ and he said ‘yeah’. Then he opened his again, he’d eaten some of his and there was meat on his too. It made me physically sick. “It didn’t even smell like meat. I was hungry and just indulged in it – I ate two slices. “I didn’t know it was on there. It was hidden and I don’t even know what meat tastes like. “When I noticed, I ran to the toilet and tried making myself be sick to just try and get it up. “My boyfriend just ate the two slices too, but he’s not as bothered as I obviously am because he’s not been veggie his whole le. “It makes me feel ill even when I think about it.” Shannon, who placed the order online, alleges that the delivery was taking longer than usual and says she rang the store to chase it, reiterating that they were two vegetarian pizzas. Despite previously being a regular Domino’s customer, Shannon claims she has now been put off pizza for le. The alleged ordeal has left Shannon so ‘paranoid’ she says she now checks every single thing she eats to make sure there\u0027s no hidden meat in it.  Shannon said: “It would normally take 45 minutes to an hour to get to us – but this time it did take a while. “I rang the store and I expressed again then that they were two vegetarian pizzas, they said they wouldn’t be long. “It’s affected me now because I’m scared with food. I’m just constantly checking it. “It has made me constantly paranoid. I won’t eat out now and I didn’t eat for a while after that as it just made me ill. “I check stuff I make too. I’m just constantly checking it, always checking the labels and in the food and in the packets to very – I’m still so upset about it.” After the shock, Shannon called the Domino’s store back to tell them there was meat on the pizza and claims they dismissed her allegation telling her that was what she had ordered. Shannon then posted a picture of the pizza on social media to express just how upset she was with the situation. The student claims Domino’s responded by offering her free pizza and that they would be sending an area manager to the store to investigate, but Shannon says she\u0027ll never touch Domino’s pizza again.

Rather than spending her time carrying out official duties, the Queen\u0027s granddaughter is a top equestrian and Olympian with a fairly normal family le. As she\u0027s not a working royal, she has more freedom and she\u0027s just appeared in an advertising campaign with her adorable three-month-old baby daughter.  Zara is the new ambassador for pushchair company iCandy and invited the team into her home to film an advert.   In the clip the mum-of-two takes baby Lena out for a walk in the countryside with their two dogs .    Zara, who is promoting the iCandy for Land Rover collaboration pushchair, said: I always use the best equipment in competing and it definitely applies for the children and having the best for the baby.  The iCandy for Land Rover works incredibly well for us and fits into our lestyle across all-terrains, it is light and accessible. It is a fantastic addition for our family.  It is so important to me and the family to be outside my job day-in-day-out is solely being outside, so for me having the family there makes it all the more doable with my iCandy for Land Rover pushchair. During the video Zara can be seen folding up the pushchair and putting it in the back of a Range Rover, before driving through the country.  Bradley Appel, iCandy joint CEO, said: It is so wonderful to have Zara as part of our iCandy family. Her sporting excellence as both a World Champion and Olympic medallist is a credit to Great Britain, but to see her achieve all this and go on to become a full-time mother too is the embodiment of the multi-dimensional modern working parent that we see in many of our customers across the globe.

If so, you might want to steer clear of Daniel Sloss\u0027 show - as it might lead to bit of an awkward moment or, worse still, the demise of your relationship. The Scottish comedian says a 20-minute joke in one of his shows has been responsible for more than 4,000 break-ups. His live stand-up routines have been streaming on Netflix since September 11 - yes, it only became available to view 10 days ago. In his show Jigsaw, the 28-year-old, from Fe, rubbishes the notion that everyone has a soulmate, saying the message society puts out is: If you are not with someone, you are broken. If you are not with someone, you are incomplete. If you are not with someone, you are not whole.  As a result, we are made to feel as though we need a partner to feel complete - meaning many settle and end up with the wrong person. “We’ll force this f***ing person into our lives because we’d much rather have something than nothing, he explains. The advice has struck a chord with people all over the world, who have been messaging Sloss to thank him for changing their lives.  One wrote: Hi Daniel! I am 23 years old  and I wanted to say you can add a orce from a 3 year emotional abusive marriage to your list. I just finished watching your show, and I was having doubts about whether or not I had made the right decision. However, the questions and situations you brought up confirmed that it\u0027s ok to say that I deserve better.  Another said: Guess you can add another to your list. Watched jigsaw and just wanted to say thank you. Certainly not the message I expected from a comedy special but the analogy has been stuck in my head ever since and you were right. People have even turned him into a meme.  Last week Daniel told the Daily Record : “The joke is 20 minutes long and was never intended to break couples up. It’s just a joyous effect of it. “It’s a love letter to single people, pointing out that most of the time being single is better than being in a relationship. “Turns out it resonates with people so much they’re dumping their s*** partners. “Before Netflix, the tally was 500. It’s now more than 2500 – and those are only the confirmed numbers, people who have messaged me. “I wouldn’t be shocked  it was four times higher.” "},{"url":null,"title":"british woman feeling unwell tenerife","story":"NewsBritish woman feeling unwell in Tenere stunned to discover \u0027dead tortoise inside her VAGINA\u0027The unnamed woman - thought to be an expat - has been quizzed police on the island following the unusual reptile discoveryShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByGerard Couzens16:58, 20 SEP 2018Updated23:40, 20 SEP 2018NewsThe size of the reptile is not known \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA British woman has reportedly been questioned by police on Tenere after doctors found a dead tortoise inside her vagina. Staff at the A\u0026ampE department of a medical centre in the south of the island are said to have called officers in after making the bizarre discovery. The unnamed woman, described as an expat, had sought help after suffering pain in her genital area which doctors diagnosed as an infection caused by the reptile. Island newspaper El Dia claimed she told police she had begun to feel odd after going out partying with a group of British friends a couple of days earlier - but had no idea how the tortoise ended up where it did.   Brit found with tortoise in vagina in Tenere \u0027may have been sexually assaulted after night out partying\u0027  The size of the reptile has not been revealed. Island papers - and respected Spanish dailies which have echoed the story - have named the medical centre she attended as El Mojon in the municipality of Arona in the south of the island. The facility, above the holiday resort of Los Cristianos, operates as a small hospital and is eventually expected to become the main southern Tenere state hospital. Police sources in Tenere confirmed the story was true and officers had been asked to speak to a British woman about the bizarre discovery.  No-one from the hospital was available for comment this afternoon although El Dia said health officials had declined to comment for data protection reasons. National Police in Tenere, reported to have been called in to question the woman over concern about how the animal had ended up in her private parts, could not be immediately reached. She is said to have gone to A\u0026ampE at El Mojon on Saturday. Spanish daily ABC reported: “A woman of British origin went to A\u0026ampE at El Mojon in Arona, Tenere, on Saturday because she felt pain in her private parts. “The duty doctors inspected her and saw that her discomfort was due to the fact that the woman, who lives on the island, had a dead turtle inside her vagina which had caused a serious infection.” In December last year doctors revealed the full list of baffling items found in vaginas. The most common was scented soap followed by a deodorant lid, a bottle cap and a penis ring with spikes on.

The \u0027super-Earth\u0027 and \u0027hot Earth\u0027 planets were spotted in solar systems at least 49 light-years away during a 337million mission. NASA\u0027s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or \u0027TESS\u0027 - a planet-hunting orbital telescope - made the incredible discovery. It marks the satellite\u0027s first discovery on its two-year mission since its April launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, officials confirmed on Thursday.  \u0027TESS\u0027 is designed to detect worlds beyond our solar system, as part of astronomers\u0027 bid to expand the known catalog of so-called exoplanets, worlds circling distant stars. While the two planets are too hot to support le, TESS Deputy Science Director Sara Seager expects many more such discoveries. She told Reuters: We will have to wait and see what else TESS discovers. We do know that planets are out there, littering the night sky, just waiting to be found.  TESS is designed to build on the work of its predecessor, the Kepler space telescope, which discovered the bulk of some 3,700 exoplanets documented during the past 20 years and is running out of fuel. NASA expects to pinpoint thousands more previously unknown worlds, perhaps hundreds of them Earth-sized or super-Earth sized - no larger than twice as big as our home planet. Those are believed the most likely to feature rocky surfaces or oceans and are thus considered the best candidates for le to evolve. Scientists have said they hope TESS will ultimately help catalog at least 100 more rocky exoplanets for further study in what has become one of astronomy\u0027s newest fields of exploration.   MIT researchers on Wednesday  announced the discovery of Pi Mensae c, a super-earth planet 60 light-years away orbiting its sun every 6.3 days.  The discovery of LHS 3844 b, a hot-earth planet 49 light-years away that orbits its sun every 11 hours, was announced the next day. Pi Mensae c could have a solid surface or be a waterworld as the composition of such planets is a mixed bag, Martin Spill, NASA\u0027s program scientist for TESS, said in a phone interview.

We have been forced to change the defence with Murdoch out with a knee injury.“In the first 20 minutes, with Rachid Bouhenna starting, maybe not everyone was comfortable.“Afterwards we grew into the game and I don’t think that we made any mistakes.”Excuses, perhaps, but valid ones? Probably. Further to his points, when King, Paul McMullan and Fyvie, in particular, came on United kicked into gear.Ahead of Saturday’s trip to Falkirk, for the first time in a few weeks, Csaba will have options to consider from a squad he has, for all his critics, united behind one cause.Stanton is expected back in training while the trio aforementioned will have played themselves into the gaffer’s thoughts.Arabs heading through on Saturday will be looking for three points after draws against Alloa and Morton in their last two league matches.And rightly so, to push themselves back into promotion contention they will have to pick up three points with more regularity.However, Csaba has defended their record so far which sees them lie in fth position – just three points behind leaders Inverness Caley Thistle, saying: “We have had four games in a row without losing – two wins and two draws – so psychologically the team are showing spirit which is good.“They  have stuck with us for three years, this is the third year in the Scottish Championship and I think, not just the fans, but everybody is hoping we can go up.“This is a normal reaction, I understand them but they also must understand that we are also human and are trying to do the best for the club.“The fans have to appreciate the work that has been put in, the season is just beginning and it is only five games.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b7bd9b8dfe43.jpg ","title":"csaba laszlo says fraser fyvie has all the right stuff","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United manager Csaba Laszlo was delighted to welcome club captain Fraser Fyvie back to the fold on Saturday and believes he is just what they need to push on.The midfield man came off the bench on 73 minutes after recovering from a long-term knee injury and made a huge impact for the Terrors.With practically the last kick of the game Fyvie netted a terric half-volley to equalise after Morton had taken the lead through a Michael Tidser penalty on 11 minutes.It was not just the goal, but his overall play, which pleased Csaba.“I am happy to have him back, not just because he scored the goal, but he is a player who can create chances and shoot,” he said.“In the last 20 minutes he showed his experience and he knows what you have to do.“He comes on and in just 20 minutes he shoots three times. Two were very dangerous and the third was the goal.“Fraser is definitely a leader but we must be careful with him because he had two cruciate ligament problems so it has not been easy for him to handle this psychologically.”Ahead of Saturday’s trip to face bottom side Falkirk, Csaba has decisions to make in his midfield.After his dominant 20-minute display at Tannadice, Fyvie will be in contention to start and Csaba also revealed Sam Stanton is close.“It is good that he is making competition. Him and Sam Stanton must come back, hopefully, very quick.

I did win the ball but on the follow-through there is always going to be contact.“We have watched it back and I am actually pulling my leg away as soon as I touched the ball to try to minimise the contact.“I never went in to harm anybody and I think the red was brandished too quickly.“I have been in the game a long time but I have never gone in to hurt anybody.“It was an honest, genuine attempt to play the ball which I did.“So it is disappointing I am going to miss two games after just going to a new club.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5ba0ce600a7e5.jpg ","title":"new boy rachid bouhenna says dundee united have to work to win back supporters","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United defender Rachid Bouhenna insists they must repay the fans for their support with a win at Falkirk on Saturday.The French-Algerian centre-back made his United debut in their disappointing 1-1 draw with Morton at Tannadice at the weekend.The Terrors now travel west for a crucial Championship tie after captain Fraser Fyvie, ing from a long-term injury off the bench, salvaged a point with a last-minute strike against Jonatan Johansson’s side – who took an early lead through a Michael Tidser penalty.And Bouhenna says they will do everything they can to pick up three points and get the Arabs back onside ahead of, what he insists is, a continued promotion push.“Of course for Dundee United the objective is to go to the top league, the Premiership, so we have to win these games at home and get results away,” he said.“Saturday we lost two points, we need to win the supporters back this weekend at Falkirk and I hope next year we will play in the top tier.“The fans were amazing, we need them for the rest of the season and I think they are behind us.“After the game I thought it was a good game but we had many chances to score and didn’t take them.“It’s good to come back to draw but for the next game we have to win  we want to stay near the top of the Championship.”Despite hauling down Gregor Buchanan for the penalty which Tidser converted to give the Ton the lead on 11 minutes, Bouhenna was pleased with his first run-out in tangerine.However, The 27-year-old was not happy with referee Colin Steven’s call to award the spot-kick after the tussle with Buchanan at a corner and Bouhenna expressed his surprise given the physical nature of Scottish football.He added: “It was an OK debut I think.“Only really the foul for the penalty – I can’t believe it.“I don’t think it was, he did not have the ball and we are in a duel but I don’t know why.“It was not just the penalty, it was every ball the referee whistle against us.“It is not like Algeria or France, for sure.“It is more physical but Morton was a very physical game – that is the big dference and I think we can play more football at home.“Away it will be very dficult, you saw in the last game at Alloa you can’t play because of a dficult pitch but at home we have to play more.“Next game it will be very dficult when we play against Falkirk, so we have to get used to this.”Bouhenna is still settling into le in Dundee and getting to grips with the language – not to mention the accent.However, he still feels at home after being welcomed by everyone at the club.Skipper Fyvie, in particular, impressed the big defender with his influence on the side when he entered the fray on 73 minutes.The 25-year-old changed the game and got the equaliser with a ferocious half volley in second-half stoppage time.“Fraser has the experience, when he come on to pitch he helped us.“He is good for us and I hope in the next game he can continue to help us  he is in the starting XI or comes on to the pitch.“I am enjoying being at Dundee United, I am feeling very good.“My team-mates and everybody at the club have been very nice, they feel like family and I am very happy with it.“With the manager and the team-mates it is very good but we have to keep going, keep working and think about the next game.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/136A1481.JPG-846x564.jpg ","title":"revealed bomb squad called to local street after woman finds this grenade on first day at new home","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA former Dundee woman has spoken of her shock after a workman discovered a grenade in her loft.Police cordoned off an area of Monieth after an \u0026#8220ordnance device\u0026#8221 was discovered in Airlie Drive shortly after 3pm today.Homes in the street and some on neighbouring Grangehill Drive were evacuated as a precaution.A bomb disposal squad was also called out to the home of Noreen Jordan.

first","story":"\u0026nbspA DOCTOR and a former detective have joined forces to launch Scotland\u0027 first absinthe blanche using ingredients hand-picked from around their 500-year-old ancestral home by the shores of Loch Ness.The couple, Lorien and Kevin Cameron-Ross, creators of the award-winning Loch Ness Gin, developed the recipe for Loch Ness Absinthe, both distilled at their home on the banks of the loch, following a trip to the birthplace of the spirit, Val-de-Travers in Switzerland.It was there Lorien learned to fine-tune the craft of making absinthe which was first used as a medicinal remedy by a French doctor living in the country, Pierre Ordinaire around the 1790s.Although best known as absinthe verte, the notorious \"green drink\", popular in the late 19th and early 20th century among artists and writers in Paris, with Vincent Van Gogh and Ernest Hemmingway among its devotees, the couple decided to create their own Scottish blanche recipe.Blanche absinthe dates back to 1910 following the ban of green absinthe in ious countries \u0026ndash although not in the UK \u0026ndash due to unproven fears it had hallucinogenic properties resulting from the use of thujone, a component of wormwood.This led to the illegal production of clear absinthe in Switzerland, making it harder for the authorities to identy.Lorien said: \"We are really proud of our latest product, Loch Ness Absinthe, boasting our very own homegrown botanicals including wormwood mixed with nearby fresh water which flows into the famous loch.\"We felt there was gap in the market for an absinthe blanche in Scotland, a drink I really enjoy, so decided to put the wheels in motion last year and began to research its history and fully understand the craft of creating and distilling it.\"Loch Ness Absinthe, with a ABV of 53 per cent, is less potent that absinthe verte, which is usually around 72 per cent.The couple, who are firm believers in mindful drinking where you drink less and enjoy yourself more, recommend that Loch Ness Absinthe should be enjoyed slowly as an aperit, ideally in a mix of one-part absinthe to three parts iced water, poured over a sugar cube on the glass\u0027 rim.Lorien continued: \"I\u0026rsquove worked really hard to get the recipe for our latest product, Loch Ness Absinthe exactly the way I wanted and in the process perfected the art of distilling it to get the exact results I was looking for.\"With the help and support of Kevin, I\u0026rsquove created a drink that I\u0026rsquom really pleased with, which has already received fantastic feedback, leading to us driving our plans forward to launch even more products in the near future that will continue to be inspired by the loch and the land around us.\"Friday 21 Sep 2018

The local authority said objections on moral grounds were not a material matter when its licensing department decides whether to approve the temporary traffic restrictions that allow marches to proceed.It added that the petition against the march is \"being considered separately\" through its regular petitions procedures by its legal service team.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: \"Highland Council, Licensing has received a request for a parade on October 6 in Inverness.\"This is currently being considered under consultation with Police Scotland and the council\u0027 roads team.\"A decision on the parade will be made [this] week and a Temporary Traffic Restriction Order would be required for the march.\" They added: \"The matters raised in the petition are not sufficient reason for the council to refuse permission for the parade, and the petition is being considered separately.\"Meanwhile, Mr Morrison has accused Highland Council of \u0026lsquomoving the goalposts\u0026rsquo after claiming it had shted a deadline for views on the march to be submitted.He said his petition was submitted on September 7 \u0026ndash which he argued was the last date for comments \u0026ndash and that he had since heard the deadline had moved back to September 21.\"One cannot help but wonder whether the circulation of two online petitions, in favour of the Proud Ness march, both created within 24 hours on and around 11 September, prompted Highland Council to review and then quickly change their date, so as to accommodate the cravings of these petitioners,\" he said.\"Everyone can clearly see that the subtle and suspicious date change is most conspicuous, just as it is deeply alarming.\"Surely it is wholly inappropriate for... Highland Council to act in a manner, that very much appears to be deceptive and gives the impression of being supportive of these counter online petitions.\"Following the council\u0027 insistence that the petition\u0027 objection is not a material licensing matter, it is not clear what dference a later deadline would have made over any decision. It is also not uncommon for councils to push consultation dates back in order for extra views to be aired.Meanwhile, the creator of one of the petitions in favour of the march has spoken of her delight at the amount of support they have received.Alice Masheter said the response had been \"fantastic\" and that, even though she is not a member of the LGBT+ community, she had felt compelled to set a petition up in solidarity to show that everyone is \"accepted and welcomed up here\".She said the pro-march petitions show that the LGBT+ community \"do have a huge amount of support\" and anti-march views are \"in the minority\".Friday 21 Sep 2018 7:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116850.jpg","title":"New social enterprise cafe set for grand opening","story":"\u0026nbspA QUIRKY caf\u0026eacute that could be run by former prisoners in an attempt to reduce re-offending rates is opening in Inverness this week.The venue at 86 Church Street called Ar n-\u0026Agraveite, which translates to Our Place, will be officially opened by Inverness MP Drew Hendry at noon on Thursday.It aims to \u0026lsquorebuild\u0026rsquo people\u0027 lives after jail, giving them work and a chance to be a part of society.More than 50 volunteers are needed in the first year to run the venture and make it financially viable.Andrew Fowler, from the charity Signpost, which is spearheading the caf\u0026eacute scheme, said: \"We genuinely believe that we will be preparing people for work.

repossessed.Aberdeenshire councillor Sebastian Leslie’s home, Lickleyhead Castle, which is thought to have been built in 1560, has been repossessed – with the family ordered to leave the premises.Mr Leslie, who sits as an Aligned Independent councillor, was suspended by the Scottish Conservative party until next year over unpaid council tax.His daughter, Game of Thrones star Rose Leslie, lived at the castle, which is near Insch, as a child.A decree for the repossession of the castle, which is also listed on rental site Airbnb where it is described as “quirky and fun”, was granted during a civil hearing at Aberdeen Sherf Court yesterday.Court documents revealed the pursuer in the case, Together Commercial Finance Limited, asked the court to find Mr Leslie in default for failing to comply with calling-up notices – a legal document ending a mortgage agreement, requiring repayment of all of the outstanding loan.The court was asked to rule that the firm has the right to enter into possession and sell Lickleyhead Castle, which has been a popular spot for weddings, as well as the Gardeners or Gamekeepers Cottage and land at Premnay, Insch.The court was also asked to agree that Mr Leslie, his family and anyone else occupying the castle should leave it, and to allow officers of the court to eject the occupants and their goods.The decree was granted by Sherf Andrew Miller. Mr Leslie was not present for the hearing but submitted an email confirming there was no objection.It comes after the councillor was also due to appear at the civil court last week for a time-to-pay hearing.The West Garioch councillor was not present and Sherf Morag McLaughlin granted a decree ordering him to pay £4,214.50 plus interest and expenses to a chartered surveyor.Court documents prepared by John Fraser, the claimant, stated £500 had been paid towards the total bill of £4,714.50 for inspections carried out and reports prepared on Mr Leslie’s properties.The property was put on the market in 2013 for £1.3 million.At the time, selling agents said the Leslies lived in another nearby castle but used Lickleyhead for weddings and s, and put the property on the market because it was “surplus to their requirements”.It has passed through a succession of owners including Patrick Duff, the uncle of the Earl of Fe.Former governor of Mexico City Don Guillermo de Landa y Escandon bought the property in 1922 for his daughter Maria Luz, who married into the Arbuthnot-Leslie family.The court hearings follow Mr Leslie’s suspension by the Scottish Conservative party until next year, and it is understood his case will be reviewed in June 2019. Mr Leslie is understood to owe the local authority £2,500 in unpaid council taxes. Earlier this year, he said he was trying to highlight what he described as corruption in the Scottish banking system.The Evening Express made repeated attempts to contact Mr Leslie for comment but received no response.

I foolishly stood up too soon approaching the Kilmartin stop and fell forward, landing head to door and feet in the air.Thank you to the doctor who checked me over, and to the driver and passengers who waited until I had been checked.Janet Jardine, KilmartinSir,I would like to give thanks to Tarbert Festivals Committee for all their hard work in organising the very successful Seafood Festival.Tarbert Festival Queen 2018 Chloe MacDonald with her Princesses Cara and Kaitlyn were beautul and a great credit to the festival.My thanks again to everyone who helped in any way to make this year’s festival such an amazing event and to the very many people who visited the village for the occasion.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertEditor\u0026#8217s note: With apologies to Councillor Horn for the delay in publishing this letter, originally submitted in July.Sir,The closure of the tourist centres at Tarbert and Inveraray is very worrying and I can’t understand why VisitScotland, backed by the Scottish Government, came up with such a decision.Tourism is extremely important to Argyll and Bute, and all agencies should be working together to assist the tourists that come to this area.Tarbert is in my council ward and I know how valuable the centre there is. The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a dferent form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of ersity to suit inidual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very signicant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they ed to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they ed to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terric work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure. I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 33","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/08/18, 2:04 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There has been talk of a new rugby pitch for a while, but plans presented to community councillors on Monday go further than that.We hope everyone involved is as enthusiastic as Mid Argyll Rugby Club and more power to their elbow.This year\u0026#8217s has to go down as one of the best Mid Argyll Shows in recent times.The weather helped bring out the crowds in big numbers, but the real credit must go to the volunteers who organise the show.

Macmillan is there to help people with cancer live le as fully as they can.Offering a broad range of cancer information and support services \u0026#8211 including a free support line and a community of over 7,700 healthcare professionals \u0026#8211 demand for Macmillan’s services is constantly growing, but we rely on the generosity of the public to provide this support.Macmillan’s Coffee Morning takes place on Friday September 28 \u0026#8211 but people can host whenever they want. Whoever they invite and whatever they serve, people are highly encouraged to host a Macmillan Coffee Morning in a way that suits them.If people can’t bake, that doesn’t have to stop them. Throughout September, headline partner M\u0026ampS will be selling a selection of limited edition coffee morning products \u0026#8211 including lots of cakes, biscuits and two exclusive mugs \u0026#8211 with 10 per cent of proceeds going to Macmillan.Homes, workplaces and communities from the Shetland Islands to Land’s End will be hosting coffee mornings this year readers in Argyll and Bute can find events nearby using the interactive map on the Coffee Morning website www.macmillan.org.uk/coffee.Thank you to everyone who gets involved.Joanna Lumley, actress and Macmillan supporterSir,The SNP announced it is starting up a new \u0026#8216fact-checking\u0026#8217 service to monitor the accuracy of research and political statements.Many people in Scotland will be wondering  the SNP will be fact-checking the cost of its new independence blueprint.

The kids have had a great time with their teams playing well, building team spirit and creating a positive impression of the soccer centre and Lochgilphead.The Red Star 2007 team as well as regularly taking part in the Oban Primary League has travelled to Mossend, Oban, Crieff, Campbeltown and Helensburgh.  The kids are really developing and getting ready to move up to nine aside from now and then eleven aside in August 2019. The 2008 team has been to Mossend, Oban, Ardencaple, Campbeltown, Helensburgh, Finnart and Airdrieonians and have also been taking part in the Oban Primary League.The 2009s, 2010s and 2011s have been on trips to Oban, Campbeltown and Helensburgh. The kids played four and five aside as well as being committed to regular additional training sessions. The future looks good for when they step up to seven aside.Finally the girls team took part in both Oban and Campbeltown festivals. The enthusiastic girls have developed enormously in the last nine months. It\u0026#8217s great to see such an active group of girls growing from around eight girls this time last year to nearly 20 now.The action continues with teams due to take part in Haldane and Lochnell festivals in September.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most inidual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"some close shaves in the strc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 10/09/18, 9:00 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere were only two Mid Argyll crews competing in the Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship  Pendragon stages at Warcop training camp in Cumbria on Sunday August 26.They were Donald Bowness and navigator Paul Gribben in their Vauxhall Nova and Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen C2R2Max. Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car. In what was a wet and slippery day, only the first stage was completed in slightly drier conditions which made tyre choice dficult.Stage two was better, after a change of tyres. There were several incidents on stages throughout the day which caused delays. Jamie and Ian stopped to help on stage three when a car rolled. This caused them to lose a lot of time but priority was to ensure the other competitors were safe.By stage seven, the \u0026#8216red mist\u0026#8217 had set in on Jamie and he had a battle with a mk 2 Escort.Jamie said: \u0026#8216This is a good event, but the class in front have a phenomenal pace to compete against, although I still enjoyed it.\u0026#8217Jamie\u0026#8217s next event is Leuchars, Fe, in November which will be the final round of the STRC. He is also looking at doing the MSN circuit event in December at Knockhill.Donald and Paul also had a few close calls. On stage two they went through a fence in slippery conditions costing them around 35 seconds.Back to service, it was a change of tyres. The new tyre choice proved to be working well back on stage and they began climbing their position and setting impressive times.On stage seven, their car stopped within inches of a concrete block.At the end of a long day rallying, Jamie and Ian finished 46th overall and 14th in class, while Donald and Paul finished 7th overall with 1st in class and 1st FWD car setting a fourth fastest stage time.Donald said these were his best results so far since he started his hobby.

As pupils had brought a iety of instruments, including saxophones, flutes, guitars, accordion, trombone and, of course, tuned percussion, they were surprised that the day started with just rhythmic clapping.Alison and Felix both demonstrated playing techniques on their specialist instruments. For Alison, with a few flautists in the group, this was very informative. Scary soundtracks with special string techniques was Felix’s forte.We were split into two groups with each group composing three short melodies in the style of Steve Reich. These were developed using minimalist techniques such as addition, subtraction, stretching, interlocking, shting and phasing with each melody sounding very dferent depending on the instruments within the group. We performed and gave positive feedback on each other’s work.After lunch we got together to compose a third section in the style of John Adams with input from everybody. Techniques used here included gradual transformation and even sparkles.By the end of the day we were able to put our melodies together and we performed our unnamed minimalist composition. The event involved us interacting with each other, meeting new people and learning interesting skills that will be beneficial for our exam next year. We are all thoroughly delighted to have been a part of what was a great experience. We are now looking forward to the SCO American Minimalism concert in Helensburgh on Wednesday September 19.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"red star exit cup after disappointing performance","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 15/09/18, 11:10 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Red Star crashed out of the Scottish Cup on Saturday after an error-strewn replay performance was punished by a clinical Southside team.As in the original tie, Red Star got off to a terrible start, finding themselves two goals down inside 20 minutes after sloppy errors. To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore\u0026#8217s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the 85th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a 1-4 victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September 15 when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,  you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers\u0026#8217 attention to the Facebook page \u0026#8216Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging\u0026#8217?The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The 600 jobs in aquaculture will not last long  mass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a 25-year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start again  an alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued? It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September 7, it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The 2018 parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause \u0026#8216irrecoverable damage\u0026#8217.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,  not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships?The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust.

Having moved to Glasgow, Alison can no longer chair the group as a non-Argyll resident. She added that there is a degree of \u0026#8216committee fatigue\u0026#8217 among the group, while the computer equipment used by Autism Argyll is getting past its sell-by date.But the most signicant factor in ending Autism Argyll, said Alison, is a lack of support from senior management at Argyll and Bute Council over many years.She said: \u0026#8216Argyll and Bute has an agreed and published Autism Strategy, which the authority commissioned Scottish Autism to produce. There is also an implementation plan. However, neither is promoted and both are largely ignored.\u0026#8216The only time senior management appear to take any interest in those iniduals and families living with autism is  it they think it is going to cost the authority money.\u0026#8216At senior manager level, Argyll and Bute Council has rejected our knowledge, rebuffed our experiences, frustrated our efforts, sapped our enthusiasm, drained our goodwill and defeated us.\u0026#8217There is good news, however. Operating in Argyll and Bute with the support of Scottish Autism, the Get Set 4 Autism project provides online resources for professionals dealing with autism.Parents of recently diagnosed children also have access to an autism advisor and the Right Click online programme, helping to provide clear, timely and sensible information and support.Alison continued: \u0026#8216Autism Argyll has raised awareness, improved knowledge and understanding, and forged partnerships with iniduals and organisations such as Scottish Autism. We should be proud of our achievements.\u0026#8217Responding to the criticism, an Argyll and Bute Council spokesperson said: \u0026#8216We are saddened that Autism Argyll has been dissolved and we thank the organisation for its work down the years to educate the wider community on autism and to support people living with the condition.\u0026#8216We are working with our partners, including Cornerstone and Scottish Autism, on the development of residential resources in Garelochhead and Helensburgh, and also to improve services for people with autism across Argyll and Bute by way of introducing and implementing the Autism Toolbox.\u0026#8216Additionally, we have engaged with Autism Network Scotland for their assistance in further implementing our autism strategy, and these meetings will continue.\u0026#8217Responsibility for autism support also falls under the remit of Argyll and Bute Health and Social Care Partnership, and a spokesman confirmed that it had advertised for a new autism practitioner.He added: \u0026#8216We have been working closely with our partners to support those iniduals living in Argyll and Bute with autism and we have been exploring how we can build on the current services that are available. \u0026#8216PICS:Back to the beginning \u0026#8211 Autism Argyll is formed in 2000. no_a38AutismArgyll01Committee members past and present gather for the last-ever Autism Argyll AGM. 06_a38AutismArgyll03It was an emotional occasion for founder members Maureen MacIntosh, left, and chairwoman Alison Leask. 06_a38AutismArgyll02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"furnace shop and post office facing closure","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 21/09/18, 2:49 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowFurnace Village Store and Post Office is set to close at the end of the year unless someone can be found to carry on the business.The shop, with its three-bedroom bungalow behind, has been owned and managed by Mike and Syb Masters for the past 18 years.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn\u0026#8217t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry\u0026#8217s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say 10,000. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don\u0026#8217t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormous  of coastline. Scotland\u0026#8217s coast is about 18,500 kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate \u0026#8211 an enormously expensive system both in money and CO2 emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant \u0026#8211 it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September 21 is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are 90,000 people with dementia in Scotland and 1,982 people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

The handicaps are as tricky as juggling with hedgehogs  The novices keep you on your toes while the listed and the Group races have you tearing your hair out with the temptation to rip into the jolly regardless. Mind you, with just two favourites since 1980 winning the big race, perhaps we should be more confident. The Ayr Gold Cup is run over six furlongs and is open to horses aged three years or older with a maximum field size of 25. For those who like to follow trainers Richard Fahey and Andrew Balding have an excellent record in the race. They have, however, some way to go to match Yorkshire-based Irish man Kevin Ryan who has saddled four winners in the last 10 years. The pick of his entries  is MAJOR JUMBO 16/1. He comes good in September and the fast finishing second to KIMBERELLA last time out in a listed race at Chester is decent form. The current favourite has been punted hard having started the week at 8/1, and SON OF REST is now as short as 5s.  He put up his best performance yet when beaten a 1/2  by HAVANA GREY on Sunday at the Curragh. There is no guarantee that just six days on he can repeat the feat. I’m against him. Second favourite GROWL , in his career to date, has done all his winning earlier in the season and while soft ground would not be a hindrance most of his winning has come on faster turf. He’s not for me. Horses aged between four and fivr have an excellent record, but fillies and mares have yet to land a blow in the previous 16 renewals. The average winning starting price in that time was 15/1. Be bold, be brave you might say. A high draw is a bonus for this cavalry charge and with our selection MAJOR JUMBO drawn in stall 9 it should certainly not hinder this front runners chances. With 22 races under his belt, the horse has won five and been placed in 12 of the others. Those victories have come in a lower grade but MAJOR JUMBO 16/1 has acquitted himself well in Class 2 company. Apprentice jockey Finley Marsh claims a valuable 5lbs and though he is having only his second ride for trainer Ryan he is no stranger to the winners enclosure.

He said: “You look at the league and would maybe say Ross County have that class edge because of the money they’ve spent. “They have a Premier League squad. “But as for everyone else...there’s no reason why we can’t hold our own.  “Nobody is going to get an easy game at our place and we’re proving we can live with the other sides in this ision. “Had we kept 11 men on the park at Inverness we’d have won there and would be sitting top of the league right now. “So we know  we play at our best we’re a match for anyone.” Ayr will head for old rivals Alloa tomorrow knowing they have a chance to hit top spot should results go their way.

motorists to stop off in the Royal Burgh.\nAnd the town\u0026rsquos Business Improvement District  officers are currently probing the ious options.\nLocal councillor Caroline Penman said: \u0026ldquoAlong with Selkirk BIDs we are looking at what the new signs should say to encourage people to stop and explore \u0026ndash should it be the Old Town Centre, William Wallace or Sir Walter Scott?\n\u0026ldquoThe signs would pinpoint people towards attractions and also where to park.\nSir Walter Scott dispensed justice from the bench in Selkirk for almost 30 years.\nAnd, as well as a town centre statue to celebrate the connection, his courtroom has been transformed into a museum to the world-famous author and poet.\nBut William Wallace\u0026rsquos connections to the town are every bit as strong.\nIt is widely believed that he was declared  of Scotland at a medieval kirk just a short walk from the town centre at the height of his Braveheart battles with England.\nA geophysics survey carried out two years ago at the ruins of the town\u0027s 18th Century Auld Kirk revealed remains of a medieval chapel \u0026ndash believed to be the legendary Kirk o\u0027 the Forest.\nBut a third choice of promoting Selkirk\u0027s historical town centre, which has many closes and alleyways dating back to 17th and 18th century, as well as having links with nearby battles at Philiphaugh and Flodden, is also being considered.\nSelkirk Community Council member Jim Stillie said: \u0026ldquoAll we have to sell to tourists is our history and we should make them aware of what we

urgent call was made at the beginning of July to collect the money in just two months.\nAnd on Thursday, August 30, thanks to the efforts of hundreds of people, companies in Tweeddale and many other local organisations, the ambitious target was reached.\nThe fundraising effort has now triggered the release of a European Leader grant of \u0026pound150,000, along with a combination of other grants, which means that the theatre now has the budget to transform its auditorium.\nThe revamp forms phase one of the \u0027Building on success\u0027 strategy to develop the building and make it more customer friendly and fit to meet increasing demand.\nIf the plans go to schedule, by the end of summer 2019 the auditorium will be developed to designs by Simpson \u0026amp Brown Architects.\nA raft of improvements will be made, including existing retractable seating replaced with new, better padded seats and increased legroom, plus aisle seats fitted with hand grabs, to help customers move up and down the steps more easily.\nThe current balcony seats that provide a restricted view of the stage will be replaced by around 24 new seats on diagonally stepped platforms.\nThey will offer a full view of the stage when two sections of solid balcony are replaced with steel rail and glass panels.\nAlso, new swivel stools, in the section of the balconies closest to the stage, will allow the theatre to offer some seats at a reduced ticket price.\nLow level safety lighting will be introduced into the new side balconies, and new heating ducts will be installed to deliver hot air at floor level.\nSir David Younger, chair of the Eastgate board of directors said: \u0026ldquoThe Board would like to thank most sincerely the Eastgate staff, the Friends of the Eastgate and all donors who rose magnicently to the challenge of raising a sizeable sum of money in a very short space of time.\n\u0026ldquoThe theatre was first developed in 2004 by the efforts of the local community and it is heartening for all of us to realise that all these years later it is still so valued.\n\u0026ldquoBy levering the European Leader grant the local fundraising has made a huge impact locally.\n\u0026ldquoThis, combined with the success of general manager Caroline Adam in attracting other signicant capital grants will help to ensure that the people of Tweeddale and much further afield have an arts venue well equipped to meet future needs.\nDonations to the appeal came in all shapes and sizes ranging from a little boy who put 50p of his pocket money into the donations box in the foyer to an American couple who transferred a four-figure sum. A bullock donated by local farmer Robert Barr now has Muchacoo  on his passport after dozens of visitors to the Peebles Agricultural show each paid \u0026pound5 to name him.\nAll of the money raised will go towards the development of the Eastgate Theatre building.\nDiscussions are already underway about progressing to phase two which will improve and reconfigure the foyer/caf\u0026eacute areas.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"sheriff-orders-gala-woman-to-hand-over-car-keys","story":"A GALASHIELS woman has been ordered to give up her car keys after being accused of two drink driving offences in the space of two months.\nJune McKain has been told she cannot drive a vehicle until the outcome of her trial in November.\nThe 58-year-old of Ladhope Crescent, appeared from custody at Selkirk Sherf Court where she pleaded not guilty to a charge of driving with a breath/alcohol count of 42 microgrammes -

exhibited their products ranging from fresh fruit and baked goods, to homemade liqueurs and locally distilled gin.\nAll exhibitors were keen to not only raise the profile of their business in the local area, but also to support this inaugural event and provide inspiration to the College students.\nFormer College student Tegan Thomas from Galashiels was exhibiting the Thomas and Ethel Bakery.\nCompleting her catering course in 2015 with the intention of going on to train as a teacher, Tegan instead decided to use her newly gained knowledge and skills to set up a bakery specialising

Airships in the Great War and the Story of Major J G Struthers\u0026#8217 exhibition in Campbeltown Library features a trove of items belonging to the late Major Jim Struthers, formerly of Ardmaddy Estate, near Oban.The items, including a dummy shell, gas goggles, badges and medals, a unorm and original airship banners and propellers, were collated, over the course of a year, by Eleanor McKay, bibliographic and local studies librarian at Live Argyll, after a conversation with Major Struthers\u0026#8217 son Charles.\u0026#8216He said he had \u0026#8216one or two things\u0026#8217 belonging to his late father,\u0026#8217 Eleanor explained. \u0026#8216It turned out to be eight boxes full of artefacts that we\u0026#8217re still going through now.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s one of the best collections from the First World War that we have seen.\u0026#8217There are parts of shot-down airships, a parachute, fragments of a radiator from a zeppelin and much more.Accompanying the artefacts, are photographs, many taken by Major Struthers himself, documenting his personal le and military career, as well as the history of airships.Major Struthers, who was mentioned in dispatches, was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, with two bars later added, for his missions with the Royal Naval Air Service, which amalgamated with the British Army\u0026#8217s Royal Flying Core to become the Royal Air Force in 1918.Major Struthers was recognised for flying more hours than any other airship pilot during the war.Aged 52 by the time the Second World War broke out, Major Struthers was too old to serve but he was in the Royal Observer Corps, his patch stretching from Sutherland to Machrihanish.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s local to Oban but it\u0026#8217s an Argyll story,\u0026#8217 said Eleanor. \u0026#8216Major Struthers was actually based in Cornwall during the war.\u0026#8217Diana Manning, from Drumlemble but originally from Cornwall, attended the exhibition\u0026#8217s Campbeltown opening to find out more about the Cornish history, and found it \u0026#8216fascinating\u0026#8217.During her opening speech, Eleanor said: \u0026#8216I think this is an area of World War One that people don\u0026#8217t really think about.\u0026#8216They think about later aircraft, especially in World War Two, but I don\u0026#8217t think they know the role they had in World War One.\u0026#8217Councillor Donald Kelly, who attended the opening, said he thought it was essential to engage with local school children: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s important that youngsters today know what went on in the past \u0026#8211 especially involving someone from Argyll.\u0026#8217The exhibition, which was launched in Oban in July, will be in Campbeltown until September 29, before moving on

the HMS Platypus Cup became the club\u0026#8217s mixed doubles championship\u0026#8217s coveted trophy and names began to be inscribed.As with any weather dependent sport there were years when the championship was not played, or perhaps there were not enough ladies and gents to run a mixed doubles competition.If the teams were always picked from a hat, the method used currently, it would explain why partnerships did not endure, unless by luck, though one strong player may win successively.The cup\u0026#8217s first winners in 1919 were: Mrs Chapman and Mr R. Y. Maxtone, the following year Mr Maxtone partnered Miss B Strang.1921 must have been a strange year for mixed doubles. The winner is inscribed as P. S. MacNair without a partner. Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour. In 1923 a dferent pair emerged Miss J. I. McKersie and Mr A. G. MacKelvie.Miss B. Strang ed, partnered by Mr L. Edwards in 1924. In 1925 a christian name is inscribed for the first time, when, Bella Strang, taking her third win, was partnered by  Mr C. MacTaggart.Mrs W. McKersie and Mr C. McTaggart won in 1926 and Miss S.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

The cake was made by food artist and cake sculptor Michelle Wibowo and was featured on Channel 4\u0027s tea-time programme Extreme Cake Makers.  The cake was 3ft4in\u0026nbspwide, and 8in\u0026nbsphigh, and is an exact replica of the building near Tranent High Street.  Using vanilla sponge sandwiched with buttercream, former architect Michelle carved the cake into shape before covering it in a sugar paste fondant.  She then printed the exterior of the shop onto edible paper, placing it onto the skeleton on the building.  For the finer details, Michelle used a sugar paste which she sculpted by hand.  The cake itself was crafted in Hayward\u0027s Heath, West Sussex, and then driven to Brighton, where Tranent-born George works.  \"He wanted to help revive the centre of town, so he\u0027s taken on a derelict building, and he\u0027s totally restoring it,\" said Sharon.  George bought the building on the corner of High Street in late 2015, and planned to renovate it into a mixture of shops, cafes\u0026nbspand a Post Office.  Upon seeing Michelle\u0027s creation, Sharon exclaimed: \"It\u0027s exactly what I wanted. It\u0027s got total wow factor. I think it\u0027s absolutely incredible. It just doesn\u0027t look like cake.\"  George, when he was finally let in on the surprise, agreed: \"When I first came in, I actually thought the cake was just a cardboard model. Then I realised it was actually a cake, and to see the level of detail and quality in doing something like that, it\u0027s quite fantastic.  \"I could take it home, put it in the building, and people would actually think it\u0027s an architect\u0027s model.\"  Sharon confirmed: \"George was absolutely blown away by the cake. He didn\u0027t want to cut it and was desperately trying to find a way to get it back to Scotland. We pointed out it wasn\u0027t possible because we wanted to eat it.  \"Michelle totally delivered on the cake, so she\u0027s probably the first person in George\u0027s le that has actually managed to do something to surprise him.\"  The show is available on Channel 4\u0027s streaming service All 4.

Each family member will don a special t-shirt as they do their bit for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and The Butterfly Trust.  Amelia\u0026rsquos mum Kathryn Tait is one of those who will be climbing the 86 steps inside the lighthouse before slowing making a 121ft descent back to solid ground on Saturday, September 22.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt was Amelia\u0026rsquos gran, Shirley Dinning, who had the idea.  \u0026ldquoShe wanted to do the abseil from the Forth Bridge but they already had their charities and so she could not do it for the cystic fibrosis charities. That is why she decided to do it at the lighthouse.  \u0026ldquoI have never done anything like this.  \u0026ldquoI would not say I am looking forward to it but I am looking forward to raising money for the charities.  \u0026ldquoAmelia is going to need help the rest of her le and it is nice to give something back.  The youngster, who turned one last month, was born three weeks early at the Birth Centre in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh .  It was three weeks later, following a routine heel prick, that it was discovered she had cystic fibrosis.  The genetic condition affects more than 10,400 people in the UK.  People with cystic fibrosis experience a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs, digestive system and other organs, causing a wide range of challenging symptoms affecting the entire body.  Kathryn said: \u0026ldquoShe had her heel prick test at five days old and then everything was fine.  \u0026ldquoThen, when she was three weeks old, we got a call from the Edinburgh Sick Kids Hospital to say we needed to go up because they had to discuss her results with us.  \u0026ldquoI phoned Amelia\u0026rsquos dad, Darren, at his work and said we needed to go there.  \u0026ldquoThey said she had cystic fibrosis and explained all about it \u0026ndash all about the genes, why she had it and that sort of stuff obviously it was a lot to take in.  Kathryn, who previously worked at Leuchie House, near North Berwick, as a care assistant, told the Courier she had heard of the condition but did not know a lot about it until speaking to the doctors.  Since the diagnosis, Amelia, who Kathryn described as \u0026ldquoalways smiling and [who] loves attention, has had regular trips to the Sick Kids to be checked over by doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and dieticians.  Kathryn, 23, of Dovecot Way, Haddington, said: \u0026ldquoAmelia has twice daily physio which she does not enjoy.  \u0026ldquoLuckily her pancreas is sufficient and she does not have to take enzymes to help her digest food.  \u0026ldquoWhen she does have an infection, it is quite an intensive course of antibiotics, three or four times a day.  \u0026ldquoIt is just the little things we have to watch for, like spraying deodorant because, obviously, you do not want her breathing that in and dust and things.  Now friends and family members, including Amelia\u0026rsquos older sisters Laura and Abby, are getting ready to give back to the two charities.  The Butterfly Trust, based in Edinburgh, offers support to families and people affected by the condition, while the Cystic Fibrosis Trust is heavily involved in research.

The girl and the boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl screaming \u0026ldquohelp, save us.  The concerned passer-by contacted the police and managed to calm the distraught children down by waiting by the vehicle while it was parked in a lay-by near to Prestonpans last year.  Yorkston, who was in charge of the children\u0026rsquos welfare, eventually appeared about 30 minutes later claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 28-year-old then jumped into his car and drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  Yorkston had previously admitted abandoning the children in the car last August when he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court earlier this year and he was due back in the dock last Wednesday.  Solicitor Cameron Tait, defending, said that his client had not attended court but asked Sherf Adrian Cottam to deal with the case in his absence.  Mr Tait added that the care of the children was now under supervision of the local social work department.  Sherf Cottam agreed and decided to admonish Yorkston on the charge of abandoning the children.  Previously, the court heard that the two children were spotted within the locked vehicle parked at a lay-by on the B1361 at about 5.30pm on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe girl was shouting \u0026lsquohelp, save us\u0026rsquo.  When asked where the person looking after her was, the girl pointed to an opening in the trees.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes, the fiscal added.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, told the court that Yorkston had stopped for a toilet break as he took the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos restaurant.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  She added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme. Fortunately there was no harm done to the children.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":null,"title":"popular-former-musselburgh-church-minister-is-remembered","story":"  The American-born clergyman served Musselburgh Congregational Church, on Links Street, for 41 years after being inducted as its minister in 1968.

The restricted service was only for general advice, which makes up about a quarter of the total bureau work, but paid staff were still available for case work and outreach services as normal.  Claire said: \u0026ldquoI think a lot of people don\u0026rsquot know that CAB is a volunteer-based charity, so we do rely on volunteers to be on reception, to become general advisers and also some of them do administrative work as well.  She said that volunteers were often people who were retired but wanted to keep mentally active, those who were between jobs and wanted to build new skills, and law students looking for experience.  Claire, who also handles financial capability issues at the CAB, started out as a volunteer adviser.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe always need volunteers, who are the leblood of the CAB.  \u0026ldquoWe have about 30 [volunteers] at the moment and 12 members of staff.  \u0026ldquoWe put a lot into advisers and helping them but not everyone makes it at the other end.  \u0026ldquoAs volunteers they can also take holidays whenever they want or attend appointments but it is important that we get a certain level of commitment.  She added: \u0026ldquoGeneral advisers deal with everything from the dog next door barking too loudly to entitlement to benefits.  \u0026ldquoThey also deal with dismissal cases, as well as helping people to make phone calls and write letters.  \u0026ldquoAround 35 per cent of the cases will be about benefits and about 20 per cent on debt followed by employment, housing, customer and local issues.  The CAB\u0026rsquos other volunteer support officer, Magdalena Szulc, who also began as a volunteer, agreed with her colleague.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe need people who can commit for six to seven hours\u0026rsquo volunteering each week and the training programme, which can take six to eight months.  \u0026ldquoThey also need good listening skills, to work well in teams, be open-minded, don\u0026rsquot judge people or their circumstances and enjoy helping people.  She interviews the recruits, who, after initial training, get to \u0026lsquoshadow\u0026rsquo a general adviser before going it alone with support from the session supervisor.  Musselburgh resident Andrew Aitken decided to become a volunteer adviser a year and a half ago as, even although he works, he found he had some free time on his hands.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is interesting and is good  you can be of some use to people.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom at the CAB for half a day twice a week.

It is set amongst the fields which surround this old former mining village. The graveyard is reached taking a short walk which follows an old rail line. The surviving gravestones are not so old, yet I felt an immediate aura of antiquity as I entered the place.  As I wandered there I knew nothing of its past. I had stumbled upon it during a short walk from the village. I always explore when I get the chance, never knowing what I might find. It seemed neglected and strangely positioned, away from the village and no evidence of a kirk nearby. I assumed it to be connected to nearby Elphinstone Tower.  Yet soon afterwards I discovered that on the north-west of the graveyard there had indeed been a kirk a medieval pre-reformation chapel no less. Its foundations remain buried under the surface, its stones yet to tell its stories.  However, that is just one layer of this graveyard\u0026rsquos history, for it is described as overlying a prehistoric site of \u0026ldquonational importance by Ancient Monuments UK. I had been walking within an ancient fort, possibly as early as the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age. While visible evidence of this is now all gone, I can testy to the aura of antiquity which hangs there. Historic sites are often not just what you can see, but what you can sense and feel.  But the graveyard was not why I was in Elphinstone that day. I had taken a trip to this village to visit Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. It\u0026rsquos a \u0026lsquobullet stone\u0026rsquo set in the village.  There is more than one story about this stone. One tale tells us that an elf is trapped within it. According to this story the elf was a servant of an Elphinstone witch called Meg.  One day the witch travelled in her carriage to a nearby burn and there had eaten food, refusing to share it with her elves. While she was having a post-scoff snooze, an elf snuck into her carriage and took the leftovers. The angry witch incarcerated the elf within the stone as a punishment.  The primary school have a version of this story painted in the playground and the children there are best to tell that tale! It\u0026rsquos a story which suggests a reason for the village name: \u0026lsquoElf in Stone\u0026rsquo!  But as is often the case, there is also an older folk tale about the stone, mentioned well over 100 years ago by P M\u0026rsquoNeill in his fascinating book of the traditions of the area. In this tale Meg is also the main character. Here is my re-telling of this old story:  The stone which now stands in Elphinstone village once stood by the smiddy. It was owned by a well-kent witch of the village called Meg. She was not the only witch in the area, for she had many friends who were also witches. They were all married women, with heavy domestic duties to perform and little time for themselves during the day.  However, as night fell and their \u0026ldquoauld gude men lay soond asleep at hame, this happy group of witches would meet up at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, a short distance from the village but far enough away to be out of earshot of a sleeping husband.  Here the sisterhood would have witchy fun and play games. Meg would bring the bullet stone for a game of chuck , a game in which four stones are laid on a surface while one is thrown in the air. The player must pick up all the four stones, then catch the thrown stone as it falls back to the ground.  Perhaps this huge stone was actually the one thrown into the air. After all, they were witches and so a normal game of chuckie would have been a bit mundane. I do not know exactly how heavy it is but it would defeat anyone trying to lt it without magic or machinery.  In fact it would have been a fair challenge to carry from the village to the burn, even for a witch. And that is why Meg didn\u0026rsquot carry it to her liaisons. She used magic, of course. As her husband snored in the house she would creep out to the stone and turn it into a horse. I can visualise her mounting this confused beast in the light of the moon, then riding speedily with joyful laughter towards Harry\u0026rsquos Burn to meet her friends and enjoy the short time of freedom from domestic duties.  There at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn she would dismount and greet her friends. No doubt they all had dferent and novel methods of travel to get to their location: a flying sieve, riding a wolf, even a husband changed into a horse are all possibilities according to the beliefs of the time!  Upon her arrival Meg would lead the horse to the burn to drink. As soon as it had quenched its thirst, Meg changed it back to a stone. And so the heavy stone was successfully transported so the witches could play their game.  Then, when the fun was over, Meg turned the stone back into a horse for the  journey, carefully dismounting at the end of her journey on the same spot by the smiddy, and then transforming the poor creature back into stone.  And so the bullet stone remains in the village after Meg\u0026rsquos final journey. It can be found opposite the primary school and is called Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. As far as I know it hasn\u0026rsquot been a horse since the last time Meg changed it into one, so it will be desperate for some exercise by now.  There is no reason not to believe that Meg also trapped an elf within the stone, as the later tale suggests. She was, after all, a witch with powerful magic.  So  you sit on it, be careful about the words you mutter. You might just accidentally say the spell that transforms it into a horse, and then you\u0026rsquoll be off on a terryingly wild ride to Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, possibly in the company of a hyperactive and by now very hungry elf.  Or maybe that would be fun! I wonder what the spell was. Maybe the children in the school have an idea?"},{"url":null,"title":"youtube-and-wikipedia-edit-a-thon-event-for-preston-tower","story":"  Dig It!

One of the two reactors at the power station, to the east of the town, is being taken offline.  The programme means hundreds of extra workers will join the 750-strong regular workforce for the maintenance period, known as a \u0026ldquostatutory outage.  Robert Gunn, station director, said: \u0026ldquoIt is Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos 30th birthday this year and this is the 22nd statutory outage we have carried out at the station.  \u0026ldquoWe are very well practised at them and over the years we have built great relationships with the extra workers who come and support us during the outages.  \u0026ldquoThese workers will be staying in local hotels and B\u0026ampBs, eating in the area\u0026rsquos restaurants and using taxi firms.  \u0026ldquoIt is great that our investment in the power station can also benefit our local community just as the peak tourist season is coming to an end.  \u0026ldquoWe carry out maintenance and inspections on the units that generate the electricity all-year-round but a statutory outage gives us the chance to carry out pieces of work that are not possible when the reactor is operating.  Philip Mellor, chairman of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association  and owner of the Dunmuir Hotel, was delighted with the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is very positive news.  \u0026ldquoI am delighted to welcome people to Dunbar and certainly as we move into the quieter season, as the holidaymakers have left, it is the ideal time for EDF to run this type of project.  \u0026ldquoIt will massively benefit the community as a whole.  EDF Energy carries out a statutory outage on each of its reactors once every three years.  These are planned in advance with the National Grid to ensure that there is no impact on the national electricity supply.  The other reactor at Torness is due to continue operating normally throughout the period.  During the outage workers will carry out more than 12,000 separate pieces of work \u0026ndash each carefully planned during the last two years of preparation.  The biggest projects include fitting of additional reactor gas temperature instrumentation, exchange of the turbine intermediate and low-pressure rotors, and replacement of auxiliary cooling water pipework systems.  Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos two nuclear reactors generate enough electricity to power more than two million homes and started operating in 1988.  The station employs more than 500 full-time staff and about 250 full-time contract partners.  Since it opened, Torness has produced enough low-carbon electricity to save the equivalent of 84.8 million tonnes of CO2e  during its 30 years of operation, the same as taking all of the passenger cars off the UK\u0026rsquos roads for more than a year."},{"url":null,"title":"tranent-womans-key-part-in-new-bbc-one-game-show-chase-the-case","story":"  The former Ross High School pupil plays a \u0026ldquofurious security guard in new strategy game Chase the Case, hosted by BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker.

He said: \"We\u0027re actually going to be fundraising in the gym.  \"We\u0027re inviting gyms from all over Scotland to come in and spar in the ring and it\u0027ll be \u0026pound3/4 on the door to come in.  \"All proceeds from that will go to the trip. Then we\u0027ve got the JustGiving page as well.\"  Muay Thai is Thailand\u0027s national sport but the WTKA Unied World Championships will be held in Carrara, between Pisa and Genoa, over October and November.  It was recognised as a provisional Olympic sport in 2016 meaning it will receive funding just under \u0026pound20,000 in annual funding from the International Olympic Committee.  The sport can then apply to become part of the Olympic games sports programme after three years.  Speaking about the championship and Olympic approval, Scott said: \"I think its good for the whole of the sport to be honest.  \"That\u0027s a huge thing for the sport, it should open up other avenues for the sport in terms of funding, as well as increase the profile of the sport.\"  There\u0027s definite potential for both Lewis and Faith to become Olympic athletes but Scott knows there is a long road ahead  both want to go pro.  \"Lewis is in a predicament because he\u0027s really good at football as well. He goes across to train in Glasgow every two weeks with the Scotland Youth Development squad.  \"So, there\u0027s a chance Lewis could go into pro football, teams have spoken to him. He\u0027s going to have a choice to make at some point.  \"With Faith, I think  it\u0027s done right she could make a career out of it.  \"There\u0027s avenues she could look at going down, but she\u0027s only 12 so there\u0027s a long way to go just yet.\"  The club has also recently been nominated three times in the Celebrating Sports Awards, held by East Lothian Council.  Put forward by Councillor and Provost John McMillan, they are shortlisted in three categories: Performance/Development Coach of the Year, Club or Community Coach of the Year, and Sports Club of the Year.  It follows on from their Junior Team of the Year award, which they received in April.

The audience then voted for a second time and chose Jackie and Jane and their high-kicking Irish dance as their winner.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But  Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-ends-funding-for-kezia-dugdales-defence-in-wings-over-scotland-defamation-case","story":"  The move, which exposes Kezia Dugdale to potentially signicant costs, has been seen by some of her fellow MSPs as a \u0026ldquobetrayal and \u0026ldquofactionalism by her pro-Corbyn enemies.  Mr Campbell, 50, who runs the nationalist Wings Over Scotland website from his home in Bath, is suing Ms Dugdale for \u0026pound25,000 in a defamation action started last November.  It followed the Lothians MSP accusing him in her Daily Record column of making a homophobic remark about gay Scottish Secretary David Mundell.  Mr Campbell had said Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos son, the Tory MSP Oliver Mundell, was \u0026ldquothe sort of public speaker that makes you wish his dad had embraced his homosexuality sooner\".  In her column, Ms Dugdale said she was \u0026ldquoshocked and appalled to see a pro-independence blogger\u0027s homophobic tweets - Mr Campbell vigorously denies homophobia.  Until now, the UK labour party in London has bankrolled all of Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos legal support, paying for a QC and an advocate to conduct her defence at Edinburgh Sherf Court.  The costs so far are understand to be close to \u0026pound100,000.  However, to the shock of Ms Dugdale and many other Labour MSPs, the UK party has now ended the arrangement, leaving Ms Dugdale to fend for herself.  Although the party will bear all of Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos costs to date, it will not pay for any more legal counsel or any damages and costs  she loses.  It is understood UK Labour, which raised \u0026pound56m last year, did not tell Ms Dugdale directly of its decision, but informed her lawyers that it was no longer standing behind her case.  Ms Dugdale, 37, who was Scottish Labour leader from 2015 to 2017, opposed Jeremy Corby becoming UK leader, earning the lasting resentment of his supporters, who now dominate the party apparatus.  As the publisher of Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos column, it is understood the Daily Record may now supply Ms Dugdale with legal support for the rest of the case.  However any help would not extend to damages and costs  Mr Campbell won his case.  Earlier this month, Sherf Kenneth McGowan refused Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos request to have the action thrown out and agreed to proceed to an evidential hearing.  Ms Dugdale had been on the point of appealing that decision when UK Labour withdrew its support, forcing her to scramble to lodge the appeal.  Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos spokesman said: \u0026ldquoGiven the principles on which it was founded - equality, fairness and justice - the UK Labour Party wholeheartedly committed to paying all legal costs associated with this case from start to finish.  \u0026ldquoIt is very much hoped that all promises will be kept.  UK Labour said: \u0026ldquoIt would be inappropriate to comment on a live, ongoing legal case.  Mr Campbell declined to comment."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-government-loses-vote-on-p1-assessments","story":"  Holyrood voted 63 to 61 to pause and review tests for P1 pupils, after complaints from teachers about them being of little value, and parents reporting\u0026nbspchildren in tears.  The SNP government has promoted the standardised national assessments as a key tool to gather information about P1 children\u0026rsquos abilities and to fine tune their teaching.  The vote is not binding on the government, but was a blow to Mr Swinney\u0026rsquos reputation as Education Secretary, and a sign the opposition could embed it in law at a later date.  The decision saw the Greens, Labour and LibDems line up with the Tories while only the SNP voted for a continuation of the computer-based literacy and numeracy tests.  The government defeat came just three months after Mr Swinney was forced to shelve his flagship Education Bill because teachers and other parties would not support the reforms.  The Tory-led manoeuvre followed an often bad-tempered debate in which Mr Swinney and other SNP MSPs accused the Conservatives of rank hypocrisy and political opportunism.  Ruth Davidson\u0026rsquos party had previously advocated standardised tests at P1 and endorsed the government\u0026rsquos use of them in its 2016 Holyrood manesto.  Tory education spokeswoman said her party had been wrong in the past.  \u0026ldquoWe made a mistake about P1, she said, adding her party remained in favour of assessments at P4, P7 and S3.  She told the Education Secretary: \u0026ldquoI think the time has come, because of the evidence that has been piling up over the last two years, to call a halt, reconsider the evidence that is very much before us and evaluate what is the best way of progressing P1 pupils.\"  Mr Swinney said he was \u0026ldquoappalled by the Conservative Party and accused it of \u0026ldquodeceit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Conservatives are playing politics with the education of our children and we will not play along \u0026nbspwith them.  He defended the assessments as an essential part of a good education system, an integral part of effective teaching and learning, and part of \u0026ldquonormal classwork that took little time.  After the vote, other parties demanded the SNP respect the will of parliament, something ministers have repeatedly told Westminster to do on constitutional issues.  Ms Smith said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Parliament has voted decisively on this matter, and now the SNP government must act on that. The nationalists have ignored the evidence on this for quite some time, but they can\u0026rsquot afford to any longer.  \u0026ldquoThese tests need to be halted, and the evidence re-examined. The SNP is always talking about how important the Scottish Parliament is and how its will must be respected.  \u0026ldquoThis is the perfect chance for the SNP to do just that.  Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard used a point of order immediately after the vote to demand the government respect the outcome.  He said: \u0026ldquoTeachers told this government that these tests were useless, ministers ignored them. Parents told this government that they do not trust these tests, ministers ignored them.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Parliament has now voted to scrap these tests and SNP ministers must not now ignore the will of Parliament. The Government must therefore bring forward immediate plans for how it will respond to this evening\u0026rsquos vote as a matter of urgency.  Green education spokesman Ross Greer said: \u0026ldquoWhat\u0026rsquos truly shocking about the introduction of these standardised tests is that all the issues highlighted by Greens and others were already well known when the SNP decided to press ahead.  \u0026ldquoMembers of the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos own International Council of Education Experts have been at the forefront of these criticisms and ministers still cannot explain why they would ignore their own experts, never mind the voices of a majority of Scotland\u0026rsquos teachers.  \u0026ldquoNow a majority in the Scottish Parliament have joined the calls to scrap these tests for four and five year olds and in a fit of arrogance, the government seems set to ignore our decision.  \u0026ldquoThe concerns that Greens have raised are not limited to the P1 tests. The whole concept of standardised testing does more harm than good to our young people. John Swinney should follow the evidence, accept the will of parliament and scrap the tests immediately.  But SNP MSP Gordon MacDonald said all the opposition parties were \u0026ldquoguilty of the most appalling hypocrisy for siding with the Tories to score political points.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government introduced p1 assessments because they are a tool we need to track kids\u0026rsquo progress and help drive up standards in our schools.  \u0026ldquoThe Tories put standardised P1 assessments in their manesto the majority of Tory-run councils across Scotland already assessed kids from P1 so did Labour and the Lib Dems.  \u0026ldquoLabour and the Lib Dems have sided with the Tories in their political gamesmanship, and sought to prey on the anxieties of parents, just to grab a headline.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos depressing that they all stood willing to do so at the expense of kids\u0026rsquo education.  \u0026ldquoWhen it comes to educating our young people, we should be united in an ambition to drive up standards \u0026ndash not exploiting these issues for political gain.  Sue Palmer, chair of the educational charity Upstart, which promoted a boycott of the assessments, said: \u0026ldquoThe opposition parties made many cogent arguments against the P1 testing and it\u0026rsquos very disappointing that the Scottish government isn\u0026rsquot prepared to listen to them.  \u0026ldquoWe at Upstart Scotland are particularly pleased that one of the closing speeches against the tests mentioned the long-term implications of beginning testing at such an early age in terms of children\u0026rsquos social and emotional development. \u0026nbsp  \u0026ldquoThere is growing evidence that the decline of self-directed play  coupled with an early focus on teaching specic academic skills is helping to fuel mental health problems among children and young people.    \u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"uk-govt-criticised-for-not-using-majority-share-holding-to-halt-rbs-branch-closures","story":"  The cross-party Scottish Affairs Committee had urged the UK Government that,  the bank did not act on its recommendation to stop the closures, then  should \u0026ldquouse any influence that its majority shareholding provides to apply pressure on RBS to reconsider the closure programme.

Such decisions, it argued, were rightly the responsibility of boards and management teams, who were \u0026ldquobest placed to set strategy and commercial direction and to make day-to-day management decisions.  Last December, RBS announced it would shut a total of 62 branches north of the border but later ten of them were given a stay of execution until at least the end of this year, pending a review.

It is unfortunate that the Government has chosen to bury its head in the sand.\"  In 2008 following the financial crash, the taxpayer bailed out RBS to the tune of \u0026pound45 billion.  In June when the Government sold off another tranche of shares \u0026ndash at a loss of \u0026pound2.1bn \u0026ndash the public stake in the bank fell from 70.1 per cent to 62.4. The sale raised \u0026pound2.5bn.  The Government has said it intends to sell \u0026pound15bn-worth of RBS shares by 2023. The overall loss to the taxpayer is set to be around \u0026pound26bn.

Ms Sturgeon has written to opposition leaders in London, arguing that  the UK failed to agree a deal with the EU, the timetable for talks must be extended.  The SNP leader said: \"It\u0027s time for everyone in the UK political establishment to wake up to the reality of what now faces us.  \"If the choice we face is between no-deal and no detail, then an extension to the Article 50 negotiation period must be on the table as the only way to avoid an economic clf edge, and allow all alternative options to be considered.\"  At a dinner with fellow European leaders in Salzburg, Austria, on Wednesday night, Mrs May continued to argue her Chequers proposals were the only credible route to a deal.

Mrs May has been adamant that there will be no second referendum on Brexit nor any extension to Article 50 ie Britain will leave the EU on March 29 next year.

They said the Mackintosh Building, destroyed in the second of two fires in four years, should be rebuilt and an expert panel should be established to oversee the task.  : Why Glasgow\u0027s patience on the Mack is wearing thin  However Sandra White, MSP for Glasgow Kelvin, said the GSA board, whose chair Muriel Gray vowed this week to rebuild the world-famous building, appeared \u0026ldquonot fit for purpose.

Her frustration at trying to square the seemingly impossible Brussels circle was clear for all to see.  Perspiring in a sultry press conference room, Theresa May could not hid her anger following the \u0026ldquofrank exchanges she had had minutes earlier with Donald Tusk, the leader of the EU leaders, who publicly and coolly delivered the last rites to her Chequers Plan.  UK diplomatic sources had expected a bust-up but thought it would come at the October 18/19 European Council. The breakdown now at least gives the UK negotiators more time before the very final deadline of mid-November.  The Prime Minister confirmed that the UK was building up a new proposal to unblock the logjam on the Irish border issue.  It is thought this would entail having \u0026ldquoregulatory checks at Irish Sea ports these are technically dferent but similar to customs checks.

Yet the key will be not just whether Brussels can accept what many would regard a fudge but also whether the Democratic Unionists, who just so happen provide the PM with her Commons majority, will be able to do so.  The Salzburg rejection now leaves Mrs May looking bruised and battered, seeking friends where few can be found for her compromise. Brexiteers hate it, Remainers hate it, Brussels hates it.

Her aides will be making sure there will be plenty of water and cough toffees on the lectern and, instead of letters on the backdrop, there will be a projected message.

Ms Sturgeon hit back, again stressing the SNP would \u0026ldquonot stand in the way of a People\u0026rsquos Vote but suggested to Mr Rennie  he wanted her to be an enthusiastic advocate for another EU referendum, then he had to explain how that vote would \u0026ldquoguarantee Scotland won\u0026rsquot simply find itself in the same position we found ourselves in June 2016 where we voted to remain in the EU but the rest of the UK voted to leave.

The rise in people fearing homelessness has been blamed on harsh welfare cuts, the high cost of keeping a home, stagnant wages and a shortage of affordable houses on the market.  Graeme Brown, Director of Shelter Scotland, said that rough sleepers were \"dying on the streets\" and called for greater action to tackle homelessness.  He said: \u0026ldquoLast year we had to help more people than ever before, which is why, in our 50th anniversary year, we\u0026rsquore not celebrating.  \"We thought that by now bad housing and homelessness would be largely a thing of the past, but instead our services are needed more than ever.\"  :\u0026nbspHomeless given help to access Universal Credit online    The charity\u0027s annual report revealed that it provided help to 21,290 people last year, an all-time high. Its website was accessed at a rate of 17,000 times per week with demands for information, with half of those getting in contact saying they needed advice on how to\u0026nbspkeep their homes.  Nearly two in three people who came to the charity were women, with the majority speaking of\u0026nbspstruggling to afford housing costs as the biggest problem they faced.  The pressures were revealed to be nationwide. In formerly oil-rich Aberdeen, hit hard by the downturn in the industry, 70 per cent of all calls were from people worried about losing their home, the highest figure in the country.  The spike the numbers turning to the charity for aid comes after the number of applications for homelessness in Scotland rose for the first time in nearly a decade this year.  The Shelter Scotland\u0026nbspreport also contained a warning of a ticking timebomb, with young people making up nearly half of those who sought advice about homelessness last year.  :\u0026nbsp38 children a day made homeless last year    Mr Brown added: \"The number of homeless children is at a 10-year high. Unknown numbers are sofa surfing with friends and families as they don\u0026rsquot have, or cannot afford, a home of their own.  \u0026ldquoBehind those statistics are people, families, iniduals \u0026ndash people on low incomes, people with complex needs, people in crisis - some of the most vulnerable people in our society.  \u0026ldquoThese are the people we help day-in, day-out and, until there\u0026rsquos a decent, safe and secure home for everyone, we\u0026rsquoll carry on fighting for everyone in Scotland facing bad housing and homelessness.  Almost 40 per cent of those appealing for help were private renters \u0026ndash a disproportionately high number compared to the size of the private rental sector, which makes up just 15 per cent of all housing in Scotland.  Clients were helped via Shelter Scotland\u0027s free national helpdesk, digital chat service and one-to-one advice sessions.  Ewan Aitken, Chief Executive of the homeless charity, Cyrenians, fully recognised the figures revealed by the Shelter Scotland report.  He said: \"There is without question more people feeling a heightened level of anxiety about their home, their jobs and their relationships.  \"As the Shelter reports says, we are encountering more people under greater pressure than ever before because of the ongoing policies of austerity.  \"And it\u0027s not just the number of people finding themselves without a roof over their heads. If you are not feeling secure in your house you can\u0027t call it a home.\"  :\u0026nbspCall for action over rise in\u0026nbsprough sleepers    Last year the Scottish Government introduced the\u0026nbspPrivate Housing   Act 2016, which improves security for tenants and strengthens their rights.  Housing Minister Kevin Stewart said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoAs ending homelessness is a priority for the Scottish Government we have established a \u0026pound50m fund and the 70 recommendations from our Action Group, which Shelter Scotland was part of, are being worked into an action plan in partnership with the sector.  \"Shelter Scotland are right to point out the impact the UK Government\u0026rsquos harsh welfare cuts and wider economic factors are having on people and the increased risk of rent arrears and homelessness this causes.  \u0026ldquoWe back their call for housing support to be ed to a level sufficient to prevent homelessness and for certainty on whether Brexit will increase the numbers of those unable to receive support through housing benefit or universal credit."},{"url":null,"title":"ecj-set-to-rule-on-whether-parliament-can-stop-brexit","story":"  Scotland\u0026rsquos most senior judge said the question should be referred to the European Court of Justice for a definitive ruling before Westminster votes on a Brexit deal.  If the ECJ rules that Parliament can stop Article 50 without the permission of the other 27 EU states, it would reduce the odds of a No Deal Brexit.  It would also undermine Theresa May\u0026rsquos negotiating strength as she tries to get backing in Brussels for her Chequers deal after being told it \u0026ldquowill not work byEU leaders yesterday.  The legal battle was led by Green MSP Andy Wightman, alongside his fellow Green MSP Ross Greer, Labour MEPs Catherine Stihler and David Martin, and SNP MEP Alyn Smith.  The SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC and LibDem MP Christine Jardine were also involved.  They asked the Court of Session for a reference to the ECJ on whether parliamentarians could instruct the UK government to withdraw the Article 50 notication underlying Brexit.  Their case was initially dismissed, but they have now won an appeal heard by the Lord President Lord Carloway, Lord Menzies and Lord Drummond Young.  Mr Wightman said he was \u0026ldquodelighted at the unanimous ruling.  Earlier this year, lawyers acting for the UK Government, which opposed the action, claimed the politicians\u0026rsquo arguments were \u0026ldquohypothetical and academic, and did not reflect political reality on the ground and the European judges should not rule on the matter.  In June, Lord Boyd of Duncansby agreed, saying revoking Article 50 was not \u0026ldquoa live practical question and the petition was \u0026ldquoa clear and dangerous encroachment on the sovereignty of Parliament, as it was up to Parliament to decide whether it wanted an ECJ ruling.  However in a written judgement issued on Friday, Lord Carloway said the question of revocation was \u0026ldquoneither academic not premature as matters had moved on.  He wrote: \"It is clear in terms of the European Union  Act 2018, that MPs will be required to vote on whether to raty any agreement between the UK government and EU council  \"If no other proposal is proffered, a vote against ratication, will result in the UK\u0027s departure from the EU on March 29 2019 a date which is looming up.  \"It seems neither academic nor premature to ask whether it is legally competent to revoke the notication and thus to remain in the EU.  \"The matter is uncertain in that it is the subject of a dispute as this litigation perhaps demonstrate.  \"The answer will have the effect of clarying the options open to MPs in the lead up to what is now an inevitable vote.  \"Whatever the interests of MSPs, and MEPs, MPs have an interest in seeing the matter resolved.  \"In these circumstances reference to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling is necessary.\"  Lord Carloway included a draft text of the reference to the court.  It asks for a ruling on whether EU law permits an Article 50 notice \u0026ldquoto be revoked unilaterally by an EU member state after it has notied its withdrawal \"and,  so, subject to what conditions and with what effect relative to the Member State remaining within the EU\".  It also requests an \"expedited\" procedure\u0026nbspin \u0026ldquolight of the urgency of the urgency of the issue in terms of parliamentary consideration and voting in advance of 29 March 2019.  In his opinion, Lord Menzies said he was \u0026ldquoin complete agreement with the Lord President\u0026rsquos conclusions, reasoning and solution.  Mr Greer, the Europe spokesperson for the Scottish Greens, said:\u0026nbsp\"This sound judgement from the Court of Session paves the way for at least one bit of clarity amid the Tories\u0027 Brexit chaos.  \"It is entirely reasonable for us to ask whether the UK Parliament can revoke the triggering of Article 50 and end the Brexit process.  \"We know that the UK Tory Government, in the grip of Brexit extremists, has no intention of revoking Article 50 but that\u0027s not the point.  \"This is about ensuring MPs are fully informed of their options at this time of national crisis.  \"If negotiations collapse, as appears to be happening, we have to know that a No-Deal disaster is not the only option on the table.\"  Ms Cherry, who represents Edinburgh South West, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom delighted that Scotland\u0026rsquos Supreme Court has unanimously agreed with myself and my fellow petitioners that it\u0026rsquos vital for MPs to know whether Article 50 is unilaterally revocable before they are asked to raty any agreement between the UK and the EU Council.  \u0026ldquoGiven Theresa May\u0026rsquos humiliation in Salzburg yesterday the answer to this question is particularly important.  \u0026ldquoI look forward to the Court of Justice of the European Union\u0026rsquos ruling, she added."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-government-reveals-harassment-case-numbers","story":"  Official data also revealed there have been up to 41 such cases since 2013 in the government\u0026rsquos central directorates, which employ around 5200 people.  The government said there had been up to four cases in both 2013 and 2014, nine cases in 2015, ten in 2016, and seven in both 2017 and 2018.  As of 2 July there were \u0026ldquoseven live internal harassment and/or bullying cases, it said.  The information was released in response to a freedom of information request.  In response to a separate parliamentary question from Labour MSP Monica Lennon, the government said it knew of 11 formal complaints of sexual harassment by staff since 2007.  It said it had no record of such complaints against ministers since 1999 and the end of 2017, and no record of any such complaints against their special advisers since 2007.  The 11 complaints against staff since 2007 covered the core government departments and a series of smaller civil servant operations which currently employ around 6850 staff.  It said the cases \u0026ldquowere dealt with in line with the relevant internal procedures.  The information emerged as the government answered a series of freedom of information requests, many lodged by the opposition parties, about Alex Salmond.  The former First Minister was accused by two women in January of sexual misconduct relating to his time in office in 2013.  He has denied harassment and criminality and is taking legal action against the government and its top official, Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans, over the handling of the case.  Backed by a \u0026pound100,000 crowdfunded appeal, he is seeking a judicial review of the complaint handling process, arguing he was denied a fair chance to respond to the allegations.  The Scottish Government issued similar responses to around a dozen FoI requests asking for details of what ministers knew about the case, records and correspondence.  The government repeatedly said it \u0026ldquocannot confirm or deny whether any information is held as disclosure \u0026ldquowould be likely to prejudice substantially the administration of justice.  Questions about when and how many times Ms Sturgeon met Mr Salmond and discussed his case after the complaints were lodged were rebuffed on this basis.  Mr Salmond has said he raised his case three times in person with Ms Sturgeon, and was the first person to inform her that he was the subject of the complaints.  The government also cited exemptions from FoI law when asked for any correspondence between Ms Sturgeons and her husband, SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, on the case.  The government this week notied the Court of Session that it intended to defend Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos action \u0026ldquovigorously, although it did not object to him bringing it in the first place.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \"We have processes in place for any employee to report bullying and harassment which they may have experienced in the workplace \u0026ndash and we have detailed the very extensive support which is in place for any employee who needs it.  \"The Scottish Government and the civil service unions share a clear commitment to ensuring that there is no place for bullying and harassment in the workplace.\""},{"url":null,"title":"prime-minister-says-uk-and-eu-are-long-way-apart-on-two-main-issues","story":"              Theresa May has called on the EU to come forward with fresh proposals on Northern Ireland and trade, warning that without a move from Brussels it will not be possible to make further progress in Brexit talks.

Dubrovnik is a prime example of the effects of mass tourism, a global phenomenon by which the increase in people travelling means the standout cites, particularly small ones, get overwhelmed by crowds.  As the numbers of visitors keeps rising, local authorities are looking for ways to keep the throngs from killing off the town\u0027s charm.  \"It\u0027s beyond belief, it\u0027s like living in the middle of Disneyland,\" says Marc van Bloemen from his house overlooking the bustling Old Harbour in the shadows of the stone city walls.  He thinks the town is in danger of becoming a mere tourist site  something is not done fast.  On a typical day there are about eight cruise ships visiting this town of 2,500 people, each dumping some 2,000 tourists into the streets.  He recalls one day when 13 ships anchored here.  \"We feel sorry for ourselves, but also for them  because they can\u0027t feel the town anymore because they are knocking into other tourists,\" he said.  \"It\u0027s chaos, the whole thing is chaos.\"  The problem is already hurting Dubrovnik\u0027s reputation.  Unesco warned last year that the city\u0027s world heritage title was at risk because of the surge in tourist numbers.  The popular Discoverer travel blog recently wrote that a visit to the historic town \"is a highlight of any Croatian vacation, but the crowds that pack its narrow streets and passageways don\u0027t make for a quality visitor experience\".  It said that the extra attention the city gets from being a filming location for Game Of Thrones combines with the cruise ship arrivals to create \"a problem of epic proportions\".  It advises that travellers would be better served visiting other quaint old towns nearby: \"Instead of trying to be one of the lucky ones who gets a ticket to Dubrovnik\u0027s sites, try the delightful town of Ohrid in nearby Macedonia.\"  In 2017, local authorities announced a Respect The City plan that limits the number of tourists from cruise ships to a maximum of 4,000 at any one time during the day.  The plan still has to be implemented, however.  \"We are aware of the crowds,\" said Romana Vlasic, the head of the town\u0027s tourist board.  But while on the one hand she pledged to curb the number of visitors, Ms Vlasic noted with some satisfaction that this season in Dubrovnik \"is really good with a slight increase in numbers\".  The success of the Croatian national football team at this summer\u0027s World Cup, where they reached the final, helped bring new tourists.  Ms Vlasic said over 800,000 tourist visited Dubrovnik since the start of the year, a 6% increase from the same period last year, and had three million overnight stays, which is a 4% increase.  The cruise ships pay the city harbour docking fees, but the local businesses get very little money from the visitors, who have all-inclusive packages on board the ship and spend very little on local restaurants or shops  Krunoslav Djuricic, who plays his electric guitar at Pile, one of the two main entrances of Dubrovnik\u0027s walled city, sees the crowds pass by him all day and believes that \"mass tourism might not be what we really need\".  The tourists disembarking from the cruise ships have only a few hours to visit the city, meaning they often rush around to see the sites and take selfies to post to social media.  \"We have crowds of people who are simply running,\" Mr Djuricic says.  \"Where are these people running to?\""},{"url":null,"title":"bennachie campaign to be discussed at holyrood","story":"        The Save Bennachie Alliance will head to the Scottish Parliament this week to discuss its campaign.

It’s going to be a very special night.” LCpl Mair plays the cornet and has recently ed from the Far East where she provided musical and ceremonial support in South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan and Indonesia.

The programme includes works by such iconic composers as Holst, Shostakovich, John Williams and Karl Jenkins alongside new compositions and arrangements. These include traditional Scottish fayre and feature a whole host of soloists in particular the unmistakable skirl of the pipes.Gordon Michie, head of fundraising, said: “It is a privilege for Poppyscotland to be in partnership with such a talented group of musicians. “The tour is providing a great opportunity for music lovers across the country to experience the unmistakable and memorable sound of Scotland’s State Band.                                                                                                         “We urge the public to get their hands on tickets for the performance as soon as possible as they are already selling out fast.”As well as the tour itself, the band is undertaking another fundraising effort in the form of The 1918 Poppy Pledge. Not only is this a lasting tribute to those who fell in the First World War, but, importantly, will also allow the Poppyscotland to make a step change in the scale of support it is able to provide those in the Armed Forces community who rely on the charity’s support today.

He was aged only 29 but during his short le distinguished himself as one of the foremost archaeologists of his day.Alexander Henry Rhind was born in Wick on July 26, 1833. His parents, Josiah and Margaret , had lost 11 children in infancy.Josiah had two spells as provost of Wick and succeeded Robert Innes of Thrumster as agent for the Commercial Bank. He owned substantial property in the new and bustling Pulteneytown and settled himself in his property at Sibster where the young Alexander grew up.Alexander attended Pulteneytown Academy, going on to study natural history and natural philosophy at Edinburgh University.Following his work in 1851 on the cairns at Yarrows, he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries at 19 years of age. He argued for the inclusion of a broch as an example of native architecture as part of the Great Exhibition and wrote a paper advocating the extension of treasure trove to objects other than precious materials.His failing health took him to warmer climes, where he studied and published extensively.He bequeathed a number of legacies to his native Wick, including the establishment of an institute \"for the industrial training of young women\" at Rhind House, and provided for two scholarships at Edinburgh University.Friday 21 Sep 2018 7:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Blackmail claims over mums to be","story":"A WHISTLEBLOWER at Raigmore Hospital has alleged that midwives were \u0026ldquoblackmailed into taking on patients from Elgin in order to prevent Caithness mums-to-be from travelling to Glasgow to give birth.The midwe, whose identity has been concealed on request as the person is contracted to NHS Highland, said that due to maternity services at Dr Gray\u0026rsquos Hospital in Elgin being downgraded, expectant mums in Moray had to travel to Inverness to give birth.A large percentage of women in Caithness also have to travel to Raigmore.The additional workload from Elgin has led to anger among midwery staff who are also aggrieved that pregnant Caithness women were allegedly used as a bargaining chip.The whistle-blower said: \u0026ldquoThe maternity services at Elgin were downgraded and that meant an influx of new patients on top of the ones we already have from Caithness.\u0026ldquoWe made it clear to management that we were overworked as it is and a new batch of expectant mums would increase that even further.\u0026ldquoWe asked  they could be erted to Aberdeen but we were told  we refused to take on Elgin patients then the Caithness ones would be removed from our workload.\u0026ldquoEssentially, that meant that women would have to travel all the way from Caithness to Glasgow in order to give birth.\u0026ldquoWe did not want that to happen and we reluctantly took on the extra workload.\u0026ldquoThis comes at a time of year when all the Christmas surprises come into the world. September has a high rate of babies being born.\u0026ldquoStaff morale is already at an all-time low. Several experienced midwives are either retiring or leaving because of the added workload and the burden it is causing.Bill Fernie of the pressure group Caithness Health Action Team said he was not surprised that a midwe felt compelled to speak out.He said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a terrible situation for the staff to find themselves in. They should be commended for all their efforts.\u0026ldquoTravelling to Raigmore places more than enough strain on the mums and their families so going to Glasgow would have added to that. I can fully understand why someone at Raigmore would want to whistle-blow as it appears to be a pretty fraught situation.An NHS Highland spokesman said: \u0026ldquoDue to the unpredictable nature of maternity activity, cases are assessed on an inidual basis and robust risk assessment and escalation plans are in place to ensure safe service provision.\u0026ldquoTo date, since accepting intrapartum transfers from Elgin, there has been no need for any Caithness woman to be erted from Raigmore Hospital to deliver elsewhere due to staffing levels or capacity, as is being suggested by the midwe whom you interviewed.Friday 21 Sep 2018 7:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Bower author helping Norn become the norm","story":"COMMON words and phrases used by Caithnessians may be thought of by locals as slang terms \u0026ndash but, by using them, they may have been reviving a dead language.Bower author Elspeth Grace Hall is doing her bit to revive the language of Norn that was once widely spoken in Caithness.Norn was officially declared a \u0026ldquodead language by world heritage body the United Nations Educational, Scientic and Cultural Organization .However, Grace Hall has been bringing about a revival of the region\u0026rsquos native tongue by writing a series of children\u0026rsquos workbooks to teach kids how to read and write in Norn.If Elspeth is successful in helping to increase the numbers of Norn speakers in Caithness, UNESCO could reverse its death declaration.They had once delivered a similar verdict on Kernowek \u0026ndash the native language of south-west English county, Cornwall.But in 2010, UNESCO announced that its former classication of the language as \u0026ldquoextinct was \u0026ldquono longer accurate.Grace Hall said: \u0026ldquoIf you have ever sat \u0026lsquoO a benk\u0026rsquo, fed the \u0026lsquoscorries\u0026rsquo, told your \u0026lsquomannie\u0026rsquo off for being a \u0026lsquoloon\u0026rsquo or simply popped off \u0026lsquotill\u0026rsquo the shops you have been speaking a second language \u0026ndash one that officially doesn\u0026rsquot even exist.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always been intrigued by languages and the Caithness dialect is wonderfully rich.\u0026ldquoI started to investigate the etymology of words unique to Caithness and found that they weren\u0026rsquot part of Scots, English or Gaelic, they were in fact Norn. A language that official bodies such as the UNESCO insist has been dead since the 1800\u0026rsquos.\u0026ldquoIt wouldn\u0026rsquot be the first time UNESCO has prematurely pronounced a language as dead. Back in 2009 UNESCO declared Manx extinct despite there being over 1500 speakers of Manx.\u0026ldquoUNESCO was forced to change its classication of Manx from \u0026ldquoExtinct to \u0026lsquoEndangered\u0026rsquo after a group of school children wrote to them in Manx asking what language they were writing in  Manx didn\u0026rsquot exist.\u0026ldquoThe more people I talked to the more I came to find that Norn isn\u0026rsquot dead, it has just become lost in our English.

Copies of the series have sold as far away as America and Sweden.\u0026ldquoIt was just after the publication of Norn Min buk two that I received an email from the University of Bari in Italy as their Minority Languages department was interested in Norn.\u0026ldquoThey asked  they could use the Norn Min series to create an Italian-Norn phrasebook. A week later I was contacted by the World Children\u0026rsquos Book project and they offered me a contract to translate five of their books into Norn.The World Children\u0026rsquos Book project has

He can now use Microsoft Outlook and completed his new CV on Microsoft Word and been applying online for jobs.Alan said: \"I\u0027ve attended workshops on confidence building, and digital skills.\"My confidence is improving a lot and so is my computer skills, I have been job searching online and sending emails, I couldn\u0027t do this before.\"* To find out more and check eligibility for the service visit www.mygov.scot/fairstartFriday 21 Sep 2018 7:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117256.jpg","title":"Norse era in Caithness was our very own Game of Thrones","story":"He has taken some of the most dramatic events from a time when the county was the southern part of the Orkney earldom and condensed them into a rollicking, fast-moving narrative in The Katanes Saga .It is based on a series of articles published in the John O\u0026rsquoGroat Journal over a decade ago, reinterpreting source material from ious sagas, and follows on from The Raven Banner, published in the mid-1990s and now out of print. Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash  it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him ing to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Aslearson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being kned in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Friday 21 Sep 2018 7:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117588.jpg","title":"Preloved pet trade blasted","story":"\u0026nbspA CAITHNESS-based animal rights campaigner is calling for a change in the law to stop \"heartless\" pet owners from selling unwanted animals online.Natalie Oag, who is backing a proposal by the Scottish Government for the introduction of a special licence for dog owners, says animals listed on sites such as Preloved are the victims of a \"throwaway society\".\"Pets shouldn\u0027t be viewed the same as inanimate objects when no longer wanted,\" said Ms Oag, the Highland representative for the Peta Foundation .Pets listed on Preloved include a 9ft python available for \u0026pound1000 and, until a few days ago, a heavily muscled eight-month-old \"untrained\" micro pocket American bulldog for \u0026pound2000 \u0026ndash listed as it did not get along with another dog.Other listings include a sheepdog which \"adores humans\" but is not interested in sheep, while on Gumtree \u0026ndash which has recently imposed a \u0026pound2.99 fee to deter \"casual\" trading \u0026ndash pets for sale include an 18-month-old cat looking for a \"stable\" household, a pair of two-year-old \"very tame\" rabbits and a one-year-old cat whose owner claims to have developed a skin allergy.It is not illegal to post adverts and sell pets online. However, Ms Oag believes it is leading to a surge in the number of abandoned and ill-treated animals.\"It\u0027s not fair on them to be sold alongside kids\u0027 bikes and unused furniture,\" she said. \"Too many people are just not taking responsibility. They like the look of the dog when it\u0027s a puppy and then they take it home and think, \u0027I can\u0027t be bothered with it.\u0027\"A Scottish SPCA spokesman said people should re-home a rescue pet, rather than buy online, while a Gumtree spokesman insisted it had taken steps to safeguard animals by introducing the fee.Meanwhile, a Preloved spokeswoman stressed that although sellers existed that don\u0027t have an animal\u0027s best interests at heart, they are in the minority.Friday 21 Sep 2018 7:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Students get on their bikes in memory of friend","story":"THREE students got on their bikes at John O\u0026rsquoGroats earlier this week and pointed their compasses to Land\u0026rsquos End in a bid to raise awareness about mental health.Fenn Newsome, Giles Themans and Alex Hayton decided upon the marathon pedal following the death of their friend and fellow Newcastle University student, Marcus Colville.Marcus, from Exeter, had tragically taken his own le last December. He was a third-year medical student who played rugby with the cycling trio and was also a talented musician. He had also been suffering from depression.The idea of cycling from John O\u0026rsquoGroats to Land\u0026rsquos End came to the trio after they had learned that Marcus had previously done the y cycle, not once but twice.Fenn, a final-year maths student from Sheffield, said that Marcus\u0026rsquos sudden death was a huge shock to us all at the rugby club,and for everyone that knew him.\u0026ldquoHearing the news that he had been suffering from depression was a surprise to all his friends and family, he said.\u0026ldquoIn light of this, Marcus\u0026rsquos family have set up a fund in his name \u0026ndash Marcus in Mind \u0026ndash to raise awareness and prevent this sort of tragedy happening to more young men.Giles, a marine and offshore engineering student from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, added: \u0026ldquoThe three of us felt compelled to do something to help raise awareness of depression and mental health.\u0026ldquoAfter learning at his funeral that Marcus had completed this very cycle ride twice, we knew it would be an appropriate challenge.\u0026ldquoWe are using the social media hashtag #ItsOkNotToBeOk and we\u0026rsquore hoping to remove some of the stigma and get blokes like us opening up about mental health.Given Marcus\u0026rsquos and the trio\u0026rsquos links with rugby, clubs around the UK have been aware of the mental health awareness drive that they\u0026rsquore undertaking,Alex, a marine engineering student from Porthlevan, Cornwall, said: \u0026ldquoWe have been in touch with rugby clubs up and down the country. Our aim is to spread our message far and wide and hope others may cycle with us.\u0026ldquoWhen we discovered depression leading to suicide was the cause of Marcus\u0026rsquos death, we couldn\u0026rsquot believe it.

They worried that the business case for the cinema and hub was not sufficient and risked adding to the number of empty buildings in Cromarty.Others argued that the project would be out of keeping with Cromarty\u0026rsquos historic architecture.A report which went before this week\u0026rsquos committee said that Cromarty Community Council had taken a neutral stance over the proposals, but that a consultation it held with the public found that, out of 63 residents who responded, 37 supported the plans and 26 were opposed.Recommending approval council planners said existing paths through the site would be maintained and added that the location within an area that is already fenced off meant there was a \"perceptible distinction\" between the yard site and wider Links area.They added that the film society had looked at other existing venues for a possible cinema and found none were suitable, and added that Cromarty Estate had argued there was \"a demand from local groups and businesses for office space\".Voting unanimously in favour of the plans, a number of councillors on the committee said it was an exciting project but also acknowledged some of the local reservations over the business case.Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Margaret Paterson said that while some in the community had doubts over the cinema\u0026rsquos financial viability, she stressed that \"the film society is active and forward-thinking and they will get the people\".Wick and East Caithness councillor Raymond Bremner also acknowledged local fears that the community might be left with \"dficult buildings\"  the development didn\u0026rsquot \"quite work\" but praised the application and gave his support to it.And Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Angela Maclean said she believed the hub and cinema was \"a venue that can be used by lots of dferent groups in the community\" and would boost the neighbouring Slaughterhouse Cafe.\"This is an exciting development for Cromarty \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos a cosmopolitan and very artistic community,\" she added.Friday 21 Sep 2018 7:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The shop owner Cornelia Hughes gave them to us at cost price and she also donated the wobbly-roofed house.\"Cornelia is seen by the children as the white witch of the Fairy Glen as she makes \"get well\" lotions and potions and sells fairy dust and crystals in her shop and she dresses up at Halloween looking quite the part.

A farm trailer chassis was found at Avoch. And at Nigg, an abandoned kayak, plastic pieces and a large rusting boat were found.For more details about the project visit www.scrapbook.org.ukFriday 21 Sep 2018 7:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It\u0026rsquos certainly a possibility that there will be more launches in the area. It\u0026rsquos something that we will look into in more depth when we have analysed the data.\"The test, which took place last week, saw the 2.5m rocket accelerate to Mach 1.45 \u0026ndash well beyond the speed of sound \u0026ndash as it reached an altitude of four miles.The launch was designed to test new systems ahead of their installation in bigger rockets.Mr Hague revealed the test went as well as could have been hoped.\"The purpose of small rockets like the one we used is to be able to test systems that are needed for bigger rockets,\" he said.\"Rockets like this one carry communications and telemetry systems. Data transfer is probably the easiest way of describing it. The launch was very successful.\"It was on a small scale but it was under real launch conditions.\"It\u0026rsquos the first one we have done and it went really well.\"It was a successful flight up to the expected altitude and we found the rocket again within the estate.\"The launch comes just weeks after the UK Space Agency identied Sutherland\u0026rsquos Moine peninsula \u0026ndash between Loch Eriboll and the Kyle of Tongue \u0026ndash as its planned location for a commercial space port.Friday 21 Sep 2018 7:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

They\u0026rsquove travelled all over Scotland to skate parks elsewhere but there\u0026rsquos never been anything closer to home in Ullapool.\"Two years ago we got a loan of portable skate park equipment owned by Highland Council. It was located on the tennis court at Lochbroom Leisure Centre and was well-used but eventually it had to move on somewhere else.\"At the start of this year, there was an announcement that there would be a local discretionary fund to bid in to. That made me think it was worth trying to get something moving. Around 30 groups gave presentations. My son gave a presentation at the end of the day about the plans for equipment and we were successful getting the maximum \u0026pound2500 available.\"Ullapool Harbour trust also chipped in \u0026pound1000 to the cause.The group set itself an initial target of \u0026pound7000. It then submitted a bid for lottery funding of \u0026pound7500, which it has just been awarded.\u0026nbspIt\u0026rsquos hoped the new equipment could again be located in the tennis court for part of the year.Mr Crook said: \"It\u0026rsquos a facility that was well-received.

Verus Petroleum has agreed the purchase of Japanese-owned Cieco Exploration \u0026amp Production  which has holdings in the Western Isles Development Project – including the Harris and Barra oil fields – and the Hudson field.            The deal will add around 11,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day  to Verus’s daily production and it will also gain stakes in the Brent pipeline system and the Sullom Voe oil terminal.            Part of the funding package for the deal is being provided by Stavanger-based private equity firm HitecVision which is the majority owner of Verus.Alan Curran, chief executive of Verus Petroleum, said the deal was in line with the company’s strategy to expand its production base and cash flow.He highlighted the Western Isles asset in particular for its long future and strong cash generation.The Western Isles development includes the Harris and Barra oil fields. Production has exceeded expectations since it started in November 2017 and is currently producing around 40,000 boepd, with an estimated field le of 15 years.“This transaction builds on our Boa oil field acquisition in 2017 and our acquisition of interests in the Alba oil field and the Babbage gas field earlier this year. The combined Alba, Babbage and Cieco acquisitions increase our net production to around 18,000 boepd,” Curran said.            The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to complete in the fourth quarter of 2018.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4786963.1537538613!/image/image.jpg","title":"edinburgh to host premiere for netflix blockbuster outlaw king","story":"        Edinburgh will roll out the red carpet to host a premiere for a new blockbuster historical drama telling the story of Scotland\u0026#8217s most famous king.                Outlaw King tells a David v Goliath story of how the great Robert The Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat and repel the much larger and better equipped occupying English army.            Starring Calornian actor Chris Pine as the heroic king, the Netflix big-budget film was shot on location at a iety of Scottish landmarks including Mugdock country park, Linlithgow Palace and Blackness Castle.            Substantial sets were built and filmed at Historic Environment Scotland’s Craigmillar Castle, which saw village of thatched cottages created in the parkland around the castle and medieval workshops appear within the castle walls. Seaclf Beach in East Lothian also saw some of the action with horseback riders appearing on the beach.Director David Mackenzie is now set to  to the Capital on October 19 with a number of key cast members for a Scottish premiere for the feature film ahead of its eagerly-anticipated Netflix global launch on November 9. A location has yet to be revealed but the Festival Theatre could be a likely location.Creative Scotland said Outlaw King, which reunites Mr Mackenzie  with star Chris Pine alongside Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Florence Pugh and Billy Howle, was the largest production to be made to date in Scotland.Matt Jones, supervising location manager for Outlaw King said: “That Edinburgh is able to host this scale of production is a real credit to the city, and I have to say that we felt supported every step of the way by the City Council and its film office Film Edinburgh who went out of their way to make us feel welcome and to facilitate our requirements.”It comes after Film Edinburgh announced filming in the city region generated a whopping £16.1 million for the economy last year following a number of feature films shot on location in the Capital including Avengers: Infinity War, starring Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlett Johansson.            Rosie Ellison, film manager for Film Edinburgh said: “From Avengers: Infinity War to the forthcoming Outlaw King, Edinburgh has demonstrated time and time again its credentials for facilitating large-scale films and TV dramas. “Filmmakers regularly tell us that the Edinburgh city region is a ready-made film set, but behind the scenes are a host of services, businesses and residents who help make it happen.“That Netflix has chosen Edinburgh for the premiere is recognition of the support that they received while filming Outlaw King here. We look forward to welcoming visitors who are inspired to visit our city after seeing it shine in the cinema.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4802756.1537444466!/image/image.jpg","title":"iconic edinburgh detective rebus makes his theatre debut","story":"        Ian Rankin\u0026#8217s most famous character takes centre stage tonight in Birmingham in a play adapted by Rona Munro. Brian Ferguson meets the team behind Long Shadows \u0026#8211 including the latest Rebus \u0026#8211 ahead of its Scottish run                It has been more than 30 years since Inspector Rebus cracked his first case.            Now Ian Rankin is preparing for the prospect of seeing his creation in the flesh for the first time.            Fans of the grizzled Edinburgh detective will be able to see him in a whole new light from this week when the character finally makes his stage debut.Long Shadows, the first Rebus story to be penned with another writer, has seen Rankin collaborate with Rona Munro, the Aberdeen-born playwright best known for her epic historical trilogy The James Plays. The show, which will premiere at Birmingham Rep tonight before a King’s Theatre run on Rebus’s home turf next month, is not only a brand new Rebus story. Devotees of the retired detective will also get the chance to see him lock horns on stage with his long-time nemesis, Maurice “Big Ger” Cafferty.The characters will be brought to le by Coronation Street veteran Charlie Lawson, the Northern Irish actor known to millions of viewers as Jim McDonald, and Scottish Game of Thrones star John Stahl, with award-winning actress Cathy Tyson, who shot to fame in film debut Mona Lisa, playing Rebus’s long-time sidekick Siobhan Clarke.Long Shadows is Rankin’s second venture into the world of theatre after writing Dark Road, which Rebus was noticeably absent from, for the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh five years ago with then artistic director, Mark Thomson.             Rankin and Munro, who had never previously met, began working together on a story after the author was approached by London-based producer Daniel Schumann with the idea of a Rebus stage play.Rankin says: “I felt it would be an awful lot of work and didn’t feel confident writing for the stage on my own, but told him I would be happy doing it with someone else.“He mentioned Rona Munro to me. I was a huge fan of her work like The James Plays, but didn’t know her at all. We met up a few times and got on like a house on fire. “She was a fan of the books, which helped, but we decided early on that we didn’t want to adapt any of them.             “You can tie yourself up in knots trying to adapt something that wasn’t specically written for the stage. The Rebus novels usually have 30-odd characters, three or four twisty sub-plots and are hundreds of pages long.“I came up with the outline of a story and we would go for cups of tea and lunches and just brainstorm it. Once we had what we thought was the right plot she went away and did the dialogue.”Munro, whose previous stage plays include The Last Witch, about the last woman to be executed in Britain, and has written Doctor Who stories for TV, jumped at the chance to work with Rankin. She says: “My mother was a monster Ian Rankin fan. I resisted reading them for such a long time. I always felt I was such a disappointment in comparison!“Crime is a genre that I enjoy reading, but I’m picky. The ones I like I absolutely love, but there is an awful lot of rubbish out there.            “But Ian writes proper novels and Rebus is such a complicated character. If you read the books you get the opportunity to follow him over all those years and I think that’s part of the attraction. I actually went back and re-read all the novels which featured Cafferty in preparation for working on the play.“I’ve never done anything like this, which is writing in another writer’s style with another writer’s characters.“The writing of it was over a year ago, but it felt quite easy at the time, I think because I had someone else’s plot to lean on. I can do dialogue and character any day of the week, but having a tight plot is something I struggle with. It was a bit of a dream in that sense.”Long Shadows, which is described by Rankin as a “psychodrama,” sees Rebus and Cafferty thrust together again after the daughter of a murder victim turns up on the doorstep of the retired detective, who has been investigating cold cases for several years.Rankin explains: “I really like the idea of a crime that has happened in the past suddenly rearing its head again in the present.“There’s some unfinished business between Rebus and Cafferty over an old case and an investigation Siobhan is working brings it to light again, which leads to Rebus and Cafferty locking horns.“It is really a psychological game, with these two heavyweights kind of dancing around each other.“I love the idea of being able to see Rebus in the flesh and actually be physically in the same room as him, especially to see him slugging it out with Cafferty. “They are two big meaty roles – two men who are at a certain point in their lives where they are starting to ask big questions about what is left for them and their place in the world.”Lawson adds: “Rebus and Cafferty’s ‘friendship’ has been built up over 25 years. They’re very much like Holmes and Moriarty. You can see there is grudging respect for each other, but by the same token they are also battling like two bulls in a ring.”Lawson freely admits he has come to the role without reading any of Rankin’s novels and knowing nothing about the character.But the 59-year-old is more than familiar with Rebus’s home city – and his favourite watering hole – since his first visit early 40 years ago.“I have actually known the Oxford Bar since 1979.“My cousin Sandy, who was actually my best mate as well, lived on Heriot Row and used to drink in all these haunts like the Ox, the Hebrides and the West End Hotel. I remember Willie Ross, the landlord of the Ox, didn’t allow any women in the bar and would quite easily fling people out at the drop of a hat.“I met loads of retired police officers there. It was full of very smart alcoholics who did The Scotsman crossword.“I appeared at the Assembly Rooms during the Edinburgh Festival in 1981 in a show called Diary of a Hunger Strike and have been to Edinburgh many, many times, since then – it’s honestly my favourite city in the world.”Lawson concedes that all he knew about the character of Rebus when he was offered the part in the play, without the need for an audition, was that he had been played by John Hannah and Ken Stott in the TV incarnations of some of Rankin’s early novels.He adds: “It was one of those things that was a ‘yes’ straight away. You don’t turn something like this down. You need to really challenge yourself now and again as an actor.“I’m quite glad I was unfamiliar with the character. You don’t want to bring baggage like that with you to a role. I approached it with a blank sheet of paper from day one. I’m right in the thick of it now.“The complexities of Rebus are obvious. We’re not doing some existential piece. His faults are all there, warts and all, from page one.”Rankin is at pains to point out to his fans that the new play is set in a “parallel world” to the one created in his novels.He adds: “There are basically going to be two audiences – people who know and love Rebus and people who just want a good night out at the theatre and might never have read any of the books.“It slots into the Rebus universe. You get a bit more of Cafferty’s back story and a bit more of Rebus’s working relationship with Siobhan Clarke.“It’s a really great cast and \u2028it will hopefully bring in people who know them but might \u2028not know me. I might get a few new fans out of it, you never know.”A LIFE OF CRIME: REBUS IN PRINT AND ON SCREENInspector John Rebus made his debut in Ian Rankin’s second novel, Knots and Crosses, which was published in March 1987.The Fe-born author had begun writing novels while he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish literature at Edinburgh University.Rankin was said to have been surprised that the first Rebus thriller was classied as crime fiction when he had set out to write a modern-day version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.Rankin has admitted Rebus was actually killed off in the first draft of Knots and Crosses and he was persuaded by his publisher to revive the character in another novel.The character has appeared in a further 20 novels since then, despite an apparent swan song more than a decade ago in Exit Music, which signalled his official retirement from the force.However, after a five-year hiatus, Rankin has gone on to revive the character in another four novels, which have seen Rebus help serving detectives to investigate unresolved “cold cases.”As well as the new stage play, Rankin is about to publish a brand new Rebus novel, In a House of Lies.More than 30 million Rebus novels are believed to have been sold around the world, while the books have been translated into 36 dferent languages to date.The most recent Rebus novel, Rather be the Devil, topped the best-seller charts for hardback fiction when it was released in November 2016. New Rebus novels are said to sell as many as half a million copies within just a few months of printing.Rankin, his publisher Orion and the Edinburgh International Book Festival marked the 30th anniversary of the detective last year by staging a three-day festival in the character’s home city.The first “RebusFest” included masterclasses, workshops, tours, live music and film events, and an exhibition of rarely-seen archive material.Rankin’s novels have previously been adapted for television by STV Productions, with John Hannah and then Ken Stott playing the leading role.However production was brought to a halt in 2008 amid reports Stott had decided he did not want to continue in the role.It was announced last year that Gregory Burke, the writer of the hit plays Gagarin Way and Black Watch, was working on a new “contemporary adaptation” of Rebus for TV. Speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival this year, Rankin revealed that a much younger actor than Stott was likely to play the role when Rebus s to the nation’s TV screens. The character was said to be 40 when he first appeared in Knots and Crosses.Other actors to play Rebus include Ron Donachie, who starred as the detective in Radio 4’s dramatisations of some of the novels, while James MacPherson, who is best-known for his long-running role in Taggart, has narrated audiobook versions of the novels.Rankin, who was awarded the OBE in 2002 for services to literature, has been the recipient of honorary degrees from the universities of Abertay, St Andrews, Hull and Edinburgh.Rebus: Long Shadows opens at Birmingham Rep tonight, and will be at the King’s Theatre, Edinburgh from 8-13 October www.capitaltheatres and His Majesty’s Theatre in Aberdeen from 12-17 November www.aberdeenperformingarts.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4802813.1537437079!/image/image.jpg","title":"massive tapestry depicting games of thrones goes on display in glasgow","story":"        A huge Game of Thrones embroidery commissioned by the producers of the series has gone on display at a university in Glasgow.

Here is Prime Minister Theresa May\u0026#8217s speech in full:                “Yesterday, I was in Salzburg for talks with European leaders.            “I have always said that these negotiations would be tough - and they were always bound to be toughest in the final straight.            “While both sides want a deal, we have to face up to the fact that - despite the progress we have made - there are two big issues where we remain a long way apart.“The first is our economic relationship after we have left.“Here, the EU is still only offering us two options.“The first option would involve the UK staying in the European Economic Area and a customs union with the EU.“In plain English, this would mean we’d still have to abide by all the EU rules, uncontrolled immigration from the EU would continue and we couldn’t do the trade deals we want with other countries.            “That would make a mockery of the referendum we had two years ago.• : Theresa May makes statement after EU leaders reject Brexit plan“The second option would be a basic free trade agreement for Great Britain that would introduce checks at the Great Britain/EU border.  But even worse, Northern Ireland would effectively remain in the Customs Union and parts of the Single Market, permanently separated economically from the rest of the UK by a border down the Irish Sea.            “Parliament has already - unanimously - rejected this idea.“Creating any form of customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK would not respect that Northern Ireland is an integral part of the United Kingdom, in line with the principle of consent, as set out clearly in the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement.“It is something I will never agree to - indeed, in my judgement it is something no British Prime Minister would ever agree to.  If the EU believe I will, they are making a fundamental mistake.“Anything which fails to respect the referendum or which effectively ides our country in two would be a bad deal and I have always said no deal is better than a bad deal.“But I have also been clear that the best outcome is for the UK to leave with a deal.  That is why, following months of intensive work and detailed discussions, we proposed a third option for our future economic relationship, based on the frictionless trade in goods.  That is the best way to protect jobs here and in the EU and to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, while respecting the referendum result and the integrity of the United Kingdom.            “Yesterday Donald Tusk said our proposals would undermine the single market.  He didn’t explain how in any detail or make any counter-proposal.  So we are at an impasse.“The second issue is connected to the first.  We both agree that the Withdrawal Agreement needs to include a backstop to ensure that  there’s a delay in implementing our new relationship, there still won’t be a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.• : Theresa May has Brexit Chequers plan rejected by EU leaders“But the EU is proposing to achieve this by effectively keeping Northern Ireland in the Customs Union.“As I have already said, that is unacceptable.  We will never agree to it.  It would mean breaking up our country.“We will set out our alternative that preserves the integrity of the UK.  And it will be in line with the commitments we made back in December - including the commitment that no new regulatory barriers should be created between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK unless the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly agree.“As I told EU leaders, neither side should demand the unacceptable of the other.“We cannot accept anything that threatens the integrity of our union, just as they cannot accept anything that threatens the integrity of theirs.“We cannot accept anything that does not respect the result of the referendum, just as they cannot accept anything that is not in the interest of their citizens.“Throughout this process, I have treated the EU with nothing but respect.  The UK expects the same.  A good relationship at the end of this process depends on it.“At this late stage in the negotiations, it is not acceptable to simply reject the other side’s proposals without a detailed explanation and counter proposals.“So we now need to hear from the EU what the real issues are and what their alternative is so that we can discuss them.  Until we do, we cannot make progress.“In the meantime, we must and will continue the work of preparing ourselves for no deal.“In particular, I want to clary our approach to two issues.“First, there are over 3 million EU citizens living in the UK who will be understandably worried about what the outcome of yesterday’s summit means for their future.• : Ruth Davidson says Tory rebels must back ‘remarkable’ Theresa May“I want to be clear with you that even in the event of no deal your rights will be protected.  You are our friends, our neighbours, our colleagues.  We want you to stay.“Second, I want to reassure the people of Northern Ireland that in the event of no deal we will do everything in our power to prevent a  to a hard border.“Let me also say this.“The referendum was the largest democratic exercise this country has ever undergone.  To deny its legitimacy or frustrate its result threatens public trust in our democracy.“That is why for over two years I have worked day and night to deliver a deal that sees the UK leave the EU.“I have worked to bring people with me even when that has not always seemed possible.“No one wants a good deal more than me.“But the EU should be clear: I will not overturn the result of the referendum. Nor will I break up my country.“We need serious engagement on resolving the two big problems in the negotiations.  We stand ready.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4803514.1537531375!/image/image.jpg","title":"alex salmond allegations no details of contact with sturgeon to be released","story":"        The Scottish Government is refusing to ulge whether it holds details of contact between Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon over the sexual harassment claims which have rocked Scottish politics.

The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do. All of that helped set the scene.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006. Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building.

If you do have some proof to justy your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in dferent buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at dferent stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

A phone call from Brydon Thomason to Alastair Wilson, the Scottish Natural Heritage warden, alerted folk to them heading north off Westing, which triggered a mega sprint across to the coast where they were able to look down on about four animals including a male.\nTo be able to see them close to is a memorable experience, but to be able to look down on them underwater even more amazing. Such oppor­tunities don’t come often. They were also seen to catch a seal in the bay at Lund, and photographed by several folk during their progress north, and so hopefully can be identied by the team that are still up here researching the distribution and abundance of killer whales around Scotland.\nFrom photographs, it has been established that an orca seen off Cullivoe, north Yell, on the evening of the 12th July, is a big male known as 014 or “Bigga”.  Next day, the same inidual was identied at 0800hrs heading north through Yell Sound.\nSome of our showiest plants are in flower just now. “I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows …” wrote William Shakespeare in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”. And indeed I do. There’s a fantastic bank near me where the pale mauve flowers of thyme are pushing through between the bell heather, itself with some plants paler than others.\nCommon heather is not so bold in its colouration, but works in mass production, and will soon be colouring the hills with subtle shades. The third in the trio of obvious heathers is cross-leaved heath, whose compact flowerheads drooping from a single stem are pinker in colour.\nChanging colour, two striking plants are now in full bloom – angelica and meadowsweet. Although names for meadowsweet in dferent coun­tries all translate as “queen of the meadow”, it seems that its name actually comes from its use in flavouring the drink mead. Also in the days when hygiene was not quite so good as now, the plant with its rather nauseating scent was spread out on the floors of houses to counteract unpleasant odours. A Shetland name is “blackenin-girse”, from its use for dyeing wool.\nFrom the showy to the opposite – demure and unnoticed is a little plant with a big name that is very common about gardens, steps and roadsides: procumbent pearlwort. This low, hairless, tufted perennial has its base as a non-flowering rosette. However, the name pearlwort is said to come from the tiny, pearl-like white, long-stalked flowers whose sepals are actually longer than the usually four petals. In folklore it is said to have special powers of protection. So next time you go to pull out this so-called weed, just give it a closer look first. Maybe its powers of protection will rub off on you!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with 14 women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday.\n issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Opinion was also sought online. There is potential for the amended boundary to generate more planning applications. Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval.

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a dference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such le-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back. We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus       false     else         your_email.focus       false     else         friends_name.focus       false     else         friends_email.focus       false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random  false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVery Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field -

ni leisure show springs into action with fun fuelled launch","story":"\nLocal man Billy Nutt welcomed traders and exhibitors alike to the adrenaline-packed launch, which featured a spectacular parkour demonstration.\n\n                \nAnticipation is mounting ahead of this year’s second annual Calor NI Leisure Show, as dozens of exhibitors joined forces recently in an action-packed launch at Lisburn’s impressive Eikon Centre.\n\n   Load the IFrame Player API code asynchronously.   tag = document.createElement  tag.src = \"https:www.youtube/player_api\"   firstScriptTag =

and sponsors of the event alike, as he announced to a delighted crowd that due to the success of last year’s event the inaugural show which is running for the second year is set to open for one full additional day due to popular demand.\n\nLaunching over the weekend of November 2, 3 and 4, Nutt Promotions will once again highlight some of the finest caravans, motorhomes, boats, jet skis, tents, cycles, fishing and all things under the leisure banner that Northern Ireland has to offer, and this year it is set to be held across two jam-packed halls for the first time.\n\nFounder of Nutt Travel, Billy Nutt MBE, who has been involved in motorsport for over 40 years, explained: ‘‘On behalf of Nutt Promotions, we are delighted that, in 2018, the Eikon Exhibition Centre have now added a further larger hall, enabling us to continue with our planned expansion. We are absolutely delighted with the set-up here, and last year for us was just unbelievable. This has given us the space to not only expand the products which were on offer last year but to incorporate new leisure pursuits such as fishing. I’m sure the fishing lake will be a great attraction in the new hall this year with the opportunity for the public to try their hand at casting. We also have more boats, more cycles and more outdoor gear on display with both Decathlon and Go Outdoors coming onboard. The thing we love about the Leisure Show is that local businesses come together and work as a team - I think it is just brilliant.’’\n\nBilly also delightedly announced that renowned chef Paula McIntyre will be at the show for three days with three demonstrations per day.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nShow sponsors including Downtown Radio and main sponsor, Calor NI\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nPaula enthused: ‘‘I’m delighted to be involved. Confined cooking facilities needn’t be a barrier to delicious food. \n\n‘‘I’ll be using the best of local ingredients to cook up dishes that can be prepared on a couple of rings or butane camper stove, I have first-hand experience of cooking in a campervan so it’ll be great to be able to show what can be done to the wider audience!’’\n\nWith a launch which included an eye-popping somersaulting spectacle from the Go-Fyt Warriors, who will be hosting a fun-fuelled challenge on the day suitable for all ages, this year’s show promises to provide all-round entertainment for the entire family. Representative Kevin Howlette said: ‘‘We’re delighted to have Go-Fyt Warrior here in a series of races and challenges for you all to become NI Warriors. Once you enter our ninja challenge your le will never be the same again.’’\n\nThe family-friendly event, which this year will also host a new dog show, will also boast refreshments, entertainment and camping packages - and is offering trips to local shopping centres for those wanting to make the most out of their weekend. Billy added: ‘‘Last year we were happy to welcome members of the Caravan Club and Motorhome Owners Club to stay with us in Balmoral Park for the weekend.\n\n‘‘We are delighted that this year this arrangement will continue and will be extended to members of the Republic of Ireland branches of these clubs. We plan to have over 500 units camping with us over that weekend with something for all to see and do. For three nights stay plus three days admission, including a shuttle service into Lisburn city centre and Sprucefield on Friday and Saturday morning with entertainment on Saturday evening altogether for £20 / euros and £15 / euros for OAPs.’’ A free shuttle transfer service will also operate from Lisburn Railway Station to the show site at Balmoral Park.\n\nCalor’s Andrew Sands, Cylinder Sales Rep, added they can’t wait to : ‘‘Calor has been operating now for over 80 years across Northern and Republic of Ireland. When we exhibited at last year’s show, we were blown away by its success and the interest we received for Calor products.’’ Calor NI Leisure Show will run on Friday, November 2 from 2pm - 10pm and Saturday and Sunday, November 3 and 4 from 10am until 5pm.\n\n\nTickets and online\n\n\nVisit: \nnileisure\n and Like the NI Leisure Show Facebook page at: \nfacebook/N.I.LeisureShow\n for updates.\n

\n            \n\nLord Mayor, Cllr Julie Flaherty attended the launch adding: “The partnership with STA is a fantastic opportunity, and we are very excited to offer a fresh and innovative swim programme incorporating advanced swimming and Junior Leguard courses, as well as increasing grass roots level classes including baby, pre-school and beginner sessions,”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe programme will have very little impact on children currently in lessons. The main area of change will be the names of the lessons from Stanley right through to Shark. \n\nA Progression Chart will be displayed throughout the sites. The change will embrace all areas ensuring a standardised programme is delivered to learners.\n\nLeanne Dougliss, STA’s Interim Sales and Marketing Director added: “We are happy to launch STA’s Swim programme with Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council. Swimming is a vital le skill that all children should be given the opportunity to learn. They have embraced this opportunity to enhance their swim scheme and we are delighted to be able to offer a current, cost-effective, quality programme that is appealing to learners of all ages and abilities. Together we can save lives through the teaching of swimming, first aid and lesaving. I look forward to working with the team to ensure their customers receive the highest quality lessons.”\n\nFor information on the getactiveabc Swim Academy, visit getactiveabc\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8633378.1536767392!/image/image.jpg","title":"international sheepdog trial was a tail wagging success","story":"\nThousands of local, national and international visitors descended on Dromore\u0026#8217s Gill Hall Estate for the International Sheepdog Trial 2018\n\n                \nMore than 600 dogs and 300 top handlers from the UK and Ireland went through their paces to secure a place for the competitive three-day event.

many women are being left traumatised by these implants","story":"\nA Banbridge woman who suffered 12 years of pain after having a vaginal mesh implant fitted is leading the fight for a moratorium on the use of the devices in Northern Ireland.\n\n                \nDrawing on her own painful experience, Jackie Harvey has set up an online support group to offer help and advice to local women about mesh implants, and raise awareness about the complications associated with them.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nJackie Harvey.\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe implants are used by surgeons in an operation to treat pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence, which can be common after childbirth. But following reports of many women being left in agonising pain, there have been calls for the procedure to be banned, or at least suspended until the long-term safety of the implants can be evaluated.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAt the age of 36, a gynaecologist recommended that Jackie have a vaginal mesh implant fitted as a way of alleviating the urinary incontinence problem she’d been left with after having her second child.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nIn March 2005 she underwent surgery and it worked well. She recovered quickly, but unfortunately the plastic implant soon started to cause her problems.\n\n“After a year or two I noticed the tops of my legs were getting really painful and stf and I just thought I must be getting old, though I was only 38 at the time,” she explained.\n\n“I went to doctors ious times about the pain in my legs and got x-rays, but they didn’t really show anything. In 2009 I stopped doing any sort of impact exercise. I couldn’t run. I couldn’t really walk very far without getting pain in my legs, my feet and hips. I kept going back to the doctor and nothing was showing. In 2013 I was really struggling and I went to rheumatologist who told me that I didn’t have arthritis. I went to an orthopaedic consultant who told me he couldn’t see anything wrong with me. And then by 2015 I had seen an article online where a woman called Kath Sansom had started a campaign group called ‘Sling The Mesh’ and she was suffering from very similar complications to me, and it was just like a lightbulb going off in my head - this was 10 years after I’d had it put in.”\n\nJackie, who claims she wasn’t told about the risks so couldn’t make an informed decision about getting the implant, says the pain she suffered as a result of the device ruined 12 years of her le.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“It had a really detrimental impact on my le. I was struggling to walk and I was in pain and exhausted every single day of my le. I felt about 90. I was stf, sore and I just felt ill. For me to go to a doctor and my issues not to be recognised or accepted was just horrendous.” \n\nJackie was referred to a gynaecologist who told her the implant wasn’t causing her problems, but she refused to accept that was the case. She decided she had no other option but to challenge the doctor’s findings, and eventually had to pay for specialist treatment in England.\n\nThe 49-year-old office worker had a scan in London which showed that her implant was in the wrong place and was causing her pain. She finally underwent surgery at a hospital in Oxford in March this year to have her mesh removed.\n\n“As soon as I woke up the dference was amazing,” she said. “I’m still not perfect, but I’m an awful lot better than I was.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThrough the UK-wide ‘Sling The Mesh’ group, Jackie heard many stories of women from Northern Ireland who are suffering similar problems to those she experienced. So, in a bid to help them, she decided to set up her own local support group on Facebook, and it already has around 200 members.\n\n“This is a repeated story across the UK, not just in Northern Ireland,” she continued. “These ladies are going to their surgeons and they are being told ‘It’s not the mesh that’s causing your problems’, or ‘It’s all in your head’. It’s almost like they’re reading off a script.\n\n“These women are in pain, some of them are constantly getting infections, others are on antibiotics every day.\n\n“Their lives are a misery, they have no sex lives, their marriages have broken down, some have lost their jobs, they can’t enjoy their le, it’s just horrendous. That’s what spurred me on to push for some sort of recognition that there is an issue in Northern Ireland and something has to be done.”\n\nWhile the NHS says “the majority of women treated with mesh respond well to the treatment”, it acknowledges that “the Medicines \u0026amp Healthcare products Regulatory Agency  has received reports of complications associated with vaginal meshes - mostly regarding persistent pain, sexual problems, mesh exposure through vaginal tissues and occasionally injury to nearby organs, such as the bladder or bowel.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nJackie, who was the first woman to report her implant to the Northern Ireland Adverse Incident Centre at Stormont, is campaigning for the use of vaginal mesh implants to be suspended.\n\n“In Scotland there was a moratorium put on the use of mesh in 2014, by the Scottish government, and it doesn’t make sense that in the rest of the UK women aren’t afforded the same protection,” she said.\n\n“We want the use of mesh suspended whilst there is a review ongoing. We want the same protection that they have in Scotland. We also want a national register to register how many mesh complications there actually are.\n\n“So many women are being left traumatised by this. They are going to doctors for help and are just basically being fobbed off. It’s appalling. I hear the same story day in, day out from women looking for help and there’s nobody there to help them. Where do these women go for help?

I thought it might be a problem with my phone so I ran across the road to a local business and they also rang 999 and got the same message.\n\n\"On this occasion the patient is fine but you just wonder what  it was something else, what  someone had seriously been injured. When you ring 999 you want to be sure someone will be there.\n\nCatherine said once her call was answered the ambulance arrived quickly and the staff \"absolutely brilliant\".\n\n\"I think it\u0027s really scary, I mean who do you call when you need help? It could have been a child choking, it could have been a road traffic accident. It could have been someone on their own crying out for help and 12 minutes is a long time to wait for someone to help you,\" Catherine added. \n\nBrian McNeill, director of operations for the Ambulance Service told the Nolan Show he was \"embarrassed and very disappointed\". He stressed that should anyone have to wait after calling 999 they should not hang up and try again as this would put them at the back of the queue.\n\n\"This is totally unacceptable, we failed the person who made the call and the patient. We are doing a full investigation to ensure it doesn\u0027t happen again.\"\n\nIn a statement the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service apologised to Catherine for the incident.\n\n\"We apologise to the patient for the unacceptable delay in sending them an ambulance,\" the statement read.\n\nThe NIAS confirmed that Catherine queued for 12 minutes and said that they have a \"call queue because on occasion calls outnumber the call takers available to answer them\".\n\n\"We have ious contingencies in place in the event that there are more of those calls coming in than we can take.\n\n\"When we have calls queueing we allow our callers to complete other calls quickly and we also have a buddy system with the Scottish Ambulance Service where the calls that are queued here can be answered by one of them and vice versa.\n\n\"There has clearly been a failure in our contingency system and we are now in the process of completing an investigation.\"   \n"},{"url":null,"title":"fionola meredith its not easy when our children head off to university but flying the family nest is the natural thing to do","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

If that sounds melodramatic, wait until you witness it for yourself. It\u0027s an eye-opener, for all concerned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nThe farewell ritual is similar for many families. First, the drawers and wardrobes of teenage bedrooms are stripped bare as an unfeasible amount of clothes, shoes, games consoles, books, posters and other precious possessions are crammed into suitcases and boxes, to be sealed with parcel tape and marked with a strange new address. The carpet, long unseen because it\u0027s usually covered with unwashed jeans, empty cereal bowls and cast-off pizza boxes, may gradually re-emerge as everything gets packed away.\n\nThen there\u0027s the inevitable trip to Ikea for towels, duvet covers and cheap kitchen supplies, which to your son or daughter\u0027s mind may well include vital essentials such as a cocktail-making kit.\n\nAfter that, there\u0027s the journey by sea or air to the English, Scottish or Welsh university where they will spend most of the next three years, far away, on their own, over the water. There will be the swt unpacking, and maybe a last dinner together. It\u0027s disorienting to see all their familiar stuff arranged in a new room, a new city. And then before you know it, you\u0027ve had the tearful goodbye hugs , you\u0027ve doled out the last words of advice, and you\u0027re back on the plane or the ferry, travelling home without them.\n\nWhen you get home, you go to their room, which is shockingly silent and bare, and there you finally see it: the empty nest.\n\nAnd you know what? That\u0027s a good thing. You have done your job, the one you\u0027ve been working at since they were born, 18 years ago. You have raised an independent, self-sufficient human being who can go out into the world and create a le for him or herself. \n\nIt\u0027s not easy for parents, of course. Some - especially mothers, I suspect, though fathers are often startled to find themselves deeply affected too - find the process of accepting that their child has reached maturity very dficult indeed, to the extent that they become seriously depressed: this is the so-called empty nest syndrome. The pain of letting go is understandable. In fact, it would be strange  it didn\u0027t hurt. But it is a necessary process of adjustment for all concerned, both parents and children.\n\nI do think the wrench is more challenging for parents whose youngsters choose to go across the water for third-level education. \n\nThis year, according to the latest UCAS figures, 4,950 school-leavers from Northern Ireland are beginning university in Britain this September, with 9,120 enrolling in universities here. \n\nMy son went to university in Dublin, and while I missed him badly, I consoled myself with the thought that at least he was still on the island. But four years later, when my daughter accepted a place at an English university, I had to reconcile myself to the physical barrier of the Irish Sea between me and my youngest. I fully supported her choice, but she seemed that much further away.\n\nThe plane ride back to Belfast, after we left her at her new halls of residence, was the hardest part. Three of us had gone out there, but only two of us were coming home. \n\nBut le soon settles into a new rhythm, only now with enhanced opportunities for parental city breaks, as well as other pleasant freedoms. And because university terms are relatively short, it\u0027s never long before they are back again, blowing into the house like a hurricane, bringing with them a blast of fresh air from the wider world. It\u0027s exciting to see how they have changed and grown, even after a short time, revelling in their new-found sense of independence.\n\nIt is customary to deplore the annual exodus of young people to British universities as some kind of lamentable \u0027brain drain\u0027. That\u0027s far too simplistic. It assumes that only the most intellectually gted students leave Northern Ireland, or that they are only departing because they have no alternative, since there isn\u0027t the same range of courses and opportunities here. \n\nIn reality, our children fly the family nest because that\u0027s the right and natural thing to do. Some fly further than others, it\u0027s true, but they go because the time has come for them to try out their wings. All we can do is watch and marvel as they soar away.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"loyalists suing state claiming their internment to balance the numbers","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

west Belfast woman and around 20 Protestant men are all suing the UK state over their internment during the Troubles, it emerged on Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nEvelyn Gilroy\u0027s legal action is to be grouped with the so-called loyalist cases in all future reviews at the High Court.\n\nA judge was told one of the claims they were unlawfully imprisoned without trial is now at an advanced stage.\n\nMr Justice Maguire has now asked lawyers to identy all writs issued in connection with the policy.\n\nHe said: \"I will initiate a review relating a group which I will call internment cases.\"  \n\nDetention without trial was introduced in 1971 as the conflict raged in Northern Ireland.\n\nNearly 2,000, most of them Catholic, were held over the next four years.\n\nClaims have been brought against the Northern Ireland Office, PSNI, Ministry of Defence and Secretary of State.\n\nMs Gilroy alleges she was subjected to inhuman conditions during her arrest and imprisonment in May 1974.\n\nShe was held for three days in an RUC station before being transferred to Armagh prison where she was held until Christmas that year, according to her claim.\n\nInternment had been introduced as the conflict raged in Northern Ireland.\n\nNearly 2,000 people, most of them Catholic, were held without trial between 1971 and 1975.\n\nMs Gilroy is seeking damages for wrongful arrest, false imprisonment, negligence, breach of statutory duty and misfeasance in public office.\n\nIn court today it emerged that writs issued by around 20 men from the other side of the community are continuing.\n\nThey claim the British Government abused its power by locking them up in a bid to balance mass Catholic internment.\n\nOne of that group was arrested in 1973 and spent more than a year in custody.\n\nTheir case includes allegations they were interned because of their religion, in order to demonstrate the British state was not just detaining Catholics under that system.\n\nMore than 300 people were initially held in what was then called the Long Kesh prison camp outside Lisburn, County Antrim.\n\nThey were accused of involvement with the IRA.\n\nIt would take another 18 months before anyone from a loyalist background was interned.\n\nBarrister Paul McLaughlin, for the authorities being sued, confirmed as many as 21 legal actions have been commenced.\n\n\"Most are loyalists who say there was an unlawful policy to intern them from 1973,\" he told the court.\n\nEugene McKenna, representing Ms Gilroy, predicted the same discovery would be required in all the cases.\n\nHe added: \"This plaintf  is the only matter with proceedings issued who was a member of the nationalist population at that time.\"\n\nFollowing submissions Mr Justice Maguire agreed to group all the actions together for future, regular reviews. \n"},{"url":null,"title":"first charity air ambulance touches down to enter fulltime service","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n |

It was, regrettably, no more than an exercise in tired rhetoric,” she said.\n\n“Rather than accepting that her so-called ‘Chequers Plan’ fails to resolve fundamental issues, Theresa May has engaged in deflection.\n\n“Her focus has unfortunately remained on infighting within her own party and her pact with the DUP, instead of coming to an acceptable negotiating position.”\n\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood accused Mrs May’s government of “belligerence”.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood has criticised the PM’s proposals. \n\n\n\n\n“The Prime Minister is doubling down on her already unworkable ‘take it or leave it’ belligerence as a tactic to deliver Brexit,” he said.\n\n“Despite the EU attempting to give the UK encouragement to take steps that will be in the best interests of our citizens the Prime Minister has chosen to continue with her failed strategy.\n\n“In failing to adequately respond to the mess of their own making the UK Government have left the people of Northern Ireland in an extremely vulnerable position.”\n\nHowever, Ulster Unionist Party leader Robin Swann gave a strong welcome to Mrs May’s statement.\n\n“The single sentence – ‘I will not overturn the result of the referendum nor will I break up my country’ indicates that the Prime Minister has grasped fully what the result of agreeing to any deal which involved ‘special status’ or a separate set of arrangements for Northern Ireland would really mean,” he said.\n\n“As the Ulster Unionist Party has said before, Brexit cannot and must not be used to establish an internal border within the United Kingdom of any form. The referendum was about whether or not the UK left the EU, it was not about whether or not Northern Ireland left the UK.\n\n“Unionists will be reassured by the Prime Minister’s comments today and her commitment to ensuring that Northern Ireland will not be used as a bargaining chip in the Brexit negotiations.” \n"},{"url":null,"title":"what are the two major issues behind the brexit impasse","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Here’s a look at why they are causing a rt:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\n\nWhat is the economic relationship issue?\n\n\nMrs May said the European Union were only offering two options regarding trade. The first involves the UK staying in the European Economic Area  – a free trade zone – and a customs union, which enables free trade between members. The second option offered by Brussels is a basic free trade agreement for Great Britain with checks at the border.\n\nBy staying in a customs union, Mrs May said Britain would have to “abide by all the EU rules” – and, crucially, would not be able to strike the trade deals the Government wants with other countries. She said this would “make a mockery” of the referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU.\n\nMrs May said the second option, a basic free trade agreement, would keep Northern Ireland in the customs union and parts of the single market – which eliminates tarfs and reduces costs by applying one set of rules across all members. She said this would lead to the separation of Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK with an effective border down the Irish Sea.\n\nThe Prime Minister has repeatedly said such a ision is something she would never agree to, as it goes against the Good Friday Agreement which helped to bring an end to the period of conflict known as the Troubles.\n\n\nWhat is the Irish border issue?\n\n\nThe second issue also relates to the risk of a ision on the Irish border, but more specically over a “backstop” – a position of last resort to protect against a hard border, with checkpoints and guards, on the island of Ireland.\n\nBoth the EU and the UK agree the need for backstop arrangements at the border  no long-term solution to Brexit is found, and both are keen to ensure there will not be a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.\n\nBut the UK has rejected the EU’s proposal to achieve this by “effectively keeping Northern Ireland in the customs union”.\n\nMrs May said this was something the UK would “never agree to” as it would mean “breaking up our country”.\n\n\nHow can the “impasse” be broken?\n\n\nMrs May called on the EU to provide counter proposals.\n\nShe said it was “not acceptable” to simply reject the UK’s suggestions without a detailed explanation, adding that until they provide an alternative, progress cannot be made.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"bongo cat is now so much more than a cat playing the bongos","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However that didn\u0026rsquot faze him as he lined up in front of the live ITV4 cameras.\n\nHe stormed past championship leader Zamparelli on the opening lap to grab fourth place, before posting the fastest lap of the race sas he began to close in on the podium battle and pile the pressure on George Gamble ahead.\n\nSome robust defending from Gamble saw Harper forced onto the grass on a couple of occasions, but he was able to find his way past heading into Copse corner on the penultimate lap to take third position, which he held through to the finish.\n\nA time penalty for the driver ahead though ensured the Dromore High School student ended the weekend with a second place finish as part of a superb one-two-three finish for the JTR team, with the result putting Harper just one point shy of fourth in the championship standings.\n\nHarper said afterwards: \u0026ldquoI feel I\u0026rsquom really in my groove in the series now and I\u0026rsquom going to be giving it everything to try and continue our great pace and end the year in style at Brands Hatch GP, a circuit I love.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch woman’s invite to join charity Twilight Walk  ","story":"\t\t\t\nBALLYNAHINCH woman Rosalind Steenson is urging people to join her on the forthcoming Marie Curie Twilight Walk to raise funds for the leading cancer charity.\n\nThe event \u0026mdash which takes place on Friday, September 28 at 7.30pm \u0026mdash will be held in the beautul grounds of Barnett Demesne in South Belfast to raise funds for an organisation which provides care to people with a terminal illness in their own homes or in one of its nine hospices.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe charity is also a leader in research into the best ways of caring for people with a terminal illness and all the\u0026nbsp\n\nservices it provides are free of charge, with around 70% of its income coming via donations with the balance of funds provided by the NHS.\n\nThose taking part in the forthcoming Twilight Walk can expect much more than just a walk as there will be a festival atmosphere with music, entertainment and a spectacular firework display to finish off.\n\nPeople take part in the walk for all sorts of reasons, with a large proportion walking in memory of someone they have lost.\u0026nbsp\n\nRosalind will be remembering her best friend of over 30 years, Michelle Watterson, who died in the Marie Curie Hospice in Belfast in July.\n\n\u0026ldquoMichelle was diagnosed with cancer for the second time three years ago and, unfortunately, it spread to other parts of her body and became terminal, she explained.\n\n\u0026ldquoShe spent her final ten days at the hospice where she received exceptional care.

Even  you start out walking by yourself, you are never alone along the Camino.\n\nThe Camino Portugues, or the Portuguese Way, spans from Lisbon to Santiago de Compostela, the final destination being St James\u0026rsquo Church, where the body of St James is said to lay.\n\nIt travels through the province of Galicia in northern Spain, going through the cities of Porto and Pontevedra and along the coastline of Sanxenxo, the Cies Islands, and Baiona.\n\nWhile this Camino way was shorter that the more arduous Camino Del Norte throughout the northern Basque area of Spain, Edmund said that there were other challenges.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThe biggest challenge was walking in extreme heat, said Edmund. \u0026ldquoIt was 38 degrees on one day but for the rest of the days it was around 28 degrees. Staying hydrated was also a challenge.\n\nEdmund also enjoys the feeling of having to travel from one hostel to another with just the bare basics, as he says it gives him an understanding of what le is like for those with transitory lestyles.\n\nHowever, he adds: \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a great togetherness and camaraderie as everyone is doing it together.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"First look inside new £16m Down Leisure Centre with ‘wow factor’  ","story":"\t\t\t\nTHE new \u0026pound16m Down Leisure Centre, which opens its doors to the public in November, has the wow factor those closely involved in its design always promised it would have.\n\nWhile very much a community facility, the ultra-modern and futuristic three-storey building boasts a stunning range of facilities which would rival any of those more commonly found in leisure complexes attached to five star hotels.\n\nWhile the finishing touches are being put to the 6,500 square metre, three-storey Market Street building, the Down Recorder was last week given a sneak preview of the stunning new centre that has been a long time coming.\u0026nbsp\n\nPlans for the new complex were first discussed well over a decade ago and despite raised eyebrows about building the centre in front of the ageing facility it will replace, everything has gone smoothly with council officials delighted they now have a leisure complex that will be the envy of many.\u0026nbsp\n\nThey are confident that once the centre opens its doors to the public, people will recognise the long wait for a new leisure complex has been worth it, with the new vitality suite on the top floor which boasts a sauna, steam room and small pool with its own mini fountain, particularly stunning.\n\nThe spacious and airy entrance foyer opens up to reveal two swimming pools, one of which has a moveable floor. There is a reception, lobby area and ground floor studio with Newry, Mourne and Down Council\u0026rsquos corporate colours a recurring theme throughout the building.\n\nThere are dedicated changing facilities on the ground floor with the pools designed for use by people of all abilities. The smaller of the two pools measures eight metres by 13, while the main 25-metre pool boats six lanes and electronic touch pads to time races.\n\nThroughout the building, every effort has been made to flood it with as much natural light as possible which helps provide the centre with its imposing look. A boccia court designed for use by disabled bowlers is also located on the ground floor, with this particular area also doubling up as a dance studio and multipurpose hall.\n\nCouncil officials have also revealed the new centre\u0026rsquos ground floor level is higher than the main road outside to protect the building from future flooding that may occur in this part of the town and which was a signicant problem a number of years ago.\n\nModern sound proofing techniques have been deployed throughout the building, particularly in the swimming pool and main hall areas. When the natural light fades,\u0026nbsp subtle, state-of-the-art LED lighting illuminates the building, adding to its unique character.\n\nMains gas was connected to the building which also boasts a combined heat and power source which helps minimise its carbon footprint with photovoltaic cells on the roof helping heat the water in the pools and shower systems across a number of changing room areas. In addition, air source heat pumps sucks in cold air from the outside and turns into warm air.\n\nSo-called ocalux glass allows natural light to stream into the building on the ground floor, also reducing glare and preventing people from outside looking in.\n\nThere are miles of pipework and electric cables with the plant room \u0026mdash the new leisure complex\u0026rsquos nerve centre \u0026mdash resembling something akin to the interior of a futuristic space ship.\n\nThe impressive four court hall on the first floor can be used for a iety of sports, including badminton, basketball and five-a-side football. One of the walls has also been specially marked at the request of the Down Handball Club.\u0026nbsp\n\nAs with the ground floor swimming pools, there is also a dedicated viewing area over the main hall, while nearby there is a dedicated area for racquet ball and handball.\n\nA spin studio and multi-purpose area are also located on the second floor, with all music and sound systems built in and controlled from the main reception area.\n\nThe third floor boasts spectacular views across to Down Cathedral, the Dromara Hills, the Mournes and across Dunleath Park towards the Vianstown area.\n\nWhen not admiring the views, users can immerse themselves in getting fit or pampering themselves in the vitality suite. The third floor boasts an 85-station fitness suite and fitness room that can be hired by sports clubs to use. Council officials say the use of the top floor will evolve over time and has the capacity to respond to need.\n\nEach of the eight beams which hold the top floor in place weigh 35 tonnes and had to be put in place overnight as part of a military-style operation which involved heavy lting gear and went without a hitch.\n\nThe vitality area extenuates the wow factor, featuring a relaxation pool alongside steam and sauna rooms, with the careful attention to detail in the design process accentuating this particular area where people can relax and unwind. There is also a dedicated lt to take people from the swimming pool area directly to the top floor.\n\nCouncil director Michael Lipsett said the new leisure centre was top of his in-tray when he joined the local authority eight years ago.\n\nSince then, he has attended countless meetings to propel the scheme forward and is delighted ratepayers will soon have an opportunity to use a centre which the district can be justiably be very proud of.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe long wait has been worth it and this is a fantastic building which I have no doubt people will appreciate and enjoy. It will also be a pleasure for our leisure staff to move to a modern building.\n\nMr Lipsett added: \u0026ldquoI have watched the building grow from the drawing board and to finally see it nearly complete is really something else. Everyone associated with the building, from the designers to the builders and the councillors who supported it financially deserve credit.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoTheir collective efforts have produced a magnicent building that would not be out of place in the private sector. That\u0026rsquos how good this building is.\n\nOnce staff move in and the old leisure complex has been decommissioned, it will be bulldozed to provide a major new car park at the rear. Ahead of the opening, council officials plan to organise a series of visits to provide the public with a glimpse of the spectacular new 21st century leisure centre.\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C September 19%2C 1978  ","story":"\t\t\t\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash Downpatrick\u0026rsquos old town hall is to be turned into a training centre for out of work teenagers in an exciting \u0026pound500,000 initiative to combat the district\u0026rsquos growing youth unemployment problem.\n\nWork has already begun on clearing the hall and the centre is to expected to be fully operational by January next year with room for up to 30 trainees. Organised by a newly named community group \u0026mdash Lecale Training Workshops Ltd \u0026mdash the scheme will cater for young people between the ages of 16 and 19.\n\nLatest unemployment figures put the total number out of work in that age group in Down district at almost 500. The aim\u0026nbsp\n\nbehind the new centre is to give them work experience and provide them with basic skills in a iety of jobs.\n\nThe idea for the new community group is the brainchild of Mr Bill Hampton, of Down District Trades Union Council. Lending a hand is Downpatrick man Mr Malachi Curran, who is head of the Department of Manpower Services in Northern Ireland.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe whole idea has ben introduced to help young people who have been unemployed to prepare for work, Mr Curran said. \u0026ldquoIt isn\u0026rsquot an apprenticeship, but rather is aimed at teaching them basic skills and perhaps helping them choose the type of career they want to follow.\n\nMr Curran said that they hoped to be able to put anything up to 250 young people through the course inside five years.\n\nCLOUGH \u0026mdash The death toll on a road outside Clough climbed to five in three years when a young motorcyclist was killed on Sunday. He was 19 year-old Andrew Stephen Martin, of Ascot Park in Belfast.\n\nMr Martin was involved in a head-on collision with a car at a spot known as the Rectory on the Ballykinlar-Clough Road. The accident happened at approximately 2pm and Mr Martin died about two hours later in Downe Hospital.\n\nThe driver of the car, who was a soldier based at Ballykinlar camp, was taken to the Downe, but was later transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast suffering from severe facial injuries.\n\nMr Frank Greeves, a local lorry driver, told the Recorder that it one of the most dangerous bends he had ever seen. He asked: \u0026ldquoHow many more lives have to be lost before something is done?\n\nA DoE spokesman said there were no plans to carry out work on the road.\n\nSTRANGFORD \u0026mdash A party of 130 mentally and physically handicapped children and young adults went cruising on Strangford Lough free of charge on Tuesday \u0026mdash courtesy of the Downpatrick Division of the DoE Roads Service.\n\nThe group\u0026rsquo aged between 12 and 25, came from the Downpatrick area and were accompanied by parents and volunteers. They left Strangford in the morning on the MV Portaferry to explore wildle and points of interest on the lough.\n\nThe idea of the cruise originated with the staff of the Downpatrick Roads Division who realised that the ferry \u0026mdash often used for educational and pleasure cruises by many groups \u0026mdash was also ideally suited for use by handicapped people because of its ramps and high sides.\n\nThe crew for the outing worked their rest day without payment and the other overheads for running the boat were written off by the DoE as normal test running. Ready Mix concrete stepped in to provide refreshments.\n\nMr Ray Carter, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State and Minister with responsibility for the DoE, was there to see the children off on their cruise.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis a fine and warming gesture by the crews of the ferries to give up their free time. I know to look at the happy faces around me that their kindness is very well received.\n\nKILLYLEAGH \u0026mdash A scheme to turn Killyleagh harbour into a boat and leisure centre has proved to be the straw which broke the back of a group of local residents. Already 104 residents have signed a petition against the scheme which has received outline planning permission.\n\nPut forward by Mr Robert Morrow, a local coal merchant and businessman, it sets out his hopes to construct pontoon jetties, a clubhouse, toilet block, bar, restaurant, chandlery, workshop and car parking spaces.\n\nThe residents, while believing that there is an urgent need for the harbour to be brought up to an acceptable standard, feel that the scheme falls short of that is required and that it is likely to have a \u0026ldquomost undesirable impact on the residential area surrounding the site.\n\nRATHMULLAN \u0026mdash The Rathmullan Mound is to stay \u0026mdash or at least the best part of it is. After four months of intensive archaeological digging, experts have ruled that the Mound is too valuable to be removed, though they have taken away the top section.\n\nBut although the Department of the environment has put a protection order on the site it will not be taking the Mound into public ownership in the way it has done with other ancient monuments.\n\nThat decision is expected to anger local historians and Down councillors, who have been battling to save the monument from demolition and who have called for it to be taken into public charge.\n\nThe Mound is a rath dating back to early Christian times, with evidence of five dferent settlements from 700 AD to the 16th century. The top section, which is Norman, has been removed, though all of the archaeologist\u0026rsquos findings have been carefully preserved.\n\nOne of the most exciting discoveries was a large souterrain, or underground passage. This 1,000 year-old chamber was used by early inhabitants of the area and is still as perfect in parts as it was when it was first built.\n\nBALLYGOWAN \u0026mdash Female wrestling comes to Ballygowan in a big way tonight when Blackfoot Sue takes the ring at The Squire\u0026rsquos Inn.\n\nThe shapely wrestler from the USA gets to grips with another lady grappler, Manchester\u0026rsquos Miss Lena. The bout is sure to be the star attraction at this initial venture by the Ballygowan night spot.\n\nBut several other star bouts are on the programme, including world middleweight champion Adrian Street, Prince Jitsu and Bruce McDonald.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash Hugh Duggan, the newly appointed progressional at Ardglass Golf Club, took up his position at the seaside club on Monday. Twenty four year-old Hugh, formerly attached to Kirkistown Castle Golf Club, becomes only the second professional golfer appointed to the club in its 84-year history.\n\nHis appointment, combined with many other improvements both on and off the course, has made Ardglass one of the most progressive clubs in Co Down.\n\nBALLYNAHINCH \u0026mdash Ballynahinch piper Ian Jess took second place in the All-Ireland solo piping championships at Banbridge Technical College on Saturday.\n\nIan was placed second in the march section and third in the reel and strathspey section, but had to be content to finish runner-up behind Tom Anderson, from Dublin.\n\nIan is tutored by Joe McAdam, the pipe major at Ballynahinch, and is now regarded as one of the best pipers in the country.\n\nKILMORE \u0026mdash A former pupil of Down High School has obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Lancaster. He is John James McIlhone, from Kilmore, Crossgar, who graduated with a second class honours BA ision one in history.\n\nIn the junior section Richard Parkes, of Field Marshal Montgomery, came out on top.\n\nSAINTFIELD \u0026mdash A woman was taken to hospital on Saturday night after two cars were involved in an accident on the Crossgar Road, Saintfield.

This was the product of gathering together his late father\u0026rsquos copious notes on the history of the town.\n\nThe society\u0026rsquos other founding members included Mr Robert Brown, an agent for Dunleath Estates who was treasurer, Down County Council official Mr Robert Maxwell, who was secretary, and the Rev John Radclfe, who was chairman.\n\nOther society members included other local clergy, headmasters, representatives of professions and local businesses and iniduals who were interested in local history.\n\nThe first meeting took place in Denvir\u0026rsquos Hotel where it continued to meet every month for several decades. At this meeting the objects of the Society were outlined \u0026ndash to encourage and foster interest in the history and traditions of Downpatrick and County Down, music, arts and sciences and the architecture of buildings and monuments of historic or artistic value in the area.\n\nThe following day\u0026rsquos Down Recorder reported that Mr Parkinson gave the first lecture of The Downe Society, fittingly on the subject, The Story of Downpatrick, in which he spoke about man reaching Ireland some seven thousand years ago, through to the ravages of the Norsemen, De Courcy and the Normans, the Fitzgeralds, Cromwells, Southwells and into the eighteen century.\u0026nbsp\n\nHis closing words were on the urban administration of the day with a sense of the historic past and the hope of future well-being.\u0026nbsp\n\nIn 1948, the formation of the Society was a signicant attempt to bring together people from all sections of the community, particularly across the religious ide. Both The Downe Society, and its later partner, the Lecale Historical Society, maintained a proud non-sectarian record.\u0026nbsp\n\nOver the years, the society hosted many outstanding speakers including a Lord Chief Justice, local author Lynn C.

Even  you didn\u0026rsquot know the first thing about the place other than it was old, it was still clearly an important part of the history of Belfast.\u0026nbsp\n  After the fire, the past of the Bank Buildings became known and many lamented at the thought of losing such a piece of the past: for it to be turned to rubble and replaced with something nondescript. It\u0026rsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.\n  But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.\n  For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.\n  That\u0026rsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.\u0026nbsp\n  Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.\u0026nbsp\n  For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.\n  Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.\n  I\u0026rsquod say that you can\u0026rsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.\n  It\u0026rsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really don\u0026rsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I don\u0026rsquot think they\u0026rsquore going about it in the best way.\n  If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.\n  If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as you\u0026rsquore passing.\u0026nbsp\n  If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to see  there are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isn\u0026rsquot going to do me much good.\n  A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isn\u0026rsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.\u0026nbsp\n  As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the store\u0026rsquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where they\u0026rsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.\n  We wouldn\u0026rsquot have had the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that there\u0026rsquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.\u0026nbsp\n  We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go there  they don\u0026rsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast aren\u0026rsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.\n  The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but it\u0026rsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, we\u0026rsquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.\n  We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so there\u0026rsquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.\u0026nbsp\n  People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses can\u0026rsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade.

This year the RUAS are delighted to welcome Paul Trapp, who is travelling from Wisconsin, USA, to judge. The event is also a great chance to interact with 200 dairy related trade exhibitors on the most relevant technological advances, dficulties and solutions in the industry. \u0026nbsp\n  Rhonda Geary, Operations Director, RUAS said: \u0026ldquo2015 saw the move of Winter Fair to our new purpose built exhibition venue, Eikon Exhibition Centre at Balmoral Park. The move has worked brilliantly and attracted one of the largest attendances to date. In preparation for the 31st Winter Fair we have increased the livestock accommodation and now have stalling, washing and milking facilities for 200 cattle. There is 4750m2 of exhibition space and a full house of 200 trade stands. \u0026nbsp\n  During the Winter Fair there is a busy Seminar Suite with talks presented every half hour from 11am until 3.30pm.\n  Dr. John Bailey from AFBI will speak about better phosphorous management, Bobby Irwin of United Feeds presents a paper on getting the lactation to the right start and Roberta Simmons of the YFCU and Barclay Bell, President of the UFU will speak about succession on farms.\n  CAFRE\u0026rsquos Martin Mulholland will be advising on feed efficiency this winter, making optimum use of grass silage \u0026nbspwhile Christopher Osborne form the UFU will speak about dairy commodity markets and the prospects for 2017.\n  Dr. Sam Strain and Sharon Verner from the Animal Health and Welfare Northern Ireland will look at improved biosecurity and BVD while Jessica Sloss from Red Tractor, speaks about the farm assurance scheme.\n  The live calf rearing demonstration will be making a  for the 2016 Show. \u0026nbspGorteade Cow Care owned by Barry O\u0026rsquoLoughlin will be displaying a fully ing calf igloo with veranda and Heatwave ad lib calf feeder.\u0026nbsp\n  One of the innovative technological features at next week\u0026rsquos Winter Fair will be the Northern Ireland launch of the CalfApp and Calf Cloud by Volac which won gold at Eurotier in Hannover. It gives information about changes in drinking pattern and fluid intakes and monitors calf health.\n  The launch of the Winter Fair was held at Draynes Farm, near Lisburn, where Michael Drayne led a tour of agricultural journalists and industry representatives around his farm and milk bottling plant. The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres.

We are absolutely delighted with the set-up here, and last year for us was just unbelievable. This has given us the space to not only expand the products which were on offer last year but to incorporate new leisure pursuits such as fishing. I’m sure the fishing lake will be a great attraction in the new hall this year with the opportunity for the public to try their hand at casting. We also have more boats, more cycles and more outdoor gear on display with both Decathlon and Go Outdoors coming onboard. The thing we love about the Leisure Show is that local businesses come together and work as a team - I think it is just brilliant.’’\n\nBilly also delightedly announced that renowned chef Paula McIntyre will be at the show for three days with three demonstrations per day.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nShow sponsors including Downtown Radio and main sponsor, Calor NI\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nPaula enthused: ‘‘I’m delighted to be involved. Confined cooking facilities needn’t be a barrier to delicious food. \n\n‘‘I’ll be using the best of local ingredients to cook up dishes that can be prepared on a couple of rings or butane camper stove, I have first-hand experience of cooking in a campervan so it’ll be great to be able to show what can be done to the wider audience!’’\n\nWith a launch which included an eye-popping somersaulting spectacle from the Go-Fyt Warriors, who will be hosting a fun-fuelled challenge on the day suitable for all ages, this year’s show promises to provide all-round entertainment for the entire family. Representative Kevin Howlette said: ‘‘We’re delighted to have Go-Fyt Warrior here in a series of races and challenges for you all to become NI Warriors. Once you enter our ninja challenge your le will never be the same again.’’\n\nThe family-friendly event, which this year will also host a new dog show, will also boast refreshments, entertainment and camping packages - and is offering trips to local shopping centres for those wanting to make the most out of their weekend. Billy added: ‘‘Last year we were happy to welcome members of the Caravan Club and Motorhome Owners Club to stay with us in Balmoral Park for the weekend.\n\n‘‘We are delighted that this year this arrangement will continue and will be extended to members of the Republic of Ireland branches of these clubs. We plan to have over 500 units camping with us over that weekend with something for all to see and do. For three nights stay plus three days admission, including a shuttle service into Lisburn city centre and Sprucefield on Friday and Saturday morning with entertainment on Saturday evening altogether for £20 / euros and £15 / euros for OAPs.’’ A free shuttle transfer service will also operate from Lisburn Railway Station to the show site at Balmoral Park.\n\nCalor’s Andrew Sands, Cylinder Sales Rep, added they can’t wait to : ‘‘Calor has been operating now for over 80 years across Northern and Republic of Ireland. When we exhibited at last year’s show, we were blown away by its success and the interest we received for Calor products.’’ Calor NI Leisure Show will run on Friday, November 2 from 2pm - 10pm and Saturday and Sunday, November 3 and 4 from 10am until 5pm.\n\n\nTickets and online\n\nVisit: \nnileisure\n and Like the NI Leisure Show Facebook page at: \nfacebook/N.I.LeisureShow\n for updates.\n

Northern Ireland coastguard had to rescue three yachts that got into dficulty during Storm Ali on Wednesday.\n\n                \nThe volunteer crew members were alerted at 11.40am on Wednesday to go the aid of a stricken yacht at Newtownards Sailing Club on Strangford Lough.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nThe Northern Ireland coastguard came to the rescue of three yachts during Storm Ali.\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe all-weather leboat under Coxswain William Chambers, launched within minutes into the middle of Storm Ali.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAs the leboat launched, it quickly became apparent the challenging weather conditions the crew were going to face on their passage to Newtownards.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nShortly after launching the Coxswain requested the main water tight doors to be closed and all crew to be seated as they now faced eight metre waves hitting from the side.\n\nThere was a force eight gale blowing as the crew approached Strangford Lough. Some 90 minutes later the seas started to settle as the leboat was sheltered by the shore.\n\nOn arrival at Newtownards Yacht Club at 2.15pm, the Coastguard was concerned that there may be a person on board the weather beaten vessel, but when the leboat crew came alongside it was confirmed that nobody had been on the boat and she was safely on the mooring.\n\nThe leboat was then requested to go the aid of another yacht drting across the lough from White Rock and Kircubbin but unfortunately by the time the leboat reached the vessel there was nothing the crew could do as it was on the rocks on an ebbing tide.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAs the leboat made her  journey to the station, and was approaching Portaferry, the crew were alerted to another yacht in dficulty. The crew established a tow line and managed to free the vessel and towed it to the safety off a mooring in Strangford marina.\n\nOn leaving the sheltered waters of Strangford Lough the leboat and its crew once again faced mountainous seas and the Coxswain decided to stop in Ardglass marina for an hour to let the wind decrease and the wave size drop.\n\nLeaving Ardglass marina around 6:00pm the crew faced large but bearable seas making it back to Newcastle, Co. Down for 7:00pm.\n\nSpeaking after spending over seven hours at sea, Newcastle RNLI Coxswain William Chambers said: \"This was a challenging day for our volunteers given that we launched into rough seas when Storm Ali was at its worst.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\"It was also uncertain at that point  there was a le at risk on-board the yacht, thankfully there wasn’t in this case. It was a long and challenging day but our volunteers are highly skilled and trained for these situations and were delighted to be able to help.\"\n\n                            \n            \n

two former pupils who lost their lives in a 24 hours period.\n\n                \nBenjamin Davis died in America on Tuesday in what is understood to have been a tragic accident, while Matthew Campbell died on Wednesday when he was struck by a falling tree in Slieve Gullion Park during Storm Ali. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nA single school year separated the boys at the Belfast school, both of them being in their early twenties.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nRBAI principal Janet Williamson paid tribute to both ex-pupils during morning assembly in the school on Friday. \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nShe told the News Letter on Thursday: “We have the flag flying at half mast. It’s normally something that is only reserved for very prominent Instonians, but we’ve done it as a mark of respect to these two young men, who were model students. “I’ve been a principal for 18 years and I’ve never experienced anything like this.”\n\nMatt’s family has asked, in a public notice, that “bright clothing is worn” to his funeral  on Monday.\n\nHis family described him as the “devoted son of Mark and Pamela, dearly loved fiance of Robyn, cherished brother of Ashley and fiance Kyle, uncle of Baby Zara, grandson of Jack and Beryl, Fred and Isa”. \n\nThe notice added that “Everyone is welcome to call” at his parents’ home at 15 Glencraig Road, Glengormley. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nA Service of Celebration for his le will be held in Fleming \u0026amp Cuthbert Funeral Home, 141 Mill Road, Ballyclare, BT39 9DZ on Monday 24 September at 10.30am followed by interment in Ballyclare Cemetery. There are no details yet on Ben’s funeral. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n        \n\n            \n    \n        \n
