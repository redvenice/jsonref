Thankfully she doesn\u0027t give many details, but you get the impression the earth didn\u0027t move for the 30-year-old. It didn\u0027t even rumble.In a separate video clip, Nick, 34, looks as shame-faced as a naughty schoolboy being ticked off for failing a spelling test. He\u0027s definitely in the dog house, he says. His wife is furious, claiming he didn\u0027t do his homework on how to mix essential oils.It\u0027s rare we see what really goes on in other people\u0027s relationships. But this intimate glimpse — part of the controversial new BBC1 fly-on-the-wall series Sex On The Couch — allows us, for the first time, a rare and tantalising peek behind the bedroom doors of real married couples with some very real problems they\u0027re all too willing to share.In each of the six 45-minute episodes, two couples are filmed attending three sessions with a sex therapist in a Manchester clinic called The Annexe.Although the swish interior-designed therapy rooms were specially created for the series, the problems the couples face are real — along with the counselling sessions they get from the show\u0027s therapists.All of the couples picked are in their 20s and early 30s, showing sex problems are just as much an issue for Millennial couples as middle-aged ones.It seems that while this generation has been exposed to more sex online and in the media than ever before, they are struggling to deal with intimacy.What\u0027s more, it also shows how, in this world of constant self-analysis and information overload, even the bedroom is no longer a sanctuary between man and wife. All of the couples were delighted to share the most intimate details of their relationship in a bid to get their love lives back on track.At the end of each session, couples get \u0027homework\u0027 exercises to do during the week to improve things. After Louisa and Nick\u0027s romantic night ends in failure, they come back for their second session with therapist Lohani Noor to analyse what went wrong.         They said the passion had stopped burning after five years together - but the programme\u0027s therapists reveal the trust died when Nick didn\u0027t tell Louisa he\u0027d been made redundant As the couple, from Amersham, Bucks, sit on opposite ends of a velvet sofa, it\u0027s clear there\u0027s more than just physical distance between them.The passion which, in Nick\u0027s words, \u0027just burned brighter and brighter\u0027 after they first met as colleagues at a magazine publisher five years ago, and married two years ago, has ebbed away so much that they now describe their sex lives as virtually non-existent.The cameras in the therapy room are clearly well-hidden because it all comes tumbling out about how Louisa is often too tired for sex because she suffers with ME and chronic pain.Meanwhile, Nick freely offers that he\u0027s \u0027selfish\u0027 because he has no patience for foreplay and wants to get down to business as soon as he feels \u0027frisky\u0027 — so it\u0027s clear why Louisa is now complaining about \u0027a disconnect\u0027.         Therapist Lohani tells Louisa to pause when she hears herself use her mothering voice — and rather than leave her to handle everything, Nick needs to grow up and take more responsibilityThe couple, who volunteered to have therapy on TV after Louisa saw an appeal on a Relate social media page, are now looking for ways to compromise.But the message of the programme reveals what most of us suspect: that sex problems are caused by tensions in a couple\u0027s relationship, not by what happens between the sheets.It soon transpires that it\u0027s not libido that\u0027s separating Louisa and Nick, but a lack of trust.Sensing there\u0027s more at stake, with issues running deeper than not having the right essential oils to hand, therapist Lohani teases out that Louisa lost her trust in Nick when he didn\u0027t tell her he had lost his job as a sports journalist for three months for fear of disappointing her.By careful probing, it transpires Nick is perpetually cast as a naughty child who can\u0027t be trusted to do anything right, with Louisa falling into the role of scolding motherteacher.This is playing out in their sex lives. From Louisa\u0027s rebuking tone, which is met by Nick hanging his head in shame, Lohani surmises that they have adopted roles that don\u0027t make for fireworks in the bedroom. \u0027When you are you talking to each other in this way, there\u0027s never going to be any sex,\u0027 she says.From now on, Lohani say Louisa needs to pause when she hears herself use her mothering voice — and rather than leave her to handle everything, Nick needs to grow up and take more responsibility. Listening to what happens between other couples behind closed doors is fascinating, and it\u0027s dynamics like these that will doubtless enlighten viewers to what is happening in their own relationships.But as the couples make so many embarrassing confessions along the way — Nick, for example, squirms as he reveals how some of his \u0027techniques\u0027 could be better — you can\u0027t help but wonder what drove these couples to allow cameras to film this most private part of their lives.There is, of course, the fact it\u0027s free — a 50-minute session with one of the counsellors would cost as much as £120.But while Nick admits he\u0027d rather his parents didn\u0027t see the programme and his mates are likely to tease him, he says he hopes others will appreciate they were brave enough to do all they could to repair their relationship.                Chloe, 27, with partner Tony, 28, pictured at their home in Blackpool, LancsNext up are Tony, a 28-year-old graphic designer and his fiancee Chloe, a 27-year-old hotel receptionist, from Blackpool.They have sex at least once a week, with Tony sometimes texting his partner of three years \u0027to book himself in\u0027.But due to the fact they\u0027ve got a two-year-old daughter, plus girls aged five and eight from Chloe\u0027s previous relationship, most encounters are \u0027quickies\u0027 which leave both unsatisfied. \u0027Foreplay is like a treat for us...it\u0027s like once a month.\u0027Homework from therapist Kate Moyle, who diagnoses they need to prioritise more time for themselves, is a rule that there must be at least five minutes of kissing before intercourse.They must also set aside a bowl for written ideas about what they\u0027d like to do to each other. Back at home, Chloe films herself using a fluffy pen to scribble down as many ideas as she can to put in a Pyrex dish she keeps on the kitchen counter — including role-play games, blindfolds and different positions.         After having better sex the couple don\u0027t bicker as much, the experts discoverWhen the couple come back to the clinic, grinning from ear to ear, it\u0027s clear that making time for each other with some early nights and some fresh inspiration has had benefits for the rest of their relationship, too. They gleefully report to having \u0027proper\u0027 sex up to three times a week and it turns out the rosy glow is no longer confined to the bedroom.Chloe announces they are more in love than ever while Tony observes they have stopped bickering and he doesn\u0027t get as uptight as he used to about when the washing-up isn\u0027t done.Next on the couch is hairdresser Dana, 21, and 26-year-old partner James, an automotive engineer, who live together in Walsall. A disparity in their sex drives, after two years together, has left them both miserable. He complains she is always pestering him for sex, while she calls him a \u0027once a week\u0027 boy.But according to therapist Roberta Babb, different sex drives aren\u0027t the problem — it\u0027s how couples communicate their different needs. She said: \u0027It\u0027s about taking away that responsibility and that feeling of pressure and just thinking: \u0027Let\u0027s have some fun.\u0027 To that end, Dana and James are sent off with a sex ban for a week to build the tension and a questionnaire to help them talk about each other\u0027s fantasies, as they\u0027ve never really discussed what they would like to do to each other.Here, too, there is another underlying reason for the rising tensions. This time, it is down to the fact that James\u0027s previous girlfriend cheated on him nine months before he met Dana, making him insecure and fearful she would do the same.However by giving them some exercises, the spark is back. Dana says: \u0027We didn\u0027t realise what we\u0027d lost. I want to keep hugging him and telling him I love him.\u0027There\u0027s another happy outcome which is, thanks to the sex the couple had during the filming, they are now expecting their first child in August.         Dana, 21, and James, 26, who live together in Walsall, are sent away with a sex ban to build the tension back up in their relationship         The pair seem much closer after being given \u0027homework\u0027 to share their fantasies with each other, having never thought to do so beforeIndeed, since finishing the programme last year, all three couples claim the sessions have improved their relationships for the better.However, therapy can also be the deciding factor that ends a relationship. Joanne, 20, and Craig, 28, from Newcastle, have only been together for 18 months but have already married and had a baby.They no longer have sex — partly because Joanne admits she even has trouble saying the word, referring to it obliquely as \u0027Smex\u0027.Therapy is clearly hard for her as she says she was raised to believe that \u0027what goes on in the bedroom, stays in the bedroom\u0027.However, it seems love-making is the least of their difficulties. Raising their son has built up a catalogue of resentment. Slowly we see the couple\u0027s relationship unravel.They agree when their therapist Silva Neves tells them: \u0027What I\u0027m hearing is that you want to regain what you had. In your history, you have not had a long time in sexual discovery. You\u0027ve moved very quickly. You became parents before you finished being lovers.\u0027But when the couple try to do the homework to bring them closer — to have a minute-long full body hug twice a day for a week — they only do it twice and row the rest of time.         Veteran psychotherapist Phillip Hodson believes the programmes could show first-hand how well therapy can help couples listen to each other\u0027s points of view, often for the first timeThe death knell comes when, back in therapy, they answer a questionnaire about why they are staying in the relationship — and find that both rate the fear of being alone higher than enjoying being with each other. When Craig reaches out to comfort her, Joanne pushes him away.The couple take the final two sessions separately — and the closing credits reveal they have since decided to separate.Veteran psychotherapist Phillip Hodson, who helped pioneer relationship and sex counselling in the UK, said it would be better to call the programme \u0027Couples On The Couch\u0027 rather than \u0027Sex On The Couch\u0027 because sex issues are nearly always inseparable from relationship difficulties.He believes the programmes could show first-hand how well therapy can help couples listen to each other\u0027s points of view, often for the first time.Difficult conversations, he says, do not always need to descend into rows. \u0027There is a tension between good TV and good therapy, however. Good TV would often mean the therapy has been difficult or disastrous. People love to see things go wrong.\u0027However, if handled well, this series could provide a useful way for viewers to think more realistically about their own relationships. It could give them more choices of how to react in their own conflicts and provide insight.\u0027It will also give people an understanding that they are almost never the only one with this sort of problem: in fact it\u0027s perfectly normal to feel as upset they do.\u0027Indeed, the programme makes it plain that good sex starts long before you get to the bedroom.As Lohani sends Nick and Louisa off to put what they\u0027ve learned into practice, Louisa observes: \u0027It\u0027s amazing how just focusing on sex has got our whole relationship back on track.\u0027If you can\u0027t trust someone in a relationship, you certainly can\u0027t trust them when you\u0027re vulnerable and naked.\u0027Sex On The Couch is on BBC1 at 11.25pm tonight."},{"url":null,"title":"Amazon aims bring one day delivery Prime members globe","story":"Share this article Olsavsky also said earlier that the company would spend more later this year to roll out more benefits to international Prime members.The news marks a familiar refrain for the world\u0027s largest online retailer. For years, Amazon has made expensive bets on new technology and programs, like its $13.7billion purchase of Whole Foods Market in 2017 to become a player in the US grocery business.Amazon\u0027s investments had long meant lower profit. However, its steady, often successful marches into new industries have been lucrative to shareholders, including its founder Jeff Bezos, who had become the richest man in the world.The luster of these bets still shined brightly on Thursday.The company\u0027s loyal customer base has drawn merchants to sell and increasingly advertise through its site in exchange for fees, helping Amazon transform from a largely low-margin retail business to a more and more lucrative marketplace.         Amazon will spend $800million in the second quarter on the one-day shipping goal. Pictured is CEO Jeff Bezos, who is the richest man in the worldRevenue from seller services jumped 20 per cent to $11.1billion in the first quarter, while ad and other sales surged 34 per cent to $2.7billion, the company said.Meanwhile, Amazon\u0027s cloud unit kept growing as more enterprises moved data and computing operations to the technology company\u0027s servers. Sales for Amazon Web Services (AWS) rose 41 per cent to $7.7billion in the first quarter.Some analysts noted that these growth figures, while impressive, were lower than what Amazon had posted in prior quarters.\u0027Amazon delivered slower growth in all key segments - AWS, advertising and e-commerce - but margins skyrocketed, seemingly driven by less aggressive investment,\u0027 said Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell.Amazon suggested that spending indeed was on the way, and with that smaller growth in profit.The company has been building warehouses around the world to ensure its edge in delivering goods to customers the fastest.It is spending more on video, from live sports to a planned prequel series to \u0027The Lord of the Rings,\u0027 to draw more people to log on to its website, watch, and while they are there, buy socks.Hiring will pick up from the 12 per cent increase Amazon posted in the past 12 months, Olsavsky said.And the company is delving into even less familiar terrain. It recently announced investments in self-driving and electric car companies, teasing how it thinks these high-tech, capital-intensive businesses could pay idends potentially in the form of autonomous deliveries in the long run. Amazon has not described in detail its thinking behind the bets.In China, where the company had long struggled to compete with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, Amazon said this month it would close warehouses and its domestic marketplace in July.         Amazon (file image) said that hiring will also pick up from the 12 per cent increase the company posted in the past 12 monthsThere were silver linings for investors, however.Amazon\u0027s Olsavsky said the company saw no material impact in India from actions the company took to comply with new regulations there affecting foreign investment in the e-commerce sector, something Amazon had voiced concern about in the past. Prime member signups in India, one of Amazon\u0027s most important growth markets, continue to be rising the fastest in the company\u0027s history.Bezos, who many regard as a management guru, also settled his closely watched orce such that he will retain full voting control of his family\u0027s stock, sparing Amazon a boardroom battle. However, his fortune, which has been the largest of any married couple in the world, will be ided.The company forecast net sales of between $59.5billion and $63.5billion for the second quarter, the midpoint of which was below analysts\u0027 average estimate of $62.37billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/04/22/22/12586152-0-image-m-12_1555967503728.jpg","title":"Vauxhall recalls thousands Zafira people carriers","story":"Share this article Vauxhall, who were investigating 161 Zafira B fires, called back 234,000 models in two separate recalls due to rising safety concerns. The company wrote to 234,000 owners in December 2015 to ask them to arrange for their car\u0027s heating and ventilation system to be inspected by a local dealer.The initial recall came following reports of nearly 200 of the model bursting into flames.        The British carmaker has been forced into a third recall of the Zafira B range (stock photo) after at least one vehicle reportedly exploded due to overheatingSubsequently all Zafira B owners were offered a free safety inspection in light of the fires. A report by the Commons Transport Select Committee in April 2017 accused Vauxhall of showing a \u0027reckless disregard for safety\u0027 by not stopping motorists driving Zafira B vehicles it knew were a fire risk.The manufacturer was too slow to begin a full investigation, according to the cross-party committee. Vauxhall was also accused of acting prematurely in attributing the problem to improper repairs by third parties, according to the cross-party committee. Concerns that there was a distinctive pattern of fires were first raised within Vauxhall in 2014, but it did not begin an investigation until August 2015. Vauxhall recalls 235,000 Zafira B models for a THIRD time over blaze fears"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/04/26/08/0EE33FA800000578-0-image-m-12_1556263496730.jpg","title":"Collection 110 vintage muscle cars revealed Iowa ahead auction","story":"Share this article According to the Des Moines Register, most of the cars haven\u0027t been moved in years, but there is little rust to be found.It\u0027s unclear what type of functionality the cars have and that can\u0027t be determined until they are removed from the sheds and prepared for auction. Johnson told the Register that he knew it was time to sell his beloved collection. \u0027There\u0027s always a time for everything.

He became serious and withdrawn and would not even smile at anyone he didn\u0027t know, let alone laugh.\u0027Mohamed tried to blow up the luxury Taj Samudra hotel in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo on Easter Sunday.But he is believed to have botched his attempt to detonate his bomb at the five-star hotel and is thought to have blown himself up by accident at a much smaller guest house.UK counter-terrorism investigators believe he attended Kingston University in south-west London from 2006-07.British investigators are searching for any associates or signs of extremist activity during his time in the UK.

Before he died he would not let his children listen to music and he never said a friendly word to anyone.\u0027Even as a child he was always devout, she added, but had \u0027never taken it too far\u0027.

So I just stopped speaking to him because it got to the point where it was getting out of hand.\u0027Although Mohamed lived round the corner, the siblings avoided each other.

As a result, the trained aeronautical engineer did not need to work.\u0027Before he died he was selling the family home,\u0027 Mrs Hidaya said. \u0027He obviously needed a sum of money.\u0027But he never wanted for anything in his life.

Like Ms McLean, she will still be able to stand in the election but if she wins she will have to sit as an independent.Euan Philipps, spokesperson for Labour Against Anti-Semitism, welcomed the suspension but criticised the fact that the other two had been let off – saying that was not ‘zero tolerance’.He said: ‘Once again, we find Labour Party candidates reportedly holding anti-Semitic views that are totally at odds with the British public.‘They should be nowhere near public office, yet they are standing for election, an apparent sign of the contempt with which Jeremy Corbyn holds the British electorate.‘We have called on Mr Corbyn time and again to root out the racism problem in his party and each time he has seemingly failed to do so.’                           These are some of the bizarre conspiracy theories and views shared that led to Lesley McLean\u0027s suspensionAction was taken against the three candidates following an intervention by the Mail.Lesley McLean, a candidate in North Devon, was suspended after retweeted a series of messages including suggesting Labour MPs were being influenced by the Israeli government.It said: ‘When you look at the direct influence the racist far right wing Israeli Likud government has on some of our politicians in the Labour Party via groups like Labour Friends of Israel and Jewish Labour Movement, is it any wonder these people agitate against the members and leadership using anti-Semitism as a weapon to stifle legitimate criticism of Israel.’She retweeted someone writing: ‘So the Jews get a homeland – they want more, so they take it, and then when anyone says hey that isn\u0027t right, they scream anti-Semitism. So they think Jews are above criticism: above international law?’The candidate retweeted an article saying the media were not reporting how popular socialism is in Venezuela because they were controlled by the Zionists.The tweet read: ‘Yesterday in Venezuela, what the Zionist controlled media doesn’t show are the millions who support the socialist revolution.’Ms McLean also retweeted a Rothschild conspiracy theory. She retweeted someone who had written: ‘The only countries left in 2017 without a central bank owned or controlled by the Rothschild family are Cuba, North Korea, Iran and Syria.’Sam Gorst was handed a ‘notice of investigation’, a lesser punishment which means he could be suspended in future – but only after the local elections.Mr Gorst spoke out in support of Ken Livingstone even after he had spoken of links between Hitler and Zionists, tweeting: ‘Ken must remain defiant throughout this anti-Semitism witch hunt.’In another message, Mr Gorst urged people to join the group Jewish Voice for Labour, which denies the party has an anti-Semitism problem.‘It sickens me that some MPs and corrupt groups are still using anti-Semitism as a political weapon to call out our twice democratically elected leader,’ he wrote.He also retweeted someone who posted an image of barbed wire fences in Germany and Palestine and wrote: ‘I can’t differentiate between Nazism and Zionism as two criminal regimes in this picture.’Cheryl Raynor, a candidate in Wyre in Lancashire, also said she did not agree Labour had an anti-Semitism problem.She accused a Tory councillor of saying she was a Holocaust denier because she had ‘said the media are lying about anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, even when I presented him with the facts.’She also re-tweeted an article headlined: ‘The British-Israel partnership driving anti-Semitism allegations against Jew-as-Zionist’.Last night Ms Raynor was reminded of the conduct expected of Labour candidates – but escaped the threat of suspension.A Labour spokeswoman said: ‘The Labour Party takes all complaints of anti-Semitism extremely seriously and we are committed to challenging and campaigning against it in all its forms.‘All complaints about anti-Semitism are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures and any appropriate disciplinary action is taken.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"Crooked butcher six figure sum selling foreign meat labelled Best British","story":"Share this article          Trading Standards officers became suspicious when a customer discovered a Dutch label underneath a \u0027Best of British\u0027 stamp on a pack of chicken breasts (pictured: Inside the Meat Shack)Deputy Judge Richard Griffith-Jones told him: \u0027You intended to make gains for yourself and consequent losses to others by fraud.\u0027You did it by tricking people into engaging in transactions by pretending that the meat they were to buy was of British origin and had a good animal welfare background.\u0027In addition, legitimate businesses who would have higher overheads, advertising the very same products as you, would lose out.\u0027So you damaged the very lines of commerce that would have the good effect people want.

We agree that what is now needed is actions and not just words from all of us who are in positions of leadership.“We have agreed to establish a new process of political talks, involving all the main political parties in Northern Ireland, together with the UK and Irish Governments, in accordance with the three stranded process. The aim of these talks is quickly to re-establish to full operation the democratic institutions of the BelfastGood Friday Agreement - the NI Executive, Assembly and North-South Ministerial Council - so that they can effectively serve all of the people for the future.“We have asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Tánaiste to meet later today in Belfast to set out our proposed approach and to commence the talks process as soon as possible after the local elections in Northern Ireland. “In addition, we have agreed that there should be a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference during the same period. The Conference will consider EastWest relations, security cooperation, and political stability in Northern Ireland. “We understand the complexity of the underlying concerns of all parties, and the need for renewed trust, mutual respect, generosity and new thinking to resolve the issues.“As Prime Minister and Taoiseach, we are determined to work together to ensure this process comes to a successful conclusion.“We will review progress at the end of May.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3871885.1556222499!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"talks on restoring north powersharing to have three week limit","story":"Fr Martin Magill receives a standing ovation as he asks why it took the death of journalist Lyra McKee to bring politicians from different parties together. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDUP leader Arlene Foster, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald and deputy leader Michelle O’Neill at  funeral service of journalist Lyra McKee at St Annes Cathedral, Belfast. Photograph: Charles McQuillanGetty ImagesNew all-party talks aimed at restoring the Northern Ireland power sharing institutions are to be given a sharp time limit of about three weeks.Tánaiste Simon Coveney and Northern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley are set to announce a fresh round of talks on Friday in an attempt to get Stormont back up and running for the first time since January 2017. The institutions collapsed amid controversy over the Renewable Heat Incentive scheme.The talks will begin the week after the local elections in Northern Ireland, which take place next Thursday, May 2nd. It is understood the precise details have largely been finalised but have yet to be formally signed off between the British and Irish governments.Public pressure has mounted for the restoration of the Stormont Assembly and the power sharing executive since the murder last week of Lyra McKee, the 29-year-old journalist who was shot in Derry by the New IRA. Earlier this week, both Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and British prime minister Theresa May attended Lyra McKee’s funeral, which saw Fr Martin Magill challenge politicians as to why it had taken her death to unite them.In talks early last year to resolve the political impasse, issues such as the Irish language, same sex marriage and dealing with the past prevented the parties reaching an agreement. However, significant progress was made on the key issue blocking a deal, the Irish language, with the DUP and Sinn Féin appearing to have signed up to broad all-embracing legislation addressing the Irish language, Ulster Scots and respecting cultural ersity.However at the time the DUP was unable to sell the deal to its grassroots with the result that these talks collapsed in February 2018.Well-placed sources said the new talks would be informed by the last process but the intention of the negotiations is to “broaden out the discussion” in an attempt to seek an agreement. This, it is argued, would ensure the talks do not exclusively focus on areas which caused previous disagreements.The talks would be “focused” and “time limited” for around “three-ish weeks”. It was also acknowledged by well placed figures that the British and Irish governments will need to “step in” and take a strong role in the talks than may have been the case in the past. Speaking on Thursday, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said her party will not “capitulate” on an Irish language act, adding there was nothing trivial about insisting on equality and rights. DUP leader Arlene Foster repeated her call for Stormont to be restored immediately, with no pre-conditions, and a parallel talks process to deal with issues of disagreement.

Photograph: Brian LawlessEPAThe strong public response to the New IRA murder of Lyra McKee prompted the British and Irish governments after a little hesitation to seize the moment and test whether Northern Ireland politicians can respond in equal measure.Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and the Northern Secretary Karen Bradley, who are meeting at Stormont in east Belfast on Friday afternoon to prepare for these negotiations, hope a deal can be struck sometime after the local elections at the start of May and before the European elections at the end of May.That desire for a short, sharp focused engagement prompted a cynical reaction in several quarters with some saying if the politicians start talking they will still be at it at Christmas – and still no closer to accommodation.Experience says there could be some validity to such pessimism but regardless Dublin and London are right to put it up to the Northern parties to see if they can respond to the public desire for political movement, as clearly demonstrated at Ms McKee’s funeral in Belfast on Wednesday.The governments were particularly encouraged by a pivotal moment at the funeral service when in a homily her friend, Fr Martin Magill commended political leaders for coming together in the Creggan in Derry on Good Friday to demonstrate political unity of purpose against the young journalist’s New IRA killers. Ms McKee was shot dead in the Creggan the previous night.Fr Magill then asked, “Why in God’s name does it take the death of a 29-year-old woman with her whole life in front of her to get us to this point?”These remarks stimulated an impromptu loud and spontaneous standing ovation signalling a deep public wish to see political progress, and some potential good to derive from Ms McKee’s murder – a signal that was not lost on the governments or the Northern parties.But whether they can build on the opportunity is the question. A range of issues are likely to be addressed. They include dealing with the legacy of the Troubles, same sex marriage and reforming how the Northern Executive and its civil service works after, especially, the debacle of the costly and utterly flawed renewable heat incentive scheme.Moreover, the smaller SDLP, Ulster Unionist and Alliance parties will be demanding in the talks that any proposed resolution doesn’t lead to what they viewed as a previous political carve-up of power between the DUP and Sinn Féin.That’s an awful lot to get through in three weeks. But some of these matters could be hived off to special commissions or committees for them to propose solutions in the months ahead while there already is a template for dealing with the past from the December 2014 Stormont House Agreement.The one issue that could unlock real movement is the Irish language. In February last year the DUP and Sinn Féin almost cracked a deal. According to several sources, some from the DUP, they devised a convoluted proposed legislative framework that addressed the Irish language, Ulster Scots and cultural ersity.The problem was Arlene Foster and her senior people could not sell it to their grassroots, and the deal crashed, bringing us to a place where Northern Ireland is now almost two- and-a-half years without a functioning political administration.And as most everyone knows this key matter isn’t just about language but is about a nationalist requirement for the DUP to show “parity of esteem” to Irish and Irishness.There isn’t any huge expectation of a breakthrough – and it could take longer than three weeks — but if Arlene Foster could persuade the majority of unionists to sign up to the Irish language compromise proposal then other matters could fall into place. It would be quite a testament to the memory of Lyra McKee."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3871911.1556222210!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"next conservative leader must believe in brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Jeremy Hunt:   ‘The democratic risk of no Brexit ultimately is higher than the economic risk of no deal.’ Photograph: Daniel  Leal-OlivasAFPGetty ImagesJeremy Hunt, the British foreign secretary, was cheerfully self-deprecating as he addressed a political journalists’ lunch at Westminster on Thursday, taking his audience through his long catalogue of gaffes. These included the time he described his Chinese wife as Japanese, which he said was a result of getting his notes for small talk with China’s foreign minister mixed up.But on his ambition to succeed Theresa May as Conservative leader, he said “wait and see”, suggesting that such speculation was unseemly. “I don’t think it’s the time to be talking about Prime Minister Hunt because we’ve got Prime Minister May,” he said.But he was quick to reject the idea that the next Conservative leader must be someone who had voted for Brexit in 2016, saying that it should be someone who “believes in Brexit”, as he says he does.May promised last month that she would step down in time for a new prime minister to take charge of the next phase of Brexit negotiations. But backbenchers became restless when Downing Street suggested that, since the next stage of the Brexit talks could not begin until the withdrawal agreement was ratified, her departure would have to wait.This week, the backbench 1922 committee rejected a proposal to allow May to face a confidence vote as early as June by changing the rule that made her immune from a challenge for a year after she won a confidence vote last December. But the committee asked the prime minister to outline a clear “road map” for her exit to reassure backbenchers that she was not planning to squat in Downing Street until the end of the year.Hunt is one of a number of ministers whose leadership campaigns are already under way but a Conservative Home poll of party members last week identified Boris Johnson as the runaway favourite. When May announces her resignation, Conservative MPs will choose two candidates to go before the entire party membership in a postal ballot.‘Leave quickly’At least one of the two candidates is likely to be a hard Brexiteer and Johnson’s strongest rival in that lane is former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab. Although Johnson is viewed as unbeatable if he gets on to the ballot, his unpopularity among MPs means that he is not guaranteed to be one of the two candidates.Raab is a less appealing and less well-known candidate who could prove vulnerable if his record is subjected to intense scrutiny. This means that an alternative candidate promising responsible and competent leadership could emerge as the winner.Hunt is the leading candidate of the centre but he knows that he must demonstrate his credentials as a born-again Brexiteer if he is to have any hope of winning over the party membership.“We have to leave, we have to leave quickly, we have to leave cleanly. And I see Brexit as the biggest democratic challenge that we’ve had in our lifetimes. Because the political establishment, myself included, didn’t want Brexit or vote for Brexit. And yet we’ve always been telling people we are one of the oldest and greatest democracies in the world,” he said on Thursday.‘Risk of no Brexit’Hunt said the measure of Brexit’s success will be if Britain’s economy grows faster than those of other European countries over the next 10 years. But he is prepared to countenance leaving the EU without a deal, despite the economic disruption it would cause.“If there was a binary choice between no deal or no Brexit I would choose no deal because I believe the democratic risk of no Brexit ultimately is higher than the economic risk of no deal. But the reality is that this parliament won’t allow no deal and I personally don’t think we should go back to the country and try to get a different parliament until we’ve left Europe, ” he said on Thursday.\u0026nbsp“I’ve always preferred to leave with a deal because I believe there will be disruption without a deal and it’s very difficult to predict exactly what that disruption would be but I think it would potentially be very significant and that’s something that I think anyone sensible would wish to avoid.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Early childhood is a period of rapid physical and cognitive development and a time during which a child\u0027s habits are formed.The recommendations go much further than recent guidance from the UK\u0027s chief medical officers.This recommended a break from screens every two hours for all children.

It\u0027s time to consider a change in approachClick to followThe IndependentHMRC has been given extra resources to tackle non payment of the minimum wage The problem with the welcome war between Labour and the Conservatives over minimum wage rates is that it means nothing if employers ignore them.\u0026nbspAccording to the Low Pay Commission, a record number of people were underpaid last year by those that chose to do just that.\u0026nbspIn a report published just a few weeks after the minimum wage celebrated its 20 year anniversary, it put the number at 439,000\u0026nbspand rising.\u0026nbsp\u0027Worrying\u0027 rise in number of people being paid below minimum wageMinimum wage at 20: Too many employers still trying to get around itTwenty years on, the national minimum wage is a successYounger workers were particularly vulnerable, even though employers are allowed to pay them less. Ditto women. The report tagged childcare as the occupation with the highest proportion of underpaid workers, with hospitality and retail, which similarly employ an unusually high proportion of female workers, also high on the list.\u0026nbspBut hang on a second, I hear you say. Wasn’t HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs (HMRC) given a bunch of extra cash by the Department for Business, Energy \u0026amp Industrial Strategy (BEIS) to bring enforcement actions?\u0026nbspThat is indeed the case, as BEIS was keen to stress in response to the report. And there is evidence that it is having results. HMRC identified an all-time high number of workers as underpaid in the 2017-18 financial year, securing pay rises and arrears for them while also levying fines.\u0026nbspYet the number of cases overall stood still. The figures were driven by a relatively small number of big cases.\u0026nbspWhat this tells you is that HMRC is deploying its resources where it can get the most bang for its buck.\u0026nbspAn eminently sensible policy given that its budget is not unlimited, even after the increases it has enjoyed and the complexities and expense involved in investigating underpayment – and bringing miscreant employers to book.The trouble is that this is inevitably going to lead to a long tail of often smaller employers that are cheating the system and may justifiably feel there is little risk to them in doing so.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Sometimes it can be as simple as delaying the introduction of new rates. Sometimes it’s a lot worse than that.\u0026nbspHelpfully the commission, which also advises on the rates themselves, has some sensible ideas for addressing the issue, which can be summarised as calling for a more holistic approach.\u0026nbspAs part of this, it wants to see more investment in communicating with workers, and employers, together with efforts to build confidence in complaints processes, and to help workers to use them.\u0026nbspIt would also like government to work more closely with unions, which obviously have considerable expertise in this area through the work they do for low paid members and could provide a great deal of assistance.\u0026nbspCheating the minimum wage not only cheats workers. It cheats the competitors of businesses that fail to pay it by disadvantaging them.\u0026nbspIn treating unions as the enemy, as the Conservative government is frequently guilty of doing, it risks undermining the success of one of its flagship policies.

The new owners include Barclays and Bank of Ireland, as well as US investment firms.It first put forward proposals in October to shut 50 stores over three years as it bids to cut costs.

A creditor vote\u0026nbspwill take place on 9 May.KPMG, which is handling the CVA, said consultations had\u0026nbspalready taken place with key creditors with further talks planned\u0026nbspto ensure the full details of the proposal are understood.Suppliers\u0026nbspwill continue to be paid “on time and in full, and terms of employment are not impacted”, KPMG said.A key part of rescue plans for the retailer is to slash its rent bill by closing stores and renegotiating leases with landlords.Leases will be retained at current rents for 39 stores, with the 22 stores earmarked for closure seeking rent reductions of 50 per cent until next year. The remaining stores will pay 25 to 50 per cent less rent under the plans.High costs and large debts have made it difficult for\u0026nbspDebenhams\u0026nbspto invest as it attempts to deal with the threat posed by changing consumer habits and the rise of online giants such as Amazon.Last week, Debenhams chief executive Sergio Boucher quit\u0026nbspafter two difficult years in charge.\u0026nbspHe had faced fierce attacks from Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley, who was seeking to take over at Debenhams and described the administration as a “national scandal”.Mr Ashley’s company owned a 30 per cent stake in Debenhams\u0026nbspbut all shareholders were wiped out as part of the administration process.The stores to close in 2020:Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Welcome steps have been taken in that direction, but this work shows more needs to be done.”A government spokesperson said: “It is illegal not to pay the minimum wage and we are cracking down on employers who fail to pay the national minimum wage and national living wage.“We have almost doubled HMRC’s budget to £26.3m since 2015, ensuring it has the resources needed to investigate employers who break these rules.“HMRC has collected £15.6m of underpayment for over 200,000 workers and issued £14.1m\u0026nbspin financial penalties to employers that breached the rules – the highest amount ever.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The new owners include Barclays and Bank of Ireland, as well as US investment firms.It first put forward proposals in October to shut 50 stores over three years as it bids to cut costs. More detailed plans have now been formally laid out and will be put to creditors, 75 per cent of whom must approve before they can go ahead.Terry\u0026nbspDuddy,\u0026nbspDebenhams\u0026nbspexecutive chairman said: “Debenhams has a clear strategy and a bright future, but in order for the business to prosper, we need to restructure the group’s store portfolio and its balance sheet, which are not appropriate for today’s much changed retail environment.Created with Sketch.

A creditor vote\u0026nbspwill take place on 9 May.KPMG, which is handling the CVA, said consultations had\u0026nbspalready taken place with key creditors with further talks planned\u0026nbspto ensure the full details of the proposal are understood.Suppliers\u0026nbspwill continue to be paid “on time and in full, and terms of employment are not impacted”, KPMG said.A key part of rescue plans for the retailer is to slash its rent bill by closing stores and renegotiating leases with landlords.Leases will be retained at current rents for 39 stores, with the 22 stores earmarked for closure seeking rent reductions of 50 per cent until next year. The remaining stores will pay 25 to 50 per cent less rent under the plans.High costs and large debts have made it difficult for\u0026nbspDebenhams\u0026nbspto invest as it attempts to deal with the threat posed by changing consumer habits and the rise of online giants such as Amazon.Last week, Debenhams chief executive Sergio Boucher quit\u0026nbspafter two difficult years in charge.\u0026nbspHe had faced fierce attacks from Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley, who was seeking to take over at Debenhams and described the administration as a “national scandal”.Mr Ashley’s company owned a 30 per cent stake in Debenhams\u0026nbspbut all shareholders were wiped out as part of the administration process.The stores to close in 2020:Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Whishaw stepped in as Q for those same two films, which also saw Harris make her debut as Eve Moneypenny.Richard Madden’s Bodyguard future ‘depends on what happens with Bond’ Bohemian Rhapsody Oscar-winner Rami Malek has finally been confirmed to appear after months of rumours. He confirmed he’ll be playing the film’s villain.Speaking about his appointment, Malek said: “I am very much looking forward to joining the cast and crew very soon. I will be making sure that Bond does not have an easy ride on his 25th outing, I can’t wait to see you all soon.”Malek\u0026nbsphad previously said in response to the rumours: “We’ll have to see about that. It would be nice to play a villain, that would be another dream role for me, I’ve got to play so many great ones so far so who knows. I’m keeping tight-lipped.”Magnussen is\u0026nbsprumoured to be playing a CIA operative that crosses paths with Bond.\u0026nbspThe film has an official working title. Subscribers to\u0026nbspProduction Weekly\u0026nbspnoticed in a new update listing that the next 007 outing will shoot under the title\u0026nbspShatterhand , but there is no indication whether this will be the final title for the film.\u0026nbsp“Shatterhand” is the alias used by Blofeld – who was played in the last Bond film,\u0026nbspSpectre,\u0026nbspby Christoph Waltz – in the\u0026nbspYou Only Live Twice\u0026nbspnovel.Idris Elba jokes about James Bond rumours on red carpetReports suggest that the film would be based on the 2001 novel Never Dream of Dying by Raymond Benson. The story sees Bond start a relationship with Tylyn Mignonne, a film star whose husband is connected to The Union, a recurring crime organisation within the 007 novel series.Fukunaga confirmed the story will bring things full circle for Craig by continuing the arc first presented in Casino Royale, his first outing as 007.Created with Sketch.

Léa Seydoux has been a household name in France for over a decade now, ever since 2008’s La Belle Personne earned the then-23-year-old a César nomination (essentially the French equivalent of an Oscar) for Most Promising Actress. She lived up to that promise – but it took a few more years for English-speaking audiences to catch on. Now, as she prepares to reprise her role as Bond girl Madeleine Swann\u0026nbspin the next 007 film, she’s become a major Hollywood player.Born in Paris, the daughter of a businessman and a philanthropist, Léa Hélène Seydoux-Fornier de Clausonne – who wisely shortened her name to Léa Seydoux – started out in music videos and short films before landing her starring role as a beguiling schoolgirl in La Belle Personne. From there, she had small parts in two English-language blockbusters: Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, in which she played cool assassin Sabine Moreau, and Quentin Tarantino’s Inglourious Basterds (2009).But it was in 2013, when she starred in the brilliant, beguiling Blue Is the Warmest Colour alongside Adèle Exarchopoulos, that Seydoux’s star ascended worldwide. Since then, she has appeared in Wes Anderson’s The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014), Yorgos Lanthimos’s The Lobster (2015), Xavier Dolan’s It’s Only the End of the World (2016), and – of course – the 2015 James Bond film Spectre. It’s rare for a Bond girl to return for a second film, but Seydoux is a rare kind of actor. Here are her five most essential roles.Director Christophe Honoré was inspired to make this film after then French president Nicolas Sarkozy mocked its source material, the 17th-century novel La Princesse de Clèves, declaring it irrelevant to modern life. Honoré transported his version into the modern day, casting the unknown Seydoux as a schoolgirl who embarks on an affair with her Italian teacher.

She signed onto the film before she’d even read the script, having admired Lanthimos’s 2009 film Dogtooth. “I like working with directors who have their own universe,” she said at the time. “For me, cinema’s like a language – everyone has their own form of it.”Set in the fictional war-torn European country Zubrowka, The Grand Budapest Hotel is a star-studded ensemble comedy from the weird, whacky mind of Wes Anderson. Alongside the likes of Ralph Fiennes, Willem Dafoe, Bill Murray, Saoirse Ronan and Tilda Swinton, Seydoux plays a hotel maid, and makes the most of her scant scenes. Though the film was a critical and commercial success, fans of Seydoux will have been rightly hoping for a little more screen time.\u0026nbspBlue is the Warmest Colour (2013)Both Seydoux, as blue-haired, bohemian art student Emma, and Adèle Exarchopoulos, as the shy schoolgirl who falls in love with her, are so convincing and compelling in their roles here that something unprecedented happened upon its release. When the film won the Palme d’Or at Cannes, the film festival’s jury – which included Steven Spielberg –insisted that the two stars receive the award alongside director Abdellatif Kechiche. The film has seen its fair share of controversy – Julie Maroh, who wrote the graphic novel on which it was based, criticised its “brutal and surgical display, exuberant and cold, of so-called lesbian sex, which turned into porn”. Seydoux, meanwhile, referred to Kechiche’s gruelling approach to filming the sex scenes, as “humiliating”, saying, “I was feeling like a prostitute. Of course, he uses that sometimes. He was using three cameras, and when you have to fake your orgasm for six hours... I can’t say that it was nothing.” But her performance in the film – subtle and serene one moment, furious and untethered the next – is undeniably brilliant.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Welcome steps have been taken in that direction, but this work shows more needs to be done.”A government spokesperson said: “It is illegal not to pay the minimum wage and we are cracking down on employers who fail to pay the national minimum wage and national living wage.“We have almost doubled HMRC’s budget to £26.3m since 2015, ensuring it has the resources needed to investigate employers who break these rules.“HMRC has collected £15.6m of underpayment for over 200,000 workers and issued £14.1m\u0026nbspin financial penalties to employers that breached the rules – the highest amount ever.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He went to get Supermalt, he was on his way back, and he was just dancing to this song. But it was just so infectious, and such a genuine joyous moment that for whatever reason, I went studio a couple weeks later, and I made this song called \u0027Vossi Bop.\u0027 But this is like three years ago, 2016 I made this song. Or 2015.And yeah, I just had the spirit of Vossi in me, and I was just like ... Yeah, it was very like, now that I think back on it, it just felt very from God, and very natural. Like yeah, this is my vibe right now. I think it just embodies everything that I\u0027m about. The confidence, the humour, the style, the flair, the anarchy, the chaos, just the vibe.

We need to determine who’s doing it, where it’s coming from and what their intent is. We need to try to find ways to prevent it from happening again.”UFOs spotted by pilots off Ireland coastHe told the paper that the military would now commit to investigating every report.The major change in policy from the US Navy comes after official reports were released which showed UFOs being chased by pilots, and detailed strange materials recovered by the Pentagon that officials say they do not recognise.Pilots have described seeing white and strangely shaped vehicles that appear to be propelled without air intakes or exhausts, and no obvious ways of flying through the air.But those same pilots – despite often having training in engineering – are said to be afraid of reporting the strange sightings. They are scared of speaking up because they may damage their careers, and there is often little interest in investigating the claims.The change of policy will allow pilots to report them and make sure they are passed on to the relevant authorities, the Navy said.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The first phase will run from Paddington to Abbey Wood.But even when the\u0026nbspproject’s central section\u0026nbspdoes open, which could be as late as March 2021, trains will not stop at Bond Street because of design and delivery challenges, executives said.Crossrail Ltd, part of Transport for London (TfL), insisted that the full line would be operational as soon as possible\u0026nbspafter that.The company said on Thursday that\u0026nbspfour major elements of the project were still not finished: writing and testing software to allow trains to communicate with signalling systems installing vital station systems installing the equipment in the tunnels and test-driving the new trains.Elizabeth Line trains will begin running in October next year at the earliest, it said.

The wood has since rotted away giving the appearance of a slumped and distorted mass grave, according to experts.Archaeologists have called the Bedlam burial ground London\u0027s most valuable 16th and 17th Century cemetery site since excavation began earlier this year, and have already uncovered over 3,500 skeletons.The burial ground was in use from 1569 to at least 1738, ning numerous plague outbreaks, and the recent excavation suggests around 30,000 Londoners were buried there during this period.The site, also known as the New Churchyard, is located at the western end of Liverpool Street and was named after the Bethlehem Hospital which housed the mentally ill, though only a small number of Bedlam patients are thought to have been buried on the grounds.Excavators have discovered a mass grave thought to contain 30 victims of The Great Plague of 1665.Osteologists from the Museum of London Archeology (MOLA) will now analyse the skeletons and carry out scientific testing to determine whether the cause of death was the bubonic plague or some other pestilence.The skeletons are understood to have been buried in thin wooden coffins.

The public accounts committee lambasted Mr Grayling’s team for continual shortcomings\u0026nbspand said the project had been afflicted by\u0026nbspan overriding culture of over-optimism”.Earlier this month, MPs said it was unacceptable that DfT and Crossrail had not identified root causes of delays and cost increases, and demanded to know what consequences officials had faced for the string of failings.Crossrail’s\u0026nbsporiginal budget was £15bn, but it is thought to have run over by £3bn so far. The company said it had now developed\u0026nbspa robust and realistic plan\u0026nbspthat took full account of exactly what was to be done and how long it would take.Its chairman, Tony Meggs, said in a statement: “An enhanced governance structure has been put in place to strengthen the Crossrail programme.“We will be open and transparent about our progress and will be providing Londoners and London businesses with regular updates as we seek to rebuild trust with all our stakeholders.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He backed Remain in 2016 but has since emphasised the need to deliver Brexit and often sided with Eurosceptic colleagues in cabinet.Asked if he would be willing as prime minister to take Britain out of the EU without a deal, the foreign secretary told a Westminster lunch: If there was a binary choice between no deal or no Brexit I would choose no deal because I think the democratic risk of no Brexit ultimately is higher than the economic risk of no deal.Tory MPs’ latest bid to topple Theresa May failsHe said he did not believe parliament would allow a no-deal exit, however, and added: I would always prefer to leave with a deal because I think there would be disruption without a deal and it\u0027s very difficult to predict exactly what that disruption would be, but it would potentially be very significant.He added: But I\u0027ve never thought that in the end we couldn\u0027t make a success as a country of whatever circumstances we\u0027re in.Mr Hunt said the UK\u0027s international allies believed the UK would succeed after Brexit but were worried about the destruction of not being able to make a decision.He said: As far as Brexit\u0027s concerned, my view is very straightforward: we have to leave, we have to leave quickly, we have to leave cleanly.I see Brexit as the biggest democratic challenge that we\u0027ve had in our lifetimes because the political establishment, myself included, didn\u0027t want Brexit or vote for Brexit.We\u0027ve always been telling people that we are one of the oldest and greatest democracies in the world and it\u0027s as if people have been looking at us and saying we will test that by asking you guys to do something that you don\u0027t want to do.It\u0027s absolutely essential that we pass that test and then make a success of Brexit at the other side.Created with Sketch.Who could succeed Theresa May as Conservative leader?

The ill-fated eco subsidy scheme left the administration facing a potential £500m overspend and the late Sinn Fein deputy first minister Martin McGuinness quit the executive - a move that pulled the executive down - in protest at the DUP\u0027s handling of the furore. A lengthy public inquiry into the flawed energy scheme ended at the end of last year. However, one of the biggest sticking points is now the stand-off over the establishment of an Irish language act.Are there other issues iding the parties?Yes, Sinn Fein and the DUP are at odds over the region\u0027s ongoing ban on same sex marriage. The pro-Brexit DUP and pro-Remain Sinn Fein have very different takes on the UK\u0027s exit from the EU as well. Stalled mechanisms to deal with the legacy of the Troubles is another source of contention. But there is a growing view that none of these would, in themselves, prevent an executive being formed. It seemingly all hinges on the Irish language, which is a key Sinn Fein demand.What has been the impact on the public services in Northern Ireland?The health and education sectors, among many other government departments, have suffered financially since the collapse of Stormont. Representatives from nurseries, primary schools and secondary schools have raised major concerns over budget cuts. Staff from schools have highlighted the issues over the shortfall in Northern Ireland\u0027s education budget to MPs. Staff have said they are at breaking point because of the challenges. The health sector also continues to suffer with growing waiting lists and staff shortages. Health professionals have complained about the waiting lists - the highest in the UK - but without a minister to address questions it\u0027s difficult to get a clear picture of the extent of the problem as well as addressing it.How did previous talks end?Despite a number of efforts to reconcile the two largest parties, talks have ended in failure. The last talks process to restore devolved government broke down on Valentine\u0027s Day 2018 after the two parties clashed on what had actually been agreed. In the last round of talks, Nothern Ireland secretary\u0026nbspKaren Bradley cut MLAs wages to put pressure on politicians. In February this year,\u0026nbspBradley initiated discussions between the main parties, however that too ended without any consensus on the outstanding issues.What is the latest round of talks about and why now?The fresh round of talks comes after several political parties wrote to Bradley in the wake of the murder of journalist Lyra McKee in Derry. The DUP says it wants to see the Northern Ireland Assembly up and running immediately, and has called for a time-limited process to deal with outstanding issues. This idea, however, was rejected by Sinn Fein in September 2017. Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald this week said that her party will not capitulate on an Irish language act for Northern Ireland in a bid to resolve the political impasse. The all-party discussions are expected to start after next week\u0027s council elections.An agreement has been reached to establish a new round of talks involving all the main political parties in Northern Ireland, Theresa May and Leo Varadkar have announced:In a joint statement, the British and Irish premiers said they hoped the negotiations would quickly re-establish to full operation the democratic institutions of the BelfastGood Friday Agreement.They said:In coming together with other political leaders in St Anne\u0027s Cathedral to pay tribute to Lyra McKee, we gave expression to the clear will and determination of all of the people of these islands to reject violence and to support peace and a better future for everyone in Northern Ireland.We also heard the unmistakable message to all political leaders that people across Northern Ireland want to see a new momentum for political progress. We agree that what is now needed is actions and not just words from all of us who are in positions of leadership.We have agreed to establish a new process of political talks, involving all the main political parties in Northern Ireland, together with the UK and Irish Governments, in accordance with the three stranded process. The aim of these talks is quickly to re-establish to full operation the democratic institutions of the BelfastGood Friday Agreement - the NI Executive, Assembly and North-South Ministerial Council - so that they can effectively serve all of the people for the future.We have asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Tanaiste to meet later today in Belfast to set out our proposed approach and to commence the talks process as soon as possible after the local elections in Northern Ireland.In addition, we have agreed that there should be a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference during the same period. The Conference will consider EastWest relations, security cooperation, and political stability in Northern Ireland.We understand the complexity of the underlying concerns of all parties, and the need for renewed trust, mutual respect, generosity and new thinking to resolve the issues.May and\u0026nbspVaradkar said they would review the progress of talks at the end of May.The British and Irish governments are due to make an announcement this afternoon about a fresh bid to restore Stormont powersharing.It is expected talks could take place after local council elections in Northern Ireland on 2 May.Northern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley and Irish Minister foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney are set to hold a press conference today in Belfast.Speaking in Derry, Bradley told the BBC: I think we need to make sure that politicians come together and do the right thing - do the right thing for the people of Northern Ireland and get back into government.Coveney told Irish broadcaster RTE: I think both governments know they have a responsibility to work together to give both leadership and structure to help parties find a way of re-establishing a functioning Stormont and we will have more to say on this this afternoon.Sinn Fein has rejected DUP leader Arlene Foster\u0027s latest offer to break the political impasse in Northern Ireland.Foster wants a twin-track approach where the devolved institutions are restored quickly to deal with issues like running the health service, while a separate process addresses disagreements like that over same-sex marriage.Sinn Fein deputy leader Michelle O\u0027Neill has rejected that and said issues like marriage equality and protection for the Irish language need to be delivered to pave the way for restoration of the devolved institutions.A Downing Street spokeswoman said the government hoped to bring the parties back together for talks as soon as possible.She added: It\u0027s more important than ever now that Northern Ireland has strong political leadership and we hope we\u0027ll be able to bring the parties back together for talks as soon as possible.On Wednesday Catholic peacemaking priest Father Martin Magill challenged politicians as to why it had taken the death of 29-year-old Lyra McKee to unite them,\u0026nbspat her funeral.Ukip’s leader\u0026nbspGerard Batten\u0026nbsphas thrown his support behind a candidate from rival party Change UK who was criticised by Muslim community groups for her views about Islam, reports The Independent\u0027s Europe correspondent Jon Stone.Nora Mulready’s selection for the European Parliament elections was condemned as a “joke” by racism reporting service Tell MAMA and criticised by the Muslim Council of Britain.But the remain-supporting centrist party has found an unlikely ally in arch-Brexiteer\u0026nbspMr Batten – who himself has been criticised for an alleged “fixation” with Islam.Read the full story:The EU will be eager to be shot of the UK when our fresh crop of MEPs arrive in\u0026nbspBrussels like that\u0026nbspMad Max\u0026nbspbiker gang that crashes the house party in\u0026nbspWeird Science,\u0026nbspenvisages our\u0026nbspsketch writer\u0026nbspTom Peck:Nicola Sturgeon has hinted she will push for a second vote on Scottish independence even if the UK remains\u0026nbsppart of the European Union.The first minister said many people would agree Westminster\u0027s treatment of Scotland during the\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspprocess marked the material change in circumstances that would hand the SNP a mandate for such a referendum.Ms Sturgeon yesterday outlined plans for a\u0026nbspnew vote on Scotland\u0027s place in the UK before the next Holyrood elections in May 2021 if the UK leaves the EU.We can only plan on the basis that the UK is still going to be taken out of the EU -\u0026nbspthat is what the UK government is planning to do, she\u0026nbsptold BBC Radio Scotland this morning.But she added: Many people would say there has been a big material change of circumstances in the way Scotland has been treated over the past few years.The SNP\u0027s 2016 election manifesto made clear another referendum should be held if there was to be a material change in circumstances from the original ballot in 2014.Labour says it will set out its\u0026nbspstall on a second referendum following local elections next month.Responding to criticism of the EU election leaflet, a spokesman said:This is a short pre-manifesto leaflet to introduce our candidates and set out our commitment to Leave and Remain voters to bring our country together.It highlights how the Tories’ chaotic handling of Brexit has left our country in crisis and how our MEPs will fight for proper investment in communities, housing, jobs and industries.Our full manifesto, which will address the issues of a Brexit deal and the circumstances of a referendum, will be published after the local elections.Please allow a moment for this live article to load.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Allies of the former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, have previously briefed that\u0026nbsphe will be sitting this one out. “He believes the prospect of the UK fielding candidates is utterly preposterous,” one told The Times.It is quite extraordinary on one level that the government is avoiding relatively simple questions on an election that is likely to take place in just four weeks’ time.\u0026nbspUnder the current terms of the revised\u0026nbspArticle 50 Brexit negotiating deadline, the UK does not have to take part\u0026nbspin the European elections if a deal is secured in the British parliament by the end of play on 22\u0026nbspMay. However,\u0026nbspif no deal is done, then the British public will be heading to the polls on the following day to elect the next crop of MEPs.\u0026nbspGiven that no agreement in the cross-party talks over Brexit appear imminent, it seems fairly unlikely the prime minister will receive MPs’ backing for a Brexit plan\u0026nbspin just a matter of weeks.Experts have also warned that\u0026nbspeven if Ms May secures approval in principle, she has “no chance” of formally passing her deal\u0026nbspin time to pull the UK out of the elections and to avoid what many speculate will be a devastating set of results for the party.But confusion will reign over the Conservative Party’s strategy for the European parliament election campaign for as long as the prime minister clings to the hope she can win parliamentary approval for\u0026nbspa deal by\u0026nbsp22 May.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

must\u0026nbspregister to vote and also\u0026nbspsign\u0026nbspa special form stating that they are not also voting in any other EU country, known as a “UC1”, by 7 May.But chaos surrounding the date of the UK’s departure from the EU means the form was only sent to 2 million European nationals on the electoral register a few weeks before the deadline – instead of the usual four-month period.A leading organisation, representing EU citizens in the UK, has urged ministers to take immediate action to remedy the situation – or face potential legal action.Roger Casale, secretary general of the New Europeans, said: “Because of the very tight timetable, we would urge the government to allow those EU citizens on the electoral roll, who miss the current 7 May\u0026nbspdeadline, to fill in the required UC1 declaration forms when they arrive at their local polling stations on 23 May.”Created with Sketch.Opposing protesters flock to parliament on would be date of Brexit Show all 30Created

judicial review to ensure that people are able to fully participate in the democratic process.“But if the government does not take rapid remedial action, we will of course have to consider taking legal action.”Maike Bohn, a co-founder of EU citizens group the3million, said they were being treated as “an afterthought” by the government.No-deal Brexit better than staying in EU, Jeremy Hunt saysPolice call to alter ‘outdated’ protest law amid Brexit threats to MPsTory MPs’ latest bid to topple Theresa May failsHunt hits back at French diplomat who said UK influence in US vanishedCould a ‘Brexit bounce’ rescue our struggling economy?She told The Independent: “I find it really disappointing that the UK makes it so hard for EU citizens to register and to kind of blame Brexit.“I just think it is an afterthought and I think it’s very problematic that so many millions of people still have no voice in their home country.”Ms Bohn, a German citizen who has lived in the UK for 25 years, added: “We do become voiceless. In a country where we pay taxes, I do think that’s really problematic.“It also is very telling about how removed the EU is from the mind of British politicians.”The issue was raised in the Commons by Labour MP Catherine West who expressed concern the rule will “disenfranchise” EU citizens as the majority of EU registers are now closed, meaning people will be unable to vote if they don’t register in the UK in time.She said: “These unusual circumstances and the government’s complete lack of action have helped create an artificial barrier to the enfranchisement of EU citizens.\u0026nbsp“We are already hearing reports of a formal legal challenge to the government. Yet another Brexit mistake.”Ms West called for an end to\u0026nbsp“government-sanctioned barriers” to voting and demanded\u0026nbspEU citizens\u0026nbspbe automatically registered if they had signed up to vote in local government elections on 2 May.Cabinet office minister Brandon Lewis defended the plan in the Commons, saying: “It is important that we ensure that everyone is aware of what they can do to make sure they are able to exercise their right to vote, should that opportunity arise.”He added: “It is to ensure EU citizens do not vote twice, both here and in their EU state of origin. Obviously it is illegal to vote twice in the same election.”The row stems from Theresa May’s insistence that Brexit would be delivered on time, which would have seen the UK leave the bloc on 29 March\u0026nbspand removed the need for the UK to send MEPs to Brussels.But parliament repeatedly rejected her Brexit deal, forcing the prime minister to seek a delay to the UK’s departure until October.In reality,\u0026nbspUK participation has been a distinct possibility since December when it became increasingly clear that Ms May might not win parliamentary approval for her deal.But the government insisted on denying that there was any possibility of UK participation and even went as far as refusing to help with contingency planning, according to the\u0026nbsporganisation representing local authority electoral officials​.“We approached civil servants on a number of occasions to discuss key potential European parliament election registration and organisational challenges, but they were unwilling to engage with us on the subject as, in their view, there was not going to be an election in the UK, ” said Laura Lock, deputy chief executive of the Association of Electoral Administrators (AEA).The Electoral Commission gave assurances to a Commons committee in 2014 that\u0026nbspthere would be changes to the system but plans were scrapped after the Brexit vote in 2016.EU citizens, this is what you need to do to safeguard your stayIt told the Political and Constitutional Affairs committee (PACAC) that it would “continue to work with the UK government, electoral registration officers and organisations representing citizens of other EU member states in the UK to identify what can be done to simplify the system and remove unnecessary administrative barriers to participation so that this problem does not affect electors at the next European parliament elections in 2019”.If the government now fails to take remedial action (by substantially extending the UC1 form completion deadline, potentially till polling day), it could lay itself open to legal challenge.David Howarth, professor of law and public policy at the University of Cambridge, believes that the government might face legal action for not having given enough time for EU nationals to complete their UC1 declaration forms.Any challenge “would presumably be based on Article 12 of the 1993 Directive, which requires member states to inform EU nationals of the conditions and detailed arrangements for the exercise of their right to vote ‘in good time’, which the government has plainly failed to do,” he said.“Doing nothing about the situation serves no legitimate purpose – or, if it does serve a legitimate purpose, the interference with the right to vote is so serious that it will be argued that it outweighs that purpose,” said Professor Howarth.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it has repeatedly been observed to behave unexpectedly – the more astronomers find out about it, the more wrong it appears –\u0026nbspin ways that have forced scientists to wonder whether our assumptions about it had been wrong.The new study confirms that speculation, and requires further work to explain how exactly the universe is growing.The research saw Professor Riess and his team analyse light from 70 stars in a galaxy near ours, known as\u0026nbspthe Large\u0026nbspMagellanic\u0026nbspCloud, using\u0026nbspa new method that allowed them to capture the stars quickly. The stars they observed are called\u0026nbspCepheid variables, and change brightness predictably, allowing them to be used to measure intergalactic distances.The new method allowed the researchers to measure many more of those stars far more quickly. Normally, Hubble can only look at one star each time it takes one of its 90-minute orbits around Earth, but the new method allowed it to see dozens in that same time.Using that data, the researchers were able to confirm our understanding of the “cosmic distance ladder”, which allows us to determine distances throughout the universe. And they were able to use the information to calculate the Hubble constant, and see how fast the cosmos is expanding.The more precise that understanding became, the clearer it was that the speed was not in line with what they expected. Scientists have made predictions of the Hubble constant based on data from the\u0026nbspEuropean Space Agency’s Planck satellite, which can\u0026nbspobserve\u0026nbspthe conditions of the early universe just 380,000 years after it came into existence.The two numbers did not match up. That led scientists to think that there must be something missing in their understanding of how the beginning and current universe match up.“This is not just two experiments disagreeing,” Riess explained. “We are measuring something fundamentally different. One is a measurement of how fast the universe is expanding today, as we see it. The other is a prediction based on the physics of the early universe and on measurements of how fast it ought to be expanding.“If these values don’t agree, there becomes a very strong likelihood that we’re missing something in the cosmological model that connects the two eras.”Professor Riess and his team are not able to say why such a difference exists.

just £ or £ so I can buy some food in Iceland, just so my son doesn’t go hungry, she says.Charlottes story is far from unique, with increasing numbers of women turning to sex work to support their families.Last month MPs announced a new inquiry into women turning to prostitution because of Universal Credit - which has been dubbed survival sex by campaigners.And while working families can claim back up to % of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.Thats why The Sun has launched our Make Universal Credit work. We demand the Government makes the following changes to help hard-working famililes before its too late. We want you to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Things have not improved for the former housekeeper, who has been forced to borrow money to pay for furniture and did not have enough cash to celebrate her eight-year-old son’s birthday.“I got my son a little truck for his birthday but that was it, she said. “He was happy to get something as I’ve had to sell the toys he has just to charge the electric and the gas,”Charlotte charges men £ for sex and other favours - bringing in around £ every week. She sees one client whenever she can as she appreciates the “regular” work.In fact, the mum feels so let down by the Government she claims her clients are the only people she can trust.Charlotte, who lives on an estate, had to give up her job when she had her son because she couldnt afford childcare.She moved onto Universal Credit in January  but fell £ behind on her rent while waiting for her first payment and was threatened with eviction.She says: “If I didn’t have to wait so long for my first payment, I would have been OK.“Something always goes wrong - five weeks is too much. I’m still just about managing now.“Winter has been hard, I’ve had to keep the house warm and the lights on, but it’s been so expensive to do.Her sons dad pays nothing towards his upkeep and while she received a £ loan from the government to tide her over when she moved onto Universal Credit last year, she claims she wasn’t told by her local job centre that it would need to be repaid.“That was the final straw when everything changed, and I saw how much debt I was in… the payments and the household bills, it all built up,” she says.Charlotte now receives £-a-month in Universal Credit after her rent has been paid to her landlord and her debts, including the £ furniture loan, are taken off.At one point, after shed paid the rest of her bills, she was left with just £. a day for her and her son to live on.Other women have also claimed that a long wait for their first Universal Credit payment has forced them into sex work.Julie, , from Merseyside told the BBC she had been left “so ashamed” after being forced to turn to sex work after an EIGHT-week wait for her Universal Credit payment.“I didnt go out looking for it, I said no at first ... it wasnt until about three weeks later that I said OK, yeah, because I thought I need to, because I need money’,” she said.Its something I never ever thought I would be ever capable of doing.”Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussell Trust website.Women like Charlotte are often too ashamed to tell their families that they have resorted to prostitution to survive.“I can’t talk to anyone. It’s the guilt mainly. My family don’t know - they wouldn’t be happy. They’d be angry, furious, upset. They would be so judgemental.My son still doesn’t know about what I do for money either.”“And I’m sure there are other women out there in worse situations than me.”Charlotte is struggling with her mental health at the moment and is having therapy for a second time – but she hasn’t admitted what she “does on the side” as she doesn’t think her counsellor would understand.She is considering going to college to do a course as she wants to be an author, but feels things are stacked against her.“I know I’ve got lots to work on, but it’s too much sometimes,” she says.“I keep thinking, why is this happening “They say Universal Credit is working, but who is that for Why are people getting poorer but the government don’t care  Evensomething changes, I can’t erase what I’ve done now.Officials say that advances are available from day one on Universal Credit - and that Brits can get up to  per cent of their cash upfrontthey need it.But delays getting the welfare payments are causing women to rack up debt and some are selling their bodies while they wait for help, charities have said.We know from the stories of women that have contacted us that the delays in processing universal credit and the drop in benefits is financially crippling.It is essential that the vulnerable are protected and their welfare is paramount.”A representative for Beyond The Streets, which works to help women who have suffered sexual exploitation, said: We welcome the investigation in to failures in universal credit and the increase in survival sex.In October, MP Frank Field shocked the House of Commons when he revealed women in his Birkenhead constituency were selling themselves for sex for the first time as a result of hardship caused by the introduction of Universal Credit.After The Sun shared Charlottes story with Mr Field, he said he would write to Department for Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd about her case.Here we have yet another awful example of Universal Credit pushing vulnerable mothers, who are trying to protect their children, to rock bottom and beyond, he told The Sun.The DWP insists safeguards are in place to make sure all repayments are affordable and sustainable.It also aims to give people help to find routes out of the sex industry, with personalised work coaches in place to help people looking for alternative roles.The department insists it has responded quickly to feedback on Universal Credit by continuing to pay Housing Benefit for two weeks after people move on to the new system. Other legacy benefits will follow suit shortly.Ms Rudd has responded to the Suns campaign, saying shes listening to Sun readers as she tries to improve Universal Credit for working families.A DWP spokeswoman told The Sun: We’re committed to getting help to people when they need it most, and advance payments and budgeting support are available.Work coaches are trained to spot vulnerable people, including those working in the sex industry, and offer appropriate support.”*Charlottes name has been changed.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This was not a poll of wider Tory voters but of people who pay an annual subscription to the party.If this group of around , people are not prepared to vote for their own party, then what chance have the Tories in attracting votes from the wider electorate But it gets worse — even elected Tory representatives are planning to rat on their party in the European elections.A Survation poll suggests that four in ten Conservative councillors are planning to back the Brexit Party too.Loyalty, it used to be said, was the Tories’ secret weapon.Not any more.The party has become like an army whose frontline troops have started burrowing beneath enemy lines — not in order to plant explosives beneath its positions, but in the hope of joining it in its trenches.No Conservative leader will find it easy to turn around the situation, but at least a new face, with some new ideas and a fresh perspective on how to solve the Brexit impasse, would have a chance.Anything would be better than being led round and round in circles by a Prime Minister who has become tired and stuck.Every time May comes to the despatch box after some new, devastating vote in the Commons, I find myself thinking: Surely she must have a fresh strategy now.Then I find myself groaning to learn that no, still she seems to think that the answer is to keep on plugging her failed deal.To huge numbers of British people, May has become a large part of the problem.What was once seen as her greatest asset — resilience — is now seen as plain stubbornness.It has become impossible to imagine any satisfactory outcome to Brexit until she is gone.Sadly, I fear that May herself cannot see this.Like John Major in the last, wretched years of his premiership, I fear she has convinced herself that she is an asset to her party and her country when almost everyone  can see that the opposite is true.As with Major in the mid s, every day that May remains in Downing Street is adding to the scale of defeat the party faces at the ballot box.The only dference is that then the beneficiary was the moderate Tony Blair.This time around, an unpopular but stubborn Tory leader is adding rocket fuel to the chances of an unreformed Marxist, Jeremy Corbyn, becoming Prime Minister.I know May is desperate to achieve some sort of legacy before she leaves Downing Street, butshe resists much longer her main achievement will be an indirect one — it will be to let in a Labour government which s Britain to the sort of punitive tax rates which drove a brain drain of iniduals and businesses from the country in the s.It is a great shame that May did not resign last December, when  of her MPs voted against her in a confidence vote.Her margin of victory — she won  per cent of votes — would have constituted a substantial mandate in an open leadership contest.But this was not a leadership contest.It was a no-confidence vote in a sitting Prime Minister, in which anything less than a resounding victory would have been unsatisfactory.Given that more than  Conservative MPs are members of the Government — and were therefore duty bound to support their Prime Minister in a confidence vote — May failed even to carry with her a majority of her backbenchers.And that was before the multiple Commons defeats for her deal, which have led to open rebellion in the Cabinet.Were such a vote to be held now, it is inevitable that many ministers who reluctantly backed her in December would no longer feel they needed to do so.Under the Conservative Party’s rules, May cannot be challenged again in a no-confidence vote for a full  months after the last one. But there are rumblings to change this rule.Graham Brady, Chairman of the  Committee, which represents backbenchers, is reported to be planning to visit May next week to tell her to resign before the end of June.But that won’t be soon enough. Before then, the Tories face twin wipeouts in the local and European elections. The latter may be utterly pointless but nevertheless, a derisory performance is still going to be deeply traumatic when it happens.Theresa May’s ministers have dutully supported her in the past.Her duty is now to step aside immediately, before she accidentally ends up leading her party to an even greater humiliation in a general election than the one it suffered in .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Why kill the innocents ”An obvious question from all right-minded people. But when you’re a murdering psycho, you want to wreak terror not just on those present, but in the minds of millions around the world.And the way they do that is to target innocent people in the normal, everyday scenarios we can all identy with.Attending a church or mosque with family and friends, taking our kids to a concert or a busy shopping mall at the weekend, cheering on marathon runners, queuing for breakfast at a holiday hotel . . .Who among us has not read about Sneha and her friends . . .  or the heartbreaking stories of the British father who lost his we and two children . . . or the Danish man who lost three of his four children . . . and thought of how we would copefaced with the same situation That’s terrorism. It projects fear on to the masses and seeks to make us alter our behaviour accordingly.With every fibre of my being, I want to resist the power of this pernicious tactic, but of late I’ll admit I have struggled.On Friday night, our -year-old attended a Shawn Mendes concert at London’s O arena with a friend and her mother. We wrestled with whether to let her go or not, then felt anxious from the moment she set off until she ed home.Equally, when she expressed a wish to meet her friends at a vast mall last week, we urged her to give it a miss and browse the shops locally. Irrational, yes, but that’s what terrorism can do to your mindsetyou let it.You don’t want to be that grieving family, so you try to minimise the chances of it happening.The truth, of course, is thata suicide bomber decides to board your train carriage, or walk in to your community centre, or drive a car that blows up just as you’re walking past — there’s not a damn thing you can do about it.But what we can do is stand together in our firm belief that these attacks — be it on churches or mosques — have nothing to do with religion.Just hours after the coordinated bombings in his country, the Sri Lankan minister of state for defence said preliminary investigations have shown, “this attack was carried out in retaliation for the attack against Muslims in Christchurch [New Zealand]”.Meanwhile, reports have emerged of young Christian men walking the streets near Sneha’s home of Negombo carrying long sticks and “looking for Muslims”.Again, this us-against-them mindset is what terrorism seeks to inflame.But this isn’t about Christianity versus Islam.The attacks in Sri Lanka, New Zealand, Manchester and London — to name but a few — are the actions of a warped few who have distorted the teachings of wholly peaceful religions to suit their own, murderous ends.We mustn’t allow one drop of poison to contaminate an ocean of humanity.DR GAIL BRADBROOK is the co-founder of Extinction Rebellion, the eco action group that brought central London to a virtual standstill last week.She says: “I think our protests have been awesome.“We’re making history at the minute, people are having a fantastic time on the streets and we really welcome people to come join us.”Yes, I’m sure workers on zero hours contracts would relish the opportunity to lose a day’s payto join her, so too the nurses whose arrival at nearby St Thomas’ hospital each day is critical to the wellbeing of thousands of patients.Dr Bradbrook may have a PhD in molecular biophysics but one fears she and her merry band of protestors may have skipped lessons in common sense.Why  would they glue themselves to public transport that encourages people to leave their cars at home while simultaneously causing air polluting traffic jams And why  would they stage a sit-in aimed to make the politicians take notice when the House of Commons rose on April  for recess and didn’tuntil yesterday  Duh.The majority of the population supports action on climate change, but this virtue-signalling nonsense only detracts from the cause by irritating ordinary people just tryingto earn a living. Begging the question: Why only now HOLLYWOOD star Anne Hathaway says she’s giving up alcohol until her son is .She’s a stronger woman than me.Meanwhile, she has also abandoned veganism after admitting that she “just didn’t feel good or healthy”. She says she immediately felt betterafter eating a fish dish from Iceland.I know what you’re thinking . . . was it the £ prawn ring as advertised by Kerry Katona No, Anne’s le-changing fish experience was a sustainably sourced salmon at a Michelin-starred restaurant in Reykjavik.Easy mistake to make though.“HEALTH tourism” is still an ongoing issue, with reports that ten people a day are jetting to the UK to have their babies delivered on the NHS.The bill for caring for , foreign maternity cases was around £.million in  , with only £.million of it clawed back.Meanwhile, three-year-old Victoria Komada, from Norwich, was born with twisted legs and faced a double amputation.And thanks only to the generosity of the local community in Norwich and those in Poland’s Szczecin, where her parents grew up, £, was raised for her to fly toFlorida for an operation to help her walk. Each week we see the plight of desperate people trying to raise money for treatments the NHS won’t fund.Just think of how many of them that unrecouped £.million might have helped.Some days, it feels like we in the UK have  of them.CERTAIN IVF clinics are exploiting older women whose chances of having a baby are very poor, the fertility regulator has warned.Since , the number of -plus women having IVF has doubled, with some clinics “trading on hope” despite a success rate of just one per cent for a woman of  using her own eggs.A spokeswoman for the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authoritysaid she would like these clinics to be honest about the low statistics.She’s right, but one suspects the number of older women opting for IVF will remain high.Because when you’re desperate for a child, even in a fertility lottery of just one per cent, there still lies the hope that it could be you.Fast forward years and they’re still performing though, despite a healthy diet and regular exercise, the batteries are running noticeably lower. Particularly as there’s now only three of them on stage.Howard,  this weekend, is a former breakdancer and perhaps the fittest of them all.But while his body is making all the right moves, his face is positively screaming: “Is there much more of this  Line Of Duty’s on in a minute.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

When I called the ambulance, the paramedics couldn’t believe he had been allowed home in that state.If I hadn’t have called for help that morning, he’d be dead.’Mark, who has been suffering with hernias for more than ten years, has had numerous operations to repair them in the past and also had to have a testicle removed due to an error during one operation.The dad has been passed from doctor to doctor and was told by one to lose weight - but nothing close to the seven stone he has lost without even trying.Maria said: “It really affects Mark because people are always staring at him.He regularly gets strange looks and negative comments too, which is upsetting – mainly about him being pregnant and asking when’s it due.“He wore his coat most of last summer to cover his bump, even though it was boiling hot. It’s not right.A hernia occurs when an internal part of the body pushes through a weakness in the muscle or surrounding tissue wall.It usually develops between your chest and hips.In many cases, it causes no or very few symptoms, although you may notice a swelling or lump in your tummyor groin.The lump can often be pushed back in or disappears when you lie down.Coughing or straining may make the lump appear.There are several dferent types of hernias inguinal femoral umbilical hiatus and other less common types.See your GPyou think you have a hernia. They may refer you to hospital for surgical treatment,necessary.You should go the accident and emergency  department of your nearest hospital immediatelyyou have a hernia and you develop any of the following symptoms:These symptoms could mean the hernia has started to cut off blood supply to an organ or surrounding tissue, or a piece of the bowel has entered the hernia.Source: NHS I have to buy him the baggiest jumpers I can find and even those don’t go over his bump properly.“It also affects our children. Mark can’t physically pick up the youngest or be active with any of them.“Mark used to love swimming with the kids, but he had to stop last year.There’s no way he can physically swim anymore and evenhe could, he would be too embarrassed for people to see his hernias at the pool.“He gets unwell and weak just walking across the living room and the hernias cause him a pain very similar to contractions in labour.He can be walking down the street and have to stop while his hernias cramp up.The couple’s children, aged , , , , five and two, worry about their father’s health.Maria said: “Our youngest child wakes up in the night panicking about his daddy and he is always asking where he is andhe’s okay.“It makes me sad that all of our kids have to see their dad as a frail -year-old man.They see him fighting for his le, see him being rushed to hospital and see the ambulances that come and go.They don’t knoweach day will be the last they will see him. Mark turns  this month but there is no way we can celebrate when he’s so unwell.”Mark, who has to take strong painkillers including morphine every day, has been ruled unfit to work.He said: “All I want is for this to be dealt with so I can get on with my le and work again, so I can give my we and children what they deserve - they are feeling this just as much as myself.Back in January , Mark had to have a hernia repaired in his stomach but unfortunately by May it had ed.He was referred back to a consultant and eventually seen in October, only to be told it was too complicated and he would have to be referred to someone .In April , Mark saw another doctor who told him the surgery for his hernia would be extremely dangerous.Mark said: “That’s when I was advised to lose kg and was told the doctor would see me again in  weeks.During this time two more hernias appeared and my stomach became very large.”In January this year, Mark still hadn’t heard anything, so he contacted his doctor’s secretary only to be told his doctor hadn’t been working for months and it was uncertain when he would be ing,at all.“I was then forgotten to be referred to someone,” said Mark.“In the meantime I lost seven stone in less than  months because I struggle to eat and can’t keep food down when I do.”Mark has previously worn a hernia belt to try and hold the hernias in, but it now falls off him because of his signicant weight loss.Last week, he received a letter with an appointment to see another consultant next month, to discuss the best course of action with regards to an operation.Mark said: “I just really want all this to be dealt with so I can get on with my le and so we can be a normal family again.I want to feel like myself again instead of feeling abnormal.This has gone on for far too long.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ac-comp-columnist-james-glancy-no-head.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"james glancy brexit party voters feel ignored","story":"But our greatest asset — our free and tolerant democracy — is under threat.The failure of our politicians to listen to the people — and their complete lack of leadership — has compelled me to take a stand.I am standing for the Brexit Party on the single issue of democracy. We have assembled a erse group of candidates from across the political spectrum, from former Tory Ann Widdecombe to left-wing grandee Claire Fox.We are all unied in our desire to pressure Westminster to deliver what the people instructed.It is vital we restore parliamentary democracy. Through my service with the Royal Marines and the Special Boat Service, I witnessed the Arab Spring first-hand and saw the horrors suffered by a people with no representation in their political system.I never thought our political class would deliberately undermine the people.But they have done so by failing to deliver on the  referendum. This after the  General Election manestos of the Conservative and Labour parties clearly pledged to honour the result.Voters on all sides have been betrayed. The final straw for me was seeing the men who sent me to a questionable war in Afghanistan — Tony Blair, Lord Adonis and Alastair Campbell — conspiring to undermine the people.They have been colluding with other governments in Europe to stop Brexit.It is vital we stand up against the damage this hardcore group who want to create an EU super-state are inflicting on British democracy.It is deeply saddening to see the isions across our country. People voted to Remain and Leave for a range of legitimate reasons.We are in this position due to John Major and Tony Blair’s arrogance in not consulting thepeople on the treaties that embedded us in the EU — Maastricht, Amsterdam, Nice and Lisbon.The public should have been consulted on these major transfers of power from Parliament towards the supranational structures of the EU.We are now left with this political mess as their legacy.One of the greatest testaments to Britain is that so many people are willing to take huge risks to come and live here, to be free and prosperous.My ancestors came to the UK from Ireland in the th century to escape famine and persecution. They settled in Greenock in the Scottish Lowlands.I am deeply disturbed that Brexit has now come to focus on identity and immigration, instead of on democracy and who runs our country.We should celebrate immigrants as the heroes who want to be British and part of the national ­success story. Brexit is not a right-wing project. Five million Labour voters and a third of ethnic-minority voters backed Leave.Yet from some of the rhetoric spouted, you would think that Brexit voters are all ignorant racists.  The result is that the Leave voters feel patronised, insulted and ignored. Look at the  Labour MPs — many of whom represent Leave-voting constituencies — who voted for a second referendum to overturn the first.The contempt they show for the ordinary people who put their faith in the democratic process is breathtaking.If politicians fail to deliver the result of the referendum, they will be guilty of selling out the people and undermining Britain’s international credibility as a stable and free liberal democracy.The backlash from the public would be unthinkable.Beyond Brexit, I see an opportunity to implement the strongest animal welfare and environmental legislation in the world. It is a chance to reset our relationship with nature, away from the Common Agricultural Policy.I strongly disagree with those who want to weaken environmental policy.Yet the beauty of an accountable liberal democracy is that those decisions can be made in our own Parliament.A vote for the Brexit Party will send shockwaves across Westminster, reminding them that the people are in charge.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

and a heavily militarised border exists between the two countries.Putin said he welcomed Kims efforts to normalise relations with the US - and said there is lots to do to develop trade ties between Russia and North Korea.But Kim then accused the US of acting in bad faith during the summit earlier this year with Donald Trump, according to the Korean Central News Agency.He also said peace in the Korean peninsula would depend entirely on Washington.Russian media had reported that Kim would be visiting the citys aquarium and seeing a ballet, however his visit was cut short - and its unclear why.KCNA reported that President Putin had accepted an invitation to visit North Korea.The visit would take place at a convenient time, the news agency added.During the meeting, Kim Jong-un reportedly told Vladimir Putin that Kim - whos previously been likened to American rapper, Fat Joe - headed back to North Korea on his train today.But German firm Daimler claims it has no idea how the leader got hold of two of their luxury limos he used when he arrived in Russia.Spokeswoman Silke Mockert said in a written response: We have absolutely no idea how those vehicles were delivered to North Korea.For Daimler, the correct export of products in conformance with the law is a fundamental principle of responsible entrepreneurial activity.The sale of luxury goods to North Korea, including limousines, is banned under U.N. sanctions, which are intended to put pressure on Kim to abandon his nuclear weapon ambitions.Kim had two Daimlers waiting for him at the train station - a Mercedes Maybach S Pullman Guard and a Mercedes Maybach S.He is believed to have also used the S Pullman Guard for his summits with Trump in Singapore in June last year and in Hanoi in February."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000485489896.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"uk weather forecast storm hannah met office today","story":"The Met Office has expanded a severe wind warning as it warns epic gusts will sweep across Wales and the southwest before pushing up further north overnight.Travel chaos could be in store for those worst affected, with delays to road, rail, air and ferry likely.The yellow warning in place from pm tonight runs until pm tomorrow and has now been extended eastwards and northwards to cover all of South England and Wales, as well as most of the Midlands and parts of northern England.Frank Saunders, chief forecaster at the Met Office, said: A low-pressure system will sweep in from the west during Friday evening and Saturday bringing strong north-westerly winds to Ireland and then parts of the UK.We have issued a yellow wind warning for parts of the UK where we’re likely to see inland gusts of -mph and stronger gusts of around -mph in exposed coastal locations.Trees are coming into full leaf and many people will be on holiday, so the impacts of a late-April storm may dfer subtly from one in mid-winter.A fiver will be paid into your bank account within four months of completing the switch. prepayment meter customer customers will receive a £ Amazon voucher.

John Rhys-Davies - who played Gimli the dwarf - claimed he had never seen such anger as he made a rare appearance on the flagship BBC debate show. The -year-old Welsh actor faced down Labouraposs Jon Ashworth, Green MP Caroline Lucas and Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable as he appeared on the show in Nottingham. But he was branded thuggish and sexist by one prominent campaigner as he lost his temper in one clash with Ms Lucas - and shouted at her: Oh, woman!. At one point he said: “I have never seen such a level of anger. I do believe every member here entered politics in order to the best for their people who elected them, for their constituencies. But your primary objective is to preserve democracy.  And whatever you may feel, you have betrayed democracy. Many audience members applauded enthusiastically as he unleashed his comments against MPs. But he was also branded “thuggish” and “sexist” for shouting “oh, woman!” at Ms Lucas in a separate rant. The actor snapped when the Green MP said Donald Trump does not represent the American people. Slapping his hand down on the desk he replied: “Oh woman! Have you ever read Kenneth Harold and Arrowaposs Theorem   “Any system of election has its problems!” Ms Lucas replied: “And the American one more than most!” Prominent Remain campaigner Femi Oluwole, of the Our Future Our Choice group, tweeted: “Did anyone  feel genuinely worried for Caroline Lucas in this moment  “John Rhys-Davies may sound posh, but that was thuggish behaviour by anyoneaposs definition. ”  It comes amid anger among Brexiteers after the date for leaving the EU was delayed to October . Theresa May has also entered talks with Labour which her hardline Brexiteers believe could lead to a apossofterapos deal. Meanwhile some MPs, include Ms Lucas and Sir Vince, have been campaigning for a second referendum. Rhys-Davies has previously been described as not being a member of any political party. In  he claimed Tony Blair , David Cameron and Gordon Brown were the least qualied men to govern a country that we’ve had in  years. But he was embroiled in an Islamophobia row in  after hardline comments he made about Islam were endorsed by the BNP.  According to Wales Online, he declared he was for deadwhite male culture. He added at the time: There is a demographic catastrophe happening in Europe that nobody wants to talk about, that we darenapost bring up because we are so cagey about not offending people racially. And rightly we should be. But there is a cultural thing as well. By ,  per cent of the children in Holland under the age of  will be of Muslim descent. I think that Tolkien says that some generations will be challenged. Andthey do not rise to meet that challenge, they will lose their civilisation. That does have a real resonance with me. Meanwhile Sir Vince Cable used last nightaposs Question Time to issue a plea for anti-Brexit MPs to work together. He slammed reports that Change UK - which formed from the Independent Group of  defector MPs - is plotting to seize Lib Dem support in the EU elections on May .  Sir Vince said: I would be much happier franklywe pooled our resources and worked together.” Askedhe would refuse to stand candidates against Change UK he said: I had suggested we have that kind of cooperation. It wasn’t feasible within the present voting system and there wasn’t willingness to do it. I am concerned we’re just fragmenting in rather a chaotic way.

On Thursday  May, millions of Brits will go to the polls in the European Parliament elections - two months after we were supposed to leave the EU.

Scroll down for the full list by area.  On Thursday  May, millions of British voters will elect  MEPs to sit in the European Parliament - until Brexit happens. The elections were not meant to happen but have been forced on the UK after Theresa May agreed to delay Brexit until October . Voting is ided into large regions of the country, with each selecting between  and  MEPs using a form of proportional representation. Seats in each region are allotted to each party depending on what share of the regional vote they received. Sothe Tories win three seats in South East England, the highest three candidates on the Tory aposlistapos become MEPs. The actual aposDaposHondt systemapos for deciding which party gets which number of seats is very complicated. In each region, the party with the most votes gets the first seat then its total is ided by two and the party with the most votes in the second round gets the second seat.

The Tories are expected to receive a hammering from Nigel Farageaposs Brexit Party, which has never faced an election before but contains many UKIP defector MEPs. Change UKwill be trying to scoop up the anti-Brexit vote in what is this groupaposs first ballot box test too. Those fringe movements could hit both Labour and the Tories hard, especially becausethe seats are chosen through a form of proportional representation, andEU elections were previously ripe for protest votes. In the last elections in , UKIP won  seats Labour won  the Tories won  and the Greens won . Nigel Farage will be leading the charge for his new Brexit Party, which despite only just setting up has enjoyed polling numbers in the mid-teens. Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson and Labour peer Maurice Glasman have warned the elite elite-basher poses a serious threat to Labour. He vowed to put the fear of God into our MPs - they deserve nothing less in comments that led to accusations he was making dog-whistle threats. Lord Buckethead The comedy character is back after becoming a viral internet sensation when he stood against Theresa May in . This time he is planning to stand against Nigel Farage in South East England.Because he is not part of a list he will need to outstrip the might of the big parties to get elected. But he has been boosted by more than £, in crowdfunding - three times what he needed for his £, deposit. Rachel Johnson Rachel Johnson, the sister of Tory Boris, is to stand for anti-Brexit party Change UK in the South West region. The journalist who has long campaigned against Brexit became the second sister of a prominent Brexiteer to join a new party in as many weeks. Jacob Rees-Moggaposs sister Annunziataalso announced she would stand in the election for Nigel Farageaposs Brexit Party. She took a swipe at her brother, saying she did not want to see Brexit “rubbing out my children’s prospects and chances of living and travelling and working in Europe”. Ann Widdecombe  Conservative Party stalwart Ann Widdecombe sensationally quit - to stand for the Brexit Party in the South West. The -year-old had been a staunch Tory for  years - serving as Shadow Health and Home secretary. But she has joined Nigel Farageaposs fledgling party on a mandate to hurry up and get Britain out of the EU. LGBT rights campaigners condemned theof Ms Widdecombe - who spent decades battling equal rights - just days after Nigel Farage claimed his new party would be intolerant of intolerance. The former Tory grandee voted against equalising the age of consent at , civil partnerships and the repeal of Section . And in  she defended gay conversion therapy - which Theresa May has branded abhorrent and vowed to ban.  Stephen Yaxley-Lennon announced he is standing to be an MEP in the forthcoming EU elections. The far-right extremist, who calls himself Tommy Robinson, launched his website on the final day of nominations to stand in the Europe-wide poll. Despite his role as an advisor to Ukip leader Gerard Batten, heaposs still barred from joining the party, and will stand in the North West region as an independent. In a message on the website, he took a swipe at Nigel Farage, calling him just another millionaire stockbroker who looks down at the working classes. He said he would fight against the Islamication of Britain and complained that the elites have tried to silence my own voice by jailing him for Contempt of Court and having his Facebook page removed. The former minister prompted raised eyebrows when he announced he would be standing for Labour - as second choice for the South West Region. The arch-Remain peer is most definitely not following Jeremy Corbynaposs official line on Brexit. He wants to cancel our leaving the EU - saying Brexit can and should be stopped. Carl Benjamin  The UKIP candidate refused to apologise for saying he wouldnapost even rape Labour MP Jess Phillips. The -year-old who styles himself aposSargon of Akkadapos even doubled down, saying his comments were justied because sheaposd been a giant bitch. In combative exchanges, Mr Benjamin - who is second on UKIPaposs South West regional list - told journalists: Iaposm not answering your questions, Iaposm not apologising for anything, you dirty, dirty smear merchants. Benjamin also repeatedly used the words n****r and spic in a since-deleted  video. The vlogger described two people as a fag and a retard and used an apparently anti-Semitic meme in the clip. And he said it was just f***ing fine to describe an Asian woman as a chink. The isive UKIP leader is almost guaranteed to re-win his seat as heaposs top of the partyaposs list in London. His leadership of the party has prompted an exodus of UKIP stalwarts including Nigel Farage, who said he was pushing it to the far right. He has courted far-right EDL founder Stephen Yaxley-Lennonand defended Carl Benjaminaposs claim he wouldnapost even rape a female MP. Laura Parker The left-winger - fourth on Labouraposs London list - is the most senior woman in the pro-Corbyn group Momentum. That means she is a power player in the partyaposs factional battle between a softer Brexit, none at all, or a second referendum. “If we were staring down the barrel of a no-deal gun, I personally would like to be asked what I thought about that,” she told the BBC last year. Eloise Todd Eyebrows were also raised when the chief of an anti-Brexit group was selected to run for Labour. Eloise Todd - the CEO of second referendum campaign group Best For Britain - will run as second on the list for Labour in Yorkshire and the Humber. Annunziata Rees-Mogg Jacob Rees-Moggaposs SISTER was announced as one of the first candidates for Nigel Farageaposs Brexit Party. Annunziata Rees-Mogg - a former Tory candidate who joined the Conservatives at the age of five - is a privately-educated fox hunting supporter once worked on the Brexiteer journal of Tory MP Bill Cash. The -year-old and her brother Jacob are both hard Brexiteers and were among five children of late newspaper editor William Rees-Mogg. She stood for the Tories aged just  in Aberavon, before falling out with the leadership when she stood again in Somerton and Frome in . David Cameron had suggested she refer to herself as aposNancy Moggapos - because her own name sounded too posh - but she refused. A YouTuber who was fined £ after filming a pug giving a Nazi salute is standing in the European elections for Ukip. Mark Meechan, , who styles himself as Count Dankula on the internet, said he would stand to represent Scotland in the EU. He was handed the fine for recording his girlfriendaposs pet dog, Buddha, responding to statements such as gas the Jews and Sieg Heil by raising its paw. He was found guilty of breaching the Communications Act by posting material that was grossly offensive and anti-Semitic and racist in nature, in an offence aggravated by religious prejudice, following a trial at Airdrie Sherf Court in April last year. He repeatedly refused to pay the fine but had the money seized from his bank account by court officials earlier this year.  Gavin EslerFormer BBC top dog Gavin Esler branded Brexit Britain a worldwide joke as he confirmed heaposll stand in the London region for Change UK. The ex-Newsnight presenter - who left the BBC two years ago - demanded a second referendum to stop Brexit now. He slammed the pretend men of the people, the posers of Brexit, the Farages and the Rees-Moggs selling the same old snake oil.  He said: I am absolutely appalled, Iaposm sick of it. They claim to speak for the British people. They do not. They stole our patriotism and I want it back.  The former Royal Marines and Special Boat Service officer - who served three tours of Afghanistan - was revealed by Nigel Farage as the Brexit Partyaposs aposwar heroapos candidate. He is now the director of a conservation charity, a host on Discovery Channelaposs Shark Week and a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society.  Ex-MP Katy Clark is a key ally of Jeremy Corbyn as the former political secretary to the Labour leader. She was shunted up to third place in the coveted London list for Labour MEP candidates after a reported battle between factions in the party. As an ally of Labouraposs leader she may introduce a sceptic note among other, far more wildly pro-EU candidates on the partyaposs list. Magid Magid  The widely-loved former Lord Mayor of Sheffield - a former refugee who became mayor at  - is top of the Green Partyaposs list for Yorkshire and the Humber. He recruited poets and musicians to perform at council meetings and famously banned Donald Trump from the city. His region doesnapost currently have a Green MEP but the party won almost % of the regional vote last time. Martin Mayer The Labour candidate shot to prominence after saying he regrets branding anti-Semitism claims a smear to undermine Jeremy Corbyn. Martin Mayer faced anger after an e-mail he sent in  emerged with the title: How Israel lobby manufactured UK Labour partyaposs anti-Semitism crisis. Euan Philipps of the Labour Against Anti-Semitism group said Mr Mayeraposs views have no place in British democracy. Yet Labour sources defended his conduct, saying his remarks are from a few years ago and were not made in the current context. As the fth candidate on a six-strong list in Yorkshire and the Humber, it is almost impossible that he will win enough votes to become an MEP.  Full list of candidates Key to the list *  sitting MEP.

drug dealers, speeding drivers and child abusersShareCommentsByFleet Street FoxColumnist:,  APR Newsopinion\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore

Your choice.Youaposll probably never see the people you killed and maimed.You wonapost meet the woman who never noticed a -day rubella rash, and then had a baby with a shrunken head, congenital cataracts, learning disabilities and diabetes. You wonapost learn the name of the -year-old boy who went deaf with the mumps, and died waiting for a new pancreas. You will never get to hear about the chemotherapy patients, HIV sufferers, and asthmatics whose immune systems couldnapost handle the measles virus, and who are reliant on you to help ensure % of humans are vaccinated in order to protect the rest. But the names of every single one of those you have harmed should be branded on your soul. You killed them, as surely asyou dealt drugs, drove too fast or beat a child so badly its small body could not withstand it.And just like every dealer, speeder and abuser, you knew what you were doing. The only dference is that you refused to look at your victims while you did it.Youaposve been told about Gareth Williams, who died of measles aged . You were warned about the  teenagers at Chichester High School who were diagnosed with the virus last year. You were sent leaflets, invited to appointments, and offered an alternative. You had the chance to learn about Nadja Petrovic, who was born with an auto-immune condition that was no risk to her le, but meant she could not have the jab. She died while being treated in hospital because another patient had measles, and the two were put in the same room by over-stretched hospital staff.Blood oozed from the toddleraposs nose and mouth before she died of heart failure. Because hereaposs the really awful thing: there is no cure for measles. Nothing. All you can do is give fluids, try to bring the fever down, and hope any secondary infection isnapost resistant to antibiotics. The best, and pretty much all, that you can do is to vaccinate people so the virus cannot find a host. If you donapost, measles lives to fight another day. Hereaposs Nadjaaposs mum Dragana holding her daughteraposs swollen, discoloured hand before she died, in a picture she made public to warn others of the risks. Just this week, we saw photos of Alba Moss, who has just turned one. She was too young for the vaccination but caught the disease because of other, stupid, abusive, parents. She spent eight days in hospital critically-ill, and when her mum Jilly posted the pictures as a warning these stupid, abusive idiots claimed Alba was a doll, that it was made up, that Jilly was being paid by some unseen, pro-vaccination lizard Illuminati.How the lizards benefit from healthy, happy children is unknown. But the anti-vax brigade seem to prefer them dead.Vaccinations exist because before we had them, measles killed .million people worldwide every year, mostly children under . They died in London and Manchester the same as they did in Tokyo and Timbuktu. The rate of mumps has dropped by % since vaccination began. There are still , children every year born with congenital rubella syndrome, because their mums were infected, but the bug is close to complete eradication in some places.The combined MMR vaccines have saved millions of lives, worldwide. Those countries where the diseases remain a serious problem are most likely to be in the developing world, where there is poor education, a lack of health infrastructure, and vaccinations only happenthe UN or WHO can get to you.Here in the UK, you have access to universal and higher education, a National Health Service free at the point of need, and a well-resourced GP covering every town and village. And  MILLION parents have decided to ignore all that.Yesterday Tory Health Secretary Matt Half-cocked was asked what heaposs going to do about the fact UNICEF says , children in the UK have not been vaccinated against measles. He blamed social media, that go-to Tory evasion-tactic for any minister who cannot express complicated thoughts.And algorithms had a role in the spread of anti-vax propaganda - social media becomes a positive feedback loop for any mad thought people express, while unwelcome facts that donapost fit the fiction are scrubbed from their timelines. But thereaposs more to it. Tory austerity has led to the closure of an estimated , childrenaposs centres, community hubs where vaccines could both be explained and administered. Government health campaigns are under-funded and under-noticed, compared to previous ones. And there is so much instruction about what to do, what to eat and how to do things that the important stuff can get lost under an onslaught of less wine, more blueberries, high-fat, low-carb, fun-free and unbalanced balderdash from aposexpertsapos who arenapost.So boil this down to basics. A million parents are hurting their children, other peopleaposs children, and adults, in this country and, thanks to international travel, around the world. Were they paedophiles, theyaposd be hunted down by Interpol. Were they county lines dealers, theyaposd be tracked by the National Crime Agency. If they were hurtling around the place in -wheel artics, the police would be laying out stingers to shred their tyres.Theyaposd be brought to justice. Asked about banning unvaccinated children from schools, as has been tried in France and the US, the minister said: I donapost think weaposre there yet.In  there were zero deaths in the UK from measles. A year later, disgraced doctor Andrew Wakefield made bogus claims about the measles vaccine. In the years since, there have been a total of  deaths from measles. One was a baby, one a toddler, and the others were all aged  or older.Over the same period another , Britons were infected, with massive health and social costs of dealing with the likely complications which can include pneumonia, meningitis, bronchitis, eye ulcers and permanent brain damage.One dead baby would be enough for some, but  corpses and many millions of pounds of expense is probably enough to convince most voters that something needs to be done. Especially as it was easily, and cheaply, avoidable.The real crime is people CHOSE to make this happen. People who claim to love their children, people who most likely have comfortable, middle-class lestyles, and smugly feel that a pension, mortgage and SUV make their family immune to the sort of disease that slaughters poorer children indiscriminatelythey are not helped.Itaposs people who pay attention to aposcelebrityapos influencers, first-time parents who listen to other idiots at their private ante-natal class rather than their doctor, those who think aposooh, well, itaposs a lot to give a tiny baby all at once and doesnapost the vaccine have metal in it, too aposThey donapost stop to ask themselves how, exactly, theyaposd continue to breathe in and out without iron, zinc, chromium and copper, or whether their blood system would work better or worse without the tiny amounts of gold in it.Despite the high levels of stupid at work here, most of these people have access to the facts. Most know measles is bad, eventhey are so far removed from any instance of it theyaposve no idea how it terried their grandmothers. But they have nevertheless made a conscious decision to do something which makes their children vulnerable to a deadly, awful disease, and invited it to happen to others.In law, it is illegal not just to deal drugs, to speed or to assault, but also to accidentally kill as a result. Itaposs called manslaughter. And thataposs why every parent who refuses to vaccinate their child against any one of the host of childhood diseases that can kill them should be arrested, charged, and put on trial for child abuse. They are wilfully inflicting pain, they are negligently inviting risk, they are intentionally undertaking an act they know, with a secondaposs pause, is likely to hurt someone other than themselves.Because most of these parents were vaccinated. Most of them were given access to everything their parents and grandparents  in many cases didnapost have, like further education, careers, and pensions. Their forebears knew what measles was, and shielded their descendants from it these new, stupid parents are not afraid of a monster they have never seen. They have never seen it in their families, in their newsfeeds, or in government information campaigns. Most of them have never seen an amputation without anaesthetic, either, but they still know itaposs not a great idea. Theyaposd know that not vaccinating children was bad, too,it carried a prison sentence. Those given the chance to improve the world, and who choose instead to maim and kill, should have their children, and their liberty, removed.

Carl Benjamin - who calls himself Sargon of Akkad - repeatedly used the words n****r and spic in a since-deleted  video. The vlogger also repeatedly described two people as a fag and a retard and used an apparently anti-Semitic meme in the clip. And he said it was just f***ing fine to describe an Asian woman as a chink. Anti-fascist group HOPE not Hate, which obtained the video, said the appalling slurs showed the mask has slipped.And Labour MP David Lammy said: This is an ideology of hate. It must be confronted and defeated.Yet today an apparently unrepentant Benjamin said people who had been offended can go and have a cry. And UKIP defended Benjamin as a YouTube entertainer fighting political correctness - before telling the Mirror: He will remain on the UKIP ticket.”    It comes days after UKIPaposs leader defended Benjamin, who is standing for the South West region in the May  European Parliament elections, for saying he wouldnapost even rape a female MP. Challenged about the comment earlier this month, Benjamin said: I think we should treat women the same as men. That meansa woman is being a giant bitch and laughing at male suicide, Iaposm going to be a giant dick back to her. The video, a copy of which has been watched by the Mirror, opened with a black man telling the camera: It’s not acceptable to call me a n****r. Benjaminaposs voice then cut in, saying: Why would you begin our conversation like that  It kind of makes me think that you want the internet to open up with a big bunch of memes on your ass, calling you a n****r. It’s not personal, no one really thinks you’re a n****r, it’s just that you’ve turned around and said aposIt’s not acceptable to call me a n****rapos and then no one fucking knows you dude.    You’re wearing a suit and tie, no one thinks you’re like some gangster or anything. Later text reading gay n****rs from outer space appeared, with Benjaminaposs voice continuing: If you hadn’t provoked me,you had just kept your whore mouth shut, I wouldn’t be putting [up this] picture. An Hispanic woman then told the video: It’s not acceptable to call me a spic.Benjaminaposs voice could be heard saying: Yeah okay, but it’s not like I’m walking   down the aisles of my local grocery   store and I see a spic, and go aposHey spic!   Hey spic!apos You know, I don’t know you, I,   I don’t really want to talk to you, I don’t   need to get your attention by calling you a spic. I don’t even know why you   would bring this up, what’s, what’s the   deal. But anyway, as, as with the previous   guy,   I won’t call him a n****r, and I won’t   call you a spic. That’s what I agree to. When an Asian woman said she shouldnapost be called a chink, Benjaminaposs voice could be heard saying: Aha! Ha ha ha, ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! You lose! It’s actually fine! It’s actually just f***ing fine and I’ll tell you why. Because Asians are privileged. In almost every walk of le, Asians make more money, they have better results, and they do better in le than me, just a dumb ass cracker. So, when Asians are filling up all of those top spots in better proportion than white people, you have to understand you have institutional privilege over me, I mean you’re using your s to lecture me now. So f*** off chink, it’s okay for me to call you this, because racism is power plus prejudice.  Later in the video Benjaminaposs voice told someone: Oh f*** off you fag. That’s not racial discrimination, that’s not even sexual discrimination, that’s just you being a f***ing fag. I don’t even care, I don’t even know that you’re gay, you might not be gay, but you’re still a fag. Shut up, f*** off. And when a man appeared saying It’s not acceptable to call me a kike, Benjaminaposs voice could be heard saying: I totally agree. Absolutely unacceptable. How dare you. Over the image, however, were overlaid what appear to be clearly anti-Semitic images of large-nosed people rubbing their hands with glee.  Later, comments in Benjaminaposs voice addressed to a woman with Downaposs syndrome said: You know what, fair enough, you can’t change that you’re a retard, and it’s not very nice for me to call your retard. I won’t do it. Nick Lowles, chief executive of HOPE not hate, said: “These appalling slurs show the mask slipping from Carl Benjamin, a man who likes to hide behind his YouTube personna and write off everything as a joke or as part of a free speech mantle. “Even a far-right party like UKIP and its Muslim-obsessed leader Gerard Batten must realise they’ve made a horrendous error in selecting Benjamin as a candidate. They must now immediately sack him, or forever be seen to be siding with bigotry, homophobia, misogyny and racism. The voters of the South West deserve better than this. A UKIP spokesman told the Mirror today: Carl Benjamin is a free speech campaigner who is challenging the gatekeepers of political correctness. “Mr Benjamin’s background as a YouTube entertainer should not, and will not exclude him from candidacy. Mr Benjamin will remain on the UKIP ticket.”The right-winger appeared unrepentant over the video, which was originally reported by BuzzFeed News.A statement to BuzzFeed said: “BREAKING NEWS: Anti-political correctness entertainer has used naughty words for fun. Subscribe to Buzzfeed for more hard-hitting and worthwhile political activism. “I expect my statement to be printed in full, have a great day.”He told Sky News: Iaposm not really interested in discussing any of these comments because, you see, Iaposve had something like  million views on my YouTube channels in total.Iaposve got a huge audience. If people want to go see them they can go watch them on my channel and see the context of them for themselves. Told people had been offended he said: I tell you what. They can go and have a cry, and when theyaposve collected themselves and theyaposre ready to talk like an adult about the issues and not bring up things that they think might be offensive and spread them around the country to people who might be offended by them, then we can have a sensible conversation about the issues.

However it doesnapost appear the ambulance has got anything to do with the couple, and it turns out they were simply there to pick up some food.    A spokesperson for the ambulance service said the ambulance parked in the farm shop was a training vehicle that went into the farm shop to pick up lunch for students working in local area. There was also an helicopter flying over the castle, which caused even more excitement. Meghan and Harry have kept key details about the birth a secret, saying they wanted to celebrate privately, so we donapost know where sheaposs planning to have her baby.   Bookies slashed on the odds on the baby not being born until next month after Prince Harry joined sister-in-law the Duchess of Cambridge for an Anzac Day service at Westminster Abbey yesterday.Itaposs an hour drive from his Windsor home, and the service lasted an hour - so many believed it was a clue Meghan isnapost showing any signs of labour yet.

The curious tot is also banned from being in the garden and kitchen on her own because she has eaten gravel, grass and cat food in the past. The poor toddler almost choked to death when she bit a chunk out of a doormat and dad Sam Smith saved her le.    Pictures show Rubyaposs traditional cotaposs wooden sides chewed asan animal has been gnawing it. Now her -year-old mum is being forced to crowdfund for a new bespoke special needs bed that will include aposplastic teething coveringapos so that her aposspecial little girlapos doesnapost eat it. Claire, from Bedford, Bedfordshire, said: Sheaposs always got something in her mouth - even the cat [Steve]! Sheaposs like a little beaver. If she can get her hands on it she will eat it. The wooden bar [of her cot] has been chewed down over a few months. I have to be careful what I cover it with so she canapost chew that either. Thereaposs nothing in our living room for her to get hold of - no books, no DVDs, nothing that she could rip up and chew.    We canapost let her out in the garden because she would eat it. Sheaposd eat the gravel and the grass. She enjoys the trampoline but we canapost let her have free rein. We canapost let her into the kitchen because thereaposs cat food and sheaposll eat it. It can be very dangerous. Children with her condition are prone to choking due to the paralysis and low muscle tone. Paper is one of her favourite - like on video games cases. So we donapost keep those anymore or CD cases. She has tried to eat grass and gravel in the past.    We had one of the furry doormats too and she choked - she took a big chunk out of it. Her dad [cable engineer Sam, ] saved her le - I was about to ring an ambulance. This was around  months old and since then weaposve been very careful about what we have around. My son loves Rubix cubes and he canapost have those in the living room because she has tried biting one of those before and a piece of it came off. She doesnapost understand any dangers. Ruby has alternating hemiplegia of childhood- an ultra-rare neurological condition that causes epilepsy, paralysis, low muscle tone, cerebral palsy and uncontrollable body movements. Pica is also listed as a common symptom of AHC and sees those affected eat items not typically thought of as food and with no signicant nutritional value, such as hair, dirt or foam.  The brave little girl was first diagnosed with AHC in  after repeated visits to Bedford Hospital for genetic testing. At just five days old she started having seizures and would be rushed to hospital aposthree or four times a weekapos. Claire said: Ruby was born by emergency cesarean and started having seizures at about five days old. We thought she was just poorly and had picked something up. In the end, we were going to hospital around three or four times a week. Now she has absent seizures every day, but we have to call an ambulance out two or three times a month. Sheaposll be bluelighted in. She can be playing and become paralysed all of a sudden. She has uncontrolled epilepsy and is always chewing because sheaposs got pica. She turns four next week but her mental age is around  months. Some of it is sensory. When youaposre a baby you chew things, lick them, itaposs just a phase - but sheaposs still doing it. Luckily her teeth are lovely for now.  Rubyaposs crowdfunding page has so far raised £ towards her £, target since it launched earlier this month - but she has quite a way to go. The bed, which will be made by a specialist firm, will include teething-safe plastic so she wonapost be able to chomp her way through it. Claire said: Ruby doesnapost just need a hospital bed. To keep her safe we need something specially built for her that she cannot eat. Because itaposs a special needs requirement itaposs more expensive and we need to fund that ourselves. The bed itself will cost £,. Weaposre having it made from Andersonaposs Themes and Dreams who make bespoke, special needs beds. Iaposve told them specically what we need and they can fit teething plastic on the bars.

The charity has also set up a fundraising campaign to help cover Georgeaposs vet bills, estimated at over £, including payments for low-calorie dog food and pain relief medicine.

The brutal slaughter of three young children in their own house by a man they should have been able to trust. David McGreavy slaughtered eight month old baby Samantha, Dawn, two, and David, four, at their home in Worcester in .When their father, Clive Ralph, left them in the care of the man who he had welcomed into the family home as a lodger, the three were sleeping peacefully in bed. McGreavy was known for his affection for children, especially those he shared a home with, so the decision to leave him in charge of them was a simple one.    But when Clive ed from collecting their mother, Elsie, from work the house was a blood bath and his children had been murdered by the man who was supposed to be protected them. There was no sign of McGreavy or the children. Aged just , McGreavy had flown into a drunken rage because baby Samantha started crying for her bottle. He strangled her with his hands and she eventually died from a fracture to her skull. McGreavy then turned his murderous intention to the other youngsters. He slit two-year-old Dawnaposs throat and strangled Paul, four, with a wire.  After the violent murders he then mutilated their tiny bodies with a pickaxe and impaled them on a neighbouraposs fence. It earned him the chilling nickname the aposMonster of Worcesterapos and McGreavy was jailed for  years for the brutal crime. Aged just  at the time of the killings, no one could have predicted the terrying events of that night. The childrensapos mother even claimed McGreavy was like a father to the trio and he had been known to criticise her when she disciplined Paul. McGreavy had moved into the family home when Elsie was pregnant with her youngest daughter. He immediately became a much-loved part of the family, often cooking Sunday dinner and babysitting for the three children.  His crime stunned the nation - how could a man who adored the children he was living with subject them to such horror  McGreavyaposs family were also baffled. His father, Tom McGreavy, said: Everyone who knew David knew that he loved children. But the affable young man who had become a key part of family le for the Ralphaposs was hiding a dark past. Born in Southport in , he was the second oldest of six children and spent much of his childhood moving between army bases as his father was a sergeant in the army. His early le pushed him to pursue a career in the Armed Forces and by  he had quit school and enlisted in the Navy.  In the late sixties, and stationed in Portsmouth, McGreavy joined his first ship, HMS Eagle. Described by colleagues as a arrogant young man and cocky McGreavy found himself subject to several disciplinary procedures. But then he started drinking and his career began to unravel. While working as a steward in the mess hall he spotted his name had been written in a Chief Petty Officeraposs Book. Worried this could mean he was about to be told he was changing jobs he reached for booze. Criminologist Dr Elizabeth Yardley said: He actually broke into an officeraposs ward room and set fire to a bin that had papers in it.  He said he did this mistakenly, by accidentally dropping a cigarette end, and he did raise the alarm at :am. He expected the Navy to believe he was just an innocent eye witness, they saw beyond that and he was court marshalled. He was found guilty of negligence and sentenced to  days detention. By  he had fallen in love with a woman called Mary, who he proposed to just one week after meeting her for the first time. In the same year his career in the Navy had collapsed and he was dismisssed and he was forced tohome to his parents. A series of jobs followed, from chef to labourer, but they all eneded the same way - he was sacked.  His attitude, arrogance and alcohol were all cited as reasons. McGreavy now put all his focus on his upcoming marriage to Mary - and he wanted a huge white wedding with all the trimmings. But on New Yearaposs Eve  Mary ended the engagement, leaving McGreavy devasated. Depressed and sulking while living with his parents, McGreavy moved into with his school friend, Clive Ralph. Cliveaposs decision to allow him to lodge with his family would have devastating consequences. The father had married Elsie when she was just  and pregnant with their first child and worked hard as a lorry driver to provide for his growing family. Living conditions in the two-bed house were cramped.  McGreavy shared a bed with little Paul while baby Samantha was in a cradle cot in her parentsapos room and Dawn slept in a bed next to her mum and dad. Cliveaposs lorry driving job meant he was regularly away from home and Elsie was grateful for McGreavyaposs help in caring for the children and running the home. A genial man who was adored by the family and liked by those who knew him, once again his personality completely changed whe he drank. McGreavy was arrested several times for being drunk in public and his father warned him to stop. But his refusal to listen cost three young children their lives. On the night of the killings McGreavy had been drinking in a pub with a friend. He drank between five and seven pints and played cards and darts.  Clive picked him up so he could babysit the children while he went to collect Elsie from her own job in another pub. Nothing could have prepared the couple for the scene that greeted them when they ed home. The walls were drenched with blood and there was no sign of McGreavy or the children. Police found their bodies impaled on the fence an hour later. At the time the sight was so hideous that Detective Superintendent Bob Booth, head of West Mercia CID, said: No investigating officer has ever had to witness that such a scene of indescribable horror. When police arrested McGreavy he initially denied carrying out the gruesome murders. By the following afternoon, he snapped and confessed. During his police interview he slumped forward and started sobbing.  McGreavy said: It was all too bloody gruesome. It was me but it was not me, how could I do it  On Paul I used the wire. Everything just seem to cave in.  I picked up the pickaxe and used all of them then I went outside and put them on the railings. All I can hear is the kids, kids f****** kids. I did the same to Dawn and used the piece of curtain wire on Paul. Asked why he had killed the three innocent children, McGreavy replied: That is what I have been trying to figure out. He pleaded guilty to the murders in a hearing that lasted just eight minutes. Most of his sentence has been served with him under protection as he has been subject to abuse from other prisoners.  In , McGreavy was transferred to an open prison and now he has been cleared for release. The news has come as a devastating blow to their mother, now Elsie Urry after re-marrying. She is terried she will see him on the street. McGreavy would be subject to exclusion zones including where Mrs Urry lives - but they could still bump into one another where. The Parole Board said a victim was entitled to request for conditions to be added to a release licence.Mrs Urry  told the BBC  : I go to Basingstoke... with my brother, where they live, and things like that and it doesnapost... cover that does it She added: Thereaposs people in prison who have done murders, not half as bad as what heaposs done, and yet they havenapost been put up for parole, so why should he get it  "},{"url":null,"title":"distraught girlfriend listened phone partner","story":"NewsDistraught girlfriend listened on phone as partner was killed in horror car crashClare Ashford heard her partner Aaron Dycer scream in fear just before he died in a crash in Longburton, near Sherborne, DorsetShareCommentsByMatthew Dresch:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsAaron Dycer died in a crash on this road in Dorset\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA girlfriend heard her partner scream in fear moments before he died in a horric car crash, an inquest has heard. Aaron Dycer, , was talking to Clare Ashford on speakerphone when he hit a deer and veered into an oncoming vehicle in Longburton, near Sherborne, Dorset. Miss Ashford said she heard her boyfriend shout aposaarghapos, followed by a loud bang and a period of silence. She later heard Antoinette Jenkins, who was trapped in her Subaru Impreza after the crash, cry out for help. Miss Ashford, , tried calling Mr Dycer but got no reply and then drove the route to his work at a farm until she came across his black Volkswagen Golf. She found his leless body in the car and tried to give him CPR but be died at the scene. An inquest heard Mr Dycer, a milker at a farm, had been due to leave home in Templecombe, Somerset, at .am to get to work but was running late as his car would not start. Miss Ashford, a hairdresser, woke up to help him jump start it before he drove away. He called her a short while later to check she was okay after the car issue had made him aposgrumpyapos with her.    In a statement read out at the Bournemouth inquest, Miss Ashford said: He was asking meI was okay and explained why he had been grumpy when I heard him shout aposaarghapos. I could hear fear in the way he shouted and I instantly heard a loud crashing sound, like a loud bang, and then silence. After about  seconds I heard a woman shouting for help. I was shouting his name but all I could hear was her. I hung up the phone and rang back again and again but there was no answer. I hopped in my car because I knew his route to work, having driven him there a few times. I kept ringing and there was no answer, then I got to where the crash took place. I got out my car and ran towards his Golf and I could see him through the driveraposs door. I shook him and shouted his name but there was no reply. I did mouth to mouth but he was already dead. I stayed there until the fire brigade, ambulance and police arrived. The collision took place on the A at Longburton, near Sherborne, Dorset, at about .am on August  last year. Police, fire and ambulance crews attended the incident but Mr Dycer was pronounced dead at the scene shortly after am. Miss Jenkins, an NHS anaesthetist, told the inquest Mr Dyceraposs car was travelling aposat massive speedapos when it crossed into her side of the road and smashed into her vehicle. She said: I could her the phone ringing from the Golf and I shouted aposanswer itapos and aposhelpapos but there was no response. It rang several times. I could not see into the vehicle so I could not see the driver. I was in agony and I knew I was very seriously injured. Miss Jenkins suffered a fractured spine and pelvis and spent almost a month in hospital. She has still not been able toto work as a result of her injuries. Sergeant Jez Strothard, of Dorset Police, said they had not been able to work out how fast Mr Dycer had been driving at the time. A post-mortem examination confirmed he died from multiple injuries. Richard Middleton, the Dorset assistant coroner, recorded a verdict that Mr Dycer died as a result of the crash. He issued a warning to members of the public to be aware of animals crossing country roads at dusk and dawn. He said: Mr Dycer was late departing for work for a number of factors relating to his vehicle and the evidence from Miss Ashford is that he was on speakerphone to her when she heard him strike the deer. It appears ashe took evasive action but unfortunately his vehicle has veered across the road into the path of an oncoming car, causing the collision which led to his death. The sequence of events seems to have been triggered by the collision with the deer, and I would like to remind members of the public of the increased presence of wildle at dusk and dawn on rural roads.

The average age for babies to start walking is around a year old, but Freya is well ahead of her peers. Grace said: Freya was able to stand up whilst holding on to our fingers for balance, by the time she was four months old. We could tell she was desperate to walk from then but it wasnapost until she was six months old that it actually happened. Have you got an incredible story about your child  Email webnews@mirror  Her face was priceless when she took her first two steps, she had the cheekiest grin, Ryan and I couldnapost believe it. At first, I thought it was a fluke, but then when she continued to walk a few steps here and there, I was amazed. She has completely skipped crawling and has walked straight away but she hasnapost quite mastered how to get around things yet, she tries to go over them.  We need eyes at the back of our heads now as she is so quick and always wants to be involved. We brought her a walker but her feet donapost even touch the ground, so we didnapost attempt to use it again, so she has learnt all by herself. She is our first child so we donapost know any dferent but weaposre so proud of her. According to the NHS, a baby starts to sit up on their own at six months and begins walking with support between nine to  months.    Grace adds: She has always been an active baby and super strong considering she is only  pounds. She is a very determined little lady, at ten weeks old she rolled from her cot into my bed so we should have seen this coming. It was only when I spoke to friends and brought her to baby groups, I realised that she is so advanced. We are all so proud of her, my family and friends canapost believe it, and neither can we. People have been amazed by her walking at play group and they love how her face is either one of sheer determination or a great big smile. Who knows what sheaposll do next, Freya is now seven months and we have no doubt that sheaposll continue to keep smashing her milestones.

Presenter Alex, who is also mourning the death of cousin Nathaniel Armstrong, , who was stabbed to death last month in a London kne attack, paid tribute to Benji in a heartrending tribute.   He wrote on Twitter : This week has been so tough. Lost one of my boys to Bowel Cancer at .I’m so glad we had that final chat just a few days ago. Everyday I wake up thinking why, but Cancer doesn’t care! RIP Brother Benji. Benji, who was a fit and healthy and went to the gum sometimes twice a day, was diagnosed with stage four terminal bowel cancer in August. It was initially mistaken for fatigue, anaemia, mental health and IBS. By the time it was discovered it was too late to save the loving husband, son, stepdad, brother and uncle. Benji, nicknamed aposThanosapos after the marvel comic character, because he had a personality as big as the universe, will be laid to rest next week on what would have been his th birthday. He was born and raised in Frome, near Bath, to parents Anthony and Josephine Millard - the eldest of three with two sisters Abs and Steph. During his later school years he worked part time at Center Parcs.  After leaving education worked for Carphone Warehouse and a sandwich bar. In his late teens Benji caught the travel bug, with his favourite places being Australia, New Zealand and Thailand. He eventually settled back into work in the UK, working in finance for London and Country, Which  and then finally Nationwide where he worked his way up into management. He had a close relationship with his parents, who said he set an example to us all in how to deal with adversity. Sisters Abs, , and Steph, , described him as being a very protective, loving and thoughtful brother. They said: He was the best big brother we could have ever asked for. It didnapost matter what he had to sacrice, his family and friends always came first. The lessons he has taught us and the legacy he leaves behind is just a scratch on the amazing man he was.”  Benji, who loved sports, was best at football. He had a semi-professional career playing for Radstock, Bath City, Larkhall, Trowbridge and Frome Town over the years. He also had a real passion for music and festivals, he friends that would stay with him for le through a regular Bristol club night. His good friend Anthony Williams ran Comfi Sundae, a city club night and Benji often helped him out. Here he was introduced to a crew of people who he hit it off with straight away. Anthony said: To connect with a group of brothers who have been tight and close knit friends for over  years takes a special person and he was just that. Leon Walker, a member of the group, added: We all had an immediate connection with him. His mindset, his ambition, humour and his personality just clicked for me. The group, including Antony and Leon, as well as Leon Dawkins, Rueben Alozie, Kevin Morris, Simon Moore, Delroy Thomas, and Alex Beresford, regularly went on holiday together.  They all took part in a fundraising Santa fun run for Benji in November raising money for charities that combat bowel cancer. Delroy Thomas said: He was a grade A guy. A man with a good heart, and someone that you only had to meet once to know how cool he was.”  Reuben Alozie added: He was one of the biggest jokers to the group. Always up for a laugh and for having fun.” Simon Moore described Benji as being like mischievous brothers that loved to play pranks on people. He said: We used to love to take centre stage for comedy and pranks, and would spend time on the phone planning them before. I have so many memories of us ‘up to no goodapos. We were still doing this when I went to see him just before he died. I will miss that so much.”    The friends even had a painting commissioned of him dressed as Thanos from Marvel Comics before his death. We Laura said: I love him so much and cannot even begin to explain how much I will miss him. He was the most wonderful husband, he was my best friend and a loving stepdad to my daughter Sophie. He was an intelligent and confident man with a massive heart. We will love him always. His family has set up a Tulip fund to support and raise awareness of the disease. His parents said: Benji faced his diagnosis with such courage and bravery, and set an example for us all when faced with such adversity. “We will strive to raise awareness and early detection of bowel  cancer so that no other family has to face the loss of someone they love so young.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kate middletons advice prince harry","story":"NewsKate Middletons advice to Prince Harry when brothers refused to put hurtful rt to bedKate Middleton is very close to her brother-in-law Prince Harry, so she had to step in to help fix his row with husband Prince WilliamShareCommentsByRussell MyersZoe ForseyAudience Writer:,  APR NewsThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry \"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email The Duchess of Cambridge was forced to step in after Princes William and Harry both refused to put to bed their hurtful rt, a source has claimed.Kate knew the brothers, who have always been extremely close, needed to make up after a complete and utter break-down in communication.

Chris Marsh, , ditched his rented home last month in favour of the tiny  square foot wooden cabin on wheels. It boasts a master bedroom and second smaller bedroom, kitchen, double bed, washing machine, comfortable living area and large shower room over two floors. He previously rented a two-bedroom house in Hexham, Northumberland, for £ a month and forked out £ a month on electricity bills and £ on council tax.  But since spending  weeks building the new eco home himself, Chris now lives in the building almost for free after buying the land in Northumberland for £, in January with the original plan to build a full house there. Single Chris, who previously worked as a building manufacturer, now sells  of the mini homes a year to other buyers across Europe - with each one retailing for £,. He said: My old house was lovely but it wasnapost remotely economical it had single glazed windows and oil heating that Iaposd rarely put on with it being so expensive to run. The house was constantly cold and I was tired of paying out so much money each month - it was hard to maintain and keep it up to scratch.  I then came across these apostiny housesapos on an American website and thought Iaposd give it a try making one myself. Iaposve now been living in my new house full time since the end of March and completely love it - I wonapost be rushing to move back into a proper house any time soon. Since moving into the tiny house, Chris now only pays around £ a month in electricity bills and doesnapost pay for water as itaposs retrieved through a rain collection system. Chris, who lives on his own, has planning permission on the land where his house is located, meaning he is legally able to use it as a permanent form of residence.    He said the money he is saving from living in his eco house - which he only had to sacrice a few clothes to move into - is being put towards having an easier lestyle and for future retirement plans. Chrisapos business Tiny Eco Homes UK - which he launched in  - makes the properties bespoke for customers all over Europe and personally delivers them. Due to the unique materials Chris uses to build the homes, which take two to eight weeks to make depending on specications, he promises a le time guarantee as the wood wonapost rot. They are suitable for all types of weathers and climates, and are easily towed by car.    Chris, who currently has six builds on the go, said: Iaposve sold the houses to wide range of people - from young families and elderly couples, to first time buyers and people just wanting an accessible holiday home. Each house is completely dferent and I build it the way to customer wants it making.

Holidaymakers who have booked to travel to the country are now being urged to contact airlines, tour operators and insurers for more information. With Sri Lanka a popular honeymoon destination, many couples, who had booked for post-wedding holidays in the coming weeks, have been forced to make alternative arrangements.    Abigail McKie, a specialist support worker from Doncaster, was due to travel to the country for a honeymoon in June with her fiance Alisdair Smith, but they are facing the prospect of rearranging the entire trip. Iaposve cried quite a few times already, she said. Itaposs so frustrating. Weaposve booked our train tickets and weaposve got our visas. Itaposs all booked, itaposs all paid for. The couple had saved up £, for a tour of Sri Lanka, with stops including Colombo, Kandy and the countryaposs Cultural Triangle, with a particular focus on seeing wildle. Weaposre quite adventurous and we donapost like staying in one place, the -year-old said.    She said her travel agent is now advising the couple change the destination for the trip, which they had been planning for around a year.Theyaposve given us a few options like Borneo but to be honest we were so set on Sri Lanka, she said.Despite her frustration with the situation, she said she understood why the Foreign Office had changed its advice.Theyaposre just trying to keep everyone safe and honestly my heart goes out to anyone thataposs out there already or that was meant to be going sooner than we are, she said. Theyaposve probably done the right thing but itaposs hard to take. Amy Goodman, a doctor from Armagh, Northern IReland, had been due to stay at Colomboaposs Cinnamon Grand hotel, one of the sites that was hit in the bombings, with her fiance Ross Kernan as part of their honeymoon in June.    They are now working with their travel agent to cut Sri Lanka out of their itinerary completely. Ms Goodman, , said: Just the thought that we could have been there... If you see the hotel you were meant to spend the first few weeks of your married le in blown to pieces, it just wouldnapost have felt right. It made us feel quite uneasy to go to another country where a government has stipulated that there is a threat and that there could be another attack at any time. Ms Goodman and her fiance had been planning the trip for over two years, and she had taken on extra shts at the hospital where she works to pay for the holiday.  But she said they were some of the lucky ones as they were able to rearrange with a manageable surcharge, and that they had been planning on changing their plans even before the new Foreign Office advice. She said: It just wouldnapost have felt right - the eeriness, and of course the tragedy for the Sri Lankans as well, we felt we couldnapost do it. Travel trade organisation Abta said those booked to travel on a package holiday imminently would be offered the chance to postpone their trip, rearrange to an alternative destination or receive a refund. Those who booked flights and accommodation separately were advised to talk to the inidual companies or check with their insurers.

The footage shows a fireball rising from the Port Talbot facility, in Wales, lighting up the night sky in the early hours of this morning. Neighbours described a big ball of flame, followed by a massive mushroom of smoke after hearing three deafening bangs.  Bosses at the steelworks plant say two workers were left slightly injured. Eyewitness Lance Davies lives at the highest point in the town and said it was a miracle no-one was killed. He said: I was woken up this morning by what sounded like thunder, I went to the window and could see the results of the first explosion, then I called my partner and saw the other two. That was all you could see, it was like a scene from Independence Day. A big ball of flame, followed by a massive mushroom of smoke. It was unbelievable.  Sharon Freeguard, a Neath Port Talbot councillor, said: I thought I heard about two to three explosions. It was extremely frightening and very, very scary. The house just shook, so it was quite alarming. Once it was over, I did wonder what it was and just did think about the works. Weaposre just all relieved that there are no fatalities. The blasts took place at around .am this morning. A Tata Steel spokesman said: We can confirm two of our employees were slightly injured when there was a spillage of liquid iron while it was travelling to the steel plant.  All fires have now been extinguished. A full investigation has begun. The site had reopened by am and sht workers were spotted arriving for work as usual. Explosions were heard  miles away in Bridgend, South Wales. The steelworks is the largest in the UK and employs more than , people. It was threatened with closure in  when it was put up for sale by Tata. However bosses changed their minds after workers agreed to a change in their pension deals. South Wales Police said: Emergency services remain on scene but we have had confirmation that all members of staff are accounted for and there are only two casualties with minor injuries. Early indications are that the seat of the explosion was a train which carries molton metal into the works.    The explosion caused some small fires which are all under control and damage to some buildings on the site. South West Fire and Rescue Service say there are no concerns over hazardous effects from smoke from the fire. Aberavon MP Stephen Kinnock said the incident raised real concerns about safety at the works. He said: It could have been a lot worse. Grateful as always to the emergency services for their rapid and effective response. Tata Steel Europe must conduct a full review, to improve safety. Accidents do happen but we need to make sure there is health and safety support for the workforce and the people in our town.

While it has not been confirmed as the work of the Bristol street artist, it bares his familiar stencilled style.It shows a child clutching an Extinction Rebellion sign while crouching near a plant shoot emerging from the earth.    From this moment despair ends and tactics begin, accompanying words say. Skeena Rathor, vision co-ordinator for the activists also known as XR, told the crowd in Speakeraposs Corner in Hyde Park on Thursday that the event marked a pause in their protests.

Mr Bolsonaro said: In Brazil, we have , penis amputations a year due to a lack of water and soap.    We have to find a way to get out of the bottom of this hole. He added that his Government must do more to make men realise the dangers of not washing properly. The American Cancer Society thinks that good genital hygiene is perhaps the most important factor in preventing penile cancer in uncircumcised men. Studies show that circumcised men are less likely to get the disease, which is thought to have links to the build-up of smegma on the penis.

Mariam Nabatanzi had her record number of babies by the time she was just  and all with the same father. Now , Mariam has had three sets of quadruplets, four sets of triplets and six sets of twins.Sadly, her husband walked out on her three years ago and she is now solely responsible for her huge family. Mariam, from Uganda, was married aged just  to her then -year-old husband.    Her first set of twins came along just a year later. Mariamaposs le has been marred by tragedy and she and all of her children are forced to live in four cramped homes built from cement bricks with a corrugated iron roof. They are surrounded by coffee fields. After her first sets of twins were born, Nabatanzi went to a doctor who told her she had unusually large oies. He advised her that birth control like pills might cause health problems, so the children kept coming.    Large families are common in Africa with women in Uganda giving birth to . children in average, one of the highest birth rates on the continent according to the World Bank. But even in Uganda Mariamaposs family is considered huge. By the time she was  Mariam had  children and, desperate, went back to see her doctor in a bid to stop her having any more Once again, she was advised to keep getting pregnant because he oy count was so high. Her last pregnancy, two and a half years ago, had complications.    She gave birth to her sixth set of twins, but sadly one of them died during the labour. Then her husband - often absent for long stretches - abandoned her. His name is now a family curse and Mariam swears whenever she refers to him. She said: I have grown up in tears, my man has passed me through a lot of suffering. All my time has been spent looking after my children and working to earn some money.  And with so many mouths to feed, Mariam will turn her hand to anything. She has worked as a hairdresser and an event decorator. Mariam collects and sells scrap metal, brews local gin and sells herbal medicine. Most of her wages are spent on food to feed her huge family, medical care, clothes and school fees to ensure her brood has the best start in le. On a grimy wall in one room of her home hang proud portraits of some of her children graduating from school, gold tinsel around their necks.  Her eldest child, Ivan Kibuka, had to drop out of school to help raise the family. The -year-old said: Mum is overwhelmed, the work is crushing her, we help where we can, like in cooking and washing, but she still carries the whole burden for the family. I feel for her. Mariamaposs mother walked out on her, her father and her five siblings three days after she was born. After her father remarried, her stepmother poisoned the five older children with crushed glass mixed in their food. They all died.  Mariam says she only escaped because she was visiting a relative. She added: I was seven years old then, too young to even understand what death actually meant. I was told by relatives what had happened. This harrowing tragedy sparked her desire for a huge family, although she originally hoped for six children. Providing a home for  youngsters is a constant challenge.  Twelve of the children sleep on metal bunk beds with thin mattresses in one small room with grime-caked walls. In the other rooms, children pile onto shared mattresses while the others sleep on the dirt floor. Older children help look after the young ones and everyone helps with chores like cooking. A single day can require  kilograms of maize flour, Mariam says. Fish or meat are rare treats.

“With the selection of Balfour Beatty as contractor, the job of turning the vision for Union Terrace Gardens into reality is about to start in earnest.“This is a moment for celebration right across Aberdeen.“The investment we’re making is transforming our city and the benefits will be felt throughout the region. Generations to come can share in the rewards.”Hector MacAulay, Balfour Beatty’s regional managing director of Scotland and Ireland, said: “We are looking forward to working with Aberdeen City Council to transform the historic Union Terrace Gardens, which on completion will signicantly contribute to the Council’s City Centre Masterplan.“Our construction expertise coupled with our experience in regenerating public spaces makes us ideally positioned to deliver the three new pavilions and sympathetically upgrade this much-loved historic space which will benefit the local community and visitors alike for years to come.”SNP Group Leader, Councillor Stephen Flynn said: “I am sure the people of Aberdeen will be at a total loss as to how the administration can justy spending almost £ million on Union Terrace Gardens when they are continuing to make severe cuts to services across the city.“Project costs have soared by at least £ million since  and it is now certain that the gardens will be delivered two years late – what a complete

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14580367.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_180419rugby_02JPG.jpg","title":"ayr rugby club prepare murrayfield","story":"NewsAyr Rugby Club prepare for Murrayfield date with destiny against HeriotsThe club will bid to land a fourth Scottish Cup and complete a league and cup double this season when they head for the capital on Saturday.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  APR NewsAyr Rugby coach Peter Murchie and his players \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Make mine a double, writes Ron Evans.That was the cry at Millbrae when the pink and black faithful realised that their team had created the chance to win the Tennent’s Premiership and the Scottish Cup in what will be the last opportunity to achieve this feat under the current league set-up. Ayr have been there before of course in  when they won the Premiership by defeating Currie then the Cup final against Melrose with the unforgettable Cammy Taylor try in the injury time of extra time. This time, however, they take on Heriot’s in both games. Having won the epic Tennent’s Premiership play-off final against the Goldenacre outfit two weeks ago, the Nailsare again Ayr’s opponents on Saturday in the cup final at Murrayfield. It might be inappropriateto suggest that Ayr are going out to hammer the Nails on Saturday, but that is exactly what they plan to do. Now in possession of more senior cup and league medals than any other Scottish player, veteran full back Grant Anderson told some of the rookies for whom this is a first- time experience: “You think beating Heriots at Millbrae was good  “Doing it at Murrayfield will feel a hundred times better!” Skipper Pete McCallum, heading for his third cup final at Murrayfield with a won one lost one record, certainly agreed that it was great chance for the players to express themselves on the big stage. “Playing on the international pitch is always something really special so we want to enjoy the occasion and go out with a bang,” he said.  As was the case at Millbrae, there will be little to choose between the two sides, their regular league form having panned out with an away win each but in the winner-takes- all contest for the Premiership title showdown, Ayr were superior. “Yes, we are in a good place but there will be no complacency” said coach Peter Murchie. “It was a physical game and we would expect the same in the cup final. “Thankfully we didn’t pick up any injuries and we were able to give the squad a bit of a rest after the last game which has let us build gradually towards Murrayfield.” “The squad are totally motivated as you would expect from any team going into a cup final becauseyou can’t be motivated for that then I donapost know what would get you up for a game. “I have said several times to the squad that opportunities like this don’t come along very often in your career and you have to take those opportunities and make the very best of it. “Some of our squad have experienced this situation before and our senior players will be a big part of what we achieve but we have some really exciting young talent as well so we will give it our best shot and hopefully have a great finish to what has already been a memorable season.” It has indeed been memorable andAyr do add a fourth Scottish Cup success to the Tennent’s Premiership title, then the call will likely be for trebles not doubles all round.

The cash withdrawals took place between July  and May  and Cowan helped herself to more than £, of the patient’s savings. The Scottish Social Services Councilheard how the offence came to light when the victim, known only as ‘AA’ and requiring “multiple care needs” decided to alert care home staff, believing that the money would never be repaid.When shocked senior staff at Glebe House found out about the incidents they called the police and reported the matter to the Care Inspectorate and the SSSC. But in the subsequent investigation, Cowan was understood to have shown “limited insight and remorse” in respect of her actions. The victim gave evidence during the hearing, telling the SSSC’s Fitness to Practise Panel how, during a conversation with Cowan, she told her she was “worried about money.” The victim initially offered Cowan money but that invitation was declined. However, in a later conversation, around a week later, Cowan, who had no previous record of wrong-doing with the SSSC, indicated that she “needed a certain amount of money.” On this occasion Cowan was given the lady’s bank card and PIN and the service user believed £ would be withdrawn. In the weeks and months thereafter, a similar scenario took place “several times.” Several cash withdrawals took place from the ATM at the Co-operative, Dalmellington. Cowan then came up with a “sob story” about a family member’s Christmas present and again, the patient handed over her bank card. This pattern continued and the patient did not report the matter at that point because Cowan “promised to pay it back” and she “believed her.” However, the victim’s concerns grew and she reported the matter to other members of staff after fearing she wasn’t going to get her money back. Another witness claimed she was “shocked” that a carer had taken a resident’s bank card and withdrawn money for her own use. During the investigation process Cowan started to make repayments of the outstanding amount. At the hearing in Dundee the victim was described as a “lonely and vulnerable inidual” but “very switched on” and an “impressive witness” who gave her evidence in a forthright manner and was found to be both “credible” and “reliable.” In their written judgement the SSSC found Cowan’s conduct fell “far below the standards” expected, labelled her actions were “serious and deliberate” and amounted to a “signicant breach of trust.” The Panel also stated they could not be satisfied that Cowan had “acknowledged the gravity” of her conduct, or that she demonstrated “meaningful regret.” The judgement concluded: “A Removal Order is the only sanction that will provide an adequate safeguard against yourepeating your misconduct. “It is the only sanction that will ensure that service users are not placed at risk of harm and will maintain public confidence in social services and the SSSC as regulator.” Cowan was neither present nor represented at the hearing. A spokesperson for East Ayrshire Council said: “We are aware of the situation and understand that care home management acted appropriately in conjunction with Scottish Social Service Council and Care Inspectorate when they learned about allegations against the member of staff. “Through our contract management arrangements we actively engage with all the care homes in East Ayrshire to provide assurance in respect of the quality of service provided to residents.” The Post did contact Glebe House Care Home for a response but did not receive one.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrEast Ayrshire CouncilSocial servicesDundee"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14579806.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_010419county_07JPG.jpg","title":"behind scenes south ayrshire council","story":"NewsBehind the scenes at South Ayrshire Council headquartersCounty Buildings mixes antiques with new modern offices in this revealing look behind the scenesShareBySarah Hilley:,  APR NewsCouncillors library at County Buildings \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt is home to antiques, grand paintings and museum treasures. But historic County Buildings is also a modern workplace housing  staff delivering services for more than , people in South Ayrshire. From the grandeur of Provost Helen Moonie’s luxurious sea-view office to the dingy corridors of the basement, the  landmark is full of character. Our Local Democracy Reporter went on a ‘behind the scenes’ tour guided by council depute chief executive Douglas Hutchison. Looking around County Buildings, it is clear to see that history speaks through the detailed decor oozing out of every cornice. Two sweeping staircases sparkle with stunning stained-glass windows which hark back to the time when the whole of Ayrshire was ided into burghs. Each burgh had a crest, which are intricately etched into the glass. They include Ayr, Irvine, Troon Prestwick, Darvel, Kilmarnock, Largs and Saltcoats among others.  Nowadays Ayrshire is ruled by three separate councils but the County Buildings design still echoes a past when Ayr reigned supreme. Its former position of housing the entire admininstrative work of the county is reflected in its extravagant architecture. The main council chambers where all major decisions take place have sleek slide-back oak  – which open into other rooms. The chambers could have one of the finest council views in the country overlooking the Firth of Clyde. Every committee room has an open fireplace, which would have warmed the wind-battered building before central heating. Another room has a glass display cabinet showing a town clerk wig and Royal Burgh of Ayr Truncheon among other artefacts. Councillors have their own swish ‘members library’ with newspapers, tea and coffee. The details of meetings taking place behind closed doors are still written in old-fashioned chalk on the front of blackboards. Showing us around, Mr Hutchison said: “This the front face of the council where the council business takes place.” The director of people also took us to a secret location – a secure vault – which opens into a large room for storingpostal votes.Now there is a mission to make the historic building more up to date to adhere with current workday practices. The original architecture is in conflict with the needs of a al workplace where open-plan is the norm. Attempts to fit more people into open- plan space means walls must come down but due to the listed status of the landmark all alterations must be carefully managed. There is also a need to make room for staff coming from the John Pollock centre and soon-to-be demolished Burns House. In contrast to the splendid offices and committee meeting rooms on the first floor, a newly renovated office for employee services staff features skylights and a purple meeting pod. Mr Hutchison said: “It is a lovely building. But trying to fit a modern working environment into an old building is not easy. There is a lot going on to make it more modern. We need to make more efficient use of space. The days of everybody turning up at their desks are gone. We have to work more flexibly.” Mr Hutchison showed us empty offices stripped bare, which are currently awaiting a facelt. Money to maintain the seat of power is ongoing with windows getting replaced along with other repairs. Mr Hutchison said: “There is a programme of general investment in the building.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsMuseumsKilmarnockIrvineCosmetic surgeryFirth of ClydeTroonDarvelPrestwickLargsSaltcoats"},{"url":null,"title":"debenhams ayr stay open department","story":"NewsDebenhams in Ayr to stay open as department store announces list of  stores to closeThe department store giant has revealed the first list of stores set to close early next year.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  APR NewsDebenhams is an anchor store for Ayr Central \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailScores of jobs have been spared after Debenhams confirmed their outlet in Ayr Central shopping mall is to survive an initial axe.

That’s because Joe, who has died aged , was a one-man citizens’ advice bureau. Joe was incredibly well-versed on how local government works. And he knew the right people to contact in a range of agencies, including South Ayrshire Council. In recent years, Joe was best known as chairman of Riverside Tenants and Residents Association. But he was equally weel kent in the Lochside and Wallacetoun areas - working passionately to improve the housing stock. Joe seemed to be involved in everything pertaining to housing and community issues. He worked alongside Shelter, learning about legislation on homelessness. He also had close links with Riverside Evangelical Church and the Salvation Army - respecting the wonderful work they do in the community. Joe was also involved with the John Pollock Centre, the Mainholm Advice Centre and was on the Community Planning Board. He was a member of the late lamented Wallacetoun and Newton Regeneration Forumwhich provided a focal point for five communities in Ayr. Joe Lafferty hailed from Newarthill, Lanarkshire, and was a choirboy in his youth. He loved singing right up to his untimely death, being a member of the Ayrways Choir, which helps people with breathing dficulties. In his late teenage years and throughout his s, Joe worked abroad for much of the time. He was a project manager on building sites in countries including Nigeria and Pakistan. Joe ed to Scotland after his marriage to Jean, and became aware of the need for communities to have a voice. This became the driving force in the second half of his le. David Burns, South Ayrshire Council’s former head of housing, said he was sorry to hear of Joe’s passing. Mr Burns added: “He was a wonderful gentleman, always taking a keen interest wherever he felt there was a benefit for the community orhe felt ideas would have a detrimental impact on people. “He also made sure I kept my feet on the ground and often said, ‘Don’t change your ability to listen to the community boy, and you’ll do just rightly.” Joe was highly thought of by many senior SAC managers, and often engaged in banter with them, to make his point. Colleague and friend Pauline Mackie said of Joe: “He was never a man who shied away from his own past mistakes and was always very courteous and generous about others as well. He was never a man to bare a grudge. “His wisdom and knowledge along with his sense of humour made him legendary . People were drawn to him even though it meant not getting much of a word in once he got started. He was always courteous and never lost his sense of humour. “Joe also believed in sharing the knowledge he had gleaned over  years, believing knowledge would empower people and communities.” Pauline added: “ Joe, myself and Jackie Lennon considered ourselves the Three Musketeers in the Wallacetoun and Newton Regeneration Forum. “I believe we did make a dference to a lot of people, but sadly the project came to an end.” Joe’s funeral service will be held at noon at Masonhill Crematorium on April  - which would have been his st birthday. He is survived by Jean and their sons, Jack and Jamie, of whom he was immensely proud, and who, like their dad, have worked abroad.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilArmed forcesAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"bike-friendly-new-buses-pull-into-peebles","story":"A FLEET of new bike-friendly buses arrived in Peebles this week.Borders Buses have invested pound, in three brand new vehicles to service its X, Peebles to Edinburgh, route.The vehicles, E double deckers, have been custom designed and built by bus manufacturer Alexander Dennis.Each bus accommodates up to two bike bays with, following positive feedback from customers, two additional bays being added to each vehicle by the end of May.Designed with commuters, local and touring cyclists in mind the bike friendly service is aimed at minimising car journeys.Lee Young, operations manager at Borders Buses, told us: ldquoWe recognise the way we travel is changing and active travel is increasingly becoming a popular choice with people from all walks of le.\"As a key transport provider, we are committed to continuously tailoring our product offerings to meet those changes in travel demand.ldquoItrsquos important to highlight one bike friendly bus could potentially take up a high number of cars off the road.\"With congestion in our towns and cities an ongoing issue it makes sense for commuters to ditch the car in favour of bus and bike.ldquoOur new buses hit the road this week and we cannot wait for our customers, both old and new, to make full use of our bike facility.Other features on the new vehicles include free WiFi, comfortable seating and tables, wireless and USB charging points and device friendly seat backs.The launch of the new vehicles coincides with the introduction of contactless payment across the full Borders Buses network.Scottish Borders Council leader Shona Haslam believes the new bike-friendly buses are a great addition.She said: \"The Scottish Borders is the leading cycling destination in Scotland, from the forests which provides a world-class mountain biking offering to the ious cycling routes which allows people to explore our fantastic area.ldquoTweeddale in particular has an excellent offering for cyclists of all ages and abilities, including the recent extension of the Tweed Valley multi-use path and opening of the e-Bike Hub in Innerleithen.ldquoThe provision of these brand new bike friendly vehicles by Borders Buses on the main service through Tweeddale will be hugely welcomed by local people and visitors and we hope will see even more people travel here to experience the Scottish Borders.Local cyclists Colin Cotter, from Peebles, and Steven Cooper, from Dalkeith, have been recruited to demonstrate how to load bikes inside the new buses.Their video can been viewed at www.youtube watch vXoQCNFsfeatureyoutu.be"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-borders-council-leader-to-stand-in-european-election","story":"SCOTTISH BORDERS COUNCIL leader Shona Haslam will be a candidate in the European election next month ndashit takes place.The Tweeddale East councillor will be third choice on the ballot paper for the Conservatives.This week the party released its full list of hopefuls for the Scotland constituency.And she is among the six names to have been put forward by the Tories.Mrs Haslam told us: ldquoI am absolutely delighted to have been selected.The former charity worker is the only candidate on the partyrsquos list from the Borders.The other hopefuls include first choice Nosheena Mobarik, an incumbent member and second choice Iain McGill, a businessman from Leith.It was also announced yesterday that former Tweeddale councillor and ex-deputy leader of SBC Catriona Bhatia will be a candidate for the Liberal Democrats.Mrs Bhatia, who is the daughter of Borders peer David Steel, is also the partyrsquos third choice behind Sheila Ritchie and Fred Mackintosh.The European elections are due to take place on Thursday, May  ndashthe UK has not left the EU by then.At total of  MEPs will be elected to represent  UK regions.At the polling station, the public will be asked to vote for a party or independent inidual.The more votes a party gets, the more candidates will be elected from their list.

brand-new, low emission Toyota Yaris hybrids have arrived in several Borders towns.And you can drive the eco-friendly vehicles for as little as pound. an hour or pound per day.The scheme is being delivered by Scottish Borders Council in partnership with E-Car Club.Councillor Simon Mountford told us: ldquoWe already have a successful partnership with E-Car Club to use Toyota Hybrids as pool cars for our staff.\"As a result of this we have seen more shared journeys by employees, a reduction in business mileage claims and lower emissions.\"This next stage, which allows members of the public to join a car club scheme, is hugely exciting.\"Vehicles are available to book across the Borders and I believe many of our local residents will take advantage of this when they need access to a car for a few hours or even a full day.The vehicles are specially adapted to include an RFID card access system, meaning the cars can be booked online or through the free E-Car Club mobile app.Bookings can be made for anyof time over one hour, and insurance is even included in the price.Patrick Cresswell, Managing Director at E-Car Club, commented: ldquoWe are delighted to give Borders residents the opportunity to integrate low emission vehicles into their everyday lives through E-Car which offers a self-service, low cost and low emission car club.\"Itrsquos a flexible solution for drivers who donrsquot want to commit to car ownership but need access to a car from time to time.\"We hope this scheme will encourage car owners to consider using the service as an alternative to vehicle ownership. And that should result in fewer cars on the road, and ultimately reducing emissions and congestion.The cars are parked in Peebles, Eyemouth, Duns, Kelso, Galashiels, Hawick and Newtown St Boswells, in allocated spaces prepared by Scottish Borders Council.As the vehicles double up as local authority pool cars they are only available in the evenings and overnight between pm and am from Monday to Wednesday.But they are for hire anytime from pm on Thursday through to am on Monday.As the vehicles are hybrid, they come with two power sources - a petrol engine and an electric motor.The majority of Toyota Hybrids are self-charging which means that every moment you are driving, your battery is charging even when slowing down.This is thanks to technology like the regenerative braking system, which recovers energy that would normally be lost and stores it in the battery for later use.And because they are all self-charging hybrids, their batteries never need to be plugged in.E-Car Club is promoting a special introductory offer to coincide with the launch which includes FREE letime membershipplus pound free driving credit.Simply visit: www.ecarclub join and enter code: WELCOMESB to claim this offer."},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-returns-to-town-hall-for-appointment-night","story":"SELKIRK is set toto normal on Friday with the  Standard Bearer being unveiled in front of the Town Hall.Due to town centre renovations last years Appointment Night was moved to the Victoria Halls.With the Market Square refurbishments now complete, the Royal and Ancient Burgh Standard Bearer will again be revealed with the traditional opening of the Town Hall doors at pm.The customary round-the-town procession will follow before the Appointment Night Concert in the Victoria Halls.An Appointment Night Dance will also take place in the same venue from .pm."},{"url":null,"title":"driver-accused-of-being-three-times-alcohol-limit-on-melrose-bypass","story":"LEE Chapman will stand trial at Selkirk Sherf Court next month accused of driving while more than three times the legal alcohol limit.The -year-old of OConnell Street, Hawick, denies driving with a breath alcohol count of  microgrammes - the legal limit being  - on the A at Tweedbank roundabout on February .The trial is set to take place on May ."},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-primaries-set-for-boundary-change","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council is set to consult on the catchment areas for two Selkirk primary schools.Following a decline in the number of pupils at Yarrow Primary School, council officers are looking at altering the catchment area to include homes that are currently within Philiphaugh Community Schoolrsquos catchment.The plans would mean that pupils from Yarrowford and Broadmeadows, to the west of Selkirk, would attend Yarrow Primary School instead of Philiphaugh School, which is in town.A report, due to go before Scottish Borders Councilrsquos executive meeting on Tuesday  April, explains that a consultation will be carried out with parents prior to any boundary changes.The author of the report, interim service director for children and young people Stuart Easingwood, writes: ldquoThe proposed consultation will seek views on whether there is support for the proposal to amend the catchment areas.ldquoIt is not considered that the proposal will have a material impact on Philiphaugh Community School.ldquoThe number of children in the area under consideration area is relatively low and the Philiphaugh roll has been at a consistent level for a number of years.ldquoThere are currently  pupils at the school which equates to occupancy of %.

Even after the Damascene conversion of arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg, who used to described her deal as ldquovassalage, her final attempt to get a stripped-down Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament failed on Friday by a substantial majority. You have to give May full marks for her consistency: everything she touches turns to dust, even her own resignation.But thatrsquos by the by. As everyone has been saying: we are where we are. And where we are is extremely uncomfortable. Brexiters are gearing up to have a belly laugh at the opposition MPs, who will do their best throughout the coming week to find a compromise. Who do they think they are  Playing at being a provisional government  ldquoItrsquos like allowing the whelk stall to be run by the whelks, according to the Tory MP Sir Bill Cash. Butno-one  is able to run the eponymous stall, then all power to the whelks.Last weekrsquos indicative votes suggested that MPs are broadly in favour of a Brexit that keeps Britain in the EUrsquos economic loop while leaving the political institutions. Curiously, the SNP, who have been arguing for soft Brexit in two white papers and an election manesto, decided not to vote for the ious options, even the Norway model that they have long extolled. The SNP did, however, vote for the proposal from the Labour MP Margaret Beckett for a confirmatory ballot, and this option got the largest number of votes, much to everyonersquos surprise. This must be a serious possibility now that Parliament has failed to resolve the Brexit conundrum.However, this is not a Peoplersquos Vote as some have styled it. A confirmatory vote is not a rerun of the  referendum, but strictly a chance for voters to give their views on whatever deal Parliament agrees . The Kyle Wilson Amendment originally envisaged putting the Prime Ministerrsquos deal to a popular vote, assuming it was passed by Parliament. However, this confirmatory referendum might be dficult to schedule because it could collide with three other elections: a Tory leadership election, the European elections and a General Election. Brenda from Bristol will be in despair.EvenMPs fail to come up with a working compromise, they can still block a no-deal Brexit. The majority against leaving the EU without a deal is overwhelming. This means May, or her successor, will have to go cap-in-hand to Brussels in the next few days and request another, longer delay to Article . This would mean Britain participating in the European elections in May, which excites the Independent Group of Tory and Labour rebels, but is looked upon with dread by the main parties. Brussels too is worried about populist contagion spreading to other EU countries like Italy, but they are legally bound to make British participation a condition of any further extension to AVoter wrath, particularly in Labourrsquos leave constituencies, could lead to a dramatic revival of Nigel Faragersquos Ukip, or worse. The Svengali behind the  Vote Leave campaign, Dominic Cummings, is gearing up for the fight and reportedly suggesting a new party to fight for the right to leave. ldquoTell them again is the favoured slogan. The European elections might themselves turn into a kind of second referendum on Brexit.The Tories will presumably have a new leader by then, since Theresa May will surely go now there is to be the long extension she has resolutely opposed. Mind you, it is impossible to guess the Prime Ministerrsquos thought processes. She said she would goher withdrawal deal passed on Friday. But her gambit didnrsquot work. Even the opportunity to dispense with Mayrsquos services was not sufficient inducement for the Democratic Unionist Party to come on board. The joke doing the rounds last week was that she tried to fall on her sword and missed.But these things have a momentum of their own, and the Tory leadership election has already begun. Boris Johnson is the narrow frontrunner, but that could change. He might win the membership, but under Tory rules the parliamentary party has to agree the two candidates put to a postal ballot. The remainers in the Tory benches might use this as an opportunity to foil the hard Brexiters by keeping Boris off the list.Of course, what should happen when a government fails to get its most important legislation through Parliament is not a leadership election, but a General Election. The government cannot govern and, even with the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, this should lead to a General Election via a vote of no confidence. Some Conservatives might prefer to fight a General Election than European elections they had promised would never take place. But events are now out of everyonersquos control.Everyone, that is, except the EU, which now holds Britainrsquos future in the balance. Itrsquos trying not to crow about Britainrsquos abject national humiliation, but the , not the UK Parliament, will now decide the UKrsquos immediate future: deal or no deal. If MPs agree this week to back a soft Brexit involving the customs union and alignment with the single market, Brussels has promised to fast-track it in a matter of days. But the alternative, a long extension, will also suit the European Union.That means more money from Britainrsquos budget contribution, and serves as a warning to other EU countries about the dangers of trying to leave the Union. It also holds out the possibility of Britain remaining in the EU,a referendum is eventually staged.Well, that remains to be seen. What is perhaps more likely is that Britain gets stuck indefinitely in a long extension. It emerged last week that the Democratic Unionist Party, which again voted against Mayrsquos withdrawal deal, could live with a long extension. Indeed, they signalled that they could live with a customs union ndash as long as it ensured no border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The DUP may be Brexiters, but they are ardent Unionists first.A soft Brexit may now be the best way of keeping the UK together. But it should be put to the people in a confirmatory vote,for no other reason than this was not what most people thought they were voting for in . MPs have the opportunity to decide this tomorrow.How and why Theresa May failed to seek the only kind of Brexit that could get through Parliament will be left for historians to judge. One of her own Cabinet ministers, quoted on BBC Newsnight, gave the provisional verdict: ldquoShersquos the sole architect of this mess because of her inability to engage in the most basic human interaction.

While younger patients have a better outlook, overall less than one in five patients survive for longer than five years after diagnosis. Survival rates are poor.Now, the protein that fuels it has been identied for the first time. Known as YTHDF, it triggers and sustains the disease.However, it is not needed for healthy cells to , meaning a medication that destroys YTHDF would be a potential cure.AML is a form of cancer that affects blood cells called myeloid cells, which include red blood cells, platelets and certain types of white blood cells. Patients experience uncontrolled growth of immature myeloid cells and do not produce enough healthy blood cells.Older people are most prone. Standard treatment is chemotherapy. If this fails the only hope is a stem cell or bone marrow transplant.The finding, published in Cell Stem Cell, could lead to a medication with signicantly less harmful side effects than existing chemotherapy.The aim would be to efficiently eliminate blood cancer cells in AML ndash without harming healthy ones.Researchers at Edinburgh University and Queen Mary University of London carried out a series of experiments to understand the role of YTHDF in blood cancer.Tests in blood samples donated by leukaemia patients showed the protein is abundant in cancer cells and tests in mice then found the protein is required to initiate and maintain the disease.Further trials enabled scientists to determine the biological pathway by which interfering with theof YTHDF selectively kills blood cancer cells. Importantly, they also showed the protein is not needed to support theof healthy blood stem cells.These are responsible for the production of all normal blood cells. In fact, blood stem cells were even more active in the absence of YTHDF.Professor Donal OrsquoCarroll, of Edinburgh Universityrsquos School of Biological Sciences, who co-led the research, said: ldquoThe study shows the promise of a novel class of drugs as the basis for cancer and regenerative medicine treatments.AML starts in young white blood cells in the bone marrow.

Girls wore chequered dresses while boys wore trousers and shirt. For a brief time, possibly a cultural thing shed brought with her from home, my mother sent me to school in a heavy kneeskirt, shirt and tie.No one  in my Northern Sydney primary had ever seen a school tie before. Didnt even know they existed. A bit of pleading ensued and soon I had my own chequered dress with its neat white collar and asymmetrical red ribbon at the neck.The light summer dresses came with their own mandatory accoutrements: scungies. Until quite recently Id assumed everyone knew the word scungies. Id no sooner have thought \"scungies\" unusual than \"water\" or \"bread\" but it turns out its the \"outwith\" of Australia. Its unique to the Aussie dialect.:Conversations about womens vulnerabilities feel so regressiveScungies, for those outwith the know, are giant pants. Hearty knickers, poofy bloomers. Youre basically kitted out in modesty preserving double-undies. Real undies under and big polyester pant protectors over.It was near year-round good weather,you can fathom such a thing, and we were outside all the time, running about, climbing on the playground equipment.I remember exchanges with my young male peers as we clambered up the metal climbing frame. \"I can see your pants!\" \"Thats not my pants, thats my scungies!\"Gas on a peep. I mean, it was all the dference of appearing in public in your underwear versus appearing in public in your swimsuit. Its the same bared flesh, but one covering is sociable attire and the other private, despite the two outfits being so similar as to the dference being all but semantics.Thinking back on it only now, werent those great big pants nothing but an early lesson in moulding girls to take steps to avoid the inappropriate impositions of boys. I cant ever once remember anyone calling back \"Well, you shouldnt be looking.\"No. It was incumbent on the girls to cover themselves. If you wanted to run and tumble and sit crossed legged, you must modestly avoid the male gaze, even aged six.:Call for Scottish state schools to be included in child abuse inquiryBut this is decades ago. We tell boys and men to mind their eyes and moderate their actions, of course.Of course not. On Twitter this week I noticed a mother lamenting the fact her daughters school had brought in playsuits for the girls. Not so they could romp around with the same unrestricted freedom as the be-trousered boys. No, because upskirting - little boys looking up girls skirts to see their pants - is increasingly a problem.I read this and my mind went to my scungie days of yore. The boys are causing a problem so lets solve it by covering the girls. We cant tackle the inappropriate behaviour so well remove the temptation by modying the victim.And theres the real problem with this messaging: it says to children, and the children in question here are also six, that girls are a temptation. They are there to be objectied. It says that boys shouldnt be expected to change and that girls are responsible for their behaviour.:Scottish teachers teaching three courses at the same timeThe mother, on social media, said she had challenged the head teacher on this policy and hed sent her a link to playsuits on the MS website by way of reply. What a missed learning opportunity that was.It can take years before women first learn they can and then learn the confidence to stand up to men who want to impose themselves on their spaces, who want to push at their boundaries.Every such opportunity should be taken to point out that, first and foremost, men should change.An AE doctor, Almas Ahmed, has been working since medical school to devise a make up that will withstand an acid attack. She had read about the ordeal of the television presenter Katie Price, who survived a acid attack in  that was orchestrated by her ex-boyfriend, and that  per cent of acid attacks worldwide are against women, and decided to create a \"super make up\" that would withstand being sprayed with corrosive liquid.\"People are still trying to destroy womenrsquos lives,\" Dr Ahmed said. You can only admire her ingenuity and tenacity in developing such a product but you can only despise the social framework that lead to her creating such a product in the first place. Without trust that this abominable problem can be solved, women are pushed to find their own solutions.From Avon and Somerset polices #JogOn campaign encouraging women to run in groups to avoid harassment and assault to the habit of focusing on whether women victims had been drinking, this persistently lingering tendency to focus on the behaviour of women and let men of the hook stunts positive change for all.A \"boys will be boys\" attitude isnt good enough - for the boys themselves, as well as the girls. Boys can be generous, kind, responsible and respectful, and they should be told that from the earliest possible opportunity.And by parents and teachers, though, not girls. Their lesson is that the only behaviour they are responsible for is their own."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-tuna-tantrums-and-blowback-for-the-sahara","story":"OUR story suggesting that folk in Glasgows west end can sometimes be a tad pretentious brings forth this example from reader Patrick Toal, who tells us: \"This was heard verbatim in the Waitrose supermarket in Byres Road ndash a three-year-old or thereabouts recalcitrant kid, brandishing a can of tuna, But Mummy!

The UK, including Scotland, would not have erged from EU laws and regulation, and there would not be any of the border problems between Scotland and the rest of the UK that a hard Brexitmight entail.If Brexit does go ahead, then the challenges will be bigger.On independence, Scotland as a European country would be entitled to apply to join the EU. If there was a lsquoyesrsquo vote in December , then orce talks ahead of actual independence might take around two years or more.

The European Commission would assess its application and recommend to the European Council whether to agree to open accession talks.Those talks would cover all  chapters of the EUrsquos rules and laws ndash itsacquis.

And it would doubtless in the meantime have an association agreement with the EU, like other accession candidates.SoScotland became independent at the start of , this analysis means it could take until  to re-join the EU.During this  year period, having an association agreement with the EU would be vital. It would set out Scotlandrsquos relationship with the EU in the interim .As long as Scotland had not erged from the EUrsquos rulebook, relatively rapid accession talks could be envisaged. But there will be substantive issues to negotiate, in particular where the UK had special deals and opt-outs.Scotland is unlikely to benefit from the UKrsquos current budget rebate, so its own budget contribution would have to be agreed in the negotiations.Scotland would also be unlikely to get any opt-out from the euro, so it would have to commit to eventually joining the euro . But the currency debate comes to the fore here.Read more:Greens savage SNPs economic plan for independenceIf Scotland had kept the pound sterling, but the UK was outside the EU, then Scotland would not be able to demonstrate that it could commit to join the euro at some indefinite future point.Nor ndashit took up to a decade to adopt its own currency ndash could it show that as a member state it would use its independent monetary policy to target price stability and make its exchange rate a lsquomatter of common concernrsquo with other member states . So this would be a signicant political challenge.Scotland would be likely ndash as both the UK and Ireland currently do ndash to request and probably get an opt-out from the Schengen border-free zone, in order to allow it to remain part of the Common Travel Area that currently exists between the UK and Ireland.But therersquos no obvious reason to expect the EU to replicate the UKrsquos current special opt-in deal for justice and home affairs issues, where the UK gets to lsquopick and mixrsquo which measures it opts into .Read more:Nicola Sturgeon advisers questions point of new Scottish currencyAn independent Scotland could, of course, decide to drop the goal of joining the EU ndash although this would be a major change.It could decide to apply to join the European Economic Areainstead ndash and accept the democratic deficit that Norway contends with, rather than be at the EUrsquos top table alongside Ireland and others.Keeping the pound would then be simpler on that score. But EEA membership might look more problematicthe rest of the UK did end up in a customs union with the EU .EEA members have to be in EFTA ndash and EFTA members have their own trade deals and cannot, without an exemption, be in a customs union with the EU too.Overall, an independent Scotland should have the prospect of a relatively swt and smooth route to re-joining the EU, subject to negotiating the substantive issues covered above.Read more:SNP hit back as Theresa May claims independent Scotland could not stay in EUThe politics of how the EU member states would look at Scotlandrsquos application to re-join would also be much more constructive, not least in the face of Brexit.Accession would still require unanimity, and the future politics of dferent member states, including Spain, cannot be guaranteed.

So very Rufus. In the cult series, Jackie Kennedy Onassisrsquo niece and sister are filmed struggling to make ends meet in a dilapidated, cramped apartment shy- sulking at a distance as the First Lady of America amasses inestimable fame and fortune.Itrsquos no coincidence such a queasy public autopsy of familial envy and entitlement appealed to the young Rufus, who was then only a star in his own head. The blazing constellation of the Wainwright musical dynasty simultaneously blinded the teenager with envy and lit the path ahead. Rufus neednrsquot have worried though ndash he would soon go supernova, outshining them all.At Glasgowrsquos Royal Concert Hall on Thursday, this -year-old battle-hardened elder statesman of arch-popera ndash tonight accessorising his advancing years with greying sideburns and moustache - deliberately and provocatively savoured that Grey Gardens line, dragging out its vowels with rolled-eyed irony and a devilish grin. Its clear this introspective, self-aware Canadian fully acknowledges this is the dreaded cash-in tour, a lsquowhole albumrsquo experience so beloved of artists who perhaps have a orce or tax bill looming. Or, simply, have been washed up on the barren shores of middle-aged creative bankruptcy.Itrsquos certainly not dficult to ldquoseparate the past from the present when people are willing to fork out a small fortune to hear tunes you wrote in another letime, perhaps to warm the embers of their own fading youthful fires. Blatant nostalgia requires a positive spin, however - so artists often call such shameless cash-ins anniversary tours, a celebration perhaps, and then confidently order that new : scale Great Pyramid replica for the front room. Everyonersquos a winner.Yet, this is Rufus Wainwright. A true golden child, a prodigious prodigy, a near-as-dammit musical genius revered by his peers and the public with nary an artistic mis-step in his esteemed catalogue. Hence, we can confidently assume therersquos deeper torrents stirring underneath overly-familiar surface waters of lsquothe hitsrsquo. For this is an artist, darling. And even nostalgia can be flipped on its head and reshaped as art, no matter how many layers of bejeweled flamboyance and costume changes eschew the true concept and meaning of the All These Poses tour.Not only did Rufus follow in his lauded parentsrsquo musical footsteps, he utterly eclipsed their cult fame in a blaze of baroque, sullen genius with his early s albums. And we are here tonight, according to the ticket, to celebrate the anniversary of the peerless Poses, released years ago. But, of course, therersquos more to this performance than simply electrocuting old corpses to see which one blinks. Tonightrsquos concert is not just an opportunity for Rufus to remind us why Elton John once called him the greatest songwriter alive. This is clearly also a wake, with the north star of the Wainwright clan taking the conscious decision to sing at the funeral of his youth.Such pretention would be unpalatable without true talent as a scaffold, but tonight we are left in no doubt of Rufusrsquo credentials as a peerless chanteuse. For all his prestigious musical gts, its this artistrsquos inimitable voice that remains his unique selling point ndash a devastatingly precise weapon of mass destruction, melting minds and bodies with depth, richness and audacious verve. A voice powerful enough, perhaps, to soundtrack its ownerrsquos own eulogy. For what transpires tonight is clearly an artist attempting to kill off his past to, perhaps, make way for new inspirations.Make no mistake ndash as le-affirming as Rufusrsquo performing abilities remain - death is the all-encompassing theme tonight. Visually, the thematic intent is obvious, with all the puzzle pieces of presentation coming together to form a cohesively New Orleans masquerade.The tour-tight band ndash each given their chance to shine tonight, particularly Jeff Buckleyrsquos former drummer Matt Johnson - are all dressed solemnly in black. The stark Cha Hotel backdrop projection is scratched out in thick, black impressionistic tears, like a crumbling memory. The ornate Sternberg piano is as black as the space between stars. The lighting is also consciously subdued, often leaving much of the stage in darkness. The Les Paul guitar sitting unloved on a stand has a skull and crossbones strap. Even Rufusrsquo feather boa is black. And, perhaps most tellingly of all, a bespoke coat of feathers which will be theatrically and rather literally employed during the jagged, rf-heavy, baroquely thumping Evil Angel from Poses is black. Undoubtedly, Rufus is telling us something. This is likely the last time his audience will hear these songs for a while.Quickly discarding his eponymous, ambitious yet over-reaching debut album with just eight of its  tracks, a gorgeous cover of Joni Mitchellrsquos Both Sides hints to where Rufusrsquo head is really at. After hiding under the glittery, ornate layers of his debut album, sleepily seducing the adoring crowd with a Leonard Cohen story hersquos told a thousand times, and once again narrating a playful diss at Seal hersquos timed to perfected over the course of this tour, Mitchellrsquos poetry leaves Rufus naked in the spotlight, emoting that wondrous melody with perfect pitch and grace. Ironically, through anotherrsquos writerrsquos words, we get the real Rufus: ldquoBut now its just another show You leave em laughing when you go Andyou care, dont let them know  Dont give yourself away. The lump in my throat remained for the rest of the performance, but many in attendance lost their reserve and wept openly. It was a moment where time seems to stop and all that existed was connection between artist and audience, a fleeting moment of sheer blissful transcendence.Rufus only giveshimself away twice more. Both during the showrsquos second half - a full-bodied, exotically embellished recreation of his undeniable, immortal  masterpiece Poses. The first glimpse of a dent in the armour was the delivery of the crescendo line in Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk: lsquoPlease be kind,Im a messrsquo. Unremarkable words at face value, yet he possessed the line tonight, holding the notes until his breath gave out. Another glimpse of creaking bones under the sparkly top hat, the darkness cloaked by that outrageous rainbow button coat, an ego asphyxiated by his black feather boa.The second moment of transcendence arrivesduring his cover of father Loudounrsquos lsquoOne Man Bandrsquo. On a surface level, itrsquos Rufus playing to the gallery with a knowing wink, living out the drama of his intergenerational dynasty. Yet, its skeletal accompaniment immediately startles, anchored down by The Voice sounding like Marleyrsquos chains ndash ancient regret filling every molecule of the room with hushed awe. \"People will know when they see this show  The kind of a guy I am  Theyrsquoll recognize just what I stand for and what I just cant stand Theyrsquoll perceive what I believe in And what I know is true.\"His lamentful, spat delivery of Loudounrsquos lyric left Glasgow in no doubt - Rufus clearly still harbours deep issues against his father. Yet, this prodigal son is well aware his voice jars with the lyricrsquos emotional honesty, his dadrsquos assured, heartfelt directness withwordshighlighting his own calculated distance as an artist. Itrsquos admirable hersquos willing to reveal his only weaknessis an inability to truly bleed ndash with Rufusrsquo main desire being tosimply put on a show, to impress, bedazzle, leave us in awe at his talents.

The council’s Infrastructure Services Committeeapproved the kerbside collection policy and procedures last year, including guidance on how to deal with contaminated bins. Any non-recyclable material placed into the recycling bin is classed as ‘contamination’, which could spoil the recyclates in any load. The recycling reprocessor may then reject whole loads as a result. Any rejected loads of recycling are disposed of at an additional cost to the taxpayer, for which there is no council budget available. Income which they would have generated to invest in services is lost.Collection crews will now visually check each recycling bin for contaminated recycling before emptying as a matter of course – those with severe contamination will not be emptied. Households consistently presenting severely contaminated bins will be offered advice and support to properly separate their waste. Those who ignore that advice could run the risk of their recycling bin being removed.Moderately contaminated bins will be emptied and an orange tag will be attached, providing information to the householder on how to properly use the recycling service. If a bin has not been emptied and tagged explaining why it has not been emptied, it is contaminated and the offending materials must be removed before the next collection. Crews will notto empty a rejected bin until the next scheduled collection day for the same bin.Bins considered to have little or no levels of contaminants will be emptied as normal.Collection crews will keep a record of bins unemptied due to overloading or contamination and this will be checked before a decision is made toto empty any bin reported as a missed collection.For those with a lot of recyclable materials, additional, free recycling bins can be requested by contacting the council’s Wasteline. Additional non-recyclable waste bins may also be authorised where there is a genuine need following a home visit and assessment by a Community Waste Officer. data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buchanobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Police Scotland\"  Police urge revellers to be safe and responsible viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"The council’s Head of Roads, Waste and Landscape services, Philip McKay, said: “It’s important residents understand how to recycle properly and make best use of the facilities available to them. “Sending waste to landfill costs more than double the amount it costs to recycle and tackling the levels of contamination in kerbside bins is intended to reduce the amount of recyclates sent to landfill.“We will be enforcing the procedures in a staggered rollout, tackling problem routes first.

Off-sales have been approved from am to pm Monday to Sunday.However, among ious conditions imposed by the licensing standards team, it was also agreed that the outdoor space to the rear of the premises will not be utilised by customers until a full licence is granted.The licensing board heard from Audrey Junner of agents Hill Brown Licensing that BrewDog had no intention to trade by way of occasional licences for an extended period of time.She added: “We would like to reassure members that a provisional premises licence has been submitted… for the avoidance of doubt my clients wholly accept that no assumptions can be made about the grant of that provisional licence.“They have undertaken the fit-out works at the business entirely at their own risk.”But licensing standards officer Lisa Gordini reminded the board that while a provisional licence had been applied for, it would not be discussed until the board’s June meeting and could receive representations or objections which could impact on BrewDog’s operation.She maintained there was an argument that the board should not be granting any occasional licences which may “conflict with the consultation process” of the provisional licence application.After considerable debate, board member Robbie Withey proposed refusal of the application, saying the authority expected a six-month consultation period to process applications and that the company – which operates  bars around the world – should have applied sooner.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Andy Beattie will be honoured with a new road named after him at Midmill Business Park\"  Honour for football manager viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"But admitting that the application was “a dficult one”, Gwyneth Petrie proposed making an “absolute exception” to usual practice and proposed approval."},{"url":null,"title":"strong demand at thainstone sale","story":"Over , buyers and sellers attended Thainstone#s collective sale of plant, machinery and equipment on Saturday, April .The sale saw an outstanding , lots forward, and the auction team sold  per cent of all items entered both on-site and online.Commenting Mark Barrack, Head of Specialist Auctions at ANM Group, said: “A strong crowd of buyers was present last week at our April collective auction, which saw consistent prices achieved for good quality lots across all categories.“The day’s leading prices came from two JCB CX excavators which were purchased using our online bidding  and sold to a buyer in England.

But, given the damage, it’s going to take some time before the walkway is operational again.“Until we know the full extent of the work required, it’s dficult to say with certainty how long it will be out of action, but it could be a number of months.“We realise this will cause inconvenience for passengers and for NorthLink Ferries.

We know that breastfeeding can be challenging, but we also know that a problem shared, is often a problem halved.

The council say that all profit would stay in the islands, enabling the local authority to preserve and enhance key services that local people value and depend upon. This, OIC believes, will provide a foundation for communities to drive transformational projects of their own.The council hopes that developments will allow it to join other local developers in making a meaningful contribution to a Needs Case for a new interconnector for Orkney, thereby substantially supporting the vital renewable energy industry in Orkney, including future development of the marine energy sector.OIC believes that the wider economic development value of a new cable to Orkney could be highly signicant, particularlya substantial proportion of local ownership can be secured — which could help employment and income remain in the county.Plans for a development of up to around MW in Hoy were announced to the local community last year — with sites for a development of up to MW on the island of Faray and up to MW on shoreside farmland at Quanterness outside Kirkwall now also being investigated.The proximity of the project at Quanterness to Kirkwall could also enable a separate private wire network project in which the council could directly supply electricity to its own buildings as a means to reduce costs.Public engagement events have been organised for Kirkwall, Eday and Rendall over the coming fortnight. Proposed plans for the developments will be on display at these, with elected members and council officers on hand to discuss the plans with members of the public. The proposed Quanterness site has the potential capacity for six m blade tip height turbines. The site on Faray has enough space for up to eight m blade tip height turbinesThe event details are as follows:An event will also be held in Westray, with the date yet to be confirmed.The current proposal at the third site in Hoy is to erect seven turbines, compared to the  presented in the original plans.The proposals for each site are expected to evolve as further site investigation work and consultation is undertaken. Site investigations, including bird and telecommunications studies, will be ongoing at all three sites.The council#s intention is to reach planning permission stage by the end of , ensuring all views and issues are fully explored and considered before any final decisions are made.  Proposals for how the applications will be determined are currently being considered.Councillor James Stockan, Orkney Islands Council leader said: “It is vital that the Council now takes an active ‘developer approach’ to energy projects in our islands. Not only does this allow us to maximise the resources available to us in the islands to support services and projects for local people, but it also allows us to contribute signicantly and in a meaningful way to allow our world-renowned local energy industry to survive and thrive through a new grid connection.“Our strategy is one that meets uncertainty head-on. The final details of proposals are by no means set in stone whilst investigations are carried out at the three sites, nor are all three sites guaranteed planning permission — and of course we also wish to take into account public opinion on the developments. Widening the net and moving to investigate three separate sites, allows us a degree of flexibility in the make-up of the final outcome.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The attraction’s website is slightly better, listing walking and cycling above car, but on a page called “Directions and Car Park”.In stark contrast, the Queen’s Gallery at the Palace of Holyrood next door has the opposite travel priorities in its publicity material. The “How to Get There” section of the leaflet for its current exhibition lists “on foot”, followed by “by bus” and “by tram”, and puts “by car” last.But I was even more impressed by the Edinburgh International Festival, which has espoused the green travel message for several years in its main programme.Under “Planning your trip”, it urges festival-goers to “please consider the environmental impact of your chosen form of transport. Travelling by train or bus can often take the sameof time as flying when you consider check-in times”.: Why protesters should be wary of ‘ years to climate breakdown’ rhetoric – Myles AllenIt adds: “We encourage our audience to think green and explore the city on foot, by bike or by public transport wherever possible”. This approach should be obvious – and the norm.Protest group Extinction Rebellion is noisily highlighting the urgency of action on the environment. But, as I’ve argued before, it’s not governments which will make a dference but the everyday actions of all of us.Many people find dficulty in relating to the big picture of where our planet is heading. But how we choose to travel is a very signicant part of that because transport accounts for one of the biggest sources of emissions and pollution.Some venues give discounts or offer priority treatment for those visitors who arrive by greener means. It’s not always going to be possible for everybody, or indeed for any of us every single time we make such journeys.However, visitor attractions and the tourist industry in general, which is so important to Scotland’s economy, must take seriously its responsibilities to set an example, being a signicant transport generator by its very nature.: World seems ambivalent about swt action on climate change – IPCC chairThere are partnerships between attractions and transport operators to incentivise visitors to take non-car options.But there are also many more opportunities to provide attractive, seamless travel choices. Planning a day trip from Glasgow to Mount Stuart on Bute on Sunday, I came across a combined train and ferry ticket and a combined ferry and attraction ticket, and I’m told there’s also a combined ferry and bus ticket between Rothesay and the house – but alas there’s not one with all four.Being able to do that – and online, in advance – is what people now expect to be able to do, considering pretty much anything  can be ordered from your mobile phone.Instead of venues, especially those in urban areas, offering free or discounted parking, regardless of need, they should be vying with each other to have the greenest credentials.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"v a dundee in running for world s richest museum honour","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Dundee#s new VA museum is in the running to win the world#s most lucrative museum prize - less than a year after opening its doors.The city’s acclaimed waterfront attraction has been named one of five contenders for the £, Art Fund Museum of the Year title.Designed by Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, it is the only Scottish attraction in the running for the honour, which is also Britain’s richest cultural award.More than half a million visitors have flocked to VA Dundee since the building opened in mid-September, while its arrival on the waterfront has helped Dundee become rated one of the world’s “must-visit” destinations in .VA Dundee’s rivals for the title include the Royal Navy museum at the decommissioned HMS Caroline in Belfast’s “Titanic Quarter,” the Nottingham Contemporary gallery, the Pitt Rivers Museum at Oxford University and the St Fagans National Museum of History in Cardf.Previous winners of the Art Fund’s title include the VA’s original th century attraction in London, Yorkshire Sculpture park, the Tate St Ives gallery in Cornwall and the Ulster Museum in Belfast.There has only been one previous winner of the award north of the border, the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, in Edinburgh, in .The judges for the Art Fund prize hailed VA Dundee as “both a striking intervention and a feat of engineering.”They added: “Born from a unique partnership between the VA, local government, universities, enterprise and communities, the new museum has helped regenerate the area.

A total of  per cent want another referendum in the future, but not within the next decade. While  per cent want one within the next two to five years,  per cent want one within the next five to ten years and  per cent did not know.The online survey asked the opinion of , adults across Scotland.The First Minister told MSPs on Wednesday that new legislation would be brought forward at Holyrood by the end of the year, which would provide the framework for a second vote. But any prospect of the UK government repeating the granting of a Section  order, which would allow Scottish ministers to hold a legally binding vote, was ruled out by Mr Lidington.“We don’t see any evidence that there is a demand from the people of Scotland to review the decision they took in ,” he said. “That referendum was said at the time to settle matters for a generation.“We don’t see that a Section  order is called for. I don’t see how it would help put right problems with Scottish schools and hospitals.“Devolution in Scotland has given many additional powers to the Scottish Parliament and some of those powers have not even be used. So I think there is plenty more that can be done in terms of the Scottish Government using the powers that are already there.”Askedhe would rule out granting a Section  order before , the minister said: “We have made it very clear we don’t think that is justied.”The First Minister indicated the Scottish Government would hold off requesting a Section  order. While Mrs May’s administration has ruled out granting one, the Prime Minister is widely expected to stand down in the coming monthsa Brexit deal can be secured. Mr Lidington refused to speculate on whether a new Tory government would be more likely to grant the order. The minister’s remarks were seized on by the SNP, with the party’s Westminster leader describing them as an “arrogant diktat”.Ian Blackford said: “Scotland’s future cannot and will not be decided by the arrogant diktat of this shambles of a Tory government, which has been rejected by Scottish voters at every election and which is soon likely to be out of office.“Whatever people’s views on independence, a strong majority of people back the Scottish Parliament’s right to determine the nation’s future.“Overwhelmingly, it is Holyrood – not Westminster – which the people of Scotland believe should have the right to decide this country’s democratic path.“The Westminster system is broken beyond repair and does not serve Scotland’s interests – something now conceded at senior levels in the Scottish Tory ranks.” But the Scottish Conservatives said the new polling proved there was no demand for another referendum.The Survation poll found more people were in favour of Scotland remaining in the UK than leaving.

Let’s therefore hope that this week the First Minister stands by her own words, and doesn’t cave in to her activists ahead of SNP conference.“Nicola Sturgeon should uphold the Sturgeon Test. Scotland doesn’t want yet more referendums – we want to move on and focus on the things that matter: improving our schools, making our streets safer and growing high quality jobs in Scotland.”A stand-off currently exists between the Scottish Government and Westminster over a second referendum. Power over the constitution lies with the UK government and Prime Minister Theresa May has so far rejected Sturgeon’s demands insisting, ‘Now is not the time.’A poll by the pro-independence Progress Scotland organisation earlier this month concluded that support for independence had fallen to below  per cent.But SNP deputy leader Keith Brown, who has been tasked with preparing the case for a second independence campaign, said Brexit turmoil has seen a backlash against the pro-Union parties in Scotland.“Since , across Westminster, the SNP have often been the only adults in the room, the only party focused on offering a serious sensible way forward out of the Brexit mess,” he said.“The Scottish Tories have completely sold out Scotland’s interests over Brexit and are happy to let Westminster do whatever they want to Scotland. “Meanwhile, Labour are quietly signing up to deliver a Tory Brexit – against the wishes of the people of Scotland – and without putting the issue back to the people. Labour and the Tories no longer have a positive vision to offer the people of Scotland. They are running scared of any debate over Scotland’s future.Sturgeon’s comments at the manesto launch came before the Brexit vote later that year which saw a majority of Scots vote to remain in the EU as the UK voted to leave. She insists this represented a “material change” in circumstances which opened the door for another vote.The pro-independence majority at the Scottish Parliament, combining SNP and Green MSPs, has also voted in favour of a second referendum being held.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Mrs Christie was thanked for her own dedication to the cadet forces in Co Antrim during her time in position, and was wished a very happy retirement for when she finishes in June.

Should anyone wish to help with this ring pulls can be left into Ballymena Sea Cadets on Tuesday evenings between pm and .pm. Chairperson Ruth Verner commented: “The hard work and dedication our cadets show is a credit to them, and we are very proud to have them in our unit. “Many of the qualications earned have meant the cadets had to go away for weekends to complete the courses, and when they are at school all week their weekends are precious, so to willingly give up the time to improve their skills is admirable. “We are also pleased to have built relationships with the Army Cadet Forces and look forward to continuing to work together to help and improve our local communities.

The Ballymenawanted to know how Morris came to be in the band. Morris tells how his grandmother had a small hotel in Carnlough and every Saturday night a “Sing Song” was held in the bar. It was mainly Ballymena people attendance.  He remembers Johnny Mitchell, who worked in the Waveney Laundry, bringing his friends every week. Johnny also brought musicians from Ballymena to play including Nellie King on piano and George Kernohan on accordion. Morris said: “George, who had a barber shop in Harryville would leave his accordion during the week with his grandmother. He would let me try to play it, upside down as I remember my first attempts! “During the summer months George’s brothers used to visit as well. ACCORDION“They were great singers and often talked about how well other relations were doing who had emigrated and formed a group called the Irish Rovers in Canada. The first time I heard “Bonnie Kellswater” sung was by an older man called Jimmy Fullerton. Great days, great times and a great introduction to performing music.”He continued: “Eugene O’Dornan from the Braid and I played as teenagers in our first band together. Eugene’s sister Maureen entered, or more properly bluffed me into entering a talent contest as I was very shy and horried at the thought. “Anyway the competition went well and from it I joined a Ballymena based band called “The Countrymen” managed by Harry Lynn and George Dillon.  Leo McCaffrey was the compere at the competition. Leo became a great friend and mentor and a major influence on my music career.”In  Morris went with Leo to play in the famous “Blarney Stone” in Vancouver. Members of the Irish Rovers would come into the Blarney Stone as they knew Leo well. Morris said: “I became great friends with Wilcil McDowell, the Irish Rovers’ Accordion player. I was already a fan of Wilcil’s playing as he too occasionally visited my grandmother’s hotel in Carnlough.“It was through Wilcil that I started to play keyboards on Irish Rovers recordings and take part as a guest musician on some of their videos.” When Morris retired from his day job he was delighted to take up an offer in  by George Millar, the bandleader, to join the Rovers. He said: “When Wilcil decided last year to stop touring with the band I moved from keyboards to playing accordion. Touring Canada with the band also meant I was able to meet up with some other Ballymena musicians now living there.“Paul Fynes who was in the Countrymen with me, and Kevin Erwin who played with Leo. Kevin was ill during my last visit and sadly passed away last year. One of the most talented people I have ever played with.”CONCERTCommenting on the concert which took place in Ballymena on March  Morris said: “It was lovely to perform in what I knew as Ballymena Town Hall.“ It was a great concert and I was so pleased it was a such a success, especially for George and Ian Millar. “Never easy playing in your home town with your relations sitting in the front row!“It never ceases to amaze me that after  years the Irish Rovers continue to play to sell out shows throughout Canada and the USA. They are a fabulous band and brilliant people to work with. “George and Ian are proud of being from Ballymena and the town is mentioned at every show. “The Irish Rovers videos, which are broadcast on American television really show off the local area and the Antrim glens. I’m sure this has a real positive impact on Tourism here. “The warm reception in the Mayor’s parlour just before the concert I think is a well deserved honour for the Millar family and it was an honour to attend it.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1733277.jpg--.jpg?1555495901000\n","title":"ballymena city of the eight towers","story":"Local children have created a new fantasy tower to add to Ballymena’s famous ‘crest’ !And it is one of a number of striking features on is new imagination-fuelled mural which has appeared asby magic in Bryan Street, with the help of Artists Leo Boyd, Laura Nelson and local children.Workshops were held in The Braid Arts Centre on the theme of comics and cartoons and, as a result, local children have delivered a new fabulous monster sized artwork for the town centre.The Bryan Street painting, which is part of a larger arts project called Opening Doors being delivered by the Arts Service of Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, was supported and partnered by BID, which is the Ballymena Improvement District.BID and Councils Arts Service identied some sites in the town centre for re-imaging and engaged professional mural artists to deliver workshops for local children.

I met him on a couple of occasions, and I think there was a strong, burning desire in his heart to preserve the best of education for all our young people.”Ulster and Ireland rugby star Rory Best tweeted: “Incredibly saddened to hear of the sudden loss of Mr Simon Harper, principal of my former school @pcportadown. Thoughts are with his family  friends.”A tribute issued on behalf of the Portadown College community said their friend and colleague was a “highly charismatic educator and leader” whose lelong passion for outdoor pursuits and Duke of Edinburgh award expeditions instilled a “love of the outdoors in all of the young people who participated in these ventures”.It is understood Mr Harper was on a walking holiday when he died.

He began his career in  as a Chemistry Teacherin Wallace High School, moving to Regent House School where he later was appointed Head of Chemistry and then to the Principalship of Rathfriland High School. From his early career,Simon excelled not only as a vibrant and engaging classroom teacher, but also as the leader of the largest Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme in the Province whilst at Regent House.Simon brought to Portadown College this lelong passion for adventure and outdoor pursuits by participating in Duke of Edinburgh expeditions and instilling a love of the outdoors in all of the young people who participated in these ventures.A hallmark of Simon’s Principalship was his heartfelt interest in students and staff as iniduals. So as to ensure that each knew their value, he was always ready to offer a gentle word of encouragement and would urge them to, “Do something today that your future self will thank you for”.Regardless of background, belief or personal circumstances, students, staff and parents were received with a warm smile and a sincere willingness to work towards a positive outcome. In all such situations, Simon gave of his time generously and graciously, always setting aside his own priorities to support others.Simon was a strong educational leader with distinctive values which he brought to a range of challenging situations. As a College community, we are indebted to him for the dedication and industry he demonstrated in working alongside the Board of Governors to advocate for the Dickson Plan, consistently placing students at the heart of his educational vision.A man of strong personality and principles, Simon espoused high standards in allaspects of College le and never once shied away from any criticism this might have attracted.Simon’s service to education in Northern Ireland extended beyond Portadown College and included holding office in the Craigavon Area Learning Community, Association of ControlledGrammar Schools and the Post-Primary Principal’s Association. His long standing career had also involved acting as Chief Examiner for A Level Chemistry with the CCEA.A passionate traveller who enjoyed adventures in the most far-flung corners of the globe,Simon was ever keen to share his experiences with students and staff alike, encouraging each and every one to get out into the world, savour its magnicence and seize every opportunity. One of Simon’s most distinctive qualities was that he never lost a childlike sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of the world. He took particular delight in his garden at the foothills of the Mountains of Mourne and regularly enjoyed walking these hills with his much loved Irish Deerhound companions, Oisin and Uther.Current and former students will remember with fondness his infectious sense of fun and wicked humour, from his cameo roles in College charity events to a starring role in “PC Happy”. In jovial banter with students, staff and Governors, he also shared his love for sport, in particular his longstanding support for Ulster and Irish Rugby, alongside Coventry City and Crusaders football teams.A man of eclectic taste, Simon derived considerable joy from art and music of all genres - classical, Irish folk and contemporary. Proud of his Banbridge roots and passionate about his Ulster culture, he demonstrated a reverent respect for tradition, as exemplied through his meticulous attention to detail and great pride in leading the College’s annual Act of Remembrance.Indeed, Simon often reflected poignantly on the sacrice of others and had served proudly as an officer in the Royal Naval Reserve for almost a quarter of a century.Students and staff alike will hold dear the sentiment of Simon’s final Easter Assembly, inspired by his many visits to Coventry Cathedral, in which he spoke on the theme of Forgiveness and the message of Hope in the death and resurrection of Jesus themes deeply important to Simon and ones which he sought to enact in his daily le.As a College community, our loss is immeasurable. However, we will endeavour to uphold the College Motto “Fortiter et Humaniter” in Simon’s memory:May the road rise up to meet you.May the wind be always at your back.May the sun shine warm upon your facethe rains fall soft upon your fieldsand until we meet again,may God hold you in the palm of His hand."},{"url":null,"title":"traffic and","story":"The Department for Infrastructure has warned motorists to expect icy conditions on roads in the north, west and south of the Province tomorrow morning.

They know they are in the UK but don’t realise they are on a dferent land mass to England. We provide basic information on housing, hospitals, police serviceand run walkabouts and talk-abouts to bring people around and show them basic things like buying a bus ticket or using an ATM. These are things that you and I take for granted.“Our other main thing is the reach to resilience programme. We deliver family support across Belfast. This can be everything from learning to say no, IT skills, safety on the internet and workshops.“The European employment service programme also provides information on free movement on labour across Europe, something which is attracting huge interest given the threats of Brexit.”It is perhaps the John Hewitt Bar, located just around the corner from the Belfast Unemployed Resource Centre, which is the hidden gem of the organisation.Not many people know that the BURC own the bar as a social enterprise, meaning all profits go back into funding their key projects outlined here.The bar was the first social enterprise bar set up in the north and continues to run as a competitive business in the Cathedral Quarter, serving food and it is very popular for its range of beers.Aisling says the location of the BURC is beneficial for service users and hopes their programmes will continue to benefit those who need them.“These programmes are hugely important. The centre is located on the outskirts of the city centre, people can come all over. We can reach a wider network of people and bring the programmes to them.“We are also keen to deliver programmes in their own areas before they feel safe to come to the city centre office.“Our overall aim is to try and bring people back into the local community.“One such challenge today is some people coming to us to report incidents of racism because they don’t feel comfortable going to police. We can help support them and give them advice on how to deal with such an issue and not just accept it as an everyday occurrence.“Overall, the general feedback from people has been very positive. For mothers, learning how to say no is an important issue. We want to give people the confidence, skills and knowledge to try things a bit dferently and explore the way they react to things.“Many of our programmes have come out of other ones – all our work is led by the inidual and other service users.“We want to give people skills of a community leader to empower themselves and help them in every way possible.”Belfast Unemployed Resource Centre,- Donegall Street Place,Belfast,BT FNTel:   Email: info@burc.org or esol@burc.org For more information, visit www.burc.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"its double delight for little daithi","story":"THE family of little Dáithí Mac Gabhann are celebrating after learning that their son has made the shortlist for the annual British Heart Foundation’s Heart Hero awards.It was discovered during a routine -week scan that little Dáithí’s heart had not developed as it should have and it was found that the now two-year-old toddler had Hypoplastic heart syndrome. At only four-days-old Dáithí travelled to London where he underwent open heart surgery. Six days after that he underwent his second open heart operation.Since the family’s ‘Is Deontóir Mé Yes I Donate’ campaign began back in July , it has since been reportedthat an increase of four percent of people in the north have opted onto the organ donation register. Dáithí’s parents Máirtín and Seph told the Andersonstown News how delighted they were to learn of the news and that their visit to London for the event in September will coincide with the toddler’s third birthday. “The British Heart Foundation run their annual Heart Hero award every year,” explained Seph.“Máirtín put in the application for it, it was basically a , word essay and we got an email the other day saying that Dáithí had been shortlisted to the last three. “The event is going to be held in the Globe Theatre in London, we are so over the moon, we can’t believe it,” she said. Seph and Máirtín also spoke of how their campaign has taken striking visual awareness with the addition of Dáithí’s pink Is Deontóir Mé slogan and picture emblazoned on a black taxi.“To see the logo on the taxi fills us with so much pride, everyone is going to see it on the road and evenit makes somebody stop and turn around, maybe think twice about organ donation for a wee second, it makes all the dference.”Máirtín added: “I can’t really put it into words how happy we are to find out that Dáithí has been shortlisted for the Heart Hero award. We have sparked up a great relationship with the British Heart Foundation for a couple of months now. They do absolutely unbelievable work that will benefit Dáithí and people like Dáithí, they also work on the promotion of organ donation as well.“In these very hard times, to hear that Dáithí is worthy of this award is great for us. “We are really looking forward to going back to London as Dáithi’s hospital is not that far from where we are going to be – not that we were looking to go into an ICU ward but we can’t wait to bring Dáithí in. The last time the staff saw him he was such a tiny baby, his chest was open, they were preparing us for the worst. Dáithi is turning three when we are over and we can’t wait to show him off to all the doctors and nurses who saved his le.”“Being from West Belfast, I’ve used black taxis all my le, five times a week, twice a day, all my le. To know we have my son on the taxi in bright pink is brilliant, everytime we see the taxi we cheer, Daithí shouts out the car window ‘meeeeeeeeeee’. We want to thank driver Micky Russell for helping us to create awareness, it looks class, we are delighted,” he said.Micky added: “There are only two things you can see from space, the Great Wall of China and my taxi,” he laughed. “It’s an absolute privilege to have the wrap around on the taxi, to create that visual awareness. The taxi is up and down the road, the Shankill, I’ve tourists in the taxi as well, they would ask ‘why the colour ’ I can say to them about organ donation and Dáithí.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"julie file locked for 45","story":"THE sister of a -year-old Lenadoon girl killed by aplastic bullet in  has hit out a decision to lock the National Archives file on her death for another  years. Julie Livingstone was ing from a local shop on the Stewartstown Road when she was fatally injured by a plastic bullet on , May . The round, which was fired from a British Army vehicle, struck her on the head and she died the next day. Earlier this week, researchers at the Pat Finucane Centre in Derry revealed that files held at the National Archives in Kew, London, relating to Julie’s death are to be kept closed until . Earlier this week it was reported that a further file relating to the plastic bullet death of a child has been locked for decades. -year-old Paul Whitters, who died on April , ,  days after being struck in the head with a plastic bullet fired by the RUC in Derry, has been closed until .It is extremely unusual for inidual files to be held on people killed in the conflict – the fact that these two files relate to schoolchildren has raised questions about why their deaths have been given such attention and what facts lie within the files that the British government wants to hide. The Northern Ireland office has said the files have been closed “in the interest of national security”. Reacting to the discovery, Julie’s sister, Elizabeth Livingstone, said that justice had been withheld from her family “for long enough”.“None of us – my brothers or sisters – are going to be alive by the time the file is opened again,it ever is,” she said. “Our parents have already passed away and nobody who ever knew Julie will be alive by then. What could possibly be pertinent to a -year-old’s death – a child’s death – that needs to be kept a secret  What is it that we’re not allowed to know about our sister’s death  We had to go through three inquests to clear Julie’s name. Ultimately, Julie was found to be an innocent victim, but that was after several years of us struggling to get a fair inquest. We already thought that justice had been withheld from us for long enough.”She continued: “It’s not a case of ‘Are they hiding something ’ This is about what’s being hidden. It’s obviously something that would prove to be an embarrassment to the British government and the NIO. Our Julie was a -year-old innocent victim. She was going about her own business when she was shot in the head and murdered. What could they possibly not want us to know about it  Your imagination runs wild. The only thing we could do for her was to get justice and now this has happened.”Paul O’Connor from the Pat Finucane Centre described the decision to close the files as “perverse”.“The decision to close Julie’s file until  was made earlier this year,” he explained. “There’s another file on plastic bullets in general, which is closed until  and it beggars belief. I have never seen anything like this before. We see lots of files closed for a long time, but these two files on the deaths of children who were killed by plastic bullets, one by the British Army, one by the RUC.” He added: “There is a total culture of secrecy within the NIO, within Ministry of Defence, and from all of those who want to protect the reputation of RUC and the British Army. They don’t want this information to come out, but it will come out. I’m confident that this file will not be closed until .”The Livingstone family have since written to the Secretary of State, Karen Bradley, to request a meeting about the NIO’s decision. Relatives for Justice CEO, Mark Thompson, called on Ms Bradley to order the release of the files.“Julie was  years of age when she was killed by a plastic bullet in ,” he said. “Her father Archie travelled these islands and Europe telling the world what happened to his baby girl. Along with the other families and injured in the United Campaign Against Plastic Bullets, he wanted to make a positive dference, to shine a light of truth and justice in the face of the horror his and other families endured. All families who have experienced state violence know that the British government will go to any s to protect its own interest. This strategic policy of impunity for the killing of Irish children clearly extends even to librarians and archives keepers. They too are complicit in the policies that accompany British state violence. This decision, undoubtedly made under direction, was made while families are asked to engage in a consultation on dealing with the past. This discovery points to the bad faith behind this consultation, as well as displaying the callous indference of those responsible. The least Karen Bradley can do now is meet with the families of Julie Livingstone and Paul Whitters. The very least the keeper of the archives can do under Bradley’s instruction is give the families these files.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Feature-pic-copy.png","title":"road safety on agenda for lisnasharragh rep","story":"MANY of you will have heard about the need for road safety improvements to four specic spots in the upper Ormeau area, writes Stevie Jenkins. They are the crossing at Ormeau Road and St John’s Avenue, the intersection of Knock Eden Park and Knockbreda Road, the entrance to Cherryvale Playing Fields and outside the Good Shepherd Church. I was delighted to be able to update the community face-to-face at the inaugural ‘Empowerment through engagement’ public meeting in the newly-built Good Shepherd Parish Centre. We took those present through the criteria obtained from the Department for Infrastructure for each of the locations. There followed a very constructive conversation with the local stakeholders present. The residents, school, youth and sporting organisation leaders all had ideas about how we could work together to build a profile to meet the department’s requirements, thus speeding up progress and change. We then arranged a face-to-face meeting between the stakeholders and the department. We voiced our concerns, including the fact that, at no time in the assessment process for new crossings, was there a public consultation.Such was the success of the meeting that arrangements were made for a second meeting on mental health, an interactive session with the superb local organisations Aware, Inspire and PIPS. Each of these bodies showcased what they do and how we can improve mental wellbeing in our area. Again, the focus was on introducing the local community to important organisations who can help us to access better services. One of the most pleasant effects of the meetings is the frequency of inquiries from constituents about the next meeting. An inquisitive community is an empowered community. I am delighted to confirm that the next meeting is on local history and will take place in May."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the pen is mightier than the sword","story":"Address by Father Martin Magill at the funeral of Lyra McKee at St Anne#s Cathedral.May I speak in the Name of the Living God.First of all, I want to thank Dean Stephen Forde for his kind invitation to give this reflection today. I have no idea what you Sara, Lyra’s partner must have felt on Thursday night when those shots rang out and Lyra was hit and fell to the ground.I can’t begin to imagine what you Lyra’s mum, and you her sisters and brothers must have gone through when Sara phoned to tell you Lyra had been shot. I can’t imagine the agony of your drive to Altnagelvin hospital knowing that Lyra had died.Many of us here in this cathedral have been praying for you since we heard the dreadful news and will continue to do so.Since the story of Lyra’s murder broke on Holy Thursday into Good Friday, there has been an enormous sense of grief and solidarity with you from many people at this huge injustice. Many, many wonderful things have been said about her including the warm and deserved tributes paid to her by the Secretary of State and by MPs of all parties in the House of Commons yesterday evening. In death Lyra, has united people of many dferent backgrounds, as further evidenced by this erse congregation at her funeral.Like so many others I couldn’t believe it when I heard the am news on Good Friday morning that Lyra McKee had been shot dead the previous night. I’d met Lyra on several occasions, we had kept in contact by phone, ‘what’s app’,and Twitter. I would however have to confess that I wasn’t aware of her great love of Harry Potter. I hadn’t heard the term ‘Hufflepuff’ until I did an internet search and found this definition # ‘Hufflepuff is the most inclusive among the four houses valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play.’ It struck me that the definition could just as easily have been about Lyra. Whilst Harry Potter didn’t feature in our conversations what did and it was our last exchange on Twitter at the end of March when Lyra tweeted me with a photo of herself dressed in a nun’s veil with a glass of cider accompanied with these words: ‘Got roped into performing as part of a Sister Act tribute act for Foyle Hospice. Hey @MartinJMagill, you need any help with mass tomorrow ’Let me give a brief overview of Lyra’s le. She was born on st March . She attended Holy Family PS just off the Limestone Road. In her early days at school, she struggled with reading and required extra support.Things changed dramatically when one of her teachers, Mr O’Neill began to read to her class The Twits by Roald Dahl. This was the spark that got Lyra interested in reading and then thanks to her granny Patricia Lawrie buying her each of the Harry Potter books as they were published this led to her le long interest in Harry Potter and later on to exchanges in social media with JK Rowling.Lyra’s love of reading was further nurtured when she went to St Gemma’s High School, just off the Oldpark Road also in North Belfast. Her interest in journalism began at the age of  when she wrote for the St Gemma’s school newspaper.Shortly afterwards Lyra became involved in a charity called “The Headliners’ which gives young people a voice by using journalism and media as a tool for learning and campaigning. This project played an important part in her being awarded the Sky News Young Journalist Award . After school and further education, Lyra studied online journalism at Birmingham City University graduating with an MA degree. Over the years her writing has won her much acclaim such as her letter when she was  to her  year old self about growing up as gay in Belfast. In , aged just , she was acknowledged internationallyas an exceptional achiever with an exciting future by Forbes magazine in their  under  listbecause of her work as an investigative reporter.Last month thefeatured Lyra in an article considering the  rising stars of Irish writing. Her memory also lives on in her TEDx talk, #How uncomfortable conversations can save lives”, about the  Orlando nightclub shooting. Her book on the murder of Rev Robert Bradford, the Member of Parliament for South Belfast, called Angels with Blue Faces was due to be published later this year.Lyra came to see me as part of her research on a book she was working on called Lost Boys. We met on several occasions and kept in contact. I knew absolutely nothing about  year old Thomas Spence and  year old John Rodgers, who vanished at a bus stop onthe Falls Road in West Belfast in November . They were both living in St John’s Parish at that time where I am presently the parish priest and it was for this reason Lyra came to see me. By the time Lyra had told me their story and what she hoped to do, I was fully behind her. Nichola her sister who spoke earlier described Lyra like #a dog with a bone’ when she had found something that interested her.I certainly experienced her gentle, determined doggedness. When we exchanged greetings on New Year’s Day and I wished her well not only in the writing of Lost Boys but also in her search for the remains of the boys which she made clear to me was very important to her. She replied in this way: ‘If that#s the only thing that comes out of this, it#ll be worth it. It#s the only thing I really want out of it, to find them and the others.’In the course of her investigations, Lyra had discovered that other children had disappeared and she had wanted to find their bodies.I pray that her work will be taken up and that their bodies will be found and even more importantly that there will be no more ‘lost boys’ or ‘lost girls.’When I consider Lyra’s determination, it strikes me that she was the embodiment of the St Gemma’s school motto: ‘truth and charity.’ On Good Friday, the day on which Christians all over the world recall the suffering and death of Jesus Christ we also wrestle with the mystery of suffering. For you Lyra’s nearest and dearest, you came to know the experience of Good Friday in your own lives. For those of us who follow Jesus, we believe that the shedding of his innocent blood on the cross was enough # in the words of the hymn: ‘the cross has said it all’. We don’t need any more innocent blood to be shed.The irony could not be more poignant when we consider the signing of the Good Friday agreement which was about ensuring there would be no more deaths like Lyra’s. Earlier in this service, we listened to Matthew’s account of the Beatitudes which was chosen by her family in remembrance of Lyra learning these by heart when she was a pupil at St Gemma’s. The beatitude ‘Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God’is very timely. Many of us will be praying that Lyra’s death in its own way will not have been in vain and will contribute in some way to building peace here. Since Thursday night we have seen the coming together of many people in ious places and the unying of the community against violence. I commend our political leaders for standing together in Creggan on Good Friday. I am however left with a question: ‘Why in God’s name does it take the death of a  year old woman with her whole le in front of her to get us to this point ’ As Christians recalled the death of Jesus on the cross, we remembered that his death was not in vain but was for us the doorway to eternal le. I dare to hope that Lyra’s murder on Holy Thursday night can be the doorway to a new beginning. I detect a deep desire for this. One of Lyra’s friends was reported as saying: ‘We have had enough. There is a younger generation coming up in the town and they don#t need guns put in their hands.They need jobs, they need a better health service and education. They need a le, not a gun put in their hands.’ To those who had any part in her murder, I encourage you to reflect on Lyra McKee journalist and writer as a powerful example of ‘The pen is mightier than the sword’.I plead with you to take the road of non violence to achieve your political ends. It was encouraging to see that those who provide a political analysis to the organisation responsible for her death chose to call off their parade on Easter Monday following the call from Fr Joe Gormley, the parish priest in Creggan where Lyra was killed. To those still intent on violence, I ask you to listen to the majority of the people on your beloved island of Ireland who are calling on you to stop. I pay tribute to the courage and determination of the women who in a very powerful gesture of non violence,one by one placed their hands in blood red paint on a wall and said loudly ‘we are not afraid.’ I commend the + people in Creggan who have contacted the police. There is a rule in many of our communities that we do not, we should not, give information to police and that, to do so is to become a ‘tout.’ But that was one of a number of rules # rules that also said that it was OK to brutalise children for petty crimes, or rules that say you can live in the locality until you are told you can’t or rules that said that the only way we could gain ‘freedom’ was by other fellow-human beings losing their lives. But this week I have seen these rules turned on their head. I have seen many people stand up and condemn this culture of violence and coercive control. We need to send a very dferent message and so I appeal to those who have information about Lyra’s murder but who haven#t yet come forward to do so now. If you want to see an end to these brutal rules, and see a new society built on justice and fairness, on hope and not fear, then you can help build that society by letting the police know what you know. There will be special measures put in place to ensure your safety and where you will not be intimidated by coercive controllers,you do so.To the many politicians present in this cathedral today, let me say again those words which one of Lyra’s friends had said: ’the younger generation need jobs, they need a better health service and education. They need a le, not a gun put in their hands.’ As politicians you will be familiar with the first report of the Independent Reporting Commission published last October which examined in depth paramilitary style attacks and found a clear correlation between these attacks and areas of social deprivation. Lyra’s friend is right in pointing out that our young people need jobs, and education and training to get those jobs. All our young people need a le that gives them an aspiration for the future. As our politicians we need you to be working together to make that happen so that especially for those living in deprived areas that they will feel the peace process is working for them as well – and especially for young people living in these communities. To the press and media which Lyra was so proud to be part of – I ask you to report on what is being done in these areas – to praise good work where you find it and report when it is not happening. I know you as politicians have a very dficult job to but then so too did Lyra. There is another valuable lesson from her le # she was like ‘a dog with a bone’ when she believed she could make a dference. When it comes to our peace process, I would love to see this dogged attitude to the rebuilding of an Assembly that works for the common good. As I listen to the radio every morning, all I seem to hear about ious initiatives in Northern Ireland are these words, ‘without a minister, this can’t be taken forward’. I pray that Lyra’s murder may be the catalyst needed for parties to start talking, to reform that which was corrosive in previous Assemblies and to begin anew. On Easter Sunday, Christians all over the world celebrated the most important event of the Christian year, the resurrection of Jesus. It was because of his resurrection that we believe in le beyond the grave and in the words of today’s second reading from John : ‘in my Father’s house there are many dwelling places.’ It is in this hope of eternal le and happiness that we gather in prayer and now into the tender mercy of a loving God and Father I commend Lyra McKee. Amen."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38048914.ece/30317/BINARY/_1FW54X-_Read-Only_.jpg","title":"applause tears and laughter at a farewell like no other to lyra mckee","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Lyra McKee was murdered in Creggan in Derry on Thursday th April.Photo by Kelvin Boyes   Press Eye.\"The funeral of Journalist Lyra McKee takes place at St Annes Cathedral in Belfast on April th  \"Mourners begin to gather for the funeral of Lyra McKee at St Annes Cathedral in Belfast on April th  In a response redolent of what happened at Princess Dianas funeral in London in , hundreds of people who had gathered outside the cathedral also clapped as they listened to a relay of the priests words in Donegall Street, where from early morning it was obvious that Lyras send-off was going to be a funeral like no other.Young people dressed in the colourful garb of Harry Potter characters and comic book heroes came in their hundreds to say their painful farewells, but also to give thanks for their slain friend, who they called \"a girl in a million\".Some mourners carried rainbow flags in honour of Lyra, a committed campaigner for LGBT rights.Prime Minister Theresa May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn took time out from their fraught Brexit negotiations to join Irish President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to pay tribute to Lyra.Few disputed the north Belfast author and journalist was destined to write herself into the annals of the great wordsmiths, but sadly she made headlines of horror and heartbreak across the globe after being killed by dissident republicans.One friend said she hoped the message from yesterdays funeral that would go out around the world would be how the murder had crystallised the fact that there was for once at least a united Ireland - united in abhorrence of Lyras murder by a New IRA gunman.However, the tears of sorrow yesterday for Lyra were also fused with tears of laughter as her friends and family celebrated her remarkable le that, they said, was full of fun and joy. And compassion and love.People from a myriad of backgrounds, from all generations, of all sexual orientations and from all religions and none, showed the world - which Lyra had at her talented feet - an unmistakable and unshakeable determination that they will not allow her death to have been in vain, and that as in her le, her passing must make a dference.It was also a powerful message that the New IRA must listen to the demands that it should give up violence once and for all.Even the choice of St Annes Cathedral for the service was powerfully symbolic in itself, a recognition of an all-too-rare shared space in what has been a ided city.Only pre-eminent churchmen, sports stars, business leaders and musicians are usually accorded funeral services in the historic building.And normally they have been older men and women who have lived their lives, not a young woman who was still on the threshold of hers and who wasnt even born of the Protestant persuasion.The service was broadcast live by the British-based  hour news channels and dozens of photographers and journalists from English newspapers were in attendance.Lyras murder may have catapulted her into the public domain, but at her funeral her love for her family was also underscored by inspiring addresses about the private side of the daughter who would phone her mother Joan  times a day to check that she was all right - \"even when she was upstairs\".Lyras sister Nichola Corner spoke on behalf of herself, her distraught mother, her sisters Joan and Mary and brothers Gary and David.Nichola told mourners that Lyra had been buried with a flower in her hair in response to her love of the Scott McKenzie song San Francisco.She said the family didnt have Dumbledores time turner to change the past.\"But within each of us we have the power to create the kind of society that Lyra envisioned,\" she added.\"In the words of Lyra herself, we must change our own world, one piece at a time. Now lets get to work.\"Lyras friend Stephen Lusty - a self-avowed \"middle-class, middle-aged Protestant heterosexual British male engineer\" - told the congregation that she had told him just hours before she died that she was going to propose to her partner Sara Canning in New York.\"She showed me pictures of the ring she had bought for Sara and told me of the fabulous plans she had of her proposal in May,\" said Mr Lusty.\"She made me put a date in my diary for the wedding in Donegal in  and gave me strict instructions to wear my kilt, which she always wanted to borrow, adorn it with some Harry Potter, and to find or refind my own version of Sara.\"He laughingly referred to the questions she would ask him out of the blue about whether it was closer to drive to Derry or Londonderry, or why Protestants ate more vegetables than Catholics.Mr Lusty said that after he introduced the indefatigable Lyra to the late southern politician Brian Lenihan, he described her as a \"star\".But he added: \"I would rather do  rounds in the boxing ring with Paisley than do that again.\"He said that in her online journalistic work Lyra received \"more than her fair share of cyber abuse and trolling, but she never hated anyone\".He said his generation had sung about an alternative Ulster - the words of a song by Belfast punk band Stf Little Fingers - but added that people here should now build an alternative Ulster and make peace a lasting legacy of Lyra McKee.Speaking at the beginning of the service, Dean Stephen Forde said: \"Lyra was a person who broke down barriers and reached across boundaries, this was her hallmark in le, this is her legacy in death.\"As a journalist she pursued truth wherever it took her, never content with the sullen silence of unanswered questions.\"She was a child of the Good Friday Agreement.\"She was a primary school pupil in north Belfast when the Agreement was signed.\"She grew up to champion its hope for a society that was free from the prejudices of the past and open to the possibilities of a new future for the people of these islands.\"In her short le Lyra had amassed an extensive network of friends and influential contacts, especially in the realms of crusading and investigative journalism.And the esteem in which she was held was reflected in the fact that upwards of  writers and broadcasters formed a guard of honour for her as her coffin was carried out of the cathedral.The size of the overall attendance underlined the reality that St Annes was the only church big enough to accommodate everyone who wanted to pay their respects to the diminutive girl with the towering and prodigious spirit from a couple of miles up the road in Ardoyne.For many of the people at the service it was their first ever visit to the Church of Ireland cathedral.Lyras family had requested that everyone should give her a dignied send-off but the -minute service wasnt all about solemnity and sadness. Lyras partner Sara had said on Facebook that the \"love of her le\" would like itpeople would wear Hufflepuff, Harry Potter or Marvel-related items at the service.Her friends didnt let her down and Hufflepuff colours were everywhere on scarves and T-shirts emblazoned with #teamlyra.No one was expecting to see DUP leader Arlene Foster or Sinn Fein vice-president Michelle ONeill wearing Hogwarts outfits.But the fact that they were there at all was interpreted by many as a sign of hope.However, that is what many commentators said when the same duo shook hands at the Requiem Mass for Martin McGuinness in the Bogside just over two years ago.\"And look what good that did us,\" one observer pointed out yesterday.But she added: \"The only dference today is that the calls at the funeral were so vocerous and so unanimous that its hard to see how they can be ignored.\"Famous faces voice support for familyAs hundreds gathered at St Anne’s Cathedral yesterday for the funeral of Lyra McKee, many other prominent voices shared their support on social media.Comedian Patrick Kielty posted: “Today Lyra McKee is laid to rest. She believed in peace, tolerance and equality. The exact opposite of those responsible. They will never win because Lyra will always be the future. And her truth will continue to be told.”Actress Bronagh Waugh said: “Thinking of Lyra’s family and friends and partner Sara who have the unfathomable burden of laying her to rest today.“Thinking of the people of Derry, of Belfast. But most of all I’m thinking about Lyra and what a bright and shining light she was.”"},{"url":null,"title":"boojum eaterie rapped over easter advert","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was the headquarters for the longest continuous campaign in British military history after troops were sent into Northern Ireland in August  to cope with growing sectarian unrest.What was described as a temporary and emergency move lasted for  years and only ended in , long after the ceasefires by the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries.Organisers say they are disappointed that the Ministry of Defence are not backing their event. They were told by the MoD that they are supporting another Op Banner commemoration which is being staged by the Royal British Legion at the National Memorial arboretum in Staffordshire on Wednesday, August .NIVAs event is being held three days later. And the organisation insist that while their members are concerned about the recent charging of soldiers with historical killings in Northern Ireland like Soldier F in relation to Bloody Sunday, their commemoration on Saturday, August  will be a memorial, not a protest.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetThe day will start in Lisburns Wallace Park with a drumhead service before a parade around the city where wreathes will be laid at three dferent points including the scene of a  explosion which killed six soldiers ing from a charity fun run in a minibus.Other floral tributes will be left at Lisburns war memorial and at a statue in honour of the UDR.Organisers say all veterans will be welcome at the commemoration, dating right back to the B Specials and the RUC along with ex-members of the UDR and the Prison Service.But representatives of the Garda Siochana and the Irish Army have also been invited to take part.\"Its a completely inclusive programme,\" said Ian Simpson, media spokesman for NIVA and the chairman of the NI Prison Service Benevolent Fund.One of the centrepieces of the NIVA remembrance day will be the display of the names of soldiers, police officers and prison staff that died in Northern Ireland.There will be , names on a big screen and in remembrance books, twice the number of personnel listed in official records as having been killed in terrorist attacks.NIVA say their roll of honour also includes men and women who died as a result of suicides, accidents and stress-related illnesses which developed as a result of the Troubles.NIVA say they are not inviting serving military chiefs or Royal family members to the Lisburn event although a retired Army general will take the salute.Ian Simpson said: \"The VIPs on the day will be the widows or the families of the people who died. All the organisations within NIVA will nominate representatives to take the salute too.\"He said the decision to hold a separate memorial event here rather than to take part in the national one in England was because this is where it all happened.\"There will be veterans attending both events,\" added Ian. \"And we will still be going to a ceremony we hold every year at the Ulster Ash Grove at the National Arboretum in September. But we thought it was important to have a local ceremony to remember everyone who died or was hurt.\"Organisers are hoping that upwards of , veterans will take part in the parade with , relatives and members of the public in attendance.Tens of thousands of service personnel were injured in the conflict which saw , soldiers coming to Northern Ireland over the  years of Op Banner.\"Taking in the police and the UDR you are talking about half a million people who saw service,\" said Ian, who added that while remembrance of the dead will be the main priority, it wont be the only focus of the Lisburn event.Old security forces vehicles and a scout helicopter will be there for people to see in the centre of Lisburn along with private collections of unorms, decommissioned weapons and regimental memorabilia.\"We want it to be a special day,\" said Ian, who has urged opponents of the security forces to respect the NIVA commemoration. We will be there to remember our fallen colleagues in a peaceful and dignied way and we would ask everyone to respect our day. We are not out to offend anyone.\"Organisers say the parade around Lisburn will include  local bands who have been issued with strict code of conduct about what is expected of them with no colour parties or flags on display.The original hope was that the Ministry of Defence would have given their approval for military bands to take part but their permission was not forthcoming.\"We were disappointed especially as so many people who were here during Op Banner were serving the MoD and some gave all,\" added Ian.He insisted that NIVA are hoping to avoid controversy on their day of commemoration, especially in the wake of the charging of retired soldiers with murder.In a statement NIVA said: \"Service personnel have to act within the law of the land. But this does not get away from the fact that veterans justiably feel that the scales of justice are tilted against them and that the likes of Soldier F are being sacriced as a sop to placate Republicans whose latent threat of ato violence is seen by them as influencing government policy.\""},{"url":null,"title":"eightyearold niamh going the extra mile in charity bid to complete all of northern irelands park runs","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The mans daughter complained to the Northern Ireland Public Services Ombudsmanthat her father would not have gone blind had the seriousness of his condition been spotted earlier. The case is detailed in a new bulletin from the watchdog.It outlines the investigation, describing how relevant documentation on the patients treatment was obtained. Independent professional advice was also sought to help in the assessment of the clinical judgment of the health professionals involved in the patients care and treatment. This advice stated that when the patients condition was first spotted, it was not given an appropriate assessment by staff. Given the seriousness of some red-eye conditions, the independent adviser stated that it potentially needed to be referred to the eye casualty department. The advice further stated that when the patient was seen by ophthalmology staff three days later, due to the mans other serious health conditions, they made the correct decision not to give him intra-vitreal antibiotics - a technique requiring an injection to the eye. However, this decision should have been reviewed the next day. Instead, the review was arranged as a routine appointment for nine days later. After considering all the evidence, the ombudsman concluded that the ongoing signicance of the patients developing red-eye condition should have been further and sooner investigated and escalated. She found: There was a failure by the Northern Health and Social Care Trust to appropriately assess and seek timely expert advice regarding the patients eye condition. This failure continued after the initial inadequate assessment as several other doctors and consultants examined or reviewed him. The system in place at the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust for handover, referral, prioritisation and monitoring of patients did not ensure that he was reviewed as a priority.

The ombudsman recommended that the complainant should receive a written apology for the failures identied in the report and £, in compensation. The ombudsman also made a series of recommendations to the two health and social care trusts involved in the case, in particular that they jointly conduct a review of the ophthalmology service provided to patients in the Northern Health and Social Care Trust, focusing on eye casualty and inpatient referral.A spokesperson for the northern trust said: \"We deeply regret the outcome for this gentleman and have responded to the recommendations made by the ombudsman.\"The Belfast trust said: \"The trust has worked jointly with Northern Trust to review the NIPSO findings and to implement the recommendations.\""},{"url":null,"title":"no difference in dissidents and provos says leading psychiatrist","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

These talks to re-establish the Assembly and Executive are likely to be as torturous and tedious as the previous ones.Since the last effort to end the political stalemate broke down on St Valentines Day last year, there has been no bridging of the gap between the DUP and Sinn Fein.They were on the cusp of a deal when the DUP negotiators took cold feet at the eleventh hour, fearing they could not sell what was on offer to their grassroots.Far from preparing their base for a compromise, both parties have spent the last  months bickering with increasing intensity over Brexit and everything .Fr Martin Magills passionate words at Lyras funeral did put pressure on all the political leaders assembled at St Annes Cathedral.The cameras captured some squirming in their pews as the priest chastised them, but it is naive to think that the death of the -year-old journalist will be by itself a game-changer.The DUP and Sinn Fein nodded in agreement with the cleric who urged them back to work - they could hardly do anything  - but by the following day the verbal warfare had resumed.Arlene Foster made Michelle ONeill an offer she knew she couldnt accept - the immediate restoration of devolution with a separate process to address the contentious issues.Sinn Fein repeated its Irish Language Act and same-sex marriage demands. Both parties will of course greet todays announcement with positive words.While discussions will begin in about  days, signicant movement is unlikely before the European elections on May .If both parties perform strongly in next Thursdays council poll, they have less incentive to compromise. But a bad or so-so day will pull them back to Stormont much more quickly.Canvassers from all the parties report deep frustration from people on the doorsteps.Whether that actually causes voters to switch parties, and who gets their vote out best, remain the key questions.Ive long believed that all roads lead back to Stormont for the DUP and Sinn Fein. Ultimately, they are at heart pragmatists who want to wield power. The election results will just determine whether its sooner or later that we see Arlene and Michelle become the new sister act in town."},{"url":null,"title":"cable i regret theres no joint ticket for remain in the eu elections","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The ferry is a real benefit to Strangford, it canrsquot be a liability.Cllr Enright claimed that the DfI ldquoin order to save on staff costs, have not been using the queuing area on the Strangford side.During a recent meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, roads officials confirmed that they were evaluating introducing an earlier morning sailing from Portaferry to Strangford.Councillor Gareth Sharvin said he was also concerned about the regular traffic congestion in Strangford after being contacted by local people caught up in the weekend traffic jam.He said: ldquoI donrsquot understand why there is ferry traffic congestion when there are good ferry traffic lines around the harbour. I will be contacting the Departmentrsquos permanent secretary, Katrina Godfrey, to have a full review and overhaul of the ferry services to ensure that this does not happen again.Strangford businessman, Robert Duffy, owner of a Mace grocery store, confirmed that the village was snarled up with traffic on Saturday evening but reported traffic and the ferry had been running smoothly over the rest of the Easter bank holiday weekend.However, Mr Duffy added: ldquoThe traffic was only bad for a couple of hours on Saturday evening and it was compounded by Saturday night mass in Strangford.ldquoSaturdayrsquos problem was that there was only one boat on. There was racing in Kirkistown and you had between  and  motorhomes travelling from Bishopscourt and that happens every single year.ldquoIrsquove been here  years and it is what it is ndash holiday traffic. The queue management was very good, I was down the street on Sunday and Monday and it was moving well.The Department of Infrastructure was unable to provide a response..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch U","story":"BALLYMACARN Park was bathed in sunshine as the talented lsquoHinch U- squad battled with Virginia for a place in the showpiece Ulster Carpets Cup final at Kingspan Stadium.Despite the heat, both sides put on an excellent display of running rugby in an entertaining encounter with Virginia drawing first blood, taking advantage of an uncharacteristically passive lsquoHinch defence to score from deep with their first attack.lsquoHinch began to work their patterns and took the lead with a typically powerful carry and score from Morgan Croskery and a fine finish from Jojo Naga.Virginia battled back and spent the final minutes before half time battering the lsquoHinch line.Fine close quarter defence enabled the home side to clear their lines but more sloppy defending from the backs allowed Virginia to gain territory and they scored to leave the tie evenly poised at -all.During the half-time break the lsquoHinch coaches asked for more urgency in defence and better ball protection in attack and were rewarded with a superb  minutes of rugby from their side.A line out move was executed perfectly for Matthew Torney to pop up a short pass for a charging Croskery to steam onto the ball and over the line untouched.The home forwards then bullied their opponents in consecutive mauls and Torney used all his power to help himself to a typical close-range score as the Virginia forwards tired.Any thoughts of a comeback were derailed by much improved line speed in defence as Cameron Patterson led the line superbly, driving his man back behind the gain line repeatedly and galvanising his team.James McMaster and Luke Braithwaite were also busy, using their power to disrupt attacks and win turnovers.A Croskery sin-bin was easily absorbed and when Naga finished an excellent Dan Hewitt chip ahead to give his team a  point lead, the match was effectively over as a contest.lsquoHinch emptied their bench to give everyone some time on the pitch and the game lost a little of its intensity as it entered the final  minutes.To their credit, Virginia battled up field for a consolation score with the last move of the match to leave the final score -.League champions, City of Armagh, await the local boys in the final on May  at Kingspan Stadium on what will be a great occasion for this dedicated group of players.Their quarter-final exit from the league play-offs did not do them justice and they have regrouped well over the past few weeks to put together an excellent cup campaign.Hooker Harry McCarroll epitomised the work ethic on Saturday with an all-action man of the match display and senior players continue to set the standards as the season reaches a conclusion.All support welcome on May ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Cormac recognised with two accolades  ","story":"A STUDENT and upcoming politician at Downpatrickrsquos St Patrickrsquos Grammar School recently won two prestigious awards in consecutive days.Cormac Savagereceived the awards for his work in the local community, including engaging young people in politics and for his efforts with local charities like the Mid Down MS Support Group.Cormac mdash who is currently a Member of the Youth Parliament representing South Down mdash was nominated for a Michaela Foundation Wings Award and a Youth and Future Talent Awardin the inspirational young person category by St Patrickrsquos Grammarrsquos head of music, Celeste McEvoy.Cormac delivered a rousing speech last November in the House of Commons with the UK Youth Parliament about the topic of homelessness and, in particular, its gender impact on safety.Also late last year, Cormac gave , local young people the chance to have their voices heard about which issues are most important to them as part of the lsquoMake Your Markrsquo campaign.His first accolade came through The Wings Awards run by the Michaela Foundation in memory of Michaela McAreavey, the young bride murdered on honeymoon in Mauritius in .Cormac said he felt ldquooverwhelmed to have won one of the four awards in the age - category with  young people shortlisted.The awards, set up by Michaelarsquos husband John and her father, Tyrone manager Mickey Harte, seek to recognise young people who have been ldquomotivators within their local community.The following night, Cormac was recognised as an lsquoinspirational young person at the YAFTA awards run by Newry and Mourne Youth Council and Down Area Youth Council.Cormac said the whole experience felt ldquosurreal, adding that it was a ldquototal honour.

The Town Committee asked for the money to go towards a two-week festival they are organising in the town this summer.But councillors bluntly pointed out this week that they have already pumping enough money into the resort for other activities and had already sufficiently helped the Town Committee.Councillors pointed out that the council had spent a ldquovery considerable amount of money in promoting a nine-week summer entertainment programme in Newcastle and had given specic help to the Town Committee in the funding of a joint press conference, advertising and publicity material, as well as providing Radio Newcastle and other facilities.Because of all this ldquoit would not be appropriate to gibe a cash grant in addition.However, the decision did not go down well with Castlewellan councillor Mrs Ethel Smyth, who said it was regrettable that the council had decided to give nothing to the Town Committee.She thought thatthe council could not help by giving the full pound, they should at least have given a part and she hoped the council would have another look at the request.Newcastle councillor Mr Norman Bicker, a member of the Town Committee, said he hoped the council might be able to do something, but he realised there was already a big council programme and he agreed that it was not possible to allow more money.The councilrsquos recreation officer, Mr Bryan Coburn, also pointed out that there was already considerable investment in finance and labour in Newcastle and he felt it would not be appropriate to give more.BALLYGOWAN mdash Bicycling Ballygowan minister, the Rev James Harper, peddled into town last week with a beaming smile on his face for he had just taken part in a smash hit -mile cycle to raise funds to build a new hall in his area.Mr Harper led a team of  modern bikes into Ballygowan on an  year-old penny farthing, which had been loaned to him by cycling enthusiast Albert Watson.The sponsored -mile bike ride took in Raffrey, Derryboy, the Pikestone, Crossgar and Saintfield. Between pound and pound was raised.Itrsquos not the first time Mr Harper, minister of Ballygowan Presbyterian Church, has come up with unusual ideas to raise money. When ministering in Killyleagh he took part in a sponsored bed push and also cycled on a tandem.Coping with the penny farthing proved easier than Mr Harper expected. ldquoIt was remarkably comfortable and I felt really refreshed after the journey, he said.ldquoThere was only one problem mdash it had no brakes, but the police helped us by going ahead to make sure the way was clear.The penny farthing dates from  and is ft in high. Mr Harper only got one half-hour practice to get the feel of it before setting out on the y journey.DOWNPATRICK mdash A proposal to locate a regional museum in Downpatrick has been supported by the South Eastern Education and Library Board.Board members want to be involved in the museumrsquos management together with local councillors.The recommendation is that the museum should be the responsibility of the district council, but Board member Mr Jack Magee believes the concept is too narrow.Board members want top priority to be given to recruiting a pool of staff for regional museums and that they should be seconded for proper professional training to acquire a professional qualication.Meanwhile, Down Council is pressing ahead with its own plans to establish a museum in Downpatrick.The council museum was started before the announcement that Downpatrick had been nominated as the location for a regional museum and it is believed that the council museum will be used as the basis for the regional museum.Councillors have accepted that it will be some time before money will be made available for the appointment of museum staff, so a full-time curator is now needed to enable their lsquoDown Museumrsquo to progress properly.It has been confirmed that until the appointment is made, Mr Albert Colmer, chairman of the Lecale Historical Society, will continue to act as curator.STRANGFORD mdash The Strangford Ferry fares will be increased next week, despite strong protests from Ards and Down councillors and members of Portaferry Development Committee.Representatives from all three groups recently met with the Department of Roads Service, which operates the ferry, and were told that the increases were the absolute minimum which could be implemented.Down councillor Mr John Ritchie said he was told that the fares should meet at least % of the servicersquos running costs, which now stood at nearly pound, a year.KILLYLEAGH mdash The blueprint for Killyleaghrsquos one-day festival of family fun in June was revealed at a public meeting in the Cooke Hall in the town.The planned programme, ranging from car slalom, marathon darts, senior citizensrsquo talent contest and yard of ale competition, makes impressive reading, attempting as it does to involve the whole community.ldquoWe must put Killyleagh on the map, was the message message hammered home at the meeting by Mr Winston Maguire, chairman of Killyleagh Town Committee.The organisers received an enormous boost when local hotelier Mr Harry Briggs offered free of charge for three nights the main hall of the Dunmore Hotel.The organisers have appealed for sponsorship, especially donations for prizes. The townspeople will not only enjoy the one-day festival, but any profits made from the event will be ploughed back to provide Christmas lights for the townrsquos streets.DRUMAROAD mdash Outbreaks of sheep worrying hit the area at the weekend when more than  lambs were savagely attacked and killed by marauding dogs.Mr P J McGrady, a farmer from Drumaroad, lost ten lambs over the weekend, He spotted a black dog with white spots on his land and he rushed into his house for his shotgun, but the dog had gone when he went outside.BALLYNAHINCH mdash A pair of talented Ballynahinch sisters, Lesley and Gail Newham, are among four students from the South Eastern Music Centre who travelled to Grantham in Lincolnshire with the British Youth Symphony Orchestra this week.This is the second year in succession that the sisters have been chosen to join the  young musicians from all over the UK who will be giving concerts for the next two weeks.Mr David Newham, father of  year-old Lesley, who plays a horn, and  year-old Gail, an oboeist, is director and advisor of music for the South Eastern Education and Library Board.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash A speedboat with the engine still attached was found drting in Strangford Lough close to Don OrsquoNeill Island on Saturday by Mr Paul McCann, of  Springvale Park, Dpwnpatrick.The speedboat was taken to a temporary mooring at Castleward Bay provided by Strangford Sailing Club. Later, when police checked on the speedboat, they discovered that it had been removed from the mooring.It is believed that the owner of the boat had taken it away, but Strangford police would like the owner to confirmthis was so.KILLOUGH mdash Down councillors have run into snags over their plans to provide playing fields in Killough.The council has applied to the Department of Education for a vesting order for land, but two objections have been entered by residents and the Department wonrsquot proceed until all possible alternatives sites have been investigated.SPA mdash The sixth annual inspection and display of First Spa Company of the Boysrsquo Brigade took place in the Arnold Hall over two nights last week.

The event was finished off by further prayers and hymns with soup served to all.The call for the Church of Ireland community to boycott the event was ignored as several additional ministers attended the event for the first time.Former Bishop Trevor Williams, recently retired from the Church of Ireland diocese of Limerick and Killaloe and former rector of Newcastle, said he felt it was important to attend the event.ldquoThe Christian message for me is one primarily of love and concern for others and on this Good Friday thatrsquos precisely the message, the cross of Jesus Christ and what he gave to the world, he said.ldquoJesus said love one another as I have loved you so that is the importance of this day. We learn most from those who are dferent so this walk today gives us an opportunity to realise that each of our traditions have something to offer, each has something to learn from each other.Church of Ireland minister, the Rev Adrian Dorrian from the Lecale group of churches, said he felt it was important to attend the walk.ldquoWe have a similar walk of witness in Downpatrick today, he said. ldquoBut, given the coverage this year and the protest letter which we disagree strongly with, we wanted to show support. Dean Henry Hull would have been here but he has other Good Friday service commitments. Irsquom very glad to have been able to come and represent the other churches in the town.Castlewellan parish priest, Fr Denis McKinlay, said: ldquoItrsquos been a great turnout today and great show of support and solidarity from some very important people. After all it is a peace walk and itrsquos about peace, reconciliation and hope and we all have to learn from one another. Surely that has to be a great thing In welcoming the walkers to St Paulrsquos, the Rev Brian Cadden said: ldquoIt is a real sense of joy today, despite dferent expressions of the Christian faith, that we can come together to share the most basic aspect of our faith which is the death of Jesus Christ on the cross.St Malachyrsquos parishioners, Harry and Margaret McCartan from Newcastle, have attended the walk for years.Mr McCartan said why there were there: ldquoTo bear witness with our Christian neighbours, thatrsquos what it is all about, he said.ldquoThatrsquos exactly it, this is nothing to do with politics, added Mrs McCartan.He continued: ldquoWhy be a Christianyou are afraid to show it Gerald King from Annsborough said he attended the walk due to recent newspaper coverage.ldquoI came today after seeing that letter because them men are wrong, he said. ldquoLove one another as I have loved you, thatrsquos what this is about.St Malachyrsquos parishioner Mary Steele, who walks every year, said: ldquoItrsquos been lovely and peaceful and calm. Itrsquos a prayerful day and it should be. Good Friday is the day and the resurrection is the day. Let those without sin cast the first stone.Fellow St Malachyrsquos parishioner Philomena Rice was there with her three grandchildren as she has done in previous years.ldquoI think itrsquos important to show my grandchildren the other church, she said. ldquoThey like coming out to this, carrying the cross as they call it.Ronnie Hamilton, secretary of the Castlewellan Area Bible Prayer Group said: ldquoIrsquom very happy with the turnout today and itrsquos more than we normally have.

Poor Sarah, however, was cornered by McNeilly in the Avoca at the presentation, who was heard regaling her of his past triumphs, including his  minute k and  minute  miler.Perhaps there was some consolation for Sarah in that she wasnrsquot subjected to Joe McCann recounting his illustrious Armagh .

It is understood that it could be early July before this work is completed.There have been a series of issues associated with the regeneration scheme to provide new paving, street lighting and furniture in Irish Street with the initial start date delayed as Phoenix Gas took longer than expected to complete its work at this part of the town.Signicant issues have now arisen with the foundations for the blast wall which surrounded the former police base, but of major concern is problems with the sewer network.A series of frenetic phone calls to politicians and NI Water were made recently after raw sewage flowed out of an old section of piping for over a week.Businesses say they have been told that major sections of the sewer network need replaced and that contractors recently discovered that one large section of the sewer was completely blocked with concrete and has most probably been like this for decades.All businesses have reported a downturn in trade since work in Irish Street started and a temporary one-way traffic system was introduced, while there is concern that a number of parking spaces have been lost and that the width of the main street has been substantially narrowed in places.Calls have been issued for a rates reduction given the impact the work has had on business with traders highlighting that the delay in completing the scheme, ironically designed to help attract more shoppers, is outside their control but has had a signicant impact upon them.Mr Alan Oakes, of Plus  Print, said the sewer outside his business collapsed for eight days, with main contractors apologising for what was happening.ldquoTrade has been poor since the works started on January  and with further realistic delays forthcoming, we donrsquot know what the future might hold, he said.ldquoOne business in Irish Street has now closed, traffic is at a standstill, deliveries are impossible and collection from businesses is a nightmare while footfall is at zero. The management of the entire streetscape has been disastrous from day one and now more delays are anticipated.Mr Oakes said what concerns him most has been the lack of communication provided by Newry, Mourne and Down Council. He also fears that the sewage infrastructure in Irish Street is at breaking point.He added: ldquoWe are a family-run business with  yearsrsquo experience in the town and an employer. These past few months been very testing and dficult for all businesses in Irish Street.Another trader said that given the loss in trade businesses have experienced, they should be entitled to a rates rebate.He said: ldquoWe all accepted that the street upgrade was needed but the work was supposed to take three months. Now they are saying that it will be the end of June and even into July before it is completed. What is going on ldquoEveryone has taken a hit and, given that fact, we deserve a rates rebate. Business is hard enough without having to put up with this. We were told the work would take three months, but we will be into a seventh month before this over.A spokeswoman for the Department of Infrastructure said the Irish Street scheme is a project it is managing on behalf of Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities.ldquoThis is a full refurbishment of the existing streetscape, with the provision of new street lighting, street furniture and carriageway resurfacing, she explained.ldquoUnfortunately the scheme has encountered a signicant number of unexpected delays due to utility alterations and dficulties with construction around the old blast wall foundations at the PSNI station.The spokeswoman confirmed that in consultation with the contractor carrying out the work, it is now anticipated that further delays are ldquounfortunately unavoidable at this stage with the finish date of the main paving works now expected to be June .She also revealed that a full road closure will then be required to carry out resurfacing of the carriageway.The spokeswoman added: ldquoWhile we appreciate this unavoidable delay has caused concern, please be assured that all measures to expedite works are being taken.South Down MLA, Colin McGrath, said it was ldquodisappointing to learn that the completion of roadworks at Irish Street have been delayed until the end of June.ldquoWhile residents and business owners will want to see the work completed to the highest standard, that this will be at the cost of another two monthsrsquo interruption which is disheartening.

We agree that what is now needed is actions and not just words from all of us who are in positions of leadership.“We have agreed to establish a new process of political talks, involving all the main political parties in Northern Ireland, together with the UK and Irish Governments, in accordance with the three stranded process. The aim of these talks is quickly to re-establish to full operation the democratic institutions of the Belfast Good Friday Agreement - the NI Executive, Assembly and North-South Ministerial Council - so that they can effectively serve all of the people for the future.“We have asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Tanaiste to meet later today in Belfast to set out our proposed approach and to commence the talks process as soon as possible after the local elections in Northern Ireland.“In addition, we have agreed that there should be a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference during the same period. The Conference will consider East West relations, security cooperation, and political stability in Northern Ireland.“We understand the complexity of the underlying concerns of all parties, and the need for renewed trust, mutual respect, generosity and new thinking to resolve the issues.“As Prime Minister and Taoiseach, we are determined to work together to ensure this process comes to a successful conclusion.“We will review progress at the end of May.”Robin Swann: UUP leader warns of dangers of not restoring powersharing Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES |  photos from the funeral of murdered journalist Lyra McKeeSpeeder clocked at mph on notorious NI roadLyra McKee killed accidentally by republican volunteer claim SaoradhLyra McKee shot dead during riot -

Now, the bridge has several operational regulations like alarm levels ndash we canrsquot balance the high level of noise needed for a bridge and the low level needed for a residential area. This is the reality that the council have to consider and resolve.A Vale of Glamorgan Council spokesman said: ldquoThe swing bridge is maintained and operated by Quay Marinas, who manage the Penarth Quays Marina site.ldquoIt was closed due to a number of safety concerns, with upgrades needed before it can be reopened, including audible warnings.ldquoThe council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report following which our health and safety officers and those from Quay Marinas will discuss possible solutions which may enable the bridge to be reopened in the future. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Marie Curie also provides support to people in their own homes, and its Information and Support Line now also features clinical nurse specialists who are available for any clinical support needed.The work to create the new cafeacute has been funded by the Hodge Foundation, who also supported the refurbishment of the hospicersquos Day Therapy and Outpatients Unit in .At the opening, cakes from the hospicersquos catering team were showcased, with staff, volunteers and patients joining Suzanne and the Hodge Foundation to enjoy welsh cakes and tea and coffee.Further works at the hospice, funded by a Legacy gt from the estate of Mrs Seaward have included the installation of a Spa bathroom on both inpatient units.There has also been further maintenance work carried out alongside the bathroom and cafeacute works. The works have been unveiled in a year in which the hospice is due to celebrate its th year.Sarah Lloyd-Davies, hospice manager, said: ldquoWe are so grateful to the Hodge Foundation for once again supporting vital work to not only allow us to continue to provide expert end of le care and support to people living with a terminal illness, and their families, but also to help us expand our reach to the community in Penarth.ldquoWe want people to understand more about the work we do here, and are excited to open our cafeacute doors and encourage people to come in and have conversations with us about end of le care.ldquoThank you also to the estate of Mrs Seaward for allowing us to create two relaxing and calming Spa bathrooms for patients, which help elevate the service we can provide at the hospice.Volunteer Ian Spence, who has been volunteering on reception for  years, is now also spending some hours helping in the cafeacute.He said: ldquoIt makes me feel good about myself. I get to give something back to the community, or rather put something into it.ldquoThe hospice is such a warm place to come to and the staff are all fantastic at making everyone feel welcome.Suzanne, who has previously visited the hospice with brother and Olympian Colin Jackson, said: ldquoItrsquos been a pleasure to officially open the new Marie Curie Cafeacute at the charityrsquos Cardf and the Vale Hospice in Penarth.ldquoMeeting the staff, volunteers and families and hearing stories about the care provided here for people living with a terminal illness has been inspiring. I wish the hospice every luck with their new venture, and hope it will encourage more people to talk about end of le with their loved ones.The Marie Curie cafeacute is currently open from .am to pm Monday to Friday, with plans to expand hours with trained volunteers.If you would like to volunteer, contact the hospice on    or visit www.mariecurie.org.uk volunteering article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

So many people say lsquowhy wonrsquot the council talk to us \"Cllr Steffan William askedsports pitches could be ldquofenced off to prevent dogs walking on them, but the councilrsquos operational manager Colin Smith said this ldquocould be quite costly for the council.At the start of the meeting, Mr Smith said: ldquoWe know the majority of dog owners are responsible and we donrsquot want to limit them from the green spaces the Vale has to offer.There were also calls for more dog waste bins throughout the Vale at the meeting.Councillors heard there have been just six prosecutions for dog fouling in the Vale of Glamorgan in the past year.Cardf councilrsquos PSPO against dog fouling will see dog owners fined poundtheyrsquore found without bags or the means of picking up after their pets.But Mr Smith said: ldquoThe legal team were concerned it wouldnrsquot be lawful.

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.

The egg processing business includes big names such as Marks and Spencer and McDonald’s among its customers.Frylite, which started le when Eamon McCay opened a cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises, has seen its turnover increase to £m, with pre-tax profits sitting at £.m. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff.And helping highlight the firms which are still based in Northern Ireland and retain ownership here, accountancy firm Harbinson Mulholland hosted its inaugural HM Homegrown event in Belfast.Showcasing the top  SMEs here, it highlighted that Northern Ireland boasts more homegrown businesses per head of population than Wales, Scotland and all regions across the north of England.And almost % of them operate in just three sectors – manufacturing, construction and wholesale retail.

The results of this research demonstrate that just because businesses are local in origin does not imply, they are not global in ambition that because they are from traditional sectors does not mean they are not modern in outlook. Indeed, local homegrown businesses have a sense of place and origin that can really create competitive advantage.“Northern Ireland has demonstrated its ability to sell its agri-food, manufacturing and construction products and services overseas, but internationally successful companies tend not to emerge in isolation. “Domestic competition drives innovation, efficiency and productivity improvements, which in turn develop businesses which can take on any competitor across the world. As a result, there is merit in Government identying the most appropriate ways to support the continued growth of successful clusters to help power the economy into the future.”And Darren McDowell, senior partner of Harbinson Mullholland said that homegrown businesses were the backbone of the practice’s client base.“The Top  list underlines the vibrancy of this group of companies and the spending power they give to local communities through employment.“Attention is often focused on other sectors, but this research demonstrates the continued importance of traditional businesses and industries to the local economy and the extent to which they can be successful.”There’s also a raft of multi-generational businesses here, which have kept both ownership and controlOne of those is food giant Henderson.

We’re also proud that we have built a sustainable business which continues to proactively develop and expand, and provides employment for over , people in Northern Ireland.”    More than  years ago, John Henderson set up a stall selling butter, eggs and cheese – he was a well-known figure and frequently was a judge of cheese and butter at the annual Balmoral Show.That subsequently progressed into a stall at St George’s Market in Belfast, and then in , the business was incorporated as a limited company.In , William Agnew married John Henderson’s daughter, and in  William joined the company as a salesman, taking a controlling interest when John Henderson retired three years later.

Close to a thirdsaid their employer was less committed to achieving gender equality, with womenmore likely to believe there was a need for improvement, versus % of men. Only % of all respondents said their employer was committed to achieving gender equality, with men overwhelmingbelieving this to be the case versus % of women. There’s clearly still a long way to go.Most business leaders are well aware of the merit of employing a erse workforce. Diversity in areas including age, employee background, gender and religion affirms a message of inclusivity within the organisation and to a wider external audience, creating a strong position andHiring methods are an integral element of increasing ersity among employees, and CVs are one of the many ways in which the process can be improved. Many organisations will judge candidates based on their most recent job listing, potentially overlooking talented and competent applicants without a steady course of uninterrupted career progression. This can particularly disadvantage many women in professional sectors who have prioritised childcare at points throughout their career.Whether you believe it or not, we all have unconscious bias built in to our responses to others. So,you could eliminate those biases from the process, would you do so More and more organisations, including many here in Northern Ireland, now recruit based on blind CVs, where information such as age, race and gender is removed to prevent subconscious biases from influencing hiring decisions.Using competency-based application processes assesses essential soft skills such as communication, emotional intelligence, problem solving and self-motivation, rather than testing specic knowledge, which can be learned more quickly than soft skills. The absence of a CV can change the way you prepare questions and open interviews up to discussions that wouldn’t otherwise take place.Favouring competency-based applications or requiring blind CVs is a sign your organisation is taking steps to fairly assess candidates based on their skills and experience. These methods of talent-based hiring also demonstrate a commitment to overcoming the perceived disadvantage of career breaks which will positively contribute to erse representation across all sectors.The practice of blind hiring is not without its shortcomings. For instance a candidate’s personal information can only be withheld during the initial screening process. Once a line manager conducts a one-to-one interview there is no way to suppress a candidate’s gender, ethnicity or age. While applying the principle may result in a wider pool of first-round interviewees employers subsequently be faced with the same ersity challenges, for example, seeking graduates with a first class honours or a high :.At Hays we have trialled blind recruitment at assessment centres for a number internal of appointments. The absence of a CV opened up a depth of enquiry and supporting examples from interviewees where the receipt of a CV might not have encouraged the same level of enquiry and open-mindedness.Demand for transparency around targets and performance is also at an all-time high. So,your organisation is transparent in their ersity reporting, it proves their willingness to make a public commitment to achieving a fairly recruited workforce and makes them accountable for measuring and reporting their progress.  You’ll undoubtedly make some excellent new hires that you may not have appointedyou maintained your traditional processes.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/stats_r1.jpg","title":"statsports takes on premier leagues alex oxlade chamberlain and raheem sterling","story":"Posted on Thursday  April  by Ulster Business Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and chief global strategist Jarlath Quinn Newry firm STATSports have taken on board Premier League players Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Raheem Sterling as signicant investors as well as global ambassadors for the burgeoning tech firm.

The struggling chain has entered into a company voluntary arrangement . It follows a pre-pack administration for the high street business. Five Northern Ireland Debenhams stores are continuing to trade, but it has confirmed  other stores will shut, outside Northern Ireland. It’s thought more than , jobs could be at risk. Debenhams is the anchor tenant at five shopping centres in Northern Ireland, including Newry’s Quays Shopping Centre, Ballymena’s Fairhill, Belfast’s CastleCourt, Craigavon’s Rushmere and Londonderry’s Foyleside. The firm’s earlier administration angered shareholder Mike Ashley, owner of Sports Direct, who has called for the process to be reversed. The administration wipes out the stakes held by Sports Direct and all other shareholders. The stores that are due to close are: Altrincham, Ashford, Birmingham Fort, Canterbury, Chatham, Eastbourne, Folkestone, Great Yarmouth, Guildford, Kirkcaldy, Orpington, Slough, Southport, Southsea, Staines, Stockton, Walton, Wandsworth, Welwyn Garden City, Wimbledon, Witney, Wolverhampton. Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, director Aodhán Connolly, says \"rising costs, a sluggish economy, and changing shopping habits are making le incredibly hard for the industry\". \"Those pressures are being exacerbated by ever-increasing public policy costs which are making it more expensive to employ workers and operate from physical premises. These factors will lead to a very dferent retail industry over the next few years. \"The challenges department stores face are a microcosm of the immense changes affecting the retail industry. As more consumers shop on-line, there is a challenge to encourage shoppers into stores, and then to get them to spend when they are there. One of the big trends we are seeing is retailers innovating to try and create a number of reasons for customers to visit the store. That can be through offering food and drink, dferent services, and by investing in customer service. The big advantage a physical retailer has is those trained helpful colleagues who can provide detailed guidance on products to help customers. \"It’s notable those retailers who have invested in evolving from purely physical retail to a multi-channel offering are those who are in the strongest position. Many of the larger stores are particularly affected by government policy which has consistently made operating from property more expensive.
