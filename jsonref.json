The species is now protected. Hvalur hf, owned by multi-millionaire Kristján Loftsson, caused uproar mid-July, when it was revealed it had killed a pregnant blue-fin whale hybrid, reportedly by mistake.          The whale has been dragged into the carving dock, which is surrounded by whale bones and cut up meat form another whale          Preparation work: Whalers are seen measuring the dead blue whale-fin whale hybrid before it is carved up          Butchering: Whalers are seen carving into the whale\u0027s thick blubber and pulling away its fin using a chain and a winchShocking photographs showed the crossbreed whale being butchered, and whalers dragging the bloodied remains of the foetus along the seafront. Both sets of images were captures by Sea Shepherd, an international  marine wildlife conservation non-profit.The charity told MailOnline that DNA tests had been carried out on the most recent killing, whale number 99, by marine biologists working for the Icelandic government, which had confirmed that it had indeed been a hybrid.Sea Shepherd chief operating officer Rob Read said: \u0027Over 100 of the second largest animals ever to have existed on our planet have now been cruelly harpooned, some harpooned more than once, and over a dozen of which were pregnant.\u0027It is unbelievable that the killing of any endangered whales, let alone pregnant mothers, is allowed by Iceland - or tolerated by the international community.\u0027Our crew has had to endure the horrifying sights and smells of the operations of this whaling company run by Icelandic multi-millionaire Kristján Loftsson since the season began in June.\u0027Should this rogue company be granted a whaling permit by the Icelandic government next year, Sea Shepherd will be forced to escalate our campaign to end this madness.\u0027          Brutal: This image shows the remains of a pregnant hybrid whale killed by the same company last month, with whalers dragging away the dead foetusRoad rage results in tractor-trailer flipping over on the highwayMoment police officer is kicked in the back whilst arresting manFestival \u0027idiot\u0027 goes viral after he e-bombed revellers\u0027 tentsMoment dozens of migrants storm Spanish beach from small boatFiery action from creative vehicles at the Burning Man festivalEnglish and French fishermen clash in the Channel over scallop stockMoment woman dumps rubbish on neighbours\u0027 driveway in StreathamAlex Salmond resigns from SNP amid harassment claims stormRemains of Soviet alpinist missing for 31 years found on Mount ElbrusKilshaws loose court battle over Wecker twins in 2001Loftsson later defended himself, saying neither the hybrid nor the fin whale were protected species under Icelandic law, however, specialists say this is a gray area.   Marine conservation experts believe that blue whale-fin whale hybrids are not very common in the waters off Iceland, and are even more rare than blue whales.Astrid Fuchs, from the charity Whale and Dolphin Conservation, said: \u0027Since 1983, they\u0027ve only recorded five of these rare hybrids.\u0027Four of them have been killed by whalers and one is a very beloved whale watching object and is still alive - they are very rare.\u0027Sea Shepherd claims a total of seven have been recorded since the 1980s, of which six have been killed by whalers.           Marine conservation experts believe that blue whale-fin whale hybrids, like this one caught last month, are not very common in the waters off Iceland, and are even more rare than blue whales          Also at risk: The fin whale, is the second largest animal on the planet after the blue whale and is also an endangered species, with some 50,000 -

All the while, she said she continued asking her son for the time.‘So we had a minute-by-minute history of the time frame and the yelling went on from 5 after 11 until 11.25 and then it stopped,’ Wayne recalled.Wood\u0027s husband Robert Wagner, who was on board his yacht Splendour along with his wife\u0027s former co-star Christopher Walken, has always maintained that the 43-year-old star of West Side Story accidentally slipped and drowned as she tried to tie up a dinghy against the boat after a tumultuous night of heavy drinking.    Wood\u0027s Brainstorm co-star Christopher Walken (left) was one of four people on board the yacht that night Wayne also revealed that the next day, she and her boyfriend called police seven separate times, trying to report what they had heard out at sea the night Wood went missing, but their calls were never returned.Then three days later, Wayne received a note that, according to her, stated ‘something to the effect of, “If you want to stay healthy, keep your mouth shut!”’Also in chapter 7, Roger Smith, former Los Angeles County Supervising Rescue Boat captain who removed Wood’s body out of the water, told the producers of the podcast that Wagner could have saved his wife ‘but he didn’t.’Smith recounted that when he found the Hollywood star floating in the water, it looked like she had not been dead very long.He recalled that when he slipped a ring off of Wood\u0027s finger, he noticed that her hands were still \u0027pliable,\u0027 meaning that rigor mortis had not set it by that point.Two weeks ago, listeners of the Fatal Voyage podcast heard from Dennis Davern, the former captain of Wagner and Wood\u0027s yacht, who claimed that the couple and their guest, Walken, had been fighting and that Wood wanted to escape. Davern said in the bombshell interview featured in Chapter 6 of the series that he believed Wagner killed his wife during a scuffle in their room, threw her overboard and then told the captain not to look for his wife.Police re-opened the case into Woods\u0027 death in February 2018, and Wagner has been named as a suspect,but has so far declined to speak with authorities.     Dennis Davern, the former captain of Wagner and Wood\u0027s yacht, previously claimed that the couple and their guest, Walken, had been fighting  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/30/17/4F890BDB00000578-0-image-a-1_1535647413794.jpg","title":"May faces backlash proposed ban sale energy drinks schoolchildren","story":"    The PM (pictured today in Kenya trying out a plastic telephone) announced yesterday that ministers would consult on plans to make the sale of caffeine-heavy products like Red Bull to under-18s or under-16s illegalHe said that while some there are some health and behavioural problems associated with children who drink lots of energy drink, criminalising them is \u0027unnecessary and draconian\u0027.And he attacked the PM\u0027s recent record of banning or slapping hefty charges on products in order to force people to change their behaviour.He said: \u0027Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has recently made an issue of energy drinks and it seems that the Government is once again dancing to his tune. The Maybot strikes again!

The sale to kids should be stopped as soon as possible.\u0027It\u0027s really great news that the government is announcing their intention to stop selling these drinks to kids.\u0027I\u0027m sure parents and health experts across the UK will happily tell the Government this is the right thing to do.\u0027 Shops that flout a ban could be hit with punishments similar to those for selling cigarettes - a £2,500 fine.

They also had to have served in Helmand – the scene of the fiercest fighting – for at least a year.          Mr Williamson promised he would widen the qualifying period to include those who spent at least a year with British forces as far back as 2006Mr Williamson promised he would widen the qualifying period to include those who spent at least a year with British forces as far back as 2006.The qualifying period for the relocation policy now extends back to May 1, 2006 – and those made redundant up to 2012. But translators claim there was no formal redundancy policy between 2006 and 2012.Rafi, who was blown up in Helmand and became the superviser for all the UK military’s translators, said: ‘I know of no one made redundant – contracts were just terminated – so this needs to be explained.’Three weeks after Mr Williamson announced the change in policy, suspected Taliban gunmen attacked Britain’s longest serving translator who had previously been refused sanctuary.Two men opened fire as the 34-year-old translator, known as Ricky, returned home in his car in Kabul. Ricky jumped clear and ran inside his house. One bullet hit his seat. He said: ‘I was very lucky. I believe it was the Taliban or Islamic State because of my work for the British forces.’Ricky said last night that British officials had ‘accepted I am in danger’ but merely offered to relocate him in Afghanistan.‘I have done 17 years’ service for the UK Government but now that I need their help, they are trying to leave me and my family here to the very real dangers, it is so disappointing,’ he said.An MoD spokesman said: ‘Our specialist team is working hard to identify which interpreters are eligible for relocation. This clearly takes time, as it requires close collaboration with other departments, the Afghan government and the International Organisation for Migration.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/30/22/4F8AD76100000578-0-image-m-13_1535666246545.jpg","title":"The Cosby star Geoffrey Owens spotted working cashier Trader Joes New Jersey","story":"    Geoffrey Owens, 57, is pictured behind a till at the store in Clifton, New Jersey, where staff earn around $11 an hour  The former star wore a Trader Joe\u0027s t-shirt with stain marks on the front as he weighed a bag of potatoes.

The species is now protected. Hvalur hf, owned by multi-millionaire Kristján Loftsson, caused uproar mid-July, when it was revealed it had killed a pregnant blue-fin whale hybrid, reportedly by mistake.

This tabbed-up version shows the names of some of the soldiers in the pictureDespite that, these young men did not flinch and chose to join the fight on the Western Front.But this isn’t just a mesmerising image. The picture has been given new prominence by the remarkable efforts of historian Dan Hill, of Herts At War, a Lottery-funded project to uncover untold stories from the Great War, who has spent months trying to discover their fate.He has conducted scrupulous research using local archives containing a vast number of images as well as obituary photographs.Tragically, of the 11 he has so far been able to put a name to, it has been established that seven were killed, ‘a much higher proportion than you would expect based on national casualty rates for the war as a whole,’ he says. He is appealing to the public for help naming the rest of the soldiers, as well as for more details about those who have been named.  Here, we tell the stories of the Tommies who have so far been identified . . . Jack Satterthwaite          Jack Satterthwaite died on April 22 of 1916, while his brother Walter survivedKilled in action April 22, 1916The platoon sergeant, Jack was a well-known face around town, as well as something of a star in the local football and cricket teams.In the photograph, he is standing next to his father, James, who is wearing a flat cap and a dark suit with his arms folded.One of Jack’s informal duties as platoon sergeant was to write home to thank the Letchworth residents who sent the men gifts, such as cigarettes and socks.He was shot in the chest during fighting at Festubert, in North West France, on April 17, 1916. He died of his wounds five days later, aged 25. Jack, a printer, had fought alongside his brother, Walter, on the Western Front.Walter won the Military Medal for bravery, but was invalided out of the Army after being wounded in the leg a year after Jack’s death.Walter FlandersKilled in action Nov 19, 1914WALTER was one of eight children born to merchant seaman Edward Flanders and his wife Sarah, who died after the birth of their youngest child. His father was frequently away at sea, so he had placed the children in the care of a relative. His collier was lost at sea with all hands in 1913.With their father gone, the children’s carer could no longer support them and they were sent to the workhouse. When one of them, Agnes, married and moved to a house in Letchworth, she took her siblings to live with her.Walter arrived in Belgium as a private on November 6, 1914 — and was killed aged 19 just two weeks later, on November 19. He is believed to have been buried alive when a German shell struck his trench. Walter’s brother, Valentine, who also fought in the war, carried a newspaper cutting about his death until he, too, was killed, at the Battle of Arras in 1917.Records show that a Private Bill Johnson, also 19, was killed in the same bomb blast as Walter. Private Johnson was on the platform when this photograph was taken, but has not yet been identified.          The photograph was taken at Letchworth train station in Hertfordshire on August 5, 1914, and is of 12 platoon, E Company, Hertfordshire RegimenHenry MabbittWoundedThis boyish-looking soldier was wounded early in the war, invalided out of service and given an honourable discharge.

Among them were 250,000 boys and young men under 19, supposed to be the legal minimum age for armed service overseas.George Drury was only 16 when he went to war. Like thousands of other brave teenage Tommies, he lied about his age to get to the Western Front.He was wounded on three occasions and awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for gallantry in 1918. George met his fiancée, a nurse, while recovering from his third wound.He then volunteered to serve with British forces on the anti-Bolshevik ‘White’ side during the Russian Civil War. He was killed by Russian machine-gunners while trying to rescue his wounded captain on March 25, 1919. At the time, he held the rank of Company Sergeant Major.          George Drury (left) and Fred Millard (centre) have been identified from the image. Both were killed in action in 1919 and 1916 respectively Fred MillardKilled in action Oct 4, 1916The cheery private looking over his comrades’ shoulders in the photograph was killed at the Battle of the Somme.The battle, which began on July 1, 1916 and lasted until November 1916, epitomised the horror of World War I trench warfare, with appalling casualties. By the end of the battle, the British Army had suffered 420,000 casualties — including 60,000 on the first day alone. The French lost 200,000 men and the Germans 500,000.George SherwoodKilled in action July 31, 1917Another of the bloodiest engagements of the Great War was the Battle of Passchendaele. It began on July 31, 1917 — which was to be the Hertfordshire Regiment’s worst day of the war.About 620 men and officers attacked German positions at the village of St Julien in Belgium.The huge bombardment had failed to destroy the enemy defences. Within two hours, all 20 officers of the Hertfordshires and 75 per cent of other ranks had been killed, wounded or captured. Among the dead was Private George Sherwood, aged 21.Arthur BoardmanKilled in action Nov 18, 1914Three months after this photograph was taken, Corporal Arthur Boardman, 21, became the platoon’s first casualty.He was killed in the early hours of the morning as he went from trench to trench with ration supplies, close to the Belgian village of Zillebeke, near Ypres.Shortly before his death, a comrade had warned him: ‘Watch out for the machine guns — they are lively tonight,’ to which he is said to have selflessly replied: ‘Never mind that — I have to look after the feeding of the men.’His death is starkly recorded in the Hertfordshire Regiment’s official War Diary with the words: ‘18-11-14. Remained in trenches. Corporal Boardman killed and one man missing.’Douglas ChisholmSurvived          Douglas Chisholm survived the war and moved to Southampton with his wifeHe is seen in the photograph standing on the platform next to his future wife, Daisy, who was wearing a floppy sunhat and had come to wave him off. Both were bookbinders who met while working at J. M. Dent’s Temple Press in Letchworth, which produced the popular Everyman’s Library series of books.His grandson, Michael Chisholm, 64, a retired university librarian, told the Mail that a black-and-white postcard version of the platform photograph had been passed down in his family.He said: ‘My grandfather Douglas was a volunteer before the war. He spent a year or so in France, then came back to England, where he was a musketry instructor in the Bedfordshire Regiment.‘He married Daisy in 1918 before the end of the war while he was stationed in England. They had three children, of whom my father was the oldest.’During his time in the Hertfordshires, Douglas was friends with one of its most famous members, Second Lieutenant Frank Young (not pictured), who was awarded the Victoria Cross post-humously for his actions in September 1918 at the Battle of Havrincourt, during which he rescued two of his men who had been captured and, according to the official citation, ‘bombed and silenced an enemy machine-gun’.Daisy, whose maiden name was Mabbitt, is thought to have been either the sister or cousin of Henry Mabbitt (pictured in the left of the photograph). Michael identified the older woman standing next to Douglas as Daisy’s mother.After the war, Douglas and Daisy moved to Southampton, where he continued to work as a bookbinder — until his workplace was bombed by the Luftwaffe during World War II.They then both went to work in a factory building Spitfires. Douglas died in 1953 aged 59.Fred WilkinsonWoundedHe can be seen casually smoking a cigarette as he waits for the train. One of his fingers was shot off on November 19, 1914, but after recovering, he went back to fight on the front line and survived the war.William SmithKilled in action July 31, 1917Like George Sherwood, Private William Smith was among those killed on the first day of the Battle of Passchendaele. He was aged 22. He has no known grave, but is commemorated on the Menin Gate Memorial.Raymond QuinnSurvivedHe was aged just 14 when war was declared and served as a boy bugler in the company. In this picture, he is seen holding his bugle in a case. Boy buglers were typically responsible for sounding reveille, and so on.

It’s a double whammy.”Greenwich and Lewisham councils, who share Blackheath, each allow events to be held in the park for 90 days. With an extra seven days required by the London marathon, full public access to the heath can be restricted for up to 187 days – more than half the year.Smith cited figures to show that Battersea Park hosted approximately 99 events in 1991, compared with more than 600 by 2016. Brockwell Park was also hosting more events because Clapham Common was so often booked, he said.Simon Hunt, the chair of the Friends of Finsbury Park group, said that since the three-day Wireless festival was first staged there in 2014, the park had effectively become a “round-the-clock commercial venue”.“For the majority of the summer months, the park is no longer open, in the proper sense, to the community. It’s now reaching boiling point.”According to the group’s figures, it was occupied by festivals for 113 days (including setup and de-rigging) in the first nine months of 2018 – up from just 29 days in 2015.Friends of Finsbury Park opposed the relicensing of Wireless but Hunt said he did not expect them to be heard when the council issuing the license also stood to gain financially from holding the event.Intense commercial activity in the park over successive years had had far-reaching impacts, he said, including obvious degradation of the ground and birdwatchers reporting fewer sightings.Clapham Common has still not recovered from last year’s Winterville festival, according to the Open Spaces Society who are calling on Lambeth Council to disallow the event, which is held for six weeks in the run-up to Christmas.The ground of the common’s events area resembles “a muddy desert” eight months on from the last Winterville, said the society’s local correspondent Jeremy Clyne. Use of the area for events, coupled with long periods of closure to allow grass a chance to recover, is “resulting in the public being denied access on an almost permanent basis”, said the society.Lambeth Council has so far received 234 objections to the planning application for restaging Winterville festival this year, against 54 expressions of support. The Open Spaces Society said the council has refused to reveal how much it receives for allowing the event on grounds of commercial confidentiality.Smith said financial gain was being prioritised over community benefit. “You could link it to a creeping privatisation – it seems publicly palatable but the effect is just damaging,” he said. “A festival has this sort of friendly face, people do see them as public occasions, but they’re obviously only public occasions if you can afford to get in.”Over-reliance on parks as commercial assets also leaves councils vulnerable to funding shortfalls in the event of festivals being moved or cancelled, Smith said.Simon said it reflected a widespread undervaluing of the benefits of green spaces, particularly in cities.“Parks are a great triumph of the British state that we should be looking after, because once it’s gone it’s gone. We’ve got to realise that parks are special, beyond any financial calculation of what they’re worth.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a28fc75879609070ce098659702872838807cb2/0_323_5411_3247/master/5411.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bcbef8d20d6ddb84027268cf93ef00c8","title":"look future aimee challenor trans green party caroline lucas","story":"A few days ago, David Challenor, the father of a high-profile Green party member, Aimee Challenor, was convicted and sentenced to 22 years in prison for child rape, torture and other depraved and horrific crimes. My thoughts are with the survivors of his shocking and disgusting acts.The Green party has, rightly, faced questions about its association with David Challenor, who in the past has acted as an election agent for his daughter and whose own membership of the party has now been terminated with immediate effect. Our governance bodies have established an urgent and independent formal investigation and a review of the party’s safeguarding and child protection procedures, and Aimee has stepped back from her spokesperson role, as well as withdrawing as a candidate in our current leadership elections.I have faced many calls for immediate action against Aimee – calls that fail to understand the very limited powers I have as a party co-leader and that assume I would be prepared to ditch the fundamental right to due process and a fair hearing. Justice and truth must not be further victims of David Challenor’s crimes and nor must trans people’s rights.That Aimee Challenor is a trans woman should not be relevant here yet others have tried to make a connection. While we can all agree that what her father did was monstrous, the transphobia unleashed against her on social media is absolutely unacceptable. So too is the aggressive and regressive vilification of those wanting to discuss trans issues. There have been bomb threats and bots systematically blocking women on social media to try to silence those who are asking whether trans rights put women’s rights at risk. If we want a more equal society we need to talk about how to get there. The positive response to high-profile celebrities like Caitlyn Jenner has done little to change the fact that trans people experience high rates of suicide, poverty and persecution. Rather than name-calling and accusations of bullying, tackling the routine exclusion and discrimination trans people face requires listening and learning.My party has long recognised that trans women are women and trans men are men. That’s been upheld by the law since 2004 and gender dysphoria is a widely recognised medical condition. I, like many others, have faced my own journey when it comes to understanding a new way of thinking about gender – one that’s resulted in understanding how the idea of gender that’s underpinned my lifelong feminism is very different to what it means and how it feels to be a trans person. For example, I personally still find it very challenging that there is often so much focus on body parts, when a fundamental tenet of my feminism has been that gender is a construct independent of vagina and ovaries.I don’t have the answers to all the difficult questions that are being asked. What I do have is a firm commitment to looking at the facts rather than being swayed by fear and speculation. Take one example: despite what you might read elsewhere, there’s no evidence that allowing trans people to self-declare will open doors for predators intent on abusing or attacking women and girls. Rather, obtaining a gender recognition certificate (GRC) will not change anything much other than removing the obstacles for trans people wanting, for example, an amended birth certificate or driving licence. It does not in any way affect whether a person presents as a man or woman on a daily basis.If an inidual wants to present as a different gender to the one they were assigned at birth, they do not need to go through the self-declaration process to do so. In many of the instances about which there are concerns – for example, women-only spaces being abused – self-declaration will make no difference. Women are not asked to prove their gender when they access refuges or other domestic violence support services, and trans women are already able to access these spaces without any documentation whatsoever. Anyone seeking to cause harm to women can already also try to access these spaces or services, which are in turn entitled to take action if they think a user or potential user poses a risk to others.I’ve not seen any evidence that self-declaration has been routinely abused to gain illegitimate access to women-only spaces in any of the countries where self-declaration already exists. Nor is the theoretical possibility that iniduals might undergo gender reassignment for abusive purposes a good basis for law-making. It’s also worth noting that a GRC is a legal document, and results in someone’s details being formally recorded. Anyone seeking to cause abuse would be drawing attention to themselves by using that route, and it’s far more likely that most people with illegal intentions will seek to operate under the radar.I understand people’s fears, but they must not be used to justify the demonisation of trans people or the denial of their rights, nor as an opportunity to claim that women’s rights are at risk from trans equality. It also detracts from the important work of dismantling our patriarchal social structures. Of creating a society in which we are all truly equal, free and empowered to choose how we live our lives – including the right to choose a different gender to the one assigned at birth and to live free from any gender construct imposed by society.We are living through a time of huge change in our understanding of the way gender works and the way it can be used to oppress others. We will survive not by turning on one another but by defending the right to free speech, protecting against hate crimes, finding a way through the current debate about trans rights that’s respectful of one another and the facts, and refusing to engage in violence and abuse. We will survive by focusing on our shared objective – for all women, whether cis, trans, lesbian, disabled or women of colour, to feel safe.I’m sure I’ve not got everything right, but I believe what matters most is being committed to continuing to learn. Publishing this piece may well bring down anger upon my head and I have thought long and hard about whether to do it. What helped me decide is knowing that unless we’re prepared to listen to each other, and to debate the way forward honestly and respectfully, we’ll never make progress towards the future I believe is possible. I will continue to do all I can to ensure the Green party plays a constructive role and learns the lessons it needs to.• Caroline Lucas is co-leader of the Green party of England and Wales, and the MP for Brighton Pavilion"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40e5aba3243bde8503efe30c637bf93b35c934de/0_161_4790_2874/master/4790.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=578d627e1b13e35ac0c4ed7eea456f41","title":"tories ukip britain entryism","story":"They are unlikely to be devotees of Theresa May’s zombie premiership. The hard-right businessman Arron Banks is spearheading an effort to recruit tens of thousands of supporters of Leave.EU – an organisation that spews anti-Muslim and anti-migrant bile across social media – to the Conservatives. A party that receives more money from the dead than the living is certainly ripe for takeover. The Tory hierarchy is set to be devoured by the monsters it suckled and reared.Let us consider how this act of political matriphagy was made possible. Cameron may have tried to reinvent himself as a husky-hugging social liberal who wanted his party to stop “banging on about Europe”, but he recognised that only a candidate burnishing their Eurosceptic credentials could hope to become leader. When he committed to leave the centre-right European EPP-ED grouping in favour of an alliance with right-wing extremists, he whetted the appetite of his party’s hard-right flank. They would always come back for more, emboldened by every concession.Cameron talked up immigration as a problem to be dealt with while setting impossible targets that were never met, fuelling popular discontent. He announced an EU referendum at the start of 2013, hoping it would appease his backbenchers and lance the Ukip boil. But it was only afterwards that Nigel Farage’s fortified purple army surged in the polls. When Cameron’s friends Michael Gove and Boris Johnson – whose careers he had supported – used the referendum to betray him, their campaign whipped up hysteria about immigrants, further boosting the hard right. As Brexit turfed Cameron out of No 10, his party’s right believed they were the vanguard of a national revolution.And it was May who played the decisive role. The politician who sent racist “Go home” vans around ethnically erse communities was a natural fit for the job. She clothed herself in the garments of the populist right, sticking it to their loathed, caricatured “liberal elite”, who were now “citizens of nowhere”. Right-wing columnists favourably compared her to Enoch Powell. Tory outriders in the press portrayed dissenters and critics as traitors and saboteurs the Daily Mail ran its infamous “Enemies of the people” front page. The paper’s political editor, James Slack, became her official spokesperson and press secretary.May’s strategists hungrily eyed the 4 million voters who plumped for Farageism in 2015 their mouths watering at the Labour-held constituencies whose MPs had smaller majorities than Ukip’s vote tally. By embracing Ukiperry, they calculated, the red-rosetted heartlands of the north and Midlands would tumble to the Tories. “No deal is better than a bad deal,” she declared, normalising a position of extremism. She resorted to immigration-bashing and championing grammar schools – no wonder Farage was ecstatic, noting she was “running on exactly the same ticket” and “using exactly the same words of phrases I have been using for 20 years”.Hubris was met by nemesis: on polling day, working-age Britain decisively rejected the Tories, and their support among minority communities shrank further. But, far from humbled, a hard right nurtured by the Tory hierarchy became hungrier still. Normalised and radicalised by Cameron and May, they had grown tired of extracting concessions from weak leaders: now they must have one of their own.And so now the Ukip army – once derided by Cameron as “fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists” – is flooding into Conservative associations, hoping to remodel the party in its own image. Jacob Rees-Mogg may be an unlikely shout as leader, – would Tory MPs really put him on a shortlist of two to present to their membership? – but he may be the kingmaker, for a canny contender will crave his endorsement. Steve Bannon – now fashioning an international grouping of the far right – courts Rees-Mogg, Johnson and Gove. A hard right takeover is within sight.The nation should fear the consequences: a lethal brew of bigotry, deregulation and rolling back the state beyond Thatcher’s wildest fantasies. And how have these extremists come so close to capturing the British state? The answer is as obvious as it is damning. A combination of the Tory leadership and the Tory press mothered them, just as the Republican hierarchy reared Trumpism. Before, they were too weak to do anything but piggyback. But my, haven’t they grown. And now they may well devour the Conservative party – and become Britain’s new political masters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2be708e1baa8278768dd319ac19337c674356c91/0_0_650_398/master/650.jpg?width=940\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f9ae7eeb3a418931b2c5547e0e50d0b 940w","title":"england faces school places emergency say councils","story":"By 2023 more than half of councils will be unable to meet secondary demand, says LGAParents across England face a severe shortage of secondary school places for their children within the next five years, according to council leaders who saymore than 100,000 children could be affected.The plea by the Local Government Association to avoid an emergency by 2023 came as the government released figures showing that more than a quarter of maintained secondary schools in England were in deficit last year.The LGA said its members were unable to supply more places because the majority of secondary schools are now academies and outside their control, while government restrictions make it very hard for councils to build new schools where needed.“No family should face uncertainty over securing their child’s secondary school,” said Anntoinette Bramble, the chair of the LGA’s children and young people board. “But the reality is we face an emergency in secondary school places where the number of pupils is growing at a far faster rate than the number of places available.”According to the LGA’s forecasts – based on the Department for Education’s projections and the number of school places last year – by 2023-24 more than half the local authorities in England will be unable to meet demand for places with an expected shortfall of 134,000.In recent years, councils have created an estimated 600,000 places in primary schools, to cope with the mini baby boom of the previous decade.But as that boom cohort now nears secondary school age, councils have less ability to expand, with two-thirds of secondaries now independently governed academies.“As a starting point, councils should be allowed to open new maintained schools and direct academies to expand,” Bramble said. “It makes no sense for councils to be given the responsibility to plan for school places but then not allowed to open schools themselves.”The education department said that it is investing £5.8bn to create more good school places, on top of the 735,000 places created since 2010.The squeeze comes as schools continue to tighten their belts, with funding in many cases frozen but declining in real terms because of pay, pension and inflationary pressures.The Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, who received the budget figures in a written parliamentary answer, said: “With a population bubble coming through secondaries, the minister really needs to stop dressing up the numbers and get a grip. Young people get one shot at education it’s time our government started properly investing in them.”In his answer, Gibb said schools were trusted to manage their own budgets and the “vast majority of schools were operating with a cumulative surplus”.Meanwhile, Damian Hinds, the education secretary, released the department’s latest plan to help schools survive, including sending financial advisers to help business managers cut costs and a “toolkit of procurement ideas and deals”.“It’s absolutely right that we help schools to maximise the money they have to spend in the classroom by working together, making sure they’re getting the best deals and are not being overcharged for services,” Hinds said.But the National Education Union said schools needed £2bn to restore funding to where it was just two years ago.“It is high time Damian Hinds accepted this is a real problem and stopped tinkering around at the edges, with suggestions that have either already been implemented in schools or go nowhere near addressing the shortfall of cash needed,” the NEU’s Nansi Ellis said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/309f76a8c362a1de08b533079d1e4cd89ac88592/0_252_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1348f86baa1307e9c1fada80b83507ca","title":"eutrophication algae how animal waste is turning chinas lakes green","story":"Animal husbandry is contaminating China’s water and has been linked to turning lakes bright green, a phenomenon known as eutrophicationThe farm, located at the end of a narrow dirt path, announces its presence with a piercing stench. At first, the caretaker of the collective facility in Kunming says the farm recycles all the animal waste into manure fertiliser. But later, he sheepishly points behind the pigsty.There, hordes of flies swarm above a festering field of grey-black dung. A few times a month, Cai shovels the steaming excrement produced by some 100 swine owned by local families into a nearby creek, where a mile downstream, villagers fish on the rocky shores of a small lake.The hilltop fishing spot feeds into Dianchi Lake in south-western Yunnan province, a major tourist attraction and one of China’s largest fresh water bodies. Dianchi is famous for a number of reasons: its sheer size (nearly 40km long), its distinctive “crescent moon” shape and the surrounding scenic hills and rock gardens. But it has another distinguishing feature for several decades, each summer the surface of Dianchi has turned bright green from algae blooms caused by excess nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus – a largely manmade phenomenon known as eutrophication.Eutrophication plagues areas around the world where rapid urbanisation and agricultural growth has taken place near bodies of water. When it rains, chemicals from cities, factories and fertilisers or untreated animal waste on farms can wash into lakes, streams and rivers. The extra nutrients feed algae on the surface of the water that can proliferate enough to block light. This deprives organisms of the light they need to photosynthesise. In the UK, for example, Tamar Lakes in south-western England suffered intense eutrophication pollution between 1975 and the 2000s, and the phenomena is also widespread in estuaries and coastal areas in the US.China’s surging appetite for meat has compounded the problem. Pork is by far the most popular type of meat consumed nationally, and the humble pig enjoys an exalted status in Chinese culture as a lucky creature symbolising prosperity and peace.But environmentalists say the average citizen in China does not connect their love of pork to water pollution.In Dianchi Lake the algal bloom is so heavy that when speedboats pass near the boardwalk, they spray a green-tinged wake. On the beaches of the north-eastern coastal city of Qingdao, the algae is so thick in summers that tourists cannot even wade through so they make the best of the situation by burying themselves in the algae for pictures.Cai cannot afford to eat much meat. He comes from a destitute part of the neighbouring province of Guizhou and has only lived in Kunming for two years. He sleeps in a shed next to the pigsty and has never heard of Dianchi Lake, let alone eutrophication.The joint family farm he manages is part of a local government drive launched in 2013 to consolidate small farms into bigger ones to help alleviate poverty. Officials provide caretakers with information on breeds, technology, disease prevention and sales but have not enacted regulations on waste treatment procedures.The underlying issue is economic, says Prof Rachel Stern, who specialises in environmental law in China at UC Berkeley. “The local government is reluctant to impose expensive pollution reduction requirements on small farms that can ill afford them.“In other pollution hotspots, local governments have typically solved similar issues either by providing pollution reduction subsidies, or coming up with an economic re-development plan to re-employ those who lose their livelihood,” she says.It is a similar sight at another small pig farm around 50km away from Dianchi Lake, where a plot of agricultural land stands next to apartments towers. Animal faeces is piled up beside a small pigsty.“Generally the way the government tries to solve water pollution is to shut down small animal farms and to make them into bigger factories,” says Wang Jing, head of Greenpeace East Asia’s food and agriculture programme.“But this disrupts the pre-existing loop of agriculture in China which is to recycle animal waste into fertiliser using traditional methods. Some of the biggest farms do have industrial converters on site but they’re disincentivised to use them because they’re not legally obliged to and the cost of running the machine costs more than the value of the fertiliser produced,” Wang says.Protected by high brick walls and a pack of guard dogs, it houses some 10,000 pigs for supply to the national market. Its website boasts the farm uses top agricultural technologies. Photographs in local media show pigs in pristine pens.“We opened here in 2008 and in 2010 we started using an industrial machine to convert waste into fertiliser. It was an important thing to do to protect the water and the soil,” says Ge Tao, a sales representative for the company.“Some farms have it but some don’t. It’s not a government regulation to have it,” Ge says, adding that he wasn’t sure how waste was processed before 2010.Reflecting on the green sludge in Dianchi, Ge says even though it is caused by various factors, privately owned farms should do their part to reduce pollution. However, the  was not permitted to tour the company’s grounds because of quarantine policies, and could not confirm whether the fertiliser converter was being operated."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf77814464b3737c7c61f4b7751c3a90883919ff/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c64628766aa17795eef6c308b4dc5d9e","title":"trade of coastal sand is damaging wildlife of poorer nations study finds","story":"Wealthy nations’ drastic increase in construction sand consumption contributes to erosion of estuaries The secretive trade of coastal sand to wealthy countries such as China is seriously damaging the wildlife of poorer nations whose resources are being plundered, according to a new study.Sand and gravel are the most extracted groups of materials worldwide after water, with sand used in the concrete and asphalt of global cities. China consumed more sand between 2011 and 2013 than the US did during the entire 20th century. India has more than tripled its annual use of construction sand since 2000.But coastal sand is also being used to make wealthy countries larger via land reclamation projects, and the cost to poorer nations is revealed in a presentation to the Royal Geographical Society’s annual conference.Research by Melissa Marschke and Laura Schoenberger of the University of Ottawa highlights that the dredging of coastal sand from Cambodia is causing the loss of mangrove swamps, coastal erosion, and damaging local fishing. They also allege that the sheer scale of the multimillion dollar trade of sand must be illegal, given that the volumes permitted for import are being exceeded.Singapore is built on sand: its land area has grown by more than a fifth since its independence in 1965 from 581 sq km to 719 sq km in 2015, according to the researchers. Between 2007 and 2017, Singapore imported more sand from Cambodia than any other country.Sand worth US$752m was imported by Singapore from Cambodia between 2007 and 2016, according to UN data.Cambodia is not the only place experiencing vast sand extraction. A study recently estimated that 236m cubic metres of sand were extracted from Poyang Lake in China, causing its water levels to drop dramatically. Sand miners have destroyed at least two dozen islands in Indonesia since 2005. The UK obtains about one fifth of its sand from the seabed.Cambodian figures claim that the total export worth for the same time period was just $5m but Singapore trade statistics show that 80.22m metric tons of sand was imported from Cambodia, compared with the 2.77m metric tons Cambodia claims was exported to Singapore.Schoenberger, a postdoctoral fellow, told the conference: “The volume of sand that has been leaving Cambodia over the last ten years is absolutely illegal way beyond the government’s permitted limits.“Small amounts of sand can be legally exported, but Singaporean import figures reveal that this Cambodian resource is clearly, and rapidly, disappearing. It appears that someone with high level connections in the Cambodian government is making a lot of money.”Desert sand is too rounded by the wind to make good concrete but coastal sand can be rinsed with freshwater to clean it of salt before use in construction. Coastal sand is also a key ingredient in land reclamation projects such as China’s expansion into the South China Sea.Schoenberger and Marschke interviewed villagers and sand dredgers in Cambodia and found that most dredgers were entrepreneurs with small boats who extracted the sand in estuaries and close to coastal fisheries, damaging local crab and fish stocks.According to Marschke, associate professor at the University of Ottowa, the noise and sediment disturbance causes grouper fish to relocate and drives crabs from the area. Subsequent erosion of mangroves destroys vital fish and crab breeding grounds and damages a natural sea defence for coastal communities.“Sand mining is contributing to the erosion of estuaries, the collapse of riverbanks and loss of mangroves,” said Marschke. “The removal of vast quantities of sand will definitely impact upon coastal erosion.”Marschke said: “We need to realise that sand is a finite resource and we are overusing it and if we don’t start to manage it properly it has huge implications.”Schoenberger said the issue of rich nations buying poor nations’ sands was “a huge social justice question”.She added: “What does it mean for a wealthy country to grow out into the sea and up into the sky at the expense of the physical biomaterial of poor countries?“Sand is not a renewable resource within human timescales.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/348e5f1eb18c9472aecb7fb29a018eeea791932b/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf3d69acd54a752557788f870447a7b1","title":"destination wedding review keanu reeves winona ryder","story":"The 90s stalwarts boast a spiky chemistry in this slight, entertaining tale of two misanthropes begrudgingly bonding while attending a weddingMuch of the online excitement over the repairing of Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder has little to do with their previous onscreen couplings and more to do with what they symbolise about a decade and a half in film. Does anyone really remember Francis Ford Coppola’s opulent imagining of Dracula for their stiff, awkwardly accented, chemistry-free scenes together? Was Richard Linklater’s A Scanner Darkly known predominantly as a vehicle for the two stars to showcase their rapport? Did they even share a scene in The Private Lives of Pippa Lee? Or instead, is there just an abundance of nostalgic thirst for a film focused entirely around Veronica SawyerLelaina PierceLydia Deetz hanging out with TedJohnny UtahJack Traven?It’s why there was such giddiness over a recent viral story that suggested the pair might actually have accidentally got married while filming Dracula. For many of us, they’re an extension of our youth, like absurdly attractive, staggeringly rich popular kids from school we envied from afar. Their reappearance transports us back to the heyday of their disaffected cool and any 90s kid inevitably enters their fourth film together with some unavoidable baggage. For such Reeves and Ryder fetishists, there’s plenty here to moon over, given that in Destination Wedding, they share more screentime than their other three outings combined.The reason for this is a rather nifty, if restrictive, gimmick that posits the pair in a variety of situations yet refuses to listen in on anything else happening outside of their interactions. It’s a bit like watching a play with just two characters, an 88-minute chamber piece, the enjoyment of which will depend on one’s tolerance for the duo. Given that they’re both playing bitchy misanthropes judging those around them, it’s also a bit like watching a nastier, sexier Statler and Waldorf let loose at a wedding. The nuptials in question are happening at a remote Californian location and the film opens with Frank (Reeves) and Lindsay (Ryder) meeting at the airport, developing an almost instant mutual disgust.They’re appalled to be going to a wedding, let alone a selfishly designed destination wedding, and the ensuing action, or rather lack thereof, sees them slowly bonding over their hatred for the world around them.It’s not unusual to see a romantic comedy that is a) set a wedding and b) unfolding between two characters who initially hate each other, but Destination Wedding does manage to spin these tired cliches into something somewhat fresh. While the backdrop is familiar, the script’s bracing cynicism turns it into a hellscape for our leads, who balk at the extravagance on display. Given that we’re not even given the chance to meet the bride and groom, all we have is acerbic commentary provided by two people who hate them both and most of the other guests while they’re at it. Writer-director Victor Levin, who brought similarly astute rat-a-tat dialogue to the underrated TV comedy Survivor’s Remorse, taps into that clandestine thrill of quietly berating those around you with someone who’s on the same, bitter page.While some of the dialogue does border on overwritten (“Why would you want me to perpetuate my circumstances?” etc), there’s enough wit and finely observed pedantry to make up for the occasional indulgence. In a slight film that’s almost wall-to-wall dialogue the pair criticise everything from each other to people who confuse formally with formerly to political correctness to wine bottles with screw tops to those assholes who take a free sample of salami at the supermarket and then drop the toothpick on the floor after. Such a barrage of unending nastiness might not be to everyone’s taste, and at times it can get a bit grating, but if you’ve suffered through enough weddings as a singleton, it might prove to be a rather addictive tonic.The pair share an easy, spiky chemistry and Reeves in particular shows himself to be surprisingly skilled at delivering such bile-filled dialogue. Given the staginess, Levin tries to force a few scenes of broad physical comedy with little success, although he does mine some laughs from an awkward field-based sex scene (“There’s kelp at or near my vagina,” Ryder complains as Reeves thrusts, bored). When the film inevitably lurches toward romance, it’s slightly frustrating that out of the two, it’s Ryder’s character whose cynicism melts into affection. It would have been far more interesting to see a gender switch there but still, the script mostly keeps its characters true to themselves. There’s no grand declaration of love, just the slow, oddly touching realisation that sometimes, the person who hates the same things as you just might be the person you hate the least."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/184c2f51a7dc63a522171f1d42f947d7b1bcf39f/0_129_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=678cf75636f307e1a9e50cb7768037e1","title":"the favourite review olivia colman yorgos lanthimos","story":"Yorgos Lanthimos brings scabrous energy to this dark comedy of 18th-century court intrigue and Colman excels herselfJust when we thought Olivia Colman couldn’t get any better, she steps up to movie-star lead status with an uproarious performance as Britain’s needy and emotionally wounded Queen Anne in this bizarre black comedy of the 18th-century court, a souped up and sweary quasi-Restoration romp full of intrigue and plotting – with wigs, clavichords and long corridors to storm down. The drama is loosely based on the true story of Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, competing with her cousin Abigail, Baroness Masham, for the monarch’s favours, and creating a horribly dysfunctional politico-sexual love triangle with mother issues. The two emotional duelists are played here by Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone, the latter with a very good Brit accent.There is a cheerfully obscene original script from Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara, directed by the Greek auteur Yorgos Lanthimos, who brings to it the absurdism he’s already known for, along with something even more jagged and uninhibited. In fact, The Favourite may have corrected Lanthimos’s tendency towards arthouse torpor. It is a scabrous and often hilarious film, made loopier by the nightmarish visions and wide-angle distortions contrived by the cinematographer Robbie Ryan.At first – I admit it – I thought these stylisations were going to be insufferable, and even had the unworthy thought that this script might work quite as well with a trad director, in a trad style. But no. Acclimatisation to the visual and verbal rhetoric doesn’t take long and the point is that Lanthimos’s provocations pump and energise the screenplay, which with a conventional director might have just reverted to simpering bonnets-and-ruffles period drama, for all the raucous language.Olivia Colman’s queen is a really funny creation – perhaps funnier and more sympathetic than her Queen Elizabeth II is going to be for Netflix, but who knows how she will reinvent that role? Her Anne is like something between the QEI that Quentin Crisp created in Sally Potter’s Orlando and a weird blend of Nursey and QEI in Blackadder. But that doesn’t do justice to the sadness of her Queen Anne: someone who has been infantilised by a lifetime of emotional manipulation. She is transported everywhere by wheelchair or sedan chair but can walk just as well. She sometimes flies into something between an anxiety attack and a rage at the sound of music or the spectacle of people enjoying themselves because of a self-hating inability to participate in pleasure. There is a private tragedy in her life which means that her emotional energies have been displaced into her large menagerie of house rabbits and she shows a keen interest in racing ducks and lobsters. Again: in the hands of an actor who wasn’t funny this could have been awful, but Colman sells all of it.Weisz plays her court favourite and intimate Lady Sarah, who deploys every sly sexual and emotional trick to keep the monarch co-dependent and keen on the raising of taxes for an ongoing French war that will glorify Lady Sarah’s warrior husband Marlborough (Mark Gatiss). This is to the horror of minister, Robert Harley (Nicholas Hoult). Then a gentlewoman and cousin of Sarah’s, fallen on hard times, arrives at the court as a servant: this is Abigail (Stone), whose knowledge of medicinal herbs helps the queen’s gout. Her majesty takes a shine to the pretty little thing. So does the predatory nobleman Lord Masham (Joe Alwyn). The contest between Abigail and Sarah is on like the 18th-century equivalent of Donkey Kong.If there is a flaw in the film, it is probably that Colman will inevitably upstage Stone and Weisz, and put their very important face-off in the shade. That is a minor consideration. The Favourite is full of freaky zingers and deeply strange laugh-lines: I loved the idea of someone sleeping like a “shot badger”. (There’s quite a lot about badgers.) And The Favourite is a reminder that the idea of royalty as polite and picturesquely sentimental is something that came in with Queen Victoria: The Favourite is more punk than that. It’s a rousingly nasty, bleary, hungover punchup."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d46dc6c9597726cbd818ea5e92d4426480cc0eb/0_213_3861_2317/master/3861.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f114c946e024aac8079d3e0bc9b42956","title":"jamie oliver spent 13m to save italian chain hours before bankruptcy","story":"Chef reveals he still does not understand why restaurants ran into financial troubleJamie Oliver has revealed that his restaurant chain was hours from bankruptcy before he rescued it by injecting nearly £13m of his own money into the business.The celebrity chef and entrepreneur said he still did not fully understand why Jamie’s Italian ran into financial trouble and came close to collapse in September last year.He has since shut 12 of the chain’s 37 restaurants and made about 600 staff redundant in an attempt to save the rest of the operation.“We had simply run out of cash,” Oliver, 43, said in an interview with the Financial Times.“And we hadn’t expected it. That is just not normal, in any business. You have quarterly meetings. You do board meetings. People supposed to manage that stuff should manage that stuff.”Oliver got his big break when a visiting TV crew spotted him while he was working at the River Cafe in Hammersmith, leading to his own show The Naked Chef.Since then he has built a TV, publishing and restaurant empire, and amassed a net worth of £150m in 2017, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.Oliver said he injected £7.5m of this wealth into Jamie’s Italian, supplemented by a further £5.2m in the months that followed. The business had racked up debts of £71.5m.“I had two hours to put money in and save it or the whole thing would go to shit that day or the next day,” he said. “It was as bad as that and as dramatic as that.”The rescue plans also required £37m in loans from HSBC, as well as subsidies from other parts of Oliver’s businesses, among them Jamie Oliver Holdings, which oversees his publishing and media activity.But more than 10 months after the chain came close to bankruptcy, the chef said he was still unclear why it ran into difficulty.Jamie’s Italian was rescued via a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), which allowed for the closure of stores, a move Oliver insisted was necessary to save the remainder of the chain and 1,600 jobs.He also had to pursue a controversial “pre-pack” arrangement to save one of his two Barbecoa steak restaurants, hiving it off into a new company with no responsibility for the original business’s debts.The group has said that suppliers initially left out of pocket have since been repaid.Oliver defended the business decisions taken by Paul Hunt, his brother-in-law and the chief executive of Jamie Oliver Group since 2014, who instigated a restructuring effort that was followed by allegations by former staff about a “bullying” style.He said: “Do you know why I chose him? Because he’s many things. But he’s honest, and he’s fair. I absolutely trust him.“His job was to come in and clean up. He has done the hardest and most fabulous job. I’m not saying that because he’s my brother-in-law. I’m saying it because it’s a fact.”Jamie Oliver has established a sprawling business empire since he was talent-spotted by a TV crew in 1997 while working at a restaurant in London.In 2015, Oliver shut the last branch of Recipease – his chain of cookery shops – and the last of his four British-themed Union Jacks restaurants went the same way two years later. Last October his food magazine, Jamie, ceased publication after almost 10 years, while his Jamie’s Italian chain was forced to cut jobs and close sites this year.But Oliver retains a wide range of lucrative culinary business interests, ranging from recipe books to wood-fired ovens.At Jamie Oliver Licensing, which covers his endorsements and range of products and tie-ups, pre-tax profit rose to £7.3m from £7m in 2016, according to accounts filed with Companies House.Profit at Jamie Oliver Holdings, which covers his media interests, rose to £5.4m from £1m.Oliver paid himself £10m in idends in 2016 – £6m from the licensing business and £4m from media. He has never taken any money from the restaurant business."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8fe08c20f039f741092306085b3d17040e3b24b/0_80_4708_2825/master/4708.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3fb441ff9772d4085218a2d24a1ca401","title":"champions league manchester united liverpool spurs manchester city","story":"Every side in the group has reached the final none of them have won the European Cup. Diego Simeone continues to work miracles to keep Atlético competitive in what would otherwise be a two-horse race in Spain, and with Antoine Griezmann staying and the arrival of Thomas Lemar, this looks the strongest Atlético in a few years – and the final will be hosted at their Wanda politano home.After a disappointing couple of seasons, a 4-1 demolition of RB Leipzig on the opening weekend suggested Lucien Favre might be the man to make Dortmund competitive again. Monaco reached the Champions League semi-final in 2017 but their trajectory has been sadly predictable as their best players were picked off. Second last season could become something worse this, after a start that has brought four points from three games. Club Brugge, who reached the final in 1978, have not won a game in the Champions League group stage in 13 years.Tottenham, having negotiated a brutal group in 2017-18, found the draw no easier this time. They will still wonder just how they managed to lose to Juventus in the round of 16 last season when they dominated for all but about half an hour of the tie. The key is to process that experience and develop, just as last season they improved on the year before, but that will be far from straightforward.Increasingly, the ideology-led approach of Barcelona seems to be fading, as they become just another club signing top players. Despite the arrival of Malcom and Arturo Vidal, this does not necessarily look a stronger Barça than the side that lost in the quarter-final last season. Inter are in yet more transition. Having made a series of intriguing signings, bringing in the likes of Radja Nainggolan, Kwadwo Asamoah and Stefan de Vrij, they have begun by taking just a point from two winnable home games. PSV, meanwhile, are under an inexperienced manager in Mark van Bommel.On the face of it, this is the toughest group, but Liverpool should be confident of progressing. They look a stronger side than last season, with Alisson a clear improvement in goal and far greater strength in depth for Jürgen Klopp to call upon in midfield. PSG, meanwhile, are living proof that while being rich is one thing, using wisely the advantages that brings is something else.Thomas Tuchel is a far more system-driven manager than Unai Emery, and much will depend on whether he can reconcile the tension between his idea of football and Neymar’s self-indulgent tendencies. There will be a reunion for PSG with a former manager, Carlo Ancelotti, who has led Napoli to two straight victories in a tricky start to the season despite the loss of Jorginho to Chelsea. Red Star Belgrade, the 1991 European Cup winners, secured their place in the group stage for the first time with victory in an away-goals play-off win over Red Bull Salzburg.A fascinatingly equal group, which is another way of saying it is probably the weakest of the eight. When Yuri Semin returned to Lokomotiv Moscow for a fourth spell in charge, it was widely seen as a sentimental appointment but the wily 71-year-old inspired them to a first league title in 14 years (when he was also in charge). Igor Denisov and Grzegorz Krychowiak form a formidable central midfield but Lok are still the pot one side everybody would have wanted.There’s been the usual swirl of ins and outs at Porto and, while they are as good as anybody in the world game at managing that, five goals conceded in their last two league games suggests a vulnerability. The danger for Schalke is that they go the way of so many other Bundesliga sides and, having qualified for the Champions League, fail to reproduce the form that got them there. The loss of Leon Goretzka to Bayern Munich does not help. The Turkish champions Galatasaray complete the group.A group of former winners, with 11 European Cups and Champions Leagues between Bayern, Benfica and Ajax. Niko Kovac took over as Bayern manager in the summer and immediately increased the physical load on players, something that may sit well with a group of German players who have something to prove after a dismal World Cup. Benfica, Rui Vitória’s Portuguese runners-up, remain unbeaten in seven this season and, under pressure after drawing the home leg of their play-off against PAOK, went to Greece and won 4-1 this week. Pizzi has been in prolific form this season, racking up six goals already.Ajax picked up Daley Blind and Dusan Tadic from the Premier League in the summer, and after finishing second in the Netherlands last season, they were impressive in beating Dynamo Kyiv in a play-off. AEK have not been in the group stage since 2006-07 but Marinos Ouzounidis’s side ended Olympiakos’s run of seven straight league titles last season.Manchester City’s squad is awesomely strong even if Kevin De Bruyne is likely to miss the entirety of the group stage with his knee injury. Pep Guardiola’s failure to win the Champions League since 2011 has called into doubt his methods against the absolute elite, but that should not be an issue at this stage. There is a familiar group-stage opponent with City, like last year, grouped with Shakhtar. Bernard, Fred and Darijo Srna have gone, but four Brazilians have been signed as Shakhtar have maintained the policy that has brought them such success. They are still unable to play in Donetsk, but Paulo Fonseca’s side completed a second successive double last season – and were the first side to beat City, albeit in a dead rubber in Ukraine, having lost 2-0 at the Etihad.Lyon, who will have to play their first home game behind closed doors as punishment for disorder at last season’s Europa League tie against CSKA Moscow, and Hoffenheim make up the group.Real Madrid may have won the past three Champions Leagues, but there is a vulnerability about them this season, as highlighted in their defeat to Atlético in the Super Cup. The manager and player most responsible for those successes have left and the underlying structure was never that convincing – something seen in how rarely Real actually controlled games even while winning them. But a capacity to peak at the right moment in Europe, even while treading water in the league, has long been a trademark.They have, anyway, been a little fortunate with the draw. Roma’s summer transfer business was frenetic, with 12 players coming in on permanent deals, while the likes of Nainggolan have left. A repeat of last season’s semi-final seems unlikely. CSKA Moscow, similarly, have lost key players with Bebars Natcho, Pontus Wernbloom and Aleksandr Golovin all departing one win in five league games this season tells its own story. Viktoria Plzen may be minnows, but they have begun their defence of the Czech title with six wins out of six.There is no doubting the major story of Group H, with Cristiano Ronaldo marking his transfer to Juventus with a return to Old Trafford. No side embodies the optimism of Serie A so much as Juventus and their summer business. After seven straight scudetti, this summer felt like a concerted effort, after two defeats in finals in the past four seasons, to win a first Champions League since 1996. Ronaldo may not be as mobile as he was, but he is as close to a guarantee of goals in major games as anybody.For José Mourinho, whose grumpiness is already threatening to overshadow this season, the draw has offered more bad news. If the Premier League continues to be a struggle, there will be no respite in Europe.Valencia finished fourth in La Liga last season and may be even stronger this having signed Michy Batshuayi, Kevin Gameiro, Denis Cheryshev and Geoffrey Kondogbia. Young Boys, after winning the league for the first time since 1986, at least offer some relief."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5588fb60bef281482a0910da5ca8682df8c746ba/528_256_3045_1827/master/3045.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78d63904a6e9b767d5b22f6dde3bd454","title":"more mourinho mithering and saido berahino scores football weekly extra","story":"Max is joined by Barry Glendenning, Andy Brassell and Lars Sivertsen to discuss Mourinho (again), Carabao Cup action, Declan Rice’s international dilemma, Hal Robson-Kanu’s international retirement and flesh-eating ratsJoin the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

West Ham took very little beating in their opener, while subsequent victories over Crystal Palace and Brighton were a mite laboured. An away trip to Leicester on Saturday lunchtime should provide another reasonably stiff test ahead of what is likely to be a more challenging trip to Tottenham Hotspur after the international break. Leicester clearly missed the searing pace of the suspended Jamie Vardy against Southampton and Kelechi Iheanacho struggled to impress in his role as replacement. The striker got off the mark for the season against Fleetwood Town in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday and with Vardy sitting out the last instalment of a three-match ban , he needs a big performance against the – thus far – impregnable two-man portcullis that is Virgil van Dijk and Joe Gomez, if he is to stake any sort of claim for keeping Vardy out upon his return. BG• Jamie Vardy: ‘I get abuse but I give it back’• Salah blames Egypt’s FA for World Cup disruptionsWest Ham are feeling a bit better about life after their Carabao Cup win over the 10 men of AFC Wimbledon, but it will not be easy for them to back up their first competitive victory under Manuel Pellegrini when Wolves visit the London Stadium on Saturday afternoon. While Wolves only have two points from their first three games, they earned plaudits for their brave approach in last week’s home draw with Manchester City, and the newly promoted side could earn their first league win if Ruben Neves and Joao Moutinho undermine Pellegrini’s suggestion that Jack Wilshere could become the East End’s answer to Andrea Pirlo. West Ham have suffered in midfield so far and a fourth consecutive defeat would see them equal their wretched start under Avram Grant in 2010. They finished bottom that season. JS• Wolves’ attacking verve offers new approach to facing Man City• Pellegrini says Rice could shine for EnglandAmid all the ongoing hoop-la surrounding Manchester United’s defeat at the hands of Tottenham Hotspur and José Mourinho’s subsequent post-match meltdown, it is easy to forget that for long periods of the game Manchester United actually played quite well. Their players created chances and moved with a sense of speed and urgency that was conspicuous by its absence in what was an embarrassingly sluggish performance in defeat against Brighton. There is, however, little or no getting away from the fact that their defence is a shambles and that Mourinho’s first choice rearguard is comprised mainly of defenders playing for other teams. Of those he has at his disposal, Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville could scarcely have been blunter in their assessment of Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and Victor Lindelof on Monday Night Football, while the sight of Ander Herrera in a back three left them and everyone else – including, possibly, Herrera – totally flabbergasted. Whether or not Burnley are good enough to take advantage of this chaos remains to be seen, but it will be difficult for Sean Dyche to plan how best to do so when he, like the rest of us, has little idea what or who exactly his players will be up against. BG• Burnley’s Europa League dream ends with draw against Olympiakos• Mourinho is a saint compared with Burnley’s Lord of provocation• Is Mourinho still the man to fix Manchester United’s problems?The official line from Arsenal was that Mesut Özil was absent because of illness when they secured their first win of the Unai Emery era by beating West Ham. Yet that was accompanied by whispers of Emery clashing with Özil before the West Ham game and it will be fascinating to see if Arsenal’s manager finds space for the German in his starting 11 against Cardiff City on Sunday. The sense that Emery will not indulge the midfielder as much as Arsène Wenger did will grow if Özil, who signed a three-and-a-half year contract worth £350,000 a week in February, finds himself on the bench at the Cardiff City Stadium. JS• Unai Emery fails to mask friction with Mesut Özil• Löw reveals snub by Özil after international retirement• Cardiff and Huddersfield humbled in Carabao CupGoals and lots of them, is this previewer’s prediction for the encounter between Chelsea and Bournemouth at Stamford Bridge, although who’ll score the majority of them is anyone’s guess. Despite winning their opening three games, scoring no fewer than eight goals in the process, Chelsea’s defending has at times been little short of slapstick and the in-form Josh King and Callum Wilson will be rubbing their hands with glee at the prospect of running at David Luiz and Antonio Rüdiger. Bournemouth have scored two goals in each of their three league games so farand banged in another three against MK Dons in the Carabao Cup. The porousness of Chelsea’s back four suggests this streak is unlikely to end before the international break. With Chelsea similarly prolific up front, this has the makings of a potential humdinger. Cue a stampede of shrewdies to the bookies, getting their money down on a scoreless draw. BG• Zouma insists Chelsea career is not over despite Everton loan• The Knowledge: Who are the single match possession kings?Tottenham will have to beware Roberto Pereyra’s flashes of brilliance when they visit Vicarage Road on Sunday. Pereyra has scored three goals in Watford’s first two home games and the improving Argentinian, who has struggled for consistency and fitness since leaving Juventus in 2016, has played a major role in his side’s immaculate start to the season. Yet Tottenham have also started with three wins and they will pose Javi Gracia’s side their toughest test so far, not least because Mauricio Pochettino has his own bewitching South American to call upon. Outstanding in the 3-0 win at Old Trafford, Lucas Moura has given Pochettino’s attack an even sharper edge. JS• Not just gold on line for Son Heung-min in Asian Games final• Son’s hopes of military reprieve rise as South Korea reach final• Spurs want Carabao Cup tie played in Milton Keynes• Spurs’ Edwards joins Excelsior on loan in push to ignite careerSouthampton were Crystal Palace’s first opponents under Roy Hodgson after Frank De Boer’s ill-fated spell in charge at Selhurst Park last season and emerged victorious courtesy of an early Steven Davis goal. Christian Benteke’s wretched form has been documented at length in previous editions of this column and elsewhere and having replaced him as a substitute three times already this season, the Norwegian striker Alexander Sorloth staked his claim for a start in Palace’s starting line-up by scoring the only goal of the game against Swansea City in the Carabao Cup earlier this week. If Southampton can shackle Wilfred Zaha, they’ll go a long way towards shackling the entire Palace team. Extremely aggressive as a player, Mark Hughes will no doubt have noticed the systematic fouling employed by Watford in what proved an ultimately futile effort to keep the winger quiet last Sunday. These roughhouse tactics did work for over an hour, however, which may prompt Hughes to instruct his Saints to turn sinners for the afternoon. Following calls for more protection for Zaha from his manager, team-mates and assorted pundits, Saturday’s match referee Martin Atkinson may become the latest to incur the increasingly tedious wrath of Hughes. BG• Allardyce loses case against Daily  for paper’s ‘sting’• England after Vardy: 10 forwards Southgate could turn toEverton entertain Huddersfield without Richarlison, who is suspended following his moment of petulance against Bournemouth last weekend. The 21-year-old Brazilian has been hugely influential for the Toffees so far this season, earning himself an international call-up in the process, but Marco Silva must now plan without him for two Premier League games. Richarlison’s impetuousness could have a big bearing on the future of Ademola Lookman, who has been angling for a move away from the club before the European transfer window closes today due to his frustration at a lack of first-team opportunities. With his fellow wingers Nikola Vlasic and Yannick Bolasie out on loan, now that a short-term opportunity has presented itself, the youngster’s hopes of securing a move to RB Leipzig look to have been stymied until January at earliest. BG• Michael Keane out for a month with hairline skull fracture• Classic YouTube: A young Marseille fan goes rogue• Why would anyone be a Sunday league ref? The love of the gameSlavisa Jokanovic’s decision to change his entire starting eleven for Tuesday night’s Carabao Cup win over Exeter City has given him something of a selection headache ahead of Fulham’s visit to Brighton. Summer signings Alfie Mawson and Sergio Rico made accomplished debuts, while Ryan Sessegnon, Aboubakar Kamara and Stefan Johansen also earned plaudits, with Jokanovic admitting several of his fringe players have given him plenty to think about. Having made so many apparently shrewd purchases over the summer to swell the ranks ahead of life in the Premier League, he’ll be pleased to see the players who helped secure promotion are not prepared to give up their first team places without a fight. His efforts to keep everyone happy will be a test of his talents as a manager, but for now it is a pleasant problem for him to have. BG• Clint Dempsey retires from football at age of 35• Brighton to offer free sanitary products to female fansThree matches in and Newcastle already look to be in a battle for survival, even if there is no particular shame in losing to Tottenham and Chelsea, or failing to take all three points against Cardiff City. Next up is a trip to Manchester City and it’s difficult to imagine Rafael Benítez will change the negative tactics that earned him and his side so much opprobrium last weekend against Chelsea. As awful as Newcastle were to watch, their approach almost worked and it would be exceptionally naïve to think Benitez will kow-tow to critics, order his players to buckle their swashes, play an expansive game that seems to be beyond their collective skill set against such accomplished opposition and risk getting thrashed. A pragmatist who is trying to make the best use of the limited tools made available to him while working with one hand tied behind his back, Benítez will try and probably fail to come away from the Etihad Stadium with a point. Wolves have proved City are not infallible, but despite being new to the Premier League, serious summer investment means they already look far more well equipped to stay in it than Newcastle’s comparatively motley crew.

Now posties have a new tool at their disposal‘This one will bite the letters and head butt the door,” smiles Charlie, a postal worker I am shadowing on his rounds. He slides a\u0026nbspcatalogue halfway inside the letterbox of a green door, and it is instantly snatched by jaws unseen. I\u0026nbspcan tell by the sound that there is drool on the carpet. “Good boy!” I\u0026nbspwhisper through the door.I am here to learn about the threat\u0026nbspof dogs to postal staff, as part of Royal Mail’s annual drive to raise awareness. Yet not only is my blindly\u0026nbsppro-dog prejudice part of the\u0026nbspproblem, I am too excited to learn anything. I have always been fascinated by the post, with its nostalgic link to national services – even after privatisation, the company has kept its government charter, the universal service obligation to deliver to 30m addresses for the same price.More than that, though, I am fascinated by the business of being a\u0026nbspcheeky postal worker. It is an alternative career I always wondered about. Now I am actually on a round, I can’t stop asking Charlie questions. What’s the most annoying thing to deliver? (The Harrods catalogue: too\u0026nbspthick.) Does he ignore signs that say “No junk mail please”? (Yes: it’s\u0026nbspnot his job to decide what is junk\u0026nbspmail or not.) What do his regulars say to him every day? (“One\u0026nbspof them says: ‘Morning Postman Pat, where’s your black and\u0026nbspwhite cat?”)Such a wholesome life, I think, picturing myself with the red bag, the red top, the company trainers with a red stripe on the tongue. On a nearby patch of grass, I see a handsome boxer, squatting. I beckon the good boy over and we fraternise. “That’s actually against the guidelines,” says Henry Perry, external relations manager for Royal Mail, who is also with us. In dog safety recommendations for staff, the company uses the acronym Avoid, in which the “A” stands for … well, avoid. (The others are Defend, Inform, Observe and Value Yourself, that latter of which sounds quite spiritual, but basically means don’t enter a garden with an unchained cockapoo in it.)Meeting dogs is one of the top five reasons I like to imagine being a postal worker. Isn’t the eternal rivalry between pooch and postie cute? Somehow very British?“This Dennis the Menace idea, that a dog hanging off the seat of your pants is an occupational hazard – I have a problem with that,” says Shaun Davis, global safety director at Royal Mail. “It’s like saying: ‘If you don’t want to get held up by a bank robber, don’t work in a bank.’” It turns out that dog attacks are one of the top five threats to postal staff. Fingers and thumbs have been bitten off, even a nose. Injuries to calves, buttocks and testicles are common. In 2017, there were more than six attacks a day. It’s a country-wide problem: last year, Sheffield saw the highest number of incidents, this year it was Taunton. As Davis describes the life-changing injuries that mean some postal staff are unable to return to their routes, and\u0026nbsprequire much mental health support afterwards, I realise that I\u0026nbsphave been naive.“I don’t use postal pegs they can’t\u0026nbsptake any weight,” says Charlie, dismissing the tongs staff are encouraged to use to deliver mail through letterboxes. Perry looks sad, because this is not a very on-message thing to say. (Thirteen per cent of dog attacks on postal staff\u0026nbspare of the fingers-in-letterbox variety.)Charlie is exactly what I like to imagine postal workers are like: an unnaturally fast mover, nipping over walls, earbuds hanging over one ear, trying to beat his personal best time for the round. Posties talk a bit like rappers: I ask Charlie where he is from, and he replies: “W7, but we’re in W12 now.” At just 20, he is one of the youngest in the game and, by his\u0026nbspcalculation, won’t see a good (ie\u0026nbspeasy) route until he is 40. He is also the least concerned person I have ever met. Inside a terrifying death-trap lift on an estate, he mildly observes that it often breaks down. He steps into the road the way\u0026nbspAchilles stepped into battle. “If\u0026nbspI\u0026nbspwaited, nothing would get delivered,” he says over his shoulder as a Ford Focus supplicates before him. Is he concerned about dog bites? He smiles, which I take to mean he is not.“The ‘young and invincible’ mindset is one of our challenges,” acknowledges Davis. It is why the company has developed a new virtual reality experience, to teach its frontline employees Avoid strategies. It is short and interactive, to better engage staff, who will have been pulled off the sorting floor for the training. I have a go myself later, at Royal Mail’s head office, in a swivel chair with a VR headset on. It’s fun – you get to follow a new postal worker, Mel, on her round, looking for signs of dogs and advising her what to do. I stare at poos hidden in the virtual garden, urine-faded grass, hung up leads and cutesy warning notices, while the program registers that I have clocked them. Occasionally, I misdirect Mel: telling her to feed a begging terrier, or not to bother reporting a new dog on her walk log. Then I am called into the office and reprimanded by a virtual manager. Royal Mail’s dog-awareness campaign has been a success. It’s not anti-dog it simply advocates for responsible dog ownership, and the\u0026nbsppublic have responded. Simple tips – such as securing excitable dogs\u0026nbspin other rooms at delivery hour,\u0026nbspand fitting letterbox cages or external post boxes, have halved the\u0026nbsp5,000 annual dog attacks of just five years ago. Approaching the end of the round, which I have slowed down immeasurably, I figure the time is now. Swallowing nervously, I ask if I\u0026nbspcan put one in.“Put one … what in?” asks Charlie, breaking stride for the first time. I\u0026nbspexplain that one of my lifelong ambitions has been to become a postie and deliver the mail. Charlie shrugs and hands me a bundle.“That’s definitely against USO guidelines,” Perry shouts, but he’s too far behind, and too late. It’s happening. I shove in a Boden catalogue, a penalty charge notification and some final demands. It’s a little underwhelming, to be honest. Post has got less interesting since the internet. Still, it\u0026nbspis satisfying to tick off the bucket list now all I need is to try becoming a town crier, and go hang-gliding. And get a dog."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b857ab5eb59ffeeb12e1d4119798ce028dc4a12b/0_271_4153_2492/master/4153.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98fcb78be090c5434e7fa3c1bb43d9c1","title":"caxton currency card terms conditions eea","story":"I recently received an email from Caxton currency cards to tell me about the changes in their terms and conditions.

In the wake of these deaths, mental health in the music industry has become a white-hot issue, with a genre-ning collection of artists coming forth to discuss their own struggles with depression, anxiety, addiction and the pressures of fame.And while her job has long been to help artists achieve such fame, Kathryn Frazier has more recently become a resource for them to figure out how to deal with it.Frazier, the founder and owner of the PR agency Biz3 – which has offices in Chicago and Los Angeles – has raised the profiles of hundreds of clients including Lauryn Hill, Miguel, Daft Punk, Justin Bieber, Skrillex and Migos. After 26 years in the business, Frazier has now expanded her professional offerings by becoming a certified personal and executive coach, a title often simple referred to as “life coach”.Frazier works in both coaching and mentorshipadvising capacities, doing sessions via Skype with clients in other countries and those out on tour. While she once scoffed at the idea of life coaching, she now evangelizes its efficacy – which she emphasizes is very different from traditional therapy – and is in the process of getting certified in relationship and addiction coaching. Altogether, she’s establishing herself as a resource for musicians looking to transcend the struggling rock star stereotype.Do you think people, and especially musicians, are now more in need of the kind of services you provide, or are we now just more aware that people are struggling?It was just sort of like, “well, artists party”, or “artists are crazy” or” artists are just so in their heads”. People writing it off like it’s a stereotype. There’s probably some truth to that, but for me it was not wanting to keep helping these people get more famous – because that is what my job is, to make artists get well known and help people know who they are – then watching them struggle and be held down by it.I do think people have certainly always needed the help. You go back to Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix. The list is long with people that probably needed a lot of help and maybe they got it, but couldn’t accept it. We have for a long time been watching our rock stars kill themselves. Of course, there’s a story behind every one of those, and some maybe had enablers. Some probably had some people really trying to help. But I think as a whole, we expect rock stars to be tragic and difficult. I don’t think it has to be that way.Do you find that artists have a typical set of issues they’re bringing to sessions that sets them apart from other clients who aren’t in the music industry?A common thing is that there’s a frustration – or they’re perplexed – that they achieved a bunch of things they wanted, yet they still feel judgmental and still have a lot of negative self-talk. They still compare and despair. They still have the same problems they had when they were trying to make it, and now you add in they’re kind of resentful … there’s a lot of people feeling like they take care of everyone. I hear frustration that they feel like they’re not – they don’t use the term “yes men” – but they want to be heard more and challenged a bit.Across the board, whether it’s an artist or a manager or the CEO of a media company or a college kid, a very common thing that comes up is this negative self-talk. A rock star might report as much negative self-talk as, like, a struggling college kid. I do a lot of very discounted or trade coaching for people who I think need it, because I feel like karmically I need to help support people who don’t have the means to have a coach or have therapy, because that’s a luxury. So I get the beauty of seeing these really different lives and it’s just so funny to see the lady that I’m coaching in Santa Monica who wants to have a mega church has the same issues and struggles as a well-known rapper living in the Hollywood Hills.You’ve seen the rise of social media during your career. Obviously it affects us all to a certain extent, but artists deal with such massive exposure. What effect is it having on them?We think people in positions of power are somehow above everyone else and free from the self-torture and negative self-talk, but they’re not any different than we are. They just have a lot more critics. It’s painful, and it’s actually really sad to watch. I’ve definitely had coaching sessions around how artists can use Instagram to their advantage, but also protect themselves.Are you seeing the results of your coaching on a mass level, where an artist puts out a project and you can sense the changes they’ve made through the music?There are two artists in particular that I have a good either coaching or this kind of advisingmentoring relationship with. The more they’re growing, the more their music is consistent with their thoughts. There’s a natural shift that’s going to happen, because if they’re being authentic to themselves and their mind state is shifting, of course they’re going to grow and shift.That’s what’s beautiful about artists, especially artists who’ve been around a long time. We can go back through many artists’ records and like, “This is a record where they got destroyed and had their heart broken. This is the record where they were angry and where they were funny and took everybody down. This is the record where they got spiritual.” You can see people’s growth.I imagine this work brings artists to a deeper level of their artistry.I feel like if we’re deeper and at better places as humans, we’re going to be better at our work. I just don’t see how there’s any way around that. I feel like we gawk at artists too much. We watch them be classic, messed up, wounded, depressed, hurt artists, because that’s what they’re supposed to do and we’re so into their music because it helps us tap into our stuff and to feel. But we’ve also gotta throw the life preserver out there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ba428dd1cd8f584dbd6bfe19dde8643ffd6699f/470_561_9728_5839/master/9728.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bee981a503ddc46118902558e9f29a0e","title":"alan rusbridger who broke the news","story":"The former editor-in-chief of the  looks back on two decades that changed journalism for ever. By  Alan RusbridgerBy early 2017 the world had woken up to a problem that, with a mixture of impotence, incomprehension and dread, journalists had seen coming for some time. News, the thing that helped people understand their world, that oiled the wheels of society, that pollinated communities, that kept the\u0026nbsppowerful honest – news was broken.The problem had many different names and diagnoses. Some thought we were drowning in too much news others feared we were in danger of becoming newsless. Some believed we had too much free news others, that paid-for news was leaving behind it a\u0026nbsplong caravan of ignorance.On this most people could agree: we were now up to\u0026nbspour necks in a seething, ever churning ocean of information, some of it true, much of it wrong. There was\u0026nbsptoo much false news, not enough reliable news. There might soon be entire communities without news, or\u0026nbspwithout news they could trust.How did we get here? And how could we get back to where we once belonged?For 20 years I edited a newspaper in\u0026nbspthe throes of this\u0026nbsptumultuous revolution. The paper I took over in 1995 was composed of words printed on newsprint involving technologies that had changed little since Victorian times. It was, in many ways, a vertically arranged world. We – the organs of information – owned printing presses and, with them, the exclusive power to hand down the\u0026nbspnews we had gathered. The readers handed up the money – and so did advertisers, who had few other ways\u0026nbspof reaching our audience. But today advertisers can often reach consumers much more effectively through other channels. People are much more reluctant to part with money for news. And, however you measure it, there is widespread scepticism, confusion and mistrust about mainstream journalism.A few years after I became editor of the , I was invited to give an after-dinner speech at the Thirty Club – a private gathering of big commercial cheeses in the advertising and media worlds. It was March 2003 – three years before the launch of Twitter and\u0026nbspthe creation of the Facebook “news feed”, before the collapse of the economic model that had underpinned journalism for a century.As I stood up to speak, I was very conscious of the contingent from News International across the table. Les Hinton, the amiable if faintly menacing executive chairman of Rupert Murdoch’s newspaper group, was sitting right opposite me, flanked by Rebekah Brooks, editor of\u0026nbspthe Sun, and Andy Coulson, editor of the News of the World. I tried to avoid catching my colleagues’ eyes as I noted that the tabloids sold most, but were trusted least.I likened British journalists to fans of Millwall football club, who famously chant “No one likes us, we don’t care”. I knew what Coulson and Brooks were thinking: we’re in for a pious sermon from\u0026nbspsomeone who can barely make a profit and whose sales are embarrassingly small. I could hear the ritual jibe from Piers Morgan, then editor of the Mirror, every time he saw me: “I sell more copies in Cornwall than you\u0026nbspdo in the entire country.”I waffled on more about trust how we’d lost it how to\u0026nbspearn it back why it would matter so much more in the\u0026nbspdigital world. It was, even if true, worthy stuff. Afterwards, the three Murdoch colleagues were very friendly. They suggested we go on to a club we ended up drinking in Soho House till the early hours. The champagne’s on them. The speech is not mentioned. The evening is fun. Brooks and Coulson are good company. Hinton is full of seen-it-all bonhomie. Deep\u0026nbspdown, we’re all hacks together.Cut to 11 years later: Coulson was in jail, Hinton had resigned and Brooks had suffered the ordeal of a nerve-shredding trial at the Old Bailey – all because of reporting in the . That night in Soho House now feels like a lost world of Fleet Street innocence. A\u0026nbspfunny word – “innocence” – to use about Fleet Street. But we were certainly all innocent of what was to come – in virtually every way possible.In 1976, when I began my career as a journalist, the common route into the business was being thrown into\u0026nbspthe newsroom of a local paper to learn on the job. A week after finishing my finals, I swapped my university college – founded in 1428 – for the prosaic 1960s offices of the Cambridge Evening News, a mile to the east. There were not many graduates in the 20-strong reporting room of the CEN, a paper then selling just fewer than 50,000 copies a day. University types were – rightly – viewed with suspicion as arrogant interlopers who would trade the experience we gained in the provinces to secure a better-paid job in Fleet Street.The paper was owned by one Lord Iliffe of Yattendon, a largely absent figure who owned a 9,000-acre estate 100 miles away in Berkshire. More important to me was Fulton Gillespie, the chief reporter, known as Jock – a\u0026nbspgrowling, silver-haired Glaswegian with dark glasses and the stub of a cigar permanently lodged between bearded lips.Jock saw it as his duty to school us in hard knocks. We\u0026nbspwould begin the day with the calls – a round trip to\u0026nbspthe police, ambulance and fire services. As we set off\u0026nbspin the office Mini, he would deliver one of a small repertoire of homilies about our craft. “If you write for dukes, only\u0026nbspdukes will\u0026nbspunderstand, but if you write for the dustman, both will understand. Keep it short, keep it simple, write it in language you would use if you were telling your mum or dad.”He explained that police work involved keeping one foot on the pavement and one in the gutter. You got their respect by kicking them in the balls at regular intervals, because, in the long run, they needed us more than we needed them. That, he emphasised, was a good rule applicable to all those in authority. It had been hammered into him by the old hacks on the Falkirk Herald, and it would always be true. He repeated this often in case I had failed to grasp it: they needed us more than we needed them. We owned the printing presses they didn’t. End of.Around the same time, I learned a more personal lesson in the ways and obsessions of the press. While I\u0026nbspwas a young reporter on the CEN, I fell in love. The relationship lasted just under two years. I was a cub reporter, she was a university lecturer. Nobodies. The\u0026nbsprelationship caused some happiness, and some unhappiness to a few people – literally, no more than half\u0026nbspa dozen either way. End of story. Well, almost – her late father had, some years earlier, been on the telly. So\u0026nbspyou could, at a stretch, make a consumable tale out of\u0026nbspit: “Daughter of quite famous man has affair.”One Friday night, there was a knock on the door. A\u0026nbspreporter and photographer from the Sunday Mirror wanted to tell the “story of our love”, as he put it, to the 4\u0026nbspmillion readers who then bought the newspaper every week. The reporter, a man called Richard, was charming, but when we politely declined the opportunity to invite him in, Richard’s tone changed. “We can do this nice or we can do it nasty,” he said abruptly, and then explained what nice and nasty looked like. Nice was for us to sit down on the sofa and tell the world about our love, and be portrayed in a sympathetic way. Nasty meant they would start knocking on the doors of neighbours and contacting our relatives to put together a story that would be altogether less heartwarming.It was a good pitch. All the same, we felt this was, well, private. We were living together openly, and made\u0026nbspno attempt to hide our relationship from friends or family. But we had no wish to tell the whole world. So we said no.Richard and his photographer sat outside the house for another 24 hours. From time to time he would lean on the doorbell to test whether we had changed our minds. A week later, the pair reappeared to try again. Eventually we asked them in for a cup of tea, and I suggested I might ring Richard’s news editor to explain that we wouldn’t be talking. That seemed to do the trick. The story – nice or nasty – never saw the light of day.My life at that point had been learning to report councils, courts, freak weather and flower shows. That was what I understood journalism to be – a record of public events of varying degrees of significance. The ring\u0026nbspon the doorbell was my first, sharp realisation that journalism meant many different things to many different people. And there were many different business\u0026nbspmodels for “journalism”.I joined the  in 1979, on the same day as Nick Davies, who went on to become one of the most fearless and prolific investigative reporters of his generation. Our paths intersected for 35 years – his as a reporter, mine as an editor. When he came to see me in 2005 to propose that he would close his career by writing one last big series about power – specifically, the unchecked power of the press – I knew it would lead somewhere difficult. Nick was a heat-seeking missile. If\u0026nbsphe spent the next year digging, you could guarantee he would come up with something extraordinary. He always did.The germ of the idea had come from the Iraq war and the press’s role in aiding and abetting a conflict based on\u0026nbspwhat now we would call fake news. But the elders of Fleet Street did not appreciate the diligent attention of\u0026nbspinvestigative journalism when it was turned upon them. On the  we had long published a Monday media section – and, latterly, a media website. Over time, I was threatened by not quite every publisher or editor in\u0026nbspLondon, but a good many of them.Editor 1: “I’ll always retaliate. We should be sticking together, not writing about each other.”Editor 2: “My circulation is three times yours. You write about me, I’ll write about you. In the end you’ll stop.”Editor 3: “I hate writing about the media, but I make an\u0026nbspexception for the .”Publisher 2: “I’ll release the hounds of hell on you. You\u0026nbsphave to stop writing about us.”Some tried for bilateral deals: “You don’t write about us, we won’t write about you.” In general, they were as good as their word. If the  upset a rival editor or\u0026nbsppublisher, you could guarantee a form of retribution within days. It could be a snide diary paragraph or a threat to dig up dirt on  employees’ private lives\u0026nbsp– including mine. It\u0026nbspcould be a hatchet job about “troubles” at the paper. Sometimes these stories had a grain of truth, at other times they were simply invented. At first I was shocked that even broadsheet rivals would knowingly run untrue stories about us in “revenge”. After a while I understood that we were all supposed to see this as the great game.I had no idea what Nick would discover, but nor did it feel right that the Fleet Street elders should get their wish that their journalism should be a coverage-free zone. If journalism is a force of immense influence – and I think it is, and should be – then it surely deserves scrutiny.Investigative journalism of this sort is very slow, expensive, and sometimes yields very little direct return. No management consultant on earth would conclude that it represents a sensible investment of time or resources: a newsroom run strictly on metrics could never justify it. Big investigations (Watergate, for example) often work via the incremental disclosures of sometimes not very headline-grabbing material. The readership for each of the smaller numerous stories along the way would be barely measurable. The great editor Harold Evans used to say that an investigation only really began to count once the readers – and even the journalists – were bored with it.So how to justify obsessive reporting that has no apparent financial rationale, and may even be of little interest to the readers? The answer to this question is central to the idea of a newspaper. If journalism is, in some sense, a public service, then an editor has to understand the ethos of public service – something that is of value to a society without necessarily making a direct financial return. This means thinking of this kind of journalism in the same way you might think of a police, ambulance or fire service. You would, as a citizen, expect such services to be run efficiently, but you would not expect them to have to justify themselves on grounds of profit.There is actually a financial benefit to investigations, but it is a long-term one. Readers, on some level, want their newspapers to be brave, serious, campaigning and\u0026nbspdogged. They like corruption to be exposed, overweening power to be challenged, and serious scandals to be unearthed. It reminds them what journalism is for. They admire it. They are even willing to pay for it.A newspaper that consistently breaks investigative stories will (with apologies to those who hate the word) build a brand. The Harold Evans Sunday Times was certainly a “brand”. To this day, it is regarded as one of\u0026nbspthe high-water marks of challenging 20th-century journalism. Brands have value. A paper that stands for nothing will soon lose its sheen, and then its point, and then its readers. But that’s not always an immediately winning argument if the financials are looking tense and\u0026nbspyou have impatient investors.Davies’s quest to explore the power of the press had resulted in a fiercely forensic book, Flat Earth News, which chronicled how many newsrooms, obsessed with traffic and with ever-declining budgets, had started practising what he termed “churnalism”. The word stuck, because so many editorial staff labouring under the pressures of shrinking resources and ever-faster output recognised the truth of it. But Nick’s inquiries, it turned out, were only just beginning. He came to see me in March 2009 to tell me about a shocking new story. We would later refer to this as the “heart-attack conversation”.A News of the World reporter, Clive Goodman, had been jailed in 2007, along with the private eye who had helped him, for intercepting the voicemail of three people who worked at Buckingham Palace. The editor, Andy Coulson, had resigned – but he was now the communications director for the Conservative party, and would soon be on his way to Downing Street when David Cameron became prime minister in 2010. The official line from News International was that Goodman had been a\u0026nbsprotten apple:\u0026nbsphis phone-hacking was a one-off.Davies told me this story was not true. He had been\u0026nbspcontacted by a source who told him the idea that Goodman was the only person to hack phones was a joke. Loads of reporters were at it: it was how the News of\u0026nbspthe World had won so many awards. Hacking phones was the system, not an aberration.The police knew this at the time, but had done nothing about it. But now one of the other victims of hacking – Gordon Taylor, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers’ Association – was suing, and was trying to find out who had known what, and when they knew it.How many victims were we talking about? Nick had met a senior figure at Scotland Yard. The answer: thousands. So, not just one rotten apple then.The News of the World, rattled by this new legal action, had offered to pay Taylor an enormous sum – £400,000 plus £300,000 costs – to drop the action. Together with the payments to Taylor’s colleagues, News\u0026nbspInternational was offering to pay no less than £1m\u0026nbspto make the actions go away.Nick had been told that hacking victims included the deputy prime minister, John Prescott. Dozens of News of\u0026nbspthe World reporters and executives were implicated. Nick had access to emails showing that transcripts of 35\u0026nbspvoice messages had been discussed by named reporters and editors. The “rogue reporter” defence was\u0026nbspshot to pieces. According to Nick’s sources, the deal had been approved by James Murdoch, son of Rupert and chair of News International. The silence money had been paid, and the court documents sealed. If Nick was right, Murdoch’s most senior UK executive had agreed to a million-pound cover-up of criminal behaviour in his own company.This was an incendiary story. The Murdoch operation, taken as a whole, was ruthless. If we merely wounded the company, it would close in for the kill. We already knew that the police, for reasons best known to themselves, would not want to get involved. We\u0026nbspwould not have many friends in politics or the rest of\u0026nbspthe press. We would be on our own.Our story ran mid-afternoon on Wednesday 8 July 2009. It detailed the conspiracy to cover up criminal behaviour. It implicated the Conservative leader’s spokesman. It accused Murdoch’s executives of misleading parliament. It pointed a finger of blame at the press regulator, and it asked why the police had turned a blind eye. Fleet Street showed only mild interest in the story. News International had released an official three-page statement rubbishing our work and exonerating themselves. The company’s PR operation had been working overtime in Westminster. All the allegations were, they said, false. Rebekah Brooks wrote to the chairman of the select committee saying we had deliberately misled the British public. The Times took a\u0026nbsppiece from another former Scotland Yard officer (now employed by Murdoch) pouring cold water on the  story. It\u0026nbspwas reprinted in the sister paper, the News of the World, under a full-page editorial attacking us.It was a lesson in how the Murdoch organisation fought back. A senior executive on the Sun later promised to use the pages of the Sunday Times to show that I\u0026nbspwas the “biggest fucking hypocrite in the world”. It\u0026nbspwas as if the family of titles were interchangeable in being used to target anyone with the temerity to take on\u0026nbspthe organisation. The entire Murdoch UK newspaper organisation appeared to have been mobilised to call the\u0026nbsptruth fake and to promote fake news as the truth.Over the next two years, our reporting was gradually and painfully vindicated. On 15 July 2011, Brooks resigned from News International. Two days after that, she was arrested. She was eventually acquitted, but Murdoch’s appearance before MPs – “the most humble day of my life” – showed an organisation in moral and organisational turmoil.Those two years it had taken to fight off the Murdoch press’s fury and prove that Nick had been right were lonely ones. You live in a democracy, you assume that there are numerous checks and balances to prevent powerful people from doing crooked things. For the first time in my adult life, I doubted this was true in Britain.We had presented strong evidence of a criminal conspiracy at one of the most powerful media companies in the world – and no one wanted to know. Not the police. Not the regulator. Not – initially, at least – parliament. And not the British press.The British gatekeepers eventually found themselves on trial – or, at least, subjected to the unforgiving glare of a judicial inquiry – with the Leveson inquiry into the\u0026nbspculture, practice and ethics of the British press, the\u0026nbspgovernment’s response to Nick Davies’s reporting, which opened on 14 November 2011.The two-part inquiry had been set up by the prime minister, David Cameron, in the wake of the phone-hacking revelations. Until this point, the British press financed its own self-regulatory body, the Press Complaints Commission. The British press had defended this organisation as tough and rigorous – right up to July\u0026nbsp2011, when the elders had admitted it was pretty toothless after all, and should be replaced by something tougher and more rigorous.But there was a case to answer. Unchecked criminality within newsrooms was a moral catastrophe for British journalism and its role in our democracy. It was our Enron, our Volkswagen, our Deepwater, our\u0026nbspsubprime crisis. It was depressing to watch some colleagues retreat into the bunker and use their own bully-pages to close down debate by savaging anyone who offered even constructive help in rebuilding trust in\u0026nbspthe press. I loathed the threats and abuse directed at\u0026nbspanyone who dared to disagree.The initial response to Leveson was, in fact, measured. There seemed, if anything, a sense of relief that we had escaped relatively lightly. But some of the aftermath was badly handled all round, and it did not take long for Fleet Street to circle the wagons – bitterly rejecting even the best-intentioned attempts to craft the most credible form of independent regulation.The dripping contempt for “the liberal elite” or their supposed notion of “public interest” was the bitter stuff of deeper culture wars. But Leveson and its fallout clarified how much confusion – or, more accurately, straight disagreement – now existed about the nature and purpose of what we did.It was becoming more and more evident that there was no neat agreement on what journalism in the public interest looked like. The Daily Mail employed many outstanding reporters, but the relentless, bruising, sometimes brutalising editorial ethos of that paper had little in common with the BBC or the Financial Times, any\u0026nbspmore than Fox News had much in common with the\u0026nbspNew York Times or Washington Post.Even among the so-called legacy media organisations, there was a yawning ergence in attitudes to what journalism should or could be. Scarcely a week passed without a withering attack from the Mail on the BBC’s editorial ethos or standards. Periodically, the Mail editor would castigate the , Channel 4 or the FT – either personally, anonymously or through willing surrogates.There was never a flicker of irony or humility in the eyes of the most complained-about newspaper (1,214 PCC complaints in 2013) bellowing contempt at the\u0026nbspmost trusted news organisations in the country (the\u0026nbspFT had just seven PCC complaints in 2013).The elders’ fury at Leveson was dressed up in invocations of Cobbett or Swift. But there seemed little that Leveson himself was then proposing – as opposed to the botched subsequent wrangling – that would inhibit robust commentary or investigation into matters of genuine public significance. What, then, did they fear? The real fury – also apparent in denunciations of the European court’s jurisdiction concerning privacy – was reserved for judges who stood in the way of the\u0026nbsplucrative pursuit of sex scandals.The tabloids have a business model that, in part, involves intrusion into the privacy of people in the public\u0026nbspeye. In comparison to some other business models, it’s not a bad one. The public’s appetite for scandal subsidises the coverage of politics. Take away the sleaze and the sex and you can kiss goodbye to reportage of\u0026nbspWestminster – that’s how they argue it.But it was hard not to wonder at all the puffed-up outrage. Was the Sun editorial team itself more free of “filthy laundry” or “sleazy antics” than any other newsroom? Journalists – and even some proprietors – were not known for leading saintly lives, any more than footballers.Did it matter? The Sun and Mail can surely have their economic imperative and ethics the New York Times and FT can have theirs. Fox News and the BBC: it’s all “journalism”. We can rub along in peaceful coexistence. That’s how it used to work, in a kinder age before newspapers began using the techniques of the secret police to spy on their targets.But now journalism is facing an existential economic threat in the form of a tumultuous recalibration of our place in the world. And on both sides of an increasingly scratchy debate about media, politics and democracy, there is a hesitancy about whether there is still a common idea of what journalism is, and why it matters.On 3 December 2013, I was led into a parliamentary committee room in Westminster to justify journalism. It was not a trial, but it felt like one. Waiting in the very next room were two of the most senior police officers in the country, who were investigating whether I should be prosecuted. Some Conservative members of the committee were determined to force admissions out of me and would, I felt sure, quite like to see me in jail.The Home Affairs committee was notionally looking into counter-terrorism. But today they wanted to know about Edward Snowden, the former US National Security Agency (NSA) operative who had given the  and others a very large number of top-secret NSA and GCHQ documents revealing the extent of state surveillance activities. Such a leak had never happened before.The head of MI6, the urbane former diplomat Sir John Sawers, had told MPs that Britain’s adversaries were “rubbing their hands with glee. Al-Qaeda is lapping it up.” He had smoothly delivered the next day’s headlines.The British press, in contrast to the overwhelming majority of journalists in virtually every other country, had not exactly bent over backwards to support the  in publishing the Snowden revelations. Some had been openly hostile. A former broadsheet editor had written that newspapers had no right to determine the public interest when it came to security. An Economist writer had suggested that he would have marched Snowden to the police if he had brought him\u0026nbspthe story. Once again, the British press could not\u0026nbspagree what the public interest looked like.The MPs arranged in front of me in a horseshoe did not, on the whole, look friendly. I was on my own. The committee chair, the maverick Labour MP Keith Vaz, opened the questions. He came from a Goan family and had settled in England at the age of six after a period in Aden. We had not been going for long when he lobbed what felt like a fizzing grenade in my direction. “You and I were both born outside this country,” he said. “But\u0026nbspI love this country. Do you love this country?”For a split second I was speechless. I recovered to say that my patriotism was rooted in the idea of a Britain that allowed a free press that could report on such matters. There were countries where the security services told editors what they could or couldn’t write. They weren’t democracies. I was proud to live in a\u0026nbspcountry that didn’t behave like that.If journalists cannot agree on a common idea of the public interest – of the public service we claim to be providing – then it complicates the defence of what we do. And in an age of horizontal free mass media, it is even more important for us to be able to define and declare our values, our purpose – and our independence. Which\u0026nbspincludes independence from the state.But five years after the Snowden revelations, it is now apparent that states themselves are struggling with the digital disruption that first tore through the established media and has now reshaped politics. The digital giants have not only unleashed information chaos – they have, in the blink of an eye, become arguably the most powerful organisations the world has ever seen.‘Public” is, to some in the 21st century, a difficult word. We value public services, public spaces and public goods – but we sometimes struggle to know how to discuss them, create them, run them, fund them, regulate them, support them or measure them. We speak of public benefits and “the public interest” without ever satisfactorily defining them. In the UK, we treasure a public health service – but not to the point of financing it sufficiently. We trust a public service broadcaster above all private news providers – but regularly revile it.The ultimate defence of journalism is that it remains a public good. But how do we measure, or value, such a public good at a time when, in the words of the political philosopher Michael Sandel, “markets – and market values – have come to govern our lives as never before … Markets leave their mark. Sometimes, market values crowd out non-market values worth caring about.”A decade ago, talking this way about news would have been dismissed as the bleating of liberals – the despised “subsidariat” who weren’t commercial enough to produce decent journalism that the public wanted to read. (As James Murdoch infamously claimed in 2009, “The only reliable durable and perpetual guarantor of independence is\u0026nbspprofit.”) But now, faced with the overwhelming scale, popularity and sheer turbo-charged commercial power of the Silicon Valley titans, there is now an outcry across the media against the havoc that free markets have inflicted on the traditional press.After two decades of disruption, it may be possible that none of the old conventional business models can still support serious news in the public interest. But the challenge has never been so urgent: we need the\u0026nbspessential work of journalism – the calling that should, at its highest, separate lies from the truth.This is an edited extract from Breaking News: The Remaking of Journalism and Why It Matters Now, published by Canongate on 6 September, and available at bookshop Alan Rusbridger will be in conversation with Beeban Kidron at the Barbican in London on 5 September.

Obviously, when there do appear to be signs of a change then that is encouraging, but I don’t think you can read too much into these,” he said.Austria’s foreign minister, Karin Kneissl, also dismissed the suggestion that the EU was ready to rethink its current position, which rules out key tenets of the Chequers proposals, including frictionless trade for goods across the Channel.The Polish foreign minister, Jacek Czaputowicz, offered the British foreign secretary some hope, however, telling reporters that he would try to persuade his fellow ministers to shift their position, following an intense period of lobbying by British ministers in EU capitals in favour of the white paper on the future trading relationship.Asked whether a more generous deal could be offered by the EU, Czaputowicz, whose party has been in a long-running row with the European commission over the country’s judicial changes and is facing unprecedented disciplinary action, told reporters: “I think that we have to discuss that issue. We are very pleased, Poland, that the white paper was presented. It is a good base for discussion.The struggle to get other member states onboard was nevertheless made clear by comments from other EU ministers in Vienna and Berlin, where Barnier was in talks with the German government.Annika Söder, the Swedish foreign secretary, suggested her central hope was that opinion on Brexit was changing in the UK in favour of a second referendum.“You know that we wanted to keep you and we look at the polls and we see that there may be some hesitation,” she said.“We hope that we can find a way forward to have a soft Brexit, because a hard Brexit wouldn’t serve anyone, but still – and this may be not very polite – we hope that there can be a solution where the UK will still be in the European Union.“Negotiations are important and Barnier and his team are working hard to find a good solution, so we will not give up on a soft Brexit, even if that tiny hope is still there.”The German economic affairs minister, Peter Altmaier, issued a statement following his meeting with Barnier reiterating Germany’s support for the EU negotiator and the guidelines offering the UK a free-trade deal, which Downing Street has already dismissed as lacking the necessary ambition to maintain economic prosperity on both sides of the Channel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1274d89cbf4d6efe13ed0b666c5dcf1bcb7e7f3a/0_197_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4b9aeac1fd5e573de11258c256232bd","title":"snp politicians praise sturgeons dignity in salmond case","story":"Party’s Westminster leader downplays rift over handling of sexual harassment claimsSenior Scottish National party politicians have defended Nicola Sturgeon’s handling of the harassment allegations against Alex Salmond and downplayed a bitter rift inside the party.Ian Blackford, the SNP’s Westminster leader, offered Sturgeon his unequivocal support as it emerged that some of his MPs had made donations to a legal fund set up by Salmond after he quit the party on Wednesday.“In trying and difficult circumstances I think the first minister has shown tremendous dignity and first class leadership,” Blackford said.Nearly 3,500 people had donated about £85,000 to Salmond by Thursday afternoon after he appealed for support to mount his legal challenge against the Scottish government’s handling of allegations of sexual harassment against him.Sturgeon again strongly defended the decision to investigate the claims against Salmond. She told the BBC it was important to uphold the SNP’s traditions of campaigning “for fairness, for equality and for the notion we shouldn’t have one rule for the powerful and another rule for everybody else”.Salmond’s resignation from the party which he had led to successive Scottish election victories and an independence referendum risked sparking a battle within the party.Sturgeon is scheduled to address a joint meeting of her MPs and MSPs in Edinburgh on Friday at their annual away day to discuss policy and strategy. Holyrood resumes after the summer recess next week, when Sturgeon is due to publish her programme for government, which now risks being overshadowed by the Salmond controversy.Some activists, backed by a handful of SNP parliamentarians, have berated Sturgeon on social media and circulated conspiracy theories about the investigation. Several SNP parliamentarians have donated to Salmond’s fund.The former SNP leader faces a police investigation into the complaints by two female civil servants. One official is said to have alleged he touched her bottom and breasts at his official residence in Edinburgh while he was first minister.Salmond has repeatedly denied any misconduct. “Let me be clear again,” he said. “I refute these two complaints of harassment and I absolutely reject any suggestion of criminality.”Blackford told reporters in Edinburgh on Thursday he was deeply saddened by the controversy and the allegations, but said Sturgeon’s conduct in defending the complaints process had been faultless.He said the interests of victims of sexual harassment had to be paramount, regardless of the seniority of the accused, and downplayed the scale of the internal revolt against Sturgeon.“I’m not getting messages from people suggesting there is civil war inside the SNP. Far from it,” he said. “There is strong support for the first minister, for the government, from parliamentarians and from party members.“Of course, you are always going to get the noise from social media … but I would simply say you need to keep things in context.”Earlier on Thursday, Mike Russell, the Scottish Brexit minister and a former party chief executive under Salmond, said he also stood “four square” behind Sturgeon.Dave Penman, the general secretary of the First Division Association, which represents the UK’s senior civil servants, accused Salmond of “nasty, vindictive and deliberate” attacks on the integrity of Leslie Evans, the Scottish government’s permanent secretary.Salmond has repeatedly accused Evans of using an unlawful and unfair process to investigate the allegations and has launched a judicial review in Scotland’s civil courts.Other SNP parliamentarians have told the  they support Sturgeon, and said the party needed to focus on its policies, Brexit, the party’s annual conference in Glasgow in October and her planned statement on plans for a new independence referendum.There are concerns that Salmond has far greater freedom to speak publicly about his legal battle than Sturgeon, who is constrained by the demands of the legal process.The controversy erupted late last week after Evans told Salmond she was planning to publish a statement disclosing the fact that he had been under investigation. Salmond’s lawyers threatened the Scottish government with an interdict. Salmond insists he was promised confidentiality by Evans and was denied the chance to call his own witnesses.He dropped that threat after Evans withdrew the planned statement, but details of the inquiry were leaked to the Daily Record. Salmond has offered no evidence that the original leak came from within the Scottish government. Some sources suggest one of the complainants has left the civil service."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a8d6027b1a3ee1335c8febac8751c4722a5ec40/0_45_1731_1039/master/1731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6ccf1943b5b7344bb826edcfdd3579f","title":"feline hungry an expert guide to feeding cats","story":"Your cat may act like it can look after itself but, like a teenager, it’s definitely underselling how much it needs you – especially when it comes to nutrition. Here’s how to get it rightCats are masters of being able to wind their owners around their little claws, and as a result they make us believe they are desperately in need of feeding when in fact, they’re not. Despite what we think, cats have no social aspect to eating. In other words, they don’t love us for it.Portion sizes should be followed according to the type of food you are feeding (most feeds have a guide for portion sizes on the pack, or offer a nutritional advice helpline) and according to the breed, build, age and activity level of your cat. A rough guide would be an urban outdoor cat that weighs about 4kg would need about 300kcal a day. If your cat is an indoor-only animal of about the same weight, this would reduce to 200kcal a day.The type of cat you have will affect what they need to eat to stay fit and healthy. Long-haired cats benefit from a different food to their shorter haired cousins, while bigger breeds such as Maine coons have a larger skeleton, so benefit from more joint support than others.The shape of the cat’s jaw can determine how and if they eat a kibble, which is why different breeds benefit from a specific shape. Cat jaws are designed to move up and down, not side to side, so they can tear at food rather than chew – and you’ll find cats eat in one of three different ways:Cats are very fussy about how food feels in their mouth and texture is very important to cats – more so, in fact, than taste, as they have relatively few taste buds compared with humans. They also need fresh drinking water at all times.SiameseThese animals are long, lean and athletic, and benefit from a diet to support muscle tone – one that has more protein and less fat. Their jaw is a specific triangular shape, so they need a kibble that works with their natural eating action, encouraging them to crunch their food.Bengal An athletic breed that benefits from a higher level of protein but also fat to fuel their activity. A diet that will help maintain its very distinctive coat is also desirable containing specific amino acids, vitamins and omega fats aimed specifically at skin and coat health.Maine coon Maine coon owners should have an awareness of the heart health issues associated with this large, heavy breed. Make sure its diet has the right energy density so that you’re not encouraging weight gain.Norwegian forest catLike other cats with longer coats, the Norwegian forest cat often needs a food that contains specific fibres such as psyllium, which help to naturally move hair swallowed during grooming through the digestive tract – as without the right care and nutrition, hairballs can be an issue.SphynxThese hairless cats are covered with a light down, but they can struggle to maintain their body temperature and so benefit from a food with a higher fat content to provide extra energy for their active metabolism. Keeping their skin healthy is also a priority. RagdollAnother long-haired cat with a broad jaw, these benefit from a pyramid-shaped kibble that is easy to grasp and encourage crunching. As with other heavier cats, they benefit from food with additional health nutrients, such as glucosamine and chondroitin to support joint health.Whatever the breed, Royal Canin offer a wide variety of wet and dry foods tailored to your cat’s inidual nutrition needs.

There’s no purrrfect answer, but the Celia Hammond Sanctuary manages to care for almost 300 if that’s a guide. Here’s how, plus an FAQ for every multi-cat householdThere is a place deep in the Sussex countryside where the four-legged residents reign supreme. They’re dozing in flowerpots, stretching in shady spots and exploring local woodlands at first glance, it seems like 100 acres of feline paradise. But the path to the Celia Hammond Rehoming Centre and Sanctuary has not been easy for the 120 cats who now roam free across the grounds, rescued as they were from often appalling conditions.“It all started during my modelling career, when a group of houses near us were threatened with demolition,” explains founder Celia Hammond, who graced the covers of Vogue during the 1960s. “There were cats inside, so obviously we had to do something. Some friends and I got some equipment together and saved them. Then people started calling me about other rescues, first every week and then every day, until it really started overtaking my work.”Celia first had the idea for a cat-friendly country house when she needed to move – accompanied by the rescue animals she had accumulated. It took her two years to find it: “We needed somewhere that was totally on its own. And then I found this place.”As the number of cats grew, Celia started looking for somewhere they could truly make themselves at home. Aptly known as Greenacres, the site took two years to find and includes stables, ancient and replanted woodland, a range of local wildlife including foxes and badgers, and (perhaps surprisingly) a wide variety of birds. At its heart is the 40-pen cattery, which currently holds around 150 cats waiting to become someone’s pet, and the main house, which live-in staff share with as many of the feral and semi-feral residents as want to join them – this central section is enclosed by a fence, designed to let cats through but keep other animals out.“The bulk of our work goes on in the rehoming centre,” explains Carolyn McBeath, the assistant manager at Greenacres. “That’s always our goal. It’s only when cats have multiple or chronic conditions and we haven’t been able to find the right place for them that they might get released into the sanctuary.” This is done slowly, first by housing a bonded group of cats in their own special “chalet” then setting them free once they’ve acclimatised.So what’s the secret to keeping the peace among this furry legion? “Primarily it’s only having cats here who are used to other cats, and using our intuition and expertise to know which ones will suit this environment,” says McBeath. “But another key consideration is space, so if they want to go off on their own and not see anyone they can. I think we all have days like that.” Neutering reduces their impulse to fight, and having adequate resources such as feeding stations, scratching posts and resting places ensures there’s nothing to fight over.There are those who believe cats are naturally solitary animals but, from its years of rescuing and rehoming family groups, the Celia Hammond Animal Trust has developed its own point of view. “All we can say is that our experience is very different,” says McBeath. “And while you can never generalise, we do find that most cats would like the opportunity of a mum or sibling playmate.”One such group is a young family brought in by their owner, who was facing eviction and unable to keep them. “The little ginger baby is just besotted with his dad and his dad is besotted with the mum, and they’re just so gregarious and happy and normal. We couldn’t split them up: we’re looking for a very special home that is able to love all three.”Clinical animal behaviourist Helen Greenley and Royal Canin scientific communications manager Vikki Anderson share their advice for a harmonious feline household.Are cats naturally sociable?“Research has found that cats will choose solitary or group living depending on availability of resources in their environment,” says Greenley. “In this way, the cat has become an amazingly adaptable and successful species – a sort of Bear Grylls among domestic animals.”How can I tell if my cats have bonded?“The group scent is the glue that bonds cats together and helps them feel relaxed in each other’s presence. This is transferred by touch against one another, so you may see them grooming or sleeping next to each other,” says Greenley. “Other affiliative behaviours include a chirruped greeting, bunting (bumping faces) and twining their tails together.”And how can I tell if they haven’t?“Non-bonded cats can live together in apparent harmony, but if you look closely, they do not display any of the scent-sharing behaviours. They have learned to tolerate each other – not ideal and can be a potential source of chronic, low level stress,” says Greenley.What’s the best way to manage feeding time?“It’s important to realise that in most group situations cats are not comfortable having to share water stations, food and litter trays, so it’s essential to have enough for each cat,” says Anderson. “It might be tempting to have their bowls in a neat row in the kitchen, but they should be an absolute minimum of one metre between them. Different rooms are even better.”What if one of my cats is eating all the food?“It can help to understand natural cat feeding patterns,” says Anderson. “They are natural grazers, eating lots of small meals throughout the day, but having multiple cats in the household can lead them to eat as much as possible in a sitting, leading to weight gain. To remedy this, activity feeders are great for encouraging cats’ natural grazing habits while meeting their need to play and hunt, making sure cats’ feeding stations are in low-traffic, possibly raised areas allows them to relax and eat their own food undisturbed.”Whether you’re the proud owner of a single pet or a burgeoning cattery, Royal Canin offers tailor-made breed-, age- and lifestyle-specific cat food, in wet and dry form, for optimum feline health.

Here’s what your cat’s age really means – and how to handle the changes that come with itOnce kittens pass the newborn phase, where they should be with their mothers, and begin to grow and engage with the outside world, they will discover play. Kitten play mimics moves that would be used for hunting such as stalking, ambushing and pawing. Help your kitten hone these skills, which also keep them active, by making time to play with them using age- and size-appropriate toys.TrainingToilet training should start using a size-appropriate litter tray as soon as your kitten comes home. Gentle grooming and recall training can start now too, use treats to encourage them to respond to their name when called, or use a clicker just before you feed them so they associate that with reward.FeedingWeaned kittens do not need any kind of cat or kitten milk, but they do need a good quality protein-rich food. “Kittens have immature digestive systems and so need an easily digestible food, and once they have stopped feeding from their mother they need to build up their own immunity, so food must have the right nutrients, such as an antioxidant complex, to help bridge the gap while they are developing their own systems,” explains Hannah Poile, scientific communications manager at Royal Canin.Kittens go from sucking, to licking to crunching a kibble, so food that is hydratable is desirable. “A growth formula with calcium and phosphorous in the right levels to promote skeletal growth is also best for them at this stage,” says Poile.Between three and six months your kitten is headed towards sexual maturity, so it’s best to have your kitty neutered (and microchipped). Liaise with your vet around exact timings. After neutering it’s best to change to a specific neutered kitten diet, this will ensure they’re still getting all the nutrients they need for healthy growth, but will take into account the specific needs following this procedure.Your kitten should be fully grown by 12 months, unless it is a larger breed such as a Maine coon, which may not reach its adult size until around 15 months. During this phase – you could refer to it as the equivalent of teenage years in humans – your cat will become more demanding of both their owner and the world they live in. Keep them entertained by making sure there is plenty to stimulate them mentally and physically.Continue with grooming and introduce ear and teeth checks, perhaps follow this up with attention and affection rather than treats to prevent any issues with weight.FeedingAn appropriate older kitten food that will give the right level of nutrition for this second growth phase is best, along with food that specifically promotes balance in their intestinal flora is also recommended.This is prime time for your cat: they should be physically fit and well, with a glossy coat, bright eyes and plenty of get up and go. They will be hunting regularly (if they have access to outside spaces) or play hunting if an indoor cat.At this stage, your cat will respond well to games, so keep their toys varied and available, especially for indoor cats keep their weight monitored, teeth clean and stay up to date with worming, flea treatments and annual boosters.FeedingAged 12 months it’s time to transition your cat from kitten to adult food. “Make sure you are feeding it an activity-appropriate diet. Are they an indoor or an outdoor cat?” says Poile. “Indoor cats are generally less active and, if not fed a diet with the right level of calories, can easily gain weight.”“Naturally, cats eat little and often – they are grazers and will have up to 15 sittings a day. If you are supporting the species as it would eat naturally you would have food down for them so they can go back to it when they want it, activity feeders are great for encouraging natural feeding habits.”By the age of seven your cat will start to experience the early and often invisible changes that come with ageing. They may be more prone to weight gain, dental problems and joint issues. Help by making sure they keep active through play and monitor any changes in their coat, behaviour or feeding pattern. Encourage activity with a variety of mixed toys. Make sure they have to work a bit to get their food – they enjoy seeking it out.FeedingHelp to support your cat as they start to face the first signs of ageing with a diet adapted to this life stage containing targeted nutrients, such as vitamins and green tea polyphenols, to help maintain their vitality. Don’t forget to keep checking your cat’s body condition score and adapt their feeding amounts to keep them at a healthy bodyweight.At this age, your cat is likely to start to experience age-related health issues such as joint pain, a reduction in kidney function, weight loss and a decline in activity. They can also become fussy about food and may be less able to adapt to changes in their environment, so it’s best not to introduce any major changes to their routine or domestic life. Your cat may begin to show signs of cognitive dysfunction towards the older end of this life stage, monitor their behaviour for signs of confusion, which should be discussed with your vet.Feeding“A senior diet is very important for this age group,” says Poile. “Just as with kittens, older cats need food that supports their changing appetites, many older cats become fussier about their diet and may appreciate an adapted kibble or wet food. Kidney health is also a concern as cats age and it is important for regular checkups at the vet, as well as to feed a diet with an adapted level of phosphorous.”The elderly cat can struggle with regulating body temperature and have fairly extensive dental issues – oral disease or tooth loss can make eating difficult. So, it’s important to provide a palatable and digestible diet.Your cat may lose weight for no obvious reason, monitor their condition, coat and overall behaviour. Any concerns should be raised with your vet. They may struggle to groom regularly as they become less flexible, so maintain regular grooming sessions with them.Your cat is likely to sleep more and can be prone to senile changes. They can seem to be lost, unable to find their food or water or usual sleeping place, so be there to care for them.FeedingAs cats age, their bodies are less able to process and get nutrients from their food, so weight loss can occur. Be sure to feed them an age-appropriate food that has a high palatability and increased calorie content. Older cats can have issues with their sense of smell so a food with a rich aroma can help.All kittens should be fed according to the size they will become as an adult cat.

Scientists believe the small rip in its shell could have been caused by a fragment of a meteorite colliding with the capsule.When the two-millimetre slash was detected, European Space Agency astronaut Alexander Gerst reportedly put his finger over the hole to try to plug the leak.“In effect he literally touched space without a space suit,” the YouTube channel Techniques Spatiale tweeted.As a quick fix the two Russian astronauts on board the ISS patched up the split from inside the craft using sealant and a cloth stuck over the area, after initially covering it with heat-resistant tape while controllers on the ground worked on a longer-term solution.The module can be detached from the main body of the ISS if the fault cannot be fully repaired. But it is not clear what will be done with the spacecraft if it is damaged.Dmitry Rogozin, head of the Russian state space agency Roscosmos, said: “Overnight and in the morning there was an abnormal situation – a pressure drop, an oxygen leak at the station.”He added: “A micro-fracture was found, most likely it is damage from the outside. The design engineers believe it is the result of a micrometeorite.”Nasa confirmed the tear had led to a “minute pressure leak” and that the crew were containing the issue.In a statement, they said: “Throughout the day the crew was never in any danger, and was told no further action was contemplated for the remainder of the day. Flight controllers will monitor the pressure trends overnight.“All station systems are stable and the crew is planning to return to its regular schedule of work on Friday.”Six people are currently orbiting Earth aboard the ISS – Nasa astronauts Drew Feustel, Ricky Arnold and Serena Auñón-Chancellor, as well as Gerst, who is German, and two Russian cosmonauts – Oleg Artemyev and Sergei Prokopyev."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/accddba6a9f9cde7f23ac772777db277b8850dc0/0_332_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff33a6d1404b3daa5efb065588b48faa","title":"colin kaepernick grievance nfl trial","story":"Colin Kaepernick’s grievance against the NFL is set to go to trial after an arbitrator turned down what was effectively a request by the league for the case to be dismissed.Kaepernick filed the grievance in October last year, claiming owners have colluded to keep him out of the league after he knelt during the national anthem to highlight racial injustice in the United States.

After reviewing the footage after the match, Herbert released a statement condemning both the umpire’s actions and the United States Tennis Association.The 4-6, 7-6 (6), 6-3, 6-0 win earned him a third-round match against Roger Federer on Saturday night, and the New York fans will no doubt give the self-proclaimed pantomime villain of the game the benefit of their wisdom in the cauldron of Arthur Ashe Stadium, when the temperature will have cooled but not the atmosphere.Lahyani, one of the most experienced and respected officials in the game, is still under review by the USTA, but the tournament referee, Brian Earley, appeared to publicly exonerate him.Federer, the sainted hero of millions, will have the overwhelming support of the crowd in what should be a charged environment on the show court on Saturday night. He beat Benoît Paire 7-5, 6-4, 6-4 to cruise through the second round in just under two hours, and said later: “It’s not the umpire’s role to go down from the chair. I get what he was trying to do. But you don’t go and speak like that. He was there for too long. It’s a conversation. Conversations can change your mindset.”Kyrgios – who cemented a friendship with Federer at the Laver Cup this year after early frostiness – went into head-shaking, eye-rolling denial, downplaying the incident as trivial, and laughing at media questions about the propriety of an official seeming to show favouritism.“He said he liked me,” the player said, smiling. “I’m not sure if that was encouragement. He just said that it’s not a good look. I wasn’t feeling good. I know what I was doing out there wasn’t good. I wasn’t really listening to him, but I knew it wasn’t a good look.”He then turned on a persistent inquisitor who asked if it might have been perceived as “coaching”.“It’s ridiculous. He wasn’t coaching me at all. I don’t have a coach. I haven’t had a coach for, like, years. Of course he wasn’t coaching me. I got some salt from the physio because it was hot and I wasn’t feeling great.”Kyrgios took the salt tablets at the next changeover, trailing 1-4, before coming from 2-5 to win the set in the tie-break. From that point on, he dominated Herbert, and took the fourth and final set 6-0.Herbert, a doubles specialist with excellent skills, had no answer to the rejuvenated Kyrgios and later released a statement in which he said he was “angry against the umpire” and upset with Earley’s statement on behalf of the USTA.Petra Kvitova dredged up her old fighting spirit to reach the third round after beating world No 90 Yafan Wang 7-5, 6-3 – setting up an intriguing match against the surprise packet of this tournament, Aryna Sabalenka, the young Belarusian who took an hour and 41 minutes to deal with Russian qualifier Vera Zvonareva, 6-3, 7-6 (7).“I didn’t really expect it to be that tough,” Kvitova said of the 45th win of her season. Only the world No 1 Simona Halep – dumped out of Flushing Meadows in the first round – has had more success on Tour in 2018, and the 28-year-old Czech might be ready to push on towards the final weekend.The fifth seed reached the quarter-finals last year, losing to Venus Williams – who is on the other side of the draw and will play her sister, Serena, on Friday in one of the most anticipated matches of the fortnight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acf34e0c2fb2cdf50691ad55bbfb61372177a58f/0_68_2100_1260/master/2100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0473ff103b20b5206fdb636d89f161a","title":"us open tennis heatwave new york","story":"As temperatures soar in New York, we take a look at how the players and fans deal with the hot conditions at the US Open, where it was described as “dangerous” as five men had to retire from their first-round matches on Tuesday alone "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5dca9cd5a4115a53e52f5276e350b751e089309d/195_0_4666_2800/master/4666.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac6aede0f9bea9e73f114e1faf67f05c","title":"google home max review google assistant smart speaker","story":"Big new Google Assistant smart speaker finally launches in the UK with best-in-class voice control aiming to be the life and soul of the partyGoogle’s big, premium Apple HomePod rival the Home Max is finally being released in the UK today, bringing Google Assistant to the high-end smart speaker market.Announced in October 2017 and on sale in the US since November, the Home Max joins Google’s smaller Home and smallest Home Mini smart speakers as the big one. Google Assistant sorts voice commands, controls and questions exactly the same as Google’s smaller smart speaker offerings, but the way it sounds couldn’t be more different.The Home Max is relatively large box speaker, by smart speaker standards, with a white or black smooth plastic body and grey or charcoal coloured fabric front. In white and grey it’s simple fabric front and rounded corners make the Home Max look a bit bland up next to a Sonos Play:5 or an Apple HomePod, but it might be easier to blend in with soft home furnishings. It is about the size of a large bookcase speaker, but weighs over 5kg.White dots in the centre of the fabric front show when the Home Max is actively listening to you, when it’s working on a query or speaking to you, or shows the volume level when you adjust it.It can be stood up vertically or placed horizontally with a little rubber foot that attaches to the bottom magnetically. When horizontal the hidden touch strip on top acts as a pause-play button and a volume slider, both of which work well.A mute switch on the back allows you to turn off the microphones if you would like a little privacy from Google Assistant’s listening out for its wake words, which are either “Hey Google” or the older “Okay, Google”. When the mute switch is flicked the dots light up red until you turn the mics back on.An analogue 3.5mm line-in socket and USB-C port round out the back, alongside the figure-of-eight power cable. There’s also Bluetooth for streaming your music directly from a phone, tablet or computer if you need to.Setting up the Home Max is super easy, but requires an Android or iOS device. Just plug it in, open the Google Home app on your smartphone or tablet, tap the button to set up a new device and follow the instructions. It took about five minutes to get the speaker out of the box and playing music.Google Assistant is the same on the Home Max as it is on any other Google Home smart speaker. Since the original Home launched in May 2017, Assistant has become smarter answering more and more questions, and is impressively able to not only recognise the words you’re saying but also what you’re trying to say – when you butcher a question, Assistant will still be able to work out what you want, more often than not.Assistant also has the ability to recognise inidual voices using Google’s Voice Match – a feature still not available for Amazon’s Alexa in the UK – so when you ask for an update on your calendar or music from your library you get your stuff, rather than stuff belonging to someone else who lives in your house.Google has also continually added to Assistants smart home device control, which now rivals Amazon’s Alexa in most categories.But it is Assistant’s ability to control a wider range of music services, including Spotify, Google Play Music, YouTube Music and Deezer – combined with the best voice recognition – which has made it the one to beat.The Home Max certainly produces a big, aggressive sound and is loud enough as a single unit to fill even large rooms. It’s front-facing two 4.5in woofers and two tweeters produce fairly direct sound, making the Home Max a speaker to put at the end of a room rather than in the middle of it like Apple’s HomePod or the cheaper Amazon Echo. It doesn’t really have a sweet spot, however, sounding pretty uniform no matter where you sit in front of it.It has an intelligent audio tweaking system called Smart Sound, which uses the mics and AI to adjust the music as you play to a account for location, noise sources, track and even the time of day. Apple’s HomePod has a similar system built in, but Sonos’s Play:5 and others require an iPhone or iPad to tune the speakers each time you move them.The Home Max sounds punchy, producing music with lots of attack in the mids and deep bass. If you like big booming bass, you will love the Home Max, but I found the bass a bit loose in some tracks, missing some subtlety – turning the bass down in the equaliser helped a little.Rap tracks such as Dr Dre’s Still DRE, Forgot About Dre or The Next Episode sounded really aggressive and great. Jazz tracks such as Moanin’ by Art Blakey sounded warm and punchy, and it even did a fairly good job with Holst’s Jupiter performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra.It seemed most at home with pop tracks such as In My Feelings by Drake or Anywhere by Rita Ora. But playing tracks such as Do I Wanna Know? by the Arctic Monkeys, where the intro drum beats lost a bit of their alternating rhythm, or a live version of Hotel California by the Eagles, which lost clarity and separation between inidual notes and vocals, showed the Home Max’s weakness.It has a big, powerful sound, but it lacks the sparkle and subtlety something like the Sonos Play:5 or Apple’s HomePod brings, which allows you to discover new parts of your favourite tracks you might not have been able to hear before.The Smart Sound tuning improves over time, and I found that the sound was a little more room dependent than others, sounding better in the longer, more open kitchen than the living room.Volume consistency between tracks on Spotify was also weak, with some tracks drastically louder than the previous. Dynamic range is great, but feeling like you have to jockey the volume between tracks isn’t. I also found thedirect, aggressive nature of the sound a little wearing over extended listening sessions compared to some more immersive rivals.The Home Max can also play in multi-room audio groups with other Google Home or Chromecast devices, which makes filling your whole house with the same music easy. Stereo pairing is also available, but I did not have two to test.The Google Home Max costs £399 and comes in two colours: chalk or charcoal.For comparison, the Google Home costs £99, the Home Mini costs £39. Apple’s HomePod costs £319, the Sonos One costs £199 and the Sonos Play:5 costs £499.The Google Home Max is one big sound upgrade for Google Assistant, producing powerful, room-filling sound and booming bass.While Google Assistant is the best voice assistant available right now, with the widest range of music services and most capable voice recognition and understanding, the Home Max doesn’t quite match the exquisite audio produced by the likes of the Apple HomePod or Sonos Play:5.If you want a speaker to blast out music at a party or in the kitchen, the Home Max is brilliant. If you want a top-end living room listening experience to replace a great hi-fi, then at £400 this isn’t quite there yet.Pros: Google Assistant is great, multi orientation, loud and punchy, can always hear you, Bluetooth and analogue in, native Spotify and multiple other music services, adaptive sound, granular volume control via percentage, good touch controlsCons: variable volume in playlists, not much good for a non-Google user, smart speaker privacy concerns, better for some music genres than others, expensive"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fec9e6efac978891a373afc11e4cf4096b6cac3/0_791_5763_3458/master/5763.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29b218de5b157b6038371b9914465a1d","title":"apple shares record new iphone expected","story":"Gold smartphone and an Apple Watch with a larger display are expected at company’s regular September gatheringApple shares hit record highs on Thursday after it said it would host an event on 12 September at its Cupertino campus where it is widely expected to unveil new iPhone models.At one point its shares rose to more than $228 each amid speculation that Apple plans to release three new smartphones this year, including one with a larger display than previous models. Analysts also expect Apple to release an iPhone with a edge-to-edge display similar to the iPhone X but using less-costly LCD screen technology. Apple’s event invitation made heavy use of the colour gold, fuelling speculation the company plans to launch a gold-coloured successor to the iPhone X, which was made available in silver and gray last year. Documents filed at the US Federal Communications Commission and unsealed this year show Apple had sought approval for a gold version of its iPhone X. A few hours after Apple’s announcement, 9to5Mac, a technology news website, posted photographs of two gold iPhone models stacked on top each other, with a larger-screened model on the bottom. Both models resemble the current iPhone X. The site said the new flagship model will be called the iPhone XS and that Apple also planned to release a new version of the Apple Watch with a larger display by reducing the edges around it. 9to5Mac told Reuters the photographs were not mockups and represented Apple’s actual planned products but declined to say how it had obtained them. Apple did not respond to requests for comment about the authenticity of the photos. Apple has for years released its new phone models in the second week of September, and often updates other product lines such as the Apple Watch at the event. The company has already given base-model iPads and some MacBook laptops an update this year. Apple typically starts selling new iPhones a few weeks after launching them, in time for the holiday shopping season. The iPhone X, priced from $999, has helped Apple beat Wall Street sales expectations. Investor Warrant Buffett, speaking on Thursday to CNBC, said the iPhone was “enormously underpriced” even when it costs $1,000, given how indispensable it had become for so many people."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0523d7e521349864e687eda7a89d97088b2a4b2/0_125_4833_2900/master/4833.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fed2a27578585d9a6bf43f38a9f0726","title":"geert wilders far right dutch mp cancels muhammed cartoon competition","story":"Geert Wilders drops plans for controversial contest in November following death threats Dutch anti-Islam MP Geert Wilders has cancelled a planned contest inviting people to submit a cartoon of the prophet Muhammad following death threats and large-scale protests in Pakistan.“To avoid the risk of victims of Islamic violence, I have decided not to let the cartoon contest go ahead,” the far-right opposition politician said in a written statement on Thursday night.Wilders, who for years has lived under round-the-clock protection because of death threats sparked by his fierce anti-Islam rhetoric, said he does not want others put in danger by the contest he planned for November.News of the competition sparked angry protests in Pakistan and an alleged death threat against Wilders this week from a 26-year-old man, reportedly a Pakistani, who was arrested on Tuesday in The Hague.Physical depictions of the prophet are forbidden in Islam and are deeply offensive to Muslims.“It’s not just about me,” Wilders said in the statement. Opponents of the event “see not only me, but the entire Netherlands as a target”.The contest was to have been held at the tightly guarded offices of his Party for Freedom in the Dutch parliament building. The Dutch government had been at pains to distance itself from the contest.Prime minister Mark Rutte last week questioned Wilders’ motives. “His aim is not to have a debate about Islam,” he said. “His aim is to be provocative.”However, Rutte added that people in the Netherlands have far-reaching freedom of speech rights and the government did not intend to seek the contest’s cancellation.Before news of the contest’s cancellation, thousands of Islamists had set out to march toward Pakistan’s capital, Islamabad, in protest.Some 10,000 supporters of the far-right religious group Tehreek-e-Labbaik, which helped Imran Khan to become prime minister following last month’s national elections, set out on the march on Wednesday, calling on Khan to cut diplomatic ties with the Netherlands."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/674ca80393d65431c83c899e5d765fc740370667/0_387_2816_1690/master/2816.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e352d9619983423dcd8f713263d5b80b","title":"sick to my stomach dolphin and penguins locked in derelict japan aquarium","story":"Anger after hundreds of fish and reptiles have been left in tiny pools amid crumbling concrete since JanuaryAnger is mounting in Japan after a dolphin, 46 penguins and hundreds of fish were found to have been abandoned for months in a derelict aquarium.Animal rights campaigners have warned that the marine animals could die if they are not rescued from the Inubosaki marine park aquarium in the Pacific coastal town of Choshi north-east of Tokyo. The plight of Honey, a female bottlenose dolphin, as well as scores of Humboldt penguins and hundreds of fish and reptiles, has triggered outrage following reports that they were abandoned when the facility closed seven months ago.Images taken from outside the marine park in March this year show the solitary dolphin languishing in a tiny pool. In another photograph, dishevelled-looking penguins can be seen perched on a structure near what appear to be piles of loose concrete.The marine park closed at the end of January following a dramatic drop in visitor numbers blamed on the earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan’s north-east in March 2011.Reports said employees of the marine park were feeding the animals, although it is unclear how they are sourcing food and how much they have left. It is possible that the park still has large stocks of frozen food or that employees are purchasing fresh fish in Choshi, a fishing port.Animal rights campaigners have been refused entry to the facility, while local authorities have been unable to contact its private owner, Inubosaki Marine Park. Calls to the park’s owner went unanswered.“I am worried that Honey will die if this situation continues,” Akiko Mitsunobu, head of aquarium issues at the Animal Rights Centre Japan, told the .“Lately she has just been repeating the same movements – dipping her head in and out of the water – and is showing definite signs of stress. “Despite claims by the prefecture’s public health centre that the dolphin and penguins are being properly cared for, Mitsunobu said they needed to be seen by animal welfare experts who can offer a second opinion.Sachiko Azuma, a representative of Japanese animal rights group Peace (Put an End to Animal Cruelty and Exploitation), said the former operator’s silence left her fearing the worst.“As a group that handles animals, they have a responsibility to explain what they intend to do with Honey and the other animals,” she said. “Compared to a year ago you can see that her condition has deteriorated. It’s impossible to say that she’s healthy.”By last week, the marine park had received more than 800 emails and letters demanding that the animals be moved to a new home. The Mainichi Shimbun reported that the operator had been in talks with another aquarium about transferring Honey and the penguins but had abruptly ended negotiations and refused to respond to enquiries from the Choshi town government. Local officials are not legally entitled to enter the facility without permission and cannot compel the owner to relocate the animals, the newspaper said.Honey was taken to the marine park in 2005 after being captured in Taiji, a town on the Pacific coast that drew international criticism after its hunts were featured in the 2009 Oscar-winning documentary The Cove.In 2015, the Japan Association of Zoos and Aquariums agreed to stop buying dolphins from Taiji after it was threatened with expulsion from the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (Waza).The move came after the  revealed that Waza had been targeted in a court action launched by the conservation group Australia for Dolphins, which accused it of being complicit in the hunts by failing to take decisive action against Japanese aquariums.Aquariums in Japan voted to stop buying live specimens from Taiji to avoid expulsion, but a facility in the town quit Jaza in protest, and local fishermen have vowed to continue the hunts.In a typical hunt the fishermen pursue pods of dolphins across open seas, banging the top of metal poles that extend beneath the water to confuse their hypersensitive sonar and driving them into a narrow cove. Some are killed for their meat, which is sold in local supermarkets and restaurants, while the most attractive specimens are selected for sale to aquariums and sea parks.The animal rights centre said it feared that Honey could be recaptured if she was returned to waters off Taiji. Instead, it is demanding that she be sent to a sanctuary that closely resembles her natural habitat.Mitsunobu said Honey’s plight “reflects the lack of awareness people in Japan generally have about animal welfare and keeping animals in captivity. Aquariums and marine parks are still seen as places for families to have a fun day out.“The issue has been complicated by the fact that it is connected to the Taiji dolphin hunts, but for now this is about the need to do something to help Honey before it is too late.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3613231.1535658862!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pay pressures set to come to a head in build up to budget","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPhil Ní Sheaghdha, head of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation. The INMO this week set the Government a one-month deadline to produce a “serious pay offer”. Photograph: Nick BradshawWithin the next few weeks pay pressures which have been building up on the Government for the last few months will come to a head.All of these issues have the potential of generating industrial unrest in key sectors.The pay pressures also will add to the complications facing the Government as it prepares for the budget in October.Already several thousand staff working in State-funded organisations providing health and social services – known technically as Section 39 bodies – are to stage the first of potentially a number of strikes in mid-September seeking pay restoration.These workers are not public servants but their unions argue they experienced pay cuts similar to those applied to State employees during the austerity years.Those working in Section 39 organisations contend that while public service staff have begun seeing the restoration of pay cuts, they have not.Nurses and midwives are also to hold a special conference towards the end of September as part of their demands for pay improvements to address recruitment and retention difficulties in the health service.The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation this week set the Government a one-month deadline to produce a “serious pay offer”.The union hinted at industrial action if this did not happen.Nurses have been waiting for months for the report of the Public Service Pay Commission on recruitment and retention problems in the health sector which is due imminently.However, it is not now expected that the commission will recommend across-the-board rises in basic pay for nurses to encourage them to remain in the public system.There may be increased allowances suggested as part of a proposed new over-arching framework, and a future review as part of the implementation of the Sláintecare health reforms. However, it remains to be seen whether this would be sufficient for the 50,000 general nurses, psychiatric nurses and midwives working in the public healthcare system.Once the commission report is published the Government is likely to commence a four-week round of talks on its findings.However, it will be conscious of the dangers of any agreement reached with nurses leading to knock-on claims elsewhere in the public service.In a parallel process the Government has been engaged with the broader public service trade union movement on dealing with the lower pay rates that apply to more than 60,000 staff across the public service appointed since 2011.Teaching unions rejected the existing public service agreement largely due to opposition to this two-tier pay system.One union, the Teachers’ Union of Ireland, already has a mandate for industrial action, and others could follow in the weeks ahead if they are dissatisfied with the outcome of this process.The Government is expected to focus mainly in these negotiations on the newer-entrants pay issue.Apart from pressures from trade unions, Fianna Fáil is also seeking that the Government begin moving on this issue in the forthcoming budget in October.However, the Government has estimated ending the two-tier system would cost about €200 million and it seems unlikely this would be put in place in a single year."},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

Now the judge has time to rule without grizzly bears being killed starting Saturday morning.A grizzly bear near Camas in northwestern MontanaThe plaintiffs had argued the bears still face threats to their survival. Federal wildlife officials say the bears are thriving.Fewer than two dozen bears would be allowed to be killed in the hunts.The advocacy groups claim the US Fish and Wildlife Service\u0027s decision last year that Yellowstone grizzlies are no longer a threatened species was based on faulty science. They also say they don\u0027t trust that the three states that have taken over bear management will ensure the bears\u0027 survival. They are asking the judge to re-classify the bears as threatened.Wyoming Gov. Matt Mead was willing to make adjustments to the hunting season, said Erik Petersen, Wyoming\u0027s senior assistant attorney general. He wants the judge to leaves Wyoming, Montana and Idaho in charge of managing the bears - even if he rules that the US Fish and Wildlife Service needs to revise its rule declassifying grizzlies as threatened.The likelihood of any significant harm to the population is essentially nil, Petersen said.Among their arguments in court, attorneys for the advocacy groups questioned how other threatened grizzly populations in the Lower 48 states would fare if the Yellowstone bears\u0027 status changed. They also said the federal wildlife agency ignored recent spikes in overall bear deaths that, when hunting is added to the mix, could cause an unanticipated population decline.When bears attack | What to do if you are attacked by a bearDepartment of Justice attorneys said the Fish and Wildlife Service considered all the plaintiffs\u0027 arguments and proceeded with lifting protections because there is no threat of extinction to the bears now or in the foreseeable future.They have a lot of speculation, (but) they have very little facts, said attorney Michael Eitel.Petersen and attorneys representing Montana and Idaho said the people most affected will be the farmers and ranchers who live in grizzly territory and have increasing conflicts with bears attacking livestock. Those people have been cooperative with conservation efforts, but that attitude may change if federal protections are restored, they said.The population of grizzlies living in Yellowstone was classified as a threatened species in 1975, when its number had fallen to 136. The Fish and Wildlife Service initially declared a successful recovery for the Yellowstone population in 2007, but a federal judge ordered protections to remain in place while wildlife officials studied whether the decline of a major food source, whitebark pine seeds, could threaten the bears\u0027 survival.In 2017, the federal agency concluded that it had addressed all threats, and ruled that the grizzlies were no longer a threatened species needing restrictive federal protections.That prompted six lawsuits challenging the agency\u0027s decision. Those lawsuits have been consolidated into one case that Christensen heard on Thursday.Idaho\u0027s hunting quota is one bear. Wyoming\u0027s hunt is in two phases: 1 September opens the season in an outlying area with a quota of 12 bears, and Sept. 15 starts the season in prime grizzly habitat near Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks. One female or nine males can be killed in those areas.It would be Wyoming\u0027s first grizzly hunt since 1974 and Idaho\u0027s first since 1946. Twelve hunters in Wyoming and one in Idaho have been issued licenses out of the thousands who applied.Montana officials decided not to hold a hunt this year. Bear hunting is not allowed in Yellowstone or Grand Teton. Please review our commenting policyAustralian Catholics refuse to report child abuse disclosed in confession as church responds to royal commissionSolihull double murder: Man, 21, arrested over deaths of mother and daughterSeven dead in New Mexico after Greyhound bus collides with truckScandal-hit NHS Trust faces calls for wider investigation into deaths on maternity unitNumber of over-65s needing 24-hour care \u0026#39to rise by third over next 20 years\u0026#39Comment: After Iceland won the cod wars, their independent fisheries thrived.

The massive increase in pupil numbers over the next few years, particularly at secondary age, will only make it harder.”Local authorities are responsible for ensuring there are enough school places, but they cannot force academies – which account for two-thirds of secondary schools – to expand. And since 2010, all newly built schools must be opened as free schools – which are run by the government.“In an increasingly fragmented school system we lack a co-ordinated approach to place planning. Instead it’s haphazard decisions are being made in isolation and new schools and new school places are not always being commissioned in the areas they are most needed,” he added.Mr\u0026nbspWhiteman\u0026nbsptold\u0026nbspThe Independent:\u0026nbsp“The consequences for children’s education and wellbeing could be negative, with potentially larger class sizes, and certainly in some parts of the country it will mean children having to travel long distances to go to secondary school, or being separated from their peers, or even siblings, forcing parents to juggle several schools.”“Some local authorities have had to consider temporary classrooms, but a lot of those accessible solutions have already been exhausted,” he added.Malcolm Trobe, deputy general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: “It is a realistic fear that there will be youngsters without places.“One way of dealing with the pressure is to get secondary schools to expand. If you are full, then you need to increase accommodation. In many cases this will mean temporary classrooms.”But Mr Trobe warned that many schools will not have the space and staff to take on extra pupils if requests are last-minute.“We have known this bulge has been coming for some time so there is no excuse for turning around and saying ‘Oh dear we have got more youngsters coming into our secondary school’. Appropriate action should have been taken to put places in,” he added.London parents have to pay £70k premium to buy a home near top schoolsParents looking forward to sending children back to school, poll findsPoorest students ‘nine times more likely to be in inadequate schools’Justine Roberts, founder and chief executive of Mumsnet, said: “For parents who find themselves in this situation it’s incredibly stressful – not to mention the impact on the children themselves.“Access to education is a fundamental right and it’s crucial that there are sufficient places for all the children who need them.”Unless more secondary school places are created, LGA analysis says 13 local authorities will face a shortfall in 201920, rising to 25 councils in 202021, 46 in 202122 and 54 in 202223.In May, the government controversially announced plans to hand over £50m to existing grammar schools to help create thousands of new places.They also announced a new wave of free school applications – building on the 212,000 places created by free schools since 2010.UK news in picturesShelves of energy drinks on sale.

Respondents predicted prices in the capital will fall 1.6 per cent this year\u0026nbspand 0.1 per cent in 2019, although for the UK in general they are set to rise 2 per cent this year and next, and 2.3 per cent in 2020. The national average price for a property was £301,973 in August, and in London it rose to £609,205. “The weight of evidence suggests that housing is overvalued once more,” said Hansen Lu at Capital Economics.Experts said there was a one in three chance of a “significant correction” in the London market. When asked what effect a disorderly Brexit would have on prices, answers ranged from “short term fall” to “damaging” to “disaster”. When asked about the likelihood of a significant correction in London’s housing market before the end of 2019, the specialists gave a relatively high median of 29 per cent, with the highest response 75 per cent.One respondent predicted house prices could fall by as much as 40 per cent. “We see little upward or downward pressure on house prices at current near-zero interest rates. However\u0026nbsprisks lie substantially to the downside,” said Andrew Brigden, at Fathom Consulting.“Were interest rates to return to pre-crisis levels, or higher – which may prove necessary if there were a sharp fall in sterling after a general election, for example – then house prices could fall by around 40 per cent.”UK house prices should be frozen for five years, think tank saysThis London area has seen the highest 20-year house price growth in UKThe Bank of England recently raised interest rates above 0.5 per cent for the first time since the financial crisis, and said the rate would continue to increase at a gradual pace over the next few years.

Now a new book collects photography and stories from the communityClick to followThe IndependentThe community designed a flag, appointed ministers of state – including actor David Rappaport as foreign minister – made their own postage stamps and issued visas for visitorsThere was a lot of talk, in the wake of the Brexit referendum, suggesting that London should stage its own exit from the United Kingdom, declare independence, and ask to rejoin the EU as a nation state.Ignoring for now the fact that not everyone – though\u0026nbspit might seem that way to London – outside the capital voted to leave the EU, it seemed a satisfying, though jokey, postscript to the Brexit vote. Indeed, more than 180,000 Londoners signed an online petition calling for the mayor, Sadiq\u0026nbspKhan, to “declare London independent, and apply to join the EU –\u0026nbspincluding membership of the Schengen zone”.But what a lot of the signatories might not have realised was that there was indeed a precedent for London seceding from the UK. Or at least, one street of the capital.\u0026nbspWelcome to the Free Independent Republic of Frestonia. Or, what’s left of it, which these days amounts to the Frestonian Gallery, keeping the name and spirit alive of one of the most curious episodes in London’s history. It\u0026nbspbegan on Halloween\u0026nbsp1977, when the residents of Freston Road in Notting Dale, West London, which was largely comprised of squats and communes, declared independence.Threatened with eviction, the squatters said they were no longer part of the UK and appealed to the United Nations to send in peacekeeping forces to prevent Greater London Council turfing them out of the homes they had claimed. They designed a flag, appointed ministers of state, and even made their own postage stamps and issued visas for visitors.The short-lived story of the Free Independent Republic of Frestonia has now been documented in a new book of photographs by one of its residents, the photographer Tony Sleep, who was resident on Freston Road from 1974.\u0026nbspSleep describes the Frestonia experiment as “part publicity stunt, part theatrical protest”, and adds that while it wasn’t a serious attempt to break away from the UK, there was never any need to, because what became Frestonia “was already on a different planet”.He writes in the lavish book: “Frestonia was rooted in the counterculture of the time. The period is now dismissed as little more than daft clothes and hair, accompanied by a great soundtrack and the invention of sex and drugs.“It was, we are told, youthful self indulgence that ended badly because it was irresponsible and naive.”Frestonian Gallery)Frestonia was born out of problems that young people will recognise today: the lack of affordable accommodation. Sleep points out that the millennial generation might have a beef with the baby boomers who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s because they had it easy, and accommodation was cheap and plentiful. Not a bit of it, he says.“Rented flats were in very short supply, and mostly slum standard. You might achieve a rented bedsit as long as you weren’t black, Irish\u0026nbspor a dog. Then, as now, landlords wanted ‘professional’ people.“Council housing lists were only for families, and backlogged for decades. Despite what now seem like absurdly low prices, only the wealthy and secure could obtain mortgages at a time before easy mass debts. Less than half the population owned their own homes at the start of the 1970s.”Freston Road, where squatters and activists founded housing coop and community Frestonia\u0026nbsp(Getty)Many of the houses on Freston Road were empty, having been condemned as unfit for human habitation, and most of the residents had been relocated to the new highrise blocks of flats that began to go up in the 1960s and 1970s. There had been a move to demolish the vacant properties, but residents in neighbouring communities had complained that they would be looking out onto swathes of barren, rubble-strewn land that would encourage flytipping, so the authorities decided to take the cheaper option and just leave the buildings standing for a while.Freston Road might have been abandoned, but that didn’t mean it was unused. From 1974, squatters began to break into the empty houses and set up home there Tony Sleep, aged 24 at that time, was one of them.He recalls:\u0026nbsp“Squatting is distinctly equal opportunity. If you can gain possession, it’s yours. This led to an interesting mix of people who had little in common except needing somewhere to live and being poor for one reason or another. While some tried to make their new homes habitable, several houses were quickly wrecked.”Sleep remembers well his first sight of Freston Road. He’d been living in a “dismal rented basement” in west Kensington, but as he and his girlfriend parted company, he needed somewhere else to live, and heard about a street of empty houses. Some of his friends went to have a look and broke into two of the houses.“That night I paid them a visit,” writes Sleep. “Eight people, four guys, four girls, in one candlelit room, the only one that had windows. There was no toilet, no water, no electricity.”But his friends set to work installing plumbing and wiring as best they could, found an old toilet, rescued carpets and furniture from skips, and Sleep asked if he could move in with them.By 1977 Freston Road had settled into an unorthodox community, of sorts. But the attention of the GLC wandered back to these old, abandoned homes, and the squatters were told that they were to be evicted from these properties.The council offered to place the squatters in what were considered “hard to let” properties dotted around London, and some took the flats –\u0026nbspand, says Sleep, were promptly replaced in Freston Road by other people desperate for somewhere to live.\u0026nbspThe GLC announced its intention to bulldoze Freston Road after all, and a meeting was called, attended by 200 people. They decided – inspired by the Ealing comedy Passport to Pimlico – to go it alone. The Free Independent Republic of Frestonia was born. And the battle was on.The Frestonian National Anthem was written (“Long live Frestonia! Land of the free – not the GLC”) and a community newspaper, The Tribal Messenger, was distributed. Frestonia made the international press, and the Daily Mirror ran a piece declaring “All Hall, Frestonia”. The actor David Rappaport was made foreign minister, and playwright Heathcote Williams became ambassador to the United Kingdom.It was all a bit jolly and, of course, more than a pinch of Ealing comedy. But, Sleep points out, Frestonia was also an interesting way of putting British society under the\u0026nbspmicroscope.“Communities are defined, more or less, by what people have in common,” he writes. “That’s usually class, background or aspiration, sometimes race or religion. What people have in common helps them feel safe and valued. What is different can be threatening or isive.Frestonian Gallery)“Families, on the other hand, are a matter of being stuck with people you sometimes struggle to tolerate, let alone like. Frestonia was a bit of both.“Frestonians were, beneath the veneer of pragmatic anarchy, from different cultures. There were the hippies, idealists of a sort. There were the punks, nihilists of a sort. And there were the itinerant street people, whose lack of youth and lost changes gave them a thread of bitterness to chew on together.”Over the next couple of years, fighting the threat of the GLC bulldozers, the anarchic squat collective organised itself more seriously, forming the Bramley Housing Cooperative with an aim that was less about the fun of independence and more about securing the future of the Freston Road community.Eventually, the GLC won the war, and demolition of the squats began in 1983. But the Bramley Housing Cooperative, working with the Notting Hill Housing Trust, continued to fight for Freston Road as a residential area. And, ultimately, they won.Sleep says, “Frestonia didn’t cease when the squats were demolished. How could it? They were only useful ruins. Frestonia was about the people, its improbable family.“If you walk through Frestonia now, there’s little to suggest it is much different from anywhere else. You’ll find a street of small, but perhaps unusually pretty houses, built in the mid 1980s. They look carefully designed, a bit too inidual to be social housing. You may not notice the enclosed communal gardens, or the sheltered housing scheme that the coop insisted on, you won’t know the coop ensured housing for some of the more vulnerable Frestonians.”It might be that Frestonia would be forgotten all together, but for Tony Sleep’s photographic record of the people, events and houses on Freston Road in the late 1970s and early 1980s.‘Pop-up squat’: Activists occupy property to protest Housing BillNew photography exhibition shows the tough reality of squattingChallenging consumption and overwork in a Danish communityThe name does linger on in the form of the Frestonian Gallery, opened in 2017 by Matt Incledon and Rollo Campbell, who have published Tony Sleep’s photographs and recollections in Welcome To Frestonia. A pair of, in their own words, “itinerant art dealers”, they opened the gallery in The People’s Hall, a Victorian building that was once at the heart of Frestonia.\u0026nbspFrestonian Gallery opened in 2017 to remember a most curious episode in London’s history\u0026nbsp(Tony SleepFrestonian Gallery)Becoming appraised of the story of Frestonia, they were introduced to Tony Sleep, and arranged an exhibition of his photographs. They write in their foreword: “It was an exhibition unlike anything either of us had worked on previously. Each day at the gallery provided a steady stream of visitors keen to revisit and share their own personal memories of Frestonia. It would be a nice point at which to say ‘We then decided a book of Tony’s work needs to be published...’ but again, in truth, the decision had been made for us already by the sheer emotional response to this unique exhibition.”Was it all worth it for the Frestonians? Did it make a difference?

Sterling fell by as much as 0.3 per cent against the dollar\u0026nbspafter the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said in a German radio interview that the bloc is prepared for a no-deal Brexit. “After the sterling bounce yesterday,\u0026nbspBarnier has used a German radio interview this morning to remind the market that the EU is also planning for a no-deal scenario,” Jeremy Stretch at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, told Bloomberg.“This suggests they are not intent on a deal at all costs and that sterling gains may prove tough to hold onto.”The pound was boosted on Tuesday, rising 1.2 per cent against the dollar, and 1 per cent against the euro, after Mr Barnier said the EU is “prepared to offer a partnership with Britain such as has never been with any other third country. His positive remarks came as Brexit secretary Dominic Raab told the Lords EU committee that he was “confident a deal is within our sights”“We\u0027re bringing ambition, pragmatism, energy and if, and I expect it will be, and if it is matched, we get a deal,” he said. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said many investors would be wondering whether Mr Barnier’s positive statement on Wednesday could be a turning point for the pound. “Although many issues related to trade and the Irish border are far from being resolved, it currently seems that negotiations may begin moving in the right direction. However, expect volatility to surge in the coming weeks as we get closer to the Brexit deadline,” he said.The pound remained up against the euro, trading up 0.02 per cent at €1.1128 by mid-morning.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/30/14/snapchat-new-york-jewtropolis-snap-map.jpg","title":"snapchat new york jewtropolis snap map","story":"Created with Sketch.Snapchat users reported that New York had been renamed to Jewtropolis on Snap MapSnacpchat blamed third party mapping data from its partner MapboxClick to followThe Independent TechNew York has been renamed Jewtropolis within Snapchat\u0027s Snap Map feature, after online vandals were apparently able to take it over.Snap Map is designed to allow users to discover content within specific regions across the world, such as Snaps of sporting events, celebrations and breaking news.It uses software provided by\u0026nbspMapbox, a separate company that provides custom maps for applications including Foursquare and Lonely Planet.

former inmate in one of the interment camps said Muslims were forced to eat pork and drink alcohol, acts which are forbidden by their religion.The UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination\u0026nbspissued its findings after a two-day review of China’s record, the first since 2009, earlier this month.China’s foreign ministry rejected the allegations at the time, and said

from Islamist militants and separatists who plot attacks and stir up tensions between the Uighur\u0026nbspminority and the ethnic Han Chinese majority.The panel criticised China’s “broad definition of terrorism and vague references to extremism and unclear definition of separatism in Chinese legislation”.It said the definition could be used against those peacefully exercising their rights and facilitates “criminal profiling” of ethnic and religious minorities, including Uighurs, Buddhist Tibetans and Mongolians.In its conclusions, the panel said it was alarmed by\u0026nbsp“numerous reports of detention of large numbers of ethnic Uighurs and other Muslim minorities held incommunicado and often for long periods, without being charged or tried, under the pretext of countering terrorism and

Life after death: Man claims to meet JESUS in afterlife\u0026ldquoThe reference to Cana in Josephus, the New Testament and in the rabbinic texts would argue the village was a Jewish village, near the Sea of Galilee and in the region of lower Galilee.\u0026ldquoKhirbet Qana fulfills all of these criteria.As for the better-known site at Kafr Kanna, Dr McCollough is sceptical.\u0026ldquoWhen tourists visiting Israel today are taken to Cana, they are taken to Kafr Kanna, he said.\u0026ldquoHowever, this site was not recognised as a pilgrimage site for those seeking Cana until the 1700s.It\u0026rsquos the former site of Khirbet Qana, a Jewish village between the years of 323BC and AD 324 (Image: penmedia)\u0026ldquoAt this point the Franciscans were managing Christian pilgrimage and facilitating easy passage rather than historical accuracy.Dr McCollough believes the discoveries at Khirbet Qana could even bolster the case for the historicity of the Gospel of John.He said: \u0026ldquoOur excavations have shown that this was in fact a thriving Jewish village located in the heart of much of Jesus\u0026rsquos life and ministry.\u0026ldquoFor the Gospel of John, Cana is in some ways, Jesus\u0026rsquos safe place or operational centre. It is a place He and His disciples return to when they encounter resistance in Judea.\u0026ldquoI would argue our excavations warrant at least a reconsideration of the historical value of John\u0026rsquos references to Cana and Jesus.

He puts my needs first.”Legendary singer Prince, who passed away in April 2016, converted to the faith in 2001 following the death of his mother.He described his conversion as: a realisation. Its like Morpheus and Neo in The Matrix.A committed Jehovahs Witness to the end, a memorial for the star took place at the Kingdom Hall of Jehovahs Witnesses near his Minnesota home to commemorate his life.Canadian model Coco Rocha has opened up about her life as a devout Jehovahs Witness saying: faith is everything and despite her fame, she still preaches door-to-door.The whole purpose is to inform people. Some people think we’re a pushy religion, but if you’re not interested, just say so, she explained to luxury magazine Dujour.Naomi Campbells mum Valerie is also a follower, telling Vogue: I brought up Naomi as a Jehovahs Witness, but she must choose her faith for herself. I do give her literature on the subject though when she asks for it.However, the model has not followed in her mothers footsteps by becoming a believer.Other A-list celebs, including Janet Jackson, Ja Rule and actress Michelle Rodriguez were raised in the faith as children, but no longer practise it.Members follow their own version of the Bible called the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.They say our world now belongs to Satan, and because of this God  - who they call Jehovah - will end it very soon in order to create a new kingdom.Jehovahs Witnesses are not meant to make friends with people of other faiths, as non-believers are considered to belong to Satans world - although this isnt always strict as their celebrity followers show.Many followers say there is a a sense of community that can come with being a Jehovahs Witness - as they are tight-knit and have respect for each other.The easy-to-follow belief system is also a big draw for people interested in the faith, and the organisation has a lot of literature providing what they believe to be the answers to lifes big questions.A Jehovahs Witness church: followers of the faith reject blood transfusions as they are seen as sinfulJehovahs Witnesses are barred from having blood transfusions - which makes operations like Caesarean sections - that often require them - more difficult to complete, as blood products are linked to immorality.As one Jehovahs Witness told the New Yorker: It’s as much a sin to take a blood transfusion as to have an extramarital affair.This has led to several deaths - and ious court battles between Jehovahs Witnesses and doctors seeking to treat them.Last Autumn, a 27-year-old Canadian new mother, Éloïse Dupuis, died a week after giving birth due to haemorrhaging - but despite doctors pleas for her to have a blood transfusion she refused.Jehovahs Witnesses dont believe in sex before marriage - and dating isnt condoned unless they bring along a chaperone as well.So its likely that the first person you choose to date will be the person you marry.And after marriage, theres still restrictions on sex - namely anal and oral sex which are strictly forbidden, something that is also frowned upon in religions such as Islam and other forms of Christianity.Followers are peaceful - even refusing military service - but are suffering from persecution in some countries.Earlier this year, they were declared as an extremist group in Russia with raids on their churches and several arrests - its thought hundreds have fled the country and applied for asylum in Finland since.Other things they are prohibited from doing include being patriotic, as it is seen as worshipping an idol, or voting or canvassing for political parties as they remain politically neutral.As Jesus never celebrated his birthday, Jehovahs Witnesses dont mark theirs either, and they dont acknowledge the major Christian holidays of Christmas Day or Easter, as they believe these festivals are based on pagan customs.On the plus side, it means they probably save a lot of money due to not having to fork out for expensive gifts.Their beliefs in the end of the world have led to a series of unfulfilled prophecies.In 1975 they were told the world would end and members of the church were encouraged to preach full-time and get rid of their possessions.Thousands of them quit their jobs and sold their homes - but Armageddon didnt come leading to a drop in membership, something which has remained in decline ever since.Armageddon was also promised before the start of the Millennium, but again never materialised.There has also been other controversies: the Charity Commission are currently investigating claims that some followers were abused as children by fellow members of the faith.Members are known for their recruitment drives: previously, they would go door-to-door to try and recruit new converts, handing out literature that explains their beliefs.However, people who have left the church have described this as being exhausting.One said: I barely got any sleep when I was a Witness...I needed the weekends to catch up on my sleep debt, but instead I had to get up at the crack of dawn to go out preaching.Followers of the religion are now more commonly found preaching outside train stations across the UK, and in London alone their volunteers give out an estimated 100,000 magazines every month.The publication, Awake!, has been running since 1919, and with a global circulation of 65 million they show no sign of stopping recruiting any time soon. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris... Johnson. The bicycle guy... was here.”And he took at dig at Mrs May for being the first PM to visit Kenya in decades, thanking her for coming to see how things has changed.Instead he namechecked Donald Trump and China as key investment partners alongside Britain and was luke warm about effect of Brexit on trade with the African powerhouse.Mrs May looked on stony-faced as her Tory rival once again upstaged a key moment, but later supressed a smile when the President rembered the name.Margaret Thatcher was the last British PM to tour the country back in 1988 - David Cameron was set to go in 2016 but didnt after he quit following the dramatic Brexit vote in June.Gordon Brown visited in 2005 as Chancellor.Last night Mrs May signed a new security deal with Nigeria to train thousands more troops to fight the terror group Boko Haram.And today she will announce a tie-up with Kenyan authorities to help track down British paedophiles using data from tech firms.Mrs May is giving the Kenyan President a framed map of the London marathon route made by British designer Holly Francesca.It is personalised with the Kenyan winners of Londons most famous annual race, and the historic landmarks along the way. The trip is part of efforts to build a global Britain and maximise trade links ahead of Brexit.Shes already announced £4billion worth of extra financial support for the Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa, and has promised to help crack down on illegal human trafficking and Islamic extremism."},{"url":null,"title":"fashion sketches princess diana bukra design saudi arabia visit","story":"Diana, who was 25 at the time, enlisted fashion designers David and Elizabeth Emanuel to make dresses that conformed to local customs ahead of the visit to Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.The husband and wife duo, who famously designed Dianas wedding dress, submitted sketches of four long sleeved outfits, including a black and white silk satin evening dress and a navy and white stripe coat over a white dress.The fifth, reserve outfit, which was also sketched but not worn, was a burka that would have covered Diana from head to toe with only a gap for her eyes.The sketches, and fabric samples for the outfits, are expected to sell for £24,000 with US auction house RR Auctions.A letter, dated June 2 1986, sent to the Emanuels by Dianas lady-in-waiting, Anne Beckwith-Smith, explained the strict requirements for her garments during the tour.She wrote: Certain special requirements concerning dress need to be observed and I am writing to ask if it would be possible to submit to The Princess of Wales a few sketches for day and evening wear from which Her Royal Highness could select items for this tour.Their Royal highnesses will be visiting Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.In all cases modesty is the order of the day.An invoice for the dresses is also included in the sale, revealing they cost between £275 and £450 each.Bobby Livingston, executive vice president of RR Auctions, said: Princess Diana tried to conform to local customs by wearing concealing clothes, but still exposed her neck and left her head uncovered.At evening banquets, she appeared in the long sleeved demure dresses made especially for the tour.She did not have to wear the reserve outfit burka depicted in this archive.Its a remarkable, comprehensive archive from the famously stylish royal.Diana and Charles visited the four countries in the Middle East during a week-long trip in mid November 1986.In Saudi Arabia she was invited to a state reception at the Al Yamamah Palace by King Fahd of Saudi Arabia -

It is a place he and his disciples return to when they encounter resistance in Judea.I would argue our excavations warrant at least a reconsideration of the historical value of Johns references to Cana and Jesus."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000429857131.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"moment cops kick travellers out of town plagued by gypsies just hours after they moved in using legal loophole","story":"More than 50 cops were called to the popular dog walking site after around 20 caravans set up camp in Woodford Green this morning.Pictures show the officer swiftly ordering them to move on from the field next to Winston Churchills statue.The travellers were in breach of a High Court order granted to the local council in June aimed at protecting parks, school grounds and industrial estates.It came after taxpayers were forced to fork out £350,000 to clear up 52 illegal sites across the borough over the past two years.Travellers have plagued the borough and cost the council £50,000 per site by dumping asbestos.But often it can taken authorities weeks to turf them out.A spokesman for City of London Corporation, which owns the land, said: We are aware that a number of travellers set up a temporary camp on Woodford Green.Our team of staff on site responded quickly and worked closely in partnership with Redbridge Council, the politan Police and social services to move the travellers on.

We’re really passionate about delivering a great service. Our reviews speak for themselves.”London-based Caraline added: “Not having to face friends and family straight after surgery helps make recovery easier.”Boob jobs at one Turkish clinic are on offer for £2,725 compared with £5,500 at home.The packages include consultations with the surgeon, the op, anaesthetist and hospital fees, medication and post-operative check-ups abroad.And clinics say they can book flights, accommodation and transfer for as little as ten per cent of the treatment cost.A hair transplant is priced at upwards of £12,000 in the UK, putting it out of reach for most Brits.

But Katie, from Croydon, South London, recalled: “The pain is worse than anything, I was in labour for 69 hours and it was so much worse.”When she returned to England she was unable to bend down as her waist was “rock-hard” and full of “lumps and scars”.Katie claimed Gina told her to come back and get it fixed — but she had to pay another £1,000 for her flights.Once there she said they recommended another bum lift but she was too scared to go through with it.She said: “I just wanted them to fix my stomach. The doctor’s supposed to have fixed me but he hasn’t.Because I didn’t have the surgery they wanted I don’t think they did anything to the lumps. He did offer to repair the damage again and I have that in writing.

On Monday, 6,000 far-right protesters were involved in clashes in Chemnitz in Saxony, Germany. In Italy, the right-wing League is in government with the populist Five Star movement. The far-right Sweden Democrats could hold the balance of power after elections this autumn. It is a similar story in Hungary, Austria and Slovenia. Some fear the “great peace” – the 70-plus years of co-operation and security in Western Europe – is now under threat. The rise of the far-right has co\u0026shyincided with a decline of the centre-left. Of the 28 EU states, only six – Spain, Portugal, Malta, Greece, Sweden and Slovakia – have left-wing governments. The right’s tough line on migration has played well with some of the left’s traditional supporters. Prof Matthew Goodwin, of Kent University, says: “We have centre- left parties struggling with a new agenda of terrorism, immigration and the refugee crisis.” There are fears for the future of the EU. A poll for Reuters suggests far-right parties could increase their seats in the European Parliament from 80 to 122 next year. Prof Goodwin says: “The issue of the refugee crisis is massive for the EU. If they cannot be seen to respond effectively to that issue and they cannot come up with a unified plan, that is going to cause the EU major, major problems.” So what is the current situation? HUNGARY At the vanguard of the populist surge is PM Viktor Orban. In power since 2010, he has exploited unease over immigration to whip up nationalist sentiment. He casts himself as the defender of Europe against Muslim migrants, saying “a Europe with a mixed population” has “no sense of identity”.  Hungary is now described as an “illiberal democracy” due to its suppression of free speech and political cronyism. Allies of Orban, 55, have been appointed to key positions in the courts, media and civil service. In June, a law was introduced so that anyone “facilitating illegal immigration” could face prison. Another crackdown, a swipe at billionaire philanthropist George Soros, a fierce critic of Orban, aims to curtail the activities of charities and civil rights groups. Hungary has been referred to the European Court of Justice for “non-compliance” with EU law but Brussels has done little to tackle corruption in the country and allegations that billions of euros in EU funding goes to Orban’s cronies. GERMANY The anti-immigration Alternative for Germany party entered parliament for the first time in last October’s elections, winning 12.6% of the vote and more than 90 seats. Preying on fears about immigration and Islam, one of its leading figures, Alexander Gauland, 77, has talked of fighting an “invasion of foreigners”. The party has also been accused of anti-Semitism.  Traditional Conservative parties have shifted to the right to head off the threat. Angela Merkel’s government almost collapsed this year when her coalition partners the Baian-based Christian Social Union demanded a tougher line on immigration. SWEDEN The Sweden Democrats, who are anti-immigration, are now polling a record high of 20 per cent. The party, which has roots in neo-Nazi organisations, is pushing an agenda of “Swexit”, halting migration and outsourcing the processing of asylum seekers to beyond Europe’s borders. Its focus on crime and immigration has found appeal among voters who previously supported the centre-left Social Democrats. It could hold the balance of power after next month’s election. POLAND The right-wing Law and Justice party came to power in 2015 and promotes a hardline nationalist and religious agenda. The Government has alarmed the EU by taking control of state media and granting itself powers to hire and fire the previously independent judiciary.  Exploiting unease about immigration, party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski, 69, claimed that migrants could  cause “epidemics”.    The Government made it illegal to accuse the Polish state of complicity in the Holocaust, leading to accusations  that it is trying to cover  up collaboration with  the Nazis.  AUSTRIA The anti-immigration Freedom Party was given several key cabinet posts as part of a coalition deal with the majority People’s Party. Founded by former Nazis in the 1950s, the Freedom Party wants a tough line on asylum seekers and immigrants. Legislation before the Austrian parliament would force asylum seekers to hand over their mobile phones and surrender cash to pay for their upkeep. Other proposals include a ban on girls aged 10 and under from wearing headscarves at school. A leading party member caused controversy by demanding a law requiring permits for kosher meat. The Government had to reassure the Jewish community the suggestion was not official policy. BRITAIN There are fears that a failure to deliver the Brexit promised by the Leave campaign could fuel far-right tensions here. UKIP has made a mini-recovery in the polls off the back of its claim that PM Theresa May is “betraying” voters with her soft Brexit. Leader Gerard Batten has taken the party further to the right with anti-Muslim \u0026shyrhetoric, calling Islam a “death cult” and talking of an “explosion” of mosques in Europe.

It follows a ferocious engagement on Tuesday that saw vessels being rammed, emergency flares used as weapons, and bottles and rocks thrown. The French – who are banned by their own government from touching the mollusks between May and October – accuse the British of greedily hoovering up as many as they can.  Now Dimitri Rogoff, the President of the Normandy Regional Fisheries Committee, has stepped up the confrontation in a series of outspoken interviews with French media.  He said it was becoming more complicated to talk to the English because of Brexit , and that previous informal deals with ‘the looters’ were being ignored.  Mr Rogoff said: ‘This tension returns because we’ve not managed to find a satisfactory agreement with the British on the sharing of scallops.  We have two totally different flotillas. On one side are the small Norman boats, and on the other side, factory ships which come from Scotland freezing scallops on board.  This is about looting. We have been talking for years to try to share better, but we cannot do it currently.’ While previous agreements were reached informally, there were serious problems this year. The problem is that the scallop is not a species managed by Europe and subject to quotas,’ said Mr Rogoff. Each country does what it likes. And suddenly, some fishermen are concentrating on this species because it\u0027s easier and freer. The solution is to get along with your neighbours, but with the Brexit coming, it\u0027s more complicated to talk to the English.  Talking about the day when Britain officially leaves the EU next year, Mr Rogoff said: Ideally, on March 29, if Brexit is introduced, the English sailors will not be able to come because they will be excluded from the community waters, but it will also present other problems for our boats.  The confrontation on Tuesday was between around five UK boats and 40 French ones, just off the coast of Normandy. There are now fears that the British will return , and the French have pledged to do everything possible to stop them.

Liam and Emma Ingram needed to tighten their belts after their family grew from three to seven members in under two years. HGV driver Liam, 32, and IT engineer Emma, 34, are proud parents to Mackenzie, ten, and not one but two sets of twins, Maddison and Jaxon, who are 19 months old, and Alexa and Sienna, who are six months old.  The couple, from Caerphilly, struggled to conceive after Mackenzie was born, so when Emma got pregnant with twins twice it was a huge surprise to the couple who met on a night out 12 years ago, reports Wales Online .   Emma said: It was a massive, massive shock, but we are really lucky. All the times we wanted a second child and we ended up with four for Mackenzie. Gran Katrina also lives with the family, but with Emma\u0027s maternity leave pay about to end they needed to find a way of saving more money. Which is why they called in Alex Jones and Steph McGovern from BBC\u0027s Shop Well For Less to help out. And the money-saving duo found that is was not only the family\u0027s surprise baby boom that was costing them, it was also a desire for big name brands that was crippling their finances. Alex and Steph were surprised by the volume of expensive baby items the family had, how much was spent on football merchandise and the array of designer gear.  Steph gave the family her top tips on how they can go on holiday for less and Alex explored the childcare options Emma could consider when she decides to return to work. They also blind tested men\u0027s shavers and car seats with the family to find out whether brands are always best. By the end, they had worked out a way of saving the family up to \u0026pound7,000. Here are just some of the ways the family made savings:   Using spray and cloth instead of disposable wipes   Yearly saving: \u0026pound706.03  With a large family to look after, Emma keeps the family house very clean and uses branded disposable wipes to clean down the high chairs and worktop surfaces. But it is a costly way of cleaning. Alex and Steph worked out they were using around five to seven packs a week, nearly 22,000 wipes a year. They encouraged Emma to ditch them in favour of a good old-fashioned spray and cloth, saving more than \u0026pound700.   Second hand toys   Saving: \u0026pound82  With five children of different ages to entertain, it is no wonder the house is crammed with toys. The Shop Well for Less team found more than 600 toys and books in the house, totalling around \u0026pound10,000. As part of the experiment the television team bought a batch of second hand toys for the family to try out, and it was a complete success and saved them more than \u0026pound80 on what they would have been brand new. Emma said: They looked in almost perfect condition and it was a big saving. It is not something I had thought about before, so if you can find things like that second hand, it is amazing. I would definitely buy second hand toys in the future.   Changing buggies   Saving: \u0026pound891.21  Two sets of twins, means two sets of car seats, buggies and other baby equipment - totalling around \u0026pound5,000. It is extremely costly, but the family were shown that by not always going for the big brand names they could make big savings while not making any compromises on safety. Emma and her mum Katrina tried out a quad buggy that they were very pleased with which cost \u0026pound599, compared to one of the double buggies they had costing \u0026pound1,490.  Nappies and wipes   Yearly saving: \u0026pound956.58  The team worked out that the family use 8,000 nappies and 40,000 wipes a year. The first plan for saving money was for Emma to try reusable nappies, but she found that the amount of washing needed for two sets of twins was not practical. The second plan was to try out a cheaper supermarket brand than the one they had been using and reusable wipes. Emma was much happier with this and made savings of nearly \u0026pound1,000.

Devastated Sue Hornbuckle, 72, sold her last sofa to pay for the luxury item. And she won\u0027t be getting her money back either after the company went into administration.  The retired Co-op supermarket worker said the traumatic ordeal has left her shaken, in floods of tears, and plummeting into debt as she tries to find a replacement, Nottinghamshire Live reports.   Mrs Hornbuckle, from Beechdale, said: My spine is crumbling into the bottom of my back and I have terrible back problems. I thought the sofa I picked was really comfortable. It was just what I wanted. I have been saving months and months for it. I was just putting away bits from my pension - every Sunday night whatever I had left in my purse I would put it to one side so I had the money. I had saved so hard for it. Mrs Hornbuckle, who has three children, seven grandchildren and three great grandchildren, chose the luxury Tetrad Harris sofa and chair from House of Fraser because it was comfortable and helped ease her severe back pain. She was expecting it to arrive on her 72nd birthday but was told on August 29 the company could not honour the purchase and she would have to contact her bank. She paid for the \u0026pound3,107 item with a debit card on July 13 - but rang up the company as soon as she heard the business had fallen into administration. Parts of the business were later purchased by Mike Ashley\u0027s Sports Direct in a \u0026pound90m deal.  She claims that despite numerous calls to the company - and reassurance that it would arrive - she has now been left with no sofa and no refund. I paid my daughter and my daughter paid for it on her debit card - that was the first mistake she said. I had another sofa but I could not sit on it as it was hurting my back so sold it for \u0026pound850 and put that towards it. I have not got a lot of money and now I have got nothing left. Yesterday they said \u0027it is not being delivered and you are not having it\u0027 but I have paid for my furniture. I have been shaking. I have now had to go on finance to get some furniture and am overdrawn. I am sitting on a wooden deck chair because I do not have anything. Most of time I\u0027m having to just lie on my bed. I am devastated. Last night I went to bed and I could not sleep. I don\u0027t know what to do. I\u0027m a nervous wreck because I do not know if I am going to get my money back. She claims the sofa was brought before the takeover and therefore it is deemed as a debt that won\u0027t be paid out. I am not a debter. I am a customer, she added. They have said \u0027go to your bank, try and get the money back and then come back in and book another sofa with us\u0027. Her full-time carer Jonathan Truman, 62, said: They have given her the run-around. She wants her money back or she wants her sofa.

Many have shared their outrage at the youngster being taken to view the blood sport. But others were left wondering why Prince Harry was notably absent from the shoot - something he has been participating in from a similarly young age alongside his father and brother.  According to the  , the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were at Balmoral over the Bank Holiday weekend. So why didn\u0027t they take part in the shoot? Some are speculating that Harry\u0027s lack of participation could be down to Meghan Markle . At the end of 2017 the prince also backed out of his family\u0027s traditional Boxing Day hunt at Sandringham in Norfolk - something he\u0027s been doing since he was 12.  A source close to the family told The Sun this was because he didn\u0027t want to upset Meghan. Harry loves [hunting] and has always been out there on Boxing Day. But if it means breaking with long-standing royal traditions to avoid upsetting [Meghan], so be it. It’s fair to say that there are some pretty stunned faces around here.

The pair are also rumoured to have recently adopted a Labrador .  Some people on Twitter are hopeful Meghan\u0027s love of animals may encourage other members of the family to abandon the cruel sport. Others have simply shared their disappointment at the family\u0027s long-standing tradition. One person posted: I wish P rince Harry and Meghan every happiness, they\u0027re truly soul mates.

David and Elizabeth Emanuel , who created her stunning wedding dress, were among her favourite designers and were often tasked with coming up with new looks for the princess.  Before Diana and Charles\u0027s tour of the Gulf states in 1986, the duo were asked to come up with a series of dresses which \u0027conformed to local customs\u0027. They came up with four demure, long-sleeved outfits and a fifth \u0027reserve\u0027 outfit - a burka that would have covered Diana from head to toe with only a gap for her eyes.  It is not believed that Diana wore a burka during the trip, but the fact she was willing to consider it shows her sensitivity to other cultures. Diana\u0027s lady-in-waiting Anne Beckwith-Smith wrote to the Emanuels explaining exactly what the princess needed from their outfits. The letter, dated June 2, 1986, said: Certain special requirements concerning dress need to be observed and I am writing to ask if it would be possible to submit to The Princess of Wales a few sketches for day and evening wear from which Her Royal Highness could select items for this tour. Their Royal highnesses will be visiting Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. In all cases modesty is the order of the day.  The sketches, and fabric samples for the outfits, have now emerged for sale with US auction house RR Auctions. The collection is tipped to sell for \u0026pound24,000. . An invoice for the dresses also features in the sale revealing they cost between \u0026pound275 and \u0026pound450 each. The collection has been consigned for sale by a private collector and it is believed that this is the first time it has emerged on the market. Bobby Livingston, executive vice president of RR Auctions, said: Princess Diana tried to conform to local customs by wearing concealing clothes, but still exposed her neck and left her head uncovered.  At evening banquets, she appeared in the long sleeved demure dresses made especially for the tour. She did not have to wear the \u0027reserve outfit\u0027 burka depicted in this archive. It\u0027s a remarkable, comprehensive archive from the famously stylish royal. Diana and Charles made a whistle stop six day tour of Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia in November 1986.

One side has a perfect view of the London Eye, the other looks over trees to the Shard itself, 300 metres away. The decked terrace is dotted with ferns in terracotta pots and a herb garden, and smells of fresh paint. Properties round here rent for \u0026shythousands of pounds a month and sell for millions. But this is social cleansing in reverse – 27 new council homes in one of London’s most expensive postcodes.  Homes that mean that instead of being driven out of the capital, everyday Londoners – cab drivers, healthcare assistants, elderly and \u0026shydisabled people – can afford to keep living in the communities in which they grew up. These are the people the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan is committed to seeing remain in London through his Building Council Homes for Londoners programme which will see 10,000 council homes started in the next four years. It’s also part of a multi-million pound commitment by Southwark Council to keeping “mixed communities in high value areas”. Meeting families out on the roof terrace, Khan says: “Over the last few years we’ve seen Londoners who can’t afford housing moving out of London,” “It’s not good for our city.  We need police officers, teachers, nurses, hospital porters, all sorts of different types of people to be able to live here.” Like almost every resident I meet on the roof terrace at Marklake Court, Barbara Caley, 70, a former usher at the Old Bailey, was born in Guy’s Hospital a stone’s throw away. She had lived on the Kipling estate for 40 years but was starting to worry about the stairs at her old place when she was offered the chance to downsize to make room for a new young family. “As civil \u0026shyservants, we actually earned less than the court cleaners who were employed by the Corporation of London,” she says, “so I would never be able to afford to live here without a council flat.”  Southwark Council faced a difficult choice that could easily have led to the wrong decision. “We could have sold this land for \u0026pound12million, but instead we chose to spend \u0026pound9m to fund new homes,” says Leo Pollak, Labour cabinet member for new council homes. “We did that because we believe in the value of mixed communities in high-value areas. We don’t think people should be segregated by income.” The weekly rent for a one-bed flat here is around \u0026pound130 a week. Built on the site of some underused garages on the Kipling estate, the knock-on effect of freeing up other homes has helped around 100 families in total. David Hawkins, 56, a black cab driver, and his wife, Lezlie, 50, who works in palliative care, were also born at Guy’s and are downsizing too.  Meanwhile, Imran and Najma Farooq, with their young children Ayaan, four, and Alayna-Noorjahan, 15 months, have moved into a three-bedroom flat to get more space. Imran, a postmaster until he developed spinal problems that left him in a wheelchair, says his family was struggling in a cramped flat on the sixth floor of a tower block where the lift was often broken. Now they live in a bespoke flat with a wide corridor and adapted bathroom. “Now I have peace of mind because this block even has a fire lift,” he says. “I bring the kids on to the roof terrace and it’s all accessible, and I just think how lucky we are. “We needed more space but didn’t want to move far because of the \u0026shybrilliant community here.”  The Mayor says growing up on a council estate has made him passionate about social housing. “My dad was a bus driver who was able to live in the sort of home with his family that a bus driver today is unlikely to live in,” Khan says. “This government’s welfare policies, from the bedroom tax to the benefit cap, to attacking housing benefit and suggesting that homes costing \u0026pound450,000 are affordable, have led to a hollowing out in cities like London. “But our social mix is our strength. Different economies need different skills. We don’t want to be like Paris and other cities where the centre is only for those who are wealthy.” The Kipling estate is run by Leathermarket JMB, Southwark’s biggest tenant management organisation, which looks after 1,500 homes in the borough.

The baby, known only as \u0027Child M\u0027, is one of three of the couple\u0027s seven children to tragically die in the space of two years. A Wigan Safeguarding Children Board report reveals only four have survived longer than 16 months - and they still live with their parents. The shocking report revealed how Child M perished on the third day of the high risk family\u0027s holiday, in July 2016. It contains 11 recommendations which, if applied at the time, may have prevented the infant\u0027s potentially predictable death. The probe revealed how the parents had left three babies for six hours while they went boozing - only checking in on them occasionally. Authorities were aware mum and dad both struggled with alcohol, but early interventions were stood down as the mum refused permission for help. The tragic event unfolded during a four-day holiday, for which the parents had taken their six children to a resort just 35 miles from Wigan, Greater Manchester.  Both the mum and the dad, a violent offender released from a 30-month jail stint for robbery just before the relationship started, were known to social services. The authorities were aware of reports of potential domestic violence after the mum turned up at her nursery job with two black eyes. Staff at A\u0026ampE also reported her after she turned up drunk at the hospital when 20 weeks pregnant with her first set of twins. At the time of Child M\u0027s death, the dad was described as unsupportive and would often go off for days at a time on drinking binges. The doomed holiday included three children - all primary-school age and younger, a 13-month-old child and the 10-week-old twins. At around 10am the dad found his youngest daughter unresponsive in a baby car seat in the hotel room next to her twin sibling. Twenty minutes later the dad carried his lifeless infant down to the hotel reception where paramedics arrived after just two minutes. Paramedics noticed signs of rigor mortis, which sets in as soon as four hours after death, and the heartbreaking decision was made to discontinue resuscitation. She was pronounced dead at 11.23am. The report states: Child M\u0027s death occurred in the morning, following the second night of the family\u0027s holiday. The three youngest children were settled for the night in the attic bedroom anytime between 7pm and 7.30pm the previous evening. The twin infants were placed to sleep in their car seats which were upright on the bottom bunk bed. The parents had planned to use a sleep system which included carry cots, but this was reported to be too heavy to carry up the three sets of stairs to the attic room.  Child M\u0027s parents and their three older children then went downstairs to the hotel lounge to socialise. The parents were reported to have been checking on the three younger children every 30 minutes. Police, who later carried out a criminal investigation, were able to verify the parents had checked on their children. According to the parents, they returned to the bedroom at around 1am after drinking in the hotel bar, and Child M was fed by her mother at 2.30am. After the tragedy, blood tests were taken from the parents after police found empty cans of lager and beer bottle in the bedroom. The report revealed how the couple\u0027s both sets of twins suffered a series of health problems. Of the first set born in June 2015, one child died after three days and the other suffered from complex needs. Child M was also considered to be high risk who needed to be resuscitated at birth and weighed just 920g. She remained under the care of the Neo-Natal Outreach Team  who worked with the family to prepare for their holiday. The following review into Child M\u0027s death read: NORT members believed the children would be sleeping in \u0027carry cots\u0027. But the parents did not follow through with this original plan as they were \u0027too heavy\u0027 to carry up the three flights of stairs to the family bedroom. Describing how the family had four referrals to child social care in a 10-year period, the reviewers stated: Mother\u0027s use of alcohol was a repeated focus of concern. There was some evidence that professionals attempted to work with the parents to assess their alcohol use.

It was 1970 and the two boys are believed to be the last to be transported under the Child Migrants Programme, which began in the 1930s and was thought to have ended by 1967. Rex was sent to a care home in Tasmania and, instead of the glorious happy life he expected, he was subjected to daily beatings and put to work as a farm labourer where he suffered physical and mental torment. He says: “The whole experience ruined my life. We were treated like slaves. It was wrong and should never have happened.” He is now suing the British Government and demanding a face-to-face meeting with PM Theresa May to talk about the abuse he suffered.  Rex and his brother Kevin, who is a year younger, were in local authority care in Cornwall because their mother could not cope once their father died. They lived with foster parents, but then the couple had their own child. Rex says: “When the child was born the husband no longer wanted anything to do with us and we were back to square one and put in a children’s home. “Just after that someone from the council came to see us and gave us three choices – a pig farm, a boarding school or go to Australia. “I was only 11 and the childish excitement just built up. My brother and I said yes straight away. At that age how do you know what you are agreeing to?  “In the space of three months we were out of the country.” Rex, 59, who still has his migration papers, says he received brutal treatment at the hands of the couple who ran the care home in Tasmania. He ran away, got into trouble and had problems with drinking. He was imprisoned and when he was freed from an offenders’ institution at the age of 26, he sold all his possessions to buy a ticket back to Britain. Rex struggled with his drink problem and is haunted by the violence which plagued his life. Now sober, and with violence behind him, he finds his time in Tasmania impossible to forget. The Tasmanian government gave him \u0026pound19,000 compensation in 2005. Now he is suing the UK Government, along with more than 100 other migrant programme children.  In 2010, Labour PM Gordon Brown issued an apology, telling the Commons: “To all those former child migrants and their families – we are truly sorry. They were let down.” In March, The Independent Inquiry Into Child Sex Abuse said 2,000 survivors would receive compensation within 12 months. But the Government is yet to set up a scheme. More than 130,000 children were migrated to Australia and Zimbabwe to be adopted or brought up in children’s homes. Approximately 2,000 are still alive. Rex, who lives with wife Annie in St Columb Major, Cornwall, said: “I have never had a direct apology from the Government. There was one made to the country, but I want to sit down with Prime Minister Theresa May face to face so she can hear what we all went through.  “I am not saying she is personally to blame, but she is at the top of the government that betrayed us. The Government should face up to the people whose lives they damaged.” A confidential report written by British officials in 1956 told how officials went to Australia to look at places where children were being sent. They visited 26 homes, two-thirds of those approved by the British Government. One place was described as isolated, with “deplorable conditions”, and the boys “appeared unhappy”. Another was primitive, with managers “rigid and narrow in outlook”. Rex still wants to know why he was shipped to Australia after the practice was supposed to have been banned. He said: “I have never had an explanation of why it continued to happen until 1970. “I never really thought about this until my wife said, ‘Out of all the thousands of children, why were you the last ones sent?’ “I had never thought of it that way. There were thousands of children sent before me, and I was the last one. I have never had a definitive answer why.

John James McMenamin, aka ‘J.J’, has been given another get-out-of-jail card after breaching a suspended jail term by stealing hundreds of pounds’ worth of DVDS and Blu-Ray discs from a supermarket. He hit the headlines in January last year when he evaded police for 48 hours after being charged with driving without a licence, TeesideLive reports.  McMenamin, 32, watched the media frenzy unfold on TV as police searched high and low for him during a farcical episode in which he goaded them on Facebook and posted pictures of himself dressed as cartoon character ‘Where’s Wally’. The “talented” former jockey, who revelled in his notoriety and bragged that locals now looked upon him as Middlesbrough’s answer to Al Capone, took police for a ride by uploading videos onto social media during a huge manhunt.  He even live-streamed his arrest on the social-media platform. But he eventually handed himself in and was fined by magistrates.  After receiving a suspended jail term for a drugs offence, McMenamin was soon up to no good again when he walked out of an Asda store in Harrogate with hundreds of pounds’ worth of DVDs, Blu-Ray discs and memory cards, just a few months into the court order. He was caught on CCTV. McMenamin, who entered the store with two other males, was arrested and charged with two counts of shop theft. He pleaded guilty and appeared for sentence at York Crown Court on Wednesday. Prosecutor Nick Adlington said McMenamin, of Shinwell Crecent, South Bank, targeted the supermarket on two occasions, on February 15 and March 28, when he stole \u0026pound579 of items. The offences put him in breach of the suspended jail sentence. McMenamin had admitted the original drug charges on the basis that he was only engaged in “low-level” dealing to fund his own habit. The court heard McMenamin had used a number of aliases and birth dates during his crime sprees. He had 18 previous convictions for 30 offences.

The birth of Tranda Wecker’s sixth child in 2014 left her identical daughters heartbroken asking her “Why give us away to then have another?”. Now the girls, Kiara and Keyara, 18, show no interest in forming a relationship with their birth mother due to the hurt she has inflicted on them throughout their lives. “Tranda recently came up to attend the girls’ high school graduation in May but they knew what she was doing,” their adoptive mum told the Mirror. “She wanted that picture with them to share in their success. The success was down to the girl’s hard work, nothing less. “The girls saw through it. They have met only a handful of times. Sometimes they have refused to see her they’ve been hurt so much.”  In 2006 Wecker had vowed to regain full custody of the kids after selling them for her share of \u0026pound8,200 to Alan and Judith Kilshaw. She won access to the children in that year and was reunited with them after a judge ordered Kiara and Keyara, who now live under different names the Mirror has chosen not to reveal, to be told the truth about their mother. But today, after being tracked down for the first time 12 years, Wecker has gone on to start a new family and now has a four-year-old son The mum-of-six, however, is once again locked in a bitter battle as her third husband, Toney Miller, fights for full custody of their boy.

At one point, Wecker is alleged to have tried to cash on her infamy when she said she had been paid an advance to write a book. “I didn’t want the book to be written to protect the girls so I made her deal,” the mum explained. “Tranda didn’t want the twins to know the truth how she had given them up so I told her if she didn’t go through with the book, I wouldn’t tell them. “She didn’t go through with the book.” Only in May, the mum-of-six travelled from her home in Florida some 600 miles north to “hijack” the twin’s high school graduation ceremony but the girls were reluctant to have her near. A former close friend of Wecker told the Mirror: “The twins just knew what Tranda was trying to do. They are smart cookies. “Tranda wanted a picture between the two of them in their caps and gowns looking like she had had a hand in their upbringing but nothing could be further from the truth.

Bobbie Jillions, 34, has been inundated with requests after launching her rather unusual idea, and she hopes it will get woman talking about their private parts. She even believes it could save lives, by giving women the confidence to go for smear tests. Bobbie, from Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, said: I\u0027m hoping my casts will make people feel more confident talking about their bits and pieces. The human body shouldn\u0027t be a taboo subject. I hope this will encourage women to be more open and comfortable with their bodies. The single mum-of-two has plans to launch casting parties where friends can get together over a bottle of wine and have their bits moulded.  Her first model was nervous to have it done at first, saying she wasn\u0027t very pretty down there. Bobbie believes many women feels like this and hopes her project will show no two are the same, giving women more confidence in the bedroom and on the doctor\u0027s table. She said: I\u0027ve been very nervous about having a smear test done in the past. I hope this will show women that no matter what they look like below the waist, they are all normal. No two are the same.  It\u0027s so important women get theirs done and my work might show them everyone is different. I think it could give them more confidence in the bedroom too - much like having an Ann Summers party. I want to offer casting parties in the near future where women or men can get together with their friends and have a laugh getting their body parts cast. They\u0027ll get a delivery of their own personal sculpture instead of naughty undies.  The vagina casts were actually designed to be in a bedroom. They make a fantastic Valentine\u0027s Day or Christmas gift if people are looking for something a bit different.  I guess you could put it on the front door to keep away unwanted guests if you wanted-each to their own. I can\u0027t imagine someone would have it on their kitchen table.  I\u0027ve had loads of people enquiring. I\u0027ve also had men contacting me asking for me to cast their balls too. I\u0027ll have to wait until the kids are back at school for that. Casting Time was set up a year ago and operates from Bobbie\u0027s back room. She uses alginate to make the moulds - the same material used by dentists for teeth impressions. In the past she has created beautiful casts of babies\u0027 hand prints, dog paws and pregnancy bumps. But now she\u0027s looking beyond \u0027the gushy stuff\u0027 and has attracted a huge response from inquisitive fans. Bobbie said: Mostly people will contact me when they\u0027ve had a baby and they want to get their hand and footprints done. But I realised I wanted to start doing more diverse pieces and not just the gushy stuff. I wanted to capture people\u0027s imaginations.

Mysterious secret tunnels in Israel are now believed to be where Christ is said to have carried out his first miracle. And the new discovery could finally put an end to centuries of debate over where the act was performed. According to the Gospel of John, Jesus changed water into wine during the Wedding at Cana. For hundreds of years, pilgrims have been flocking to Kafr Kanna, a town in northern Israel, where they visit the 20th-century \u0027Wedding Church\u0027.  But the true location has long been debated - and now archaeologists believe the Cana of biblical times may be a dusty hillside five miles further north. It\u0027s the former site of Khirbet Qana, a Jewish village between the years of 323 BC and AD 324, where archaeologists have discovered a number of compelling clues. Excavations there have revealed a network of tunnels used for Christian worship, marked with crosses and references to Kyrie Iesou, a Greek phrase meaning Lord Jesus. There was also an altar and a shelf with the remains of a stone vessel, plus room for five more.  Six stone jars like this held the wine in the biblical account of the miracle. Dr Tom McCollough, who directs excavations at the site, said there were three other sites with a credible claim to being the Cana of scripture. But none has the ensemble of evidence that makes such a persuasive case for Khirbet Qana, he said. We have uncovered a large Christian veneration cave complex that was used by Christian pilgrims who came to venerate the water-to-wine miracle. This complex was used beginning in the late fifth or early sixth century and continued to be used by pilgrims into the 12th-century Crusader period.  The pilgrim texts we have from this period that describe what pilgrims did and saw when they came to Cana of Galilee match very closely what we have exposed as the veneration complex. As part of his evidence, Dr McCollough points to the work of first-century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus. He said: His references to Cana align geographically with the location of Khirbet Qana and align logically with his movements. The reference to Cana in Josephus, the New Testament and in the rabbinic texts would argue the village was a Jewish village, near the Sea of Galilee and in the region of lower Galilee. Khirbet Qana fulfills all of these criteria.  As for the better-known site at Kafr Kanna, Dr McCollough is sceptical. When tourists visiting Israel today are taken to Cana, they are taken to Kafr Kanna, he said. However, this site was not recognized as a pilgrimage site for those seeking Cana until the 1700s. At this point the Franciscans were managing Christian pilgrimage and facilitating easy passage rather than historical accuracy. Dr McCollough believes the discoveries at Khirbet Qana could even bolster the case for the historicity of the Gospel of John.

worse as winter approaches and people are forced to choose between food and heating.”Mr Linton said that since the start of the year, the foodbank had distributed 5,230 food parcels, 1,500 of them to

a huge difference to our supplies in the short term.“It would also start off our stocks for the winter.“We want to be able to provide a healthy and balanced stock of food and we rely on the generosity

united are showing positive signs","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStriker Craig Curran admits if he’s learned one new thing since joining Dundee United, unfortunately it is what a real dead leg is like.The man who got his first Tangerines goal in the impressive weekend victory over likely promotion rivals Partick Thistle admits he’s still feeling the “charley horse” he picked up in the final pre-season friendly almost a month-and-a-half ago.And that left him frustrated and, quite literally, out in the cold.“Now I do know what a proper dead leg is. I’ve had them before and I think they cleared in a couple of days but this one blew up double the size,” said the Liverpudlian.“I was living on the ice machine for weeks but it just wouldn’t come down. It was purely a time thing and I just had to wait. It’s still not fully healed, that’s how bad it was.“It was tough to have played all the pre-season friendlies and then get hurt in the last one. It was tough to take but it’s a long season so there will, hopefully, be plenty games for me.“Because of my injury I missed all the Betfred Cup games. That was a few competitive games, which was frustrating because I did all the work and was ready to go in them, then got the dead leg.“It was hard watching but it’s nice to be back and that was, near enough, my first full 90 minutes against Thistle so that was good.”He suffered the injury in an accidental collision in a friendly against Cowdenbeath just days before the cup action kicked off.A few other players also suffered problems around that time and it did not help the gelling process for Csaba Laszlo’s new-look squad.Curran believes that contributed to the teething problems in the opening weeks of the season but believes wins in the last two league outings have shown United are on the right path.Saturday’s 3-1 Tannadice success over the Jags was an impressive win and he reckons the team will only continue to improve in the coming weeks and months. He added: “I think it was another marker down in the league, against the side that came down with Ross County, to show where we’re at.“We obviously didn’t get off to a great start against Dunfermline in the league but you’ve seen how well we’ve bounced with two big wins in those last two games.“That’s massively important, especially at home. With the crowd and support we get it is important that we put performances on for them and get wins like this one.“I thought we controlled the game against Thistle but, look, we’re still improving and everyone has to understand that.“There are so many new players. If you look at the starting line-up on Saturday, most of them were new, apart from a couple of the boys. The fans probably still don’t know all our names there’s been so many of us coming in!“It’s important that we keep winning while we’re improving. We’ll take any win in the league, 1-0 or 4-0, but it was nice to play well against Thistle and it was good to get some goals. Everyone is gelling well and it is a good dressing-room here.”Saturday saw another recent injury victim, full-back Callum Booth, make a brief appearance near the end.With him and others returning, Curran feels the improvement will only accelerate.“It’s been some important players who have been missing. Boothy’s back now and we are still waiting on Fraser Fyvie – he is going to be a very big player for us.“Like I say, I’ve missed a large portion of the work myself and, although I’m playing again, I am still catching up with fitness and things.“The boys are heading in the right direction and we are looking for a full squad to go and get promoted.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b87bb1f3781e-870x564.jpg ","title":"scotrail set to make improvements for 11 rail stations across local area","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlans to refurbish several train stations across Tayside – including improvements to waiting rooms and toilets – have been announced by ScotRail.The firm is seeking bidders to take on the work of enhancing 11 stations, including Broughty Ferry, Monifeth, Carnoustie, Arbroath and Montrose.According to ScotRail’s expression of interest notice, work will y from station to station but will include installing new waiting rooms, shelters and airport-style ‘zoeftig’ seating.Other stations will have their waiting rooms refurbished, with new furniture and improved toilet facilities.New single and double-deck cycle racks will also be installed, while ducting and bases for new electrical equipment such as CCTV and ticket machines will also be required.The successful bidder is expected to complete the work by January 2019.The other six stations in the project brief are Gleneagles, Invergowrie, Laurencekirk, Portlethen, Stonehaven and Inverurie.Last month the ScotRail Alliance – a working partnership between Scotrail and Network Rail Scotland Route – opened Dundee’s new £38m five-storey railway station, complete with Sleeperz Hotel and retail units.Broughty Ferry station has also recently undergone some improvement works, carried out by Network Rail, where a section of the platform was raised to accommodate modern trains and lessen the gap between the platform and train for wheelchair users.A ScotRail spokeswoman said: “The investment we are making – the recently completed upgrade of Dundee station, the InterCity trains connecting Scotland’s seven cities, and the coming improvements – demonstrate our commitment to the communities we serve.“We are building the best railway that Scotland has ever had – and that applies to all of Scotland.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"visitors shocked to see dundee beauty spot now like a swamp","story":"\t\t\t\t\tVisitors to a beauty spot in Dundee have said the area now resembles a “swamp”.Recent visitors to the Den o’ Mains, in Caird Park, were left “shocked” this week when they walked around the area near to Mains Castle.Fallen trees and green water were telltale signs that the area has been “let go”.Gary Robertson said the area would now need a “major excavation” to bring it back to its former glory.Gary, 51, from Fintry, said James Caird – who donated the park to the city – would be “disappointed” to see its current state.He had gone to see the King Robert The Bruce Penguin with his grandson in the grounds of Mains Castle.He said: “I hadn’t been around the Den o’ Mains ponds in years.“I’d taken my grandson up to visit the penguin.“We decided to walk up to the spot which had been so popular when I was a kid.“I was shocked at the state of the area.”Visitors used to be able to see minnows, a fresh water fish, in the ponds in years gone by.Gary added: “You’d struggle to see anything in that water at the moment.

It changes the dynamic in the market hall. It\u0027 a great unit with fantastic windows and great visibility.The idea is to charge \u0026pound20 per hour for use of the premises.If the initiative is approved by the council\u0027 city committee, Mrs Murray promised the unit would be redecorated before it is let.Meanwhile, the market could be renamed Old Town Arcade Inverness in a major rebranding exercise.The proposal has emerged after talks between interested parties and council, which has employed consultant Tristram Woolston Design of Cannich to look at the marketing of the landmark, which has often been a focal point for city visitors from home and abroad.Mrs Murray said further talks will be held before it goes to Highland councillors for consideration.\u0026ldquoThe consultant has identified problems with the existing name, in that the building and its environment doesn\u0026rsquot strongly present Victorian qualities and it\u0027 not a \u0026lsquomarket\u0026rsquo as such, but has permanent enclosed retail units rather than changeable stalls, she said.\u0026ldquoThe vision for this historic building after refurbishment is to provide a high-quality destination with a mix of unique Highland brands and products, a place to eat and drink, and a venue for events and entertainment.\u0026ldquoOther similar destinations in the UK and abroad call themselves arcades and hence the proposed new name is Old Town Arcade Inverness.Those involved will discuss the new image for the facility in September.Inverness economist Tony Mackay said it might be better to focus on other matters.\u0026ldquoTo be honest I\u0026rsquom not sure what sort of impact changing the name will have, he said.\u0026ldquoThere needs to be improvements at the market, there are a few empty premises in the centre. It\u0027 gone downhill due to lack of investments and the decline in people shopping in the city centre.\u0026ldquoWe need to move away from the traditional shopping idea, more social activities and more attractions are what is needed.

Whether that was for the first team, boosting sport science or towards the youth development academy.“You see what we have been able to achieve with bringing the likes of James Wilson to Aberdeen in the last couple of weeks.“It is money from DNA that has gone towards that player and bringing him to Aberdeen.“James has only had a couple of minutes on the pitch against Hibs at the weekend but I think we will start to see the fruits of his labour and the efforts of DNA in the fixtures ahead.”Aberdeen chairman Stewart Milne revealed in July that AberDNA had already raised £600,000 for the first team which will be used over the course of the next 12 months.Asked if there was still DNA money to secure further signings Wicks said: “Very much so.“But it is important for people to realise that the DNA scheme is subscription based so all that money is not sitting with the club in a bank account earning interest every day.“It is subscription-based income that comes in on a monthly basis so we have to be conscious of that as things develop. We are delighted with how the scheme has rolled out and how it has been received.”Aberdeen have secured seven signings in the summer with McInnes set to add to that tally before the window shuts tomorrow.During the summer window the Reds also rejected a £3.5m bid from Celtic for Scotland international defender Scott McKenna. Did the funds generated by AberDNA put the Reds in a stronger financial position where they could knock back Celtic’s overtures?Wicks said: “To some extent.“We know Scott’s worth, we have a value in our mind.“He has demonstrated in the way he has played not only for Aberdeen but also captaining Scotland that he has an enormously bright future.“I would say it is less about DNA but more about Scott’s ability and value.“Right now he is not a player who is for sale.“The DNA funding is more there to enable us to attract players who can strengthen the squad rather than be a pot at the end of the rainbow that we can keep in reserve and knock back the likes of Celtic and anyone else who comes knocking at our door for the time being.“But we think Scott has an enormously bright future and would like to think he would be at the club for some time.”AberDNA was launched this summer with four packages that come with ious benefits – Premium , Standard , International  and Under-12 .Hearts run a similar scheme. Foundation of Hearts has more than 8,000 members and has raised more than £6.5m.Hibs Supporters’ Limited has contributed £525,000 to the football budget.Wicks said: “The manager has said how much he values the support of the fans and what they have done to secure those funds for him to use.“We look to build on that.“This is not a membership programme that is going to come and go.“It is going to grow and build.“We have only scratched the surface of number of members, particularly from an international perspective.

This is our annual survey.“But the most recent information showed we had vacancies running at about 1 to 1.5% in Scottish education.“So clearly where we have vacancies it is unacceptable but it is at a very, very low level compared to many of our international peers.“Obviously there’s a whole range of different measures being taken to expand the pool of teachers available.“We’ve expanded recruitment into initial teacher education, we’ve created nearly a dozen new routes to make it more practical and flexible for individuals to gain access and indeed one of those routes is very focused on the north-east of Scotland through the partnerships that exist in that respect.“I’m very focused on trying to identify how we can secure the additional teachers into the teaching profession and to

The Aberdonian secured his first game time for his country in the 2-0 friendly loss to Peru in Lima.Shinnie did enough to earn a start in a 1-0 friendly loss to World Cup-bound Mexico in front of 71,000 fans at the legendary Stadio Azteca in Mexico City.Now he is determined to make the most of this opportunity to add to his caps tally against one of the world’s top sides.He said: “I waited my time to try to get that chance.“It came in the summer when I was away to Mexico and Peru.“I was delighted to keep my place as it gives me the opportunity to try to impress again.“In intentional football you come up against top players and top teams.“You are going to learn so much from it and just being there  and involved will be so helpful for me.“Hopefully I can get another cap or two under my belt. But just being there and seeing these teams will help me.“I am getting older but am still learning all the time so it is something I am looking forward to.”Shinnie is the only Dons player named in McLeish’s squad as centre-back Scott McKenna is ruled out with a hamstring tear.Dons defender McKenna, subject of a rejected £3.5 million bid from Celtic recently, captained the Scots in the defeat to Mexico and would surely have been in McLeish’s squad if fit.Shinnie said: “Mexico and Peru are experiences I will never forget and games I really enjoyed.“I felt I did well in the games.“I tried to work as hard as I possibly could and was eager to try to get those first two caps under my belt.“I was eager to try to impress and try to give him  that question every time a squad came up. I didn’t want it to be a one-off so I am delighted to be back in the squad.”Before Shinnie meets up with the Scotland squad he will lead Aberdeen out in the Premiership against Kilmarnock at Pittodrie on Saturday.The Dons remain unbeaten in the first four domestic games but there was a lingering disappointment at conceding a late goal at Hibs to draw 1-1. Shinnie wants to travel to the Scotland camp with the momentum of a league victory.He said: “You enjoy the international break a little better if you go in with a win.“We want to be putting points on the board and winning as many games as we can at this stage of the season.“When it goes into the 86th minute and you are minutes away from a good result, to lose a goal in that manner was frustrating.“It was the first time Hibs got in behind us with the ball across and the guy was standing on his own to tap it in.“If we had come away with a 1-0 win it would have been a great result down in Edinburgh.“It is a draw, we take it and we move on and look forward to Kilmarnock.”The Dons beat Kilmarnock three times in the league, drew one and also knocked them out of the Scottish Cup on penalties.Shinnie said: “We were Kilmarnock’s bogey team last season and the one they couldn’t beat so they will come up determined to change that.“It is up to us to combat that and get back to winning ways. We need to build from a clean sheet because we know we have players up front who can score.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 31","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 03/08/18, 1:40 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Well done to young Ella Pollock for recognising that she can make a difference.Something as simple as baking cakes can be all it takes to make another\u0026#8217s life a little better.

It strikes me this sort of selfish attitude is something that may also be contributing to the growing problem of drivers throwing rubbish out their windows on Argyll\u0026#8217s road network.If you can\u0026#8217t find a public toilet, at least find a tree to hide behind when you\u0026#8217re caught short \u0026#8211 and a bin to chuck your rubbish in.Name and address supplied.Sir,At Royal Mail we never forget that we form an essential part of the UK’s social fabric.We know our postmen and postwomen are valued members of the local community as they deliver letters and parcels six days a week \u0026#8211 in all weathers.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

All members of the 19th Argyll were successful and, as far as we are aware, it was the only unit to achieve this feat.Two of the team, Martha Payne and Polly Payne, have secured places at the World Scout Jamboree, a three-week adventure at the Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve in West Virginia, USA.

But Alfie Briggs does plan to downsize the long-established business. Mr Briggs, 74, wants to change part of the arcade, to create a town house. And he has been granted planning consent by South Ayrshire Council. Mr Briggs says he will transform the smaller part of the arcade - next to the Harbour Bar pub - back into a house. But the larger, deeper part of the business will remain an amusement arcade. However, Mr Briggs also has consent to create a house there, should it ever be required. He said: “I was advised to do it  this way. But I’m definitely not closing the arcade.” He added: “I won’t be around forever, and maybe my children will decide it should go back to a house. “But I know I won’t do it.” Mr Briggs, who lives in Ayr, has owned Mayfair Amusements since 1984. The business was created in 1962 by the late Edwin Lawrence, a former travelling showman. He had bought the two-storey house next to the Harbour Bar pub, and converted the downstairs front into a small amusement arcade. This had originally been John Carson’s fish shop. The arcade was greatly expanded around 1970, after the acquistion of a house at No 29 Knockcushan Street. The arcade, which included a prize bingo and a shop, was run successfully by Mr Lawrence and his family, until bought by Mr Briggs. The new owner kept the name ‘Mayfair Amusements’ which was a tribute to Mr Lawrence’s wife May, as well as an affluent part of London. Alfie Briggs recalls: “There was more business for everyone back in the days when there was about five amusement arcades in Girvan. “Takings have certainly gone down, but we’re still getting by. “This conversion will allow me to rent out a house and a flat, instead of just a flat.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilGirvanAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr united fans under starters","story":"NewsAyr United fans under starter\u0027s orders for Somerset Park charity racenight in aid of Ian McCall\u0027s player fundInternet supporters\u0027 team KaisAyr is staging the bash this Saturday night in United\u0027s Hospitality Suite.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson10:56, 23 AUG 2018NewsAyr\u0027s Craig McGuffie and Alan Forrest go for a ride with mascot Pandamonium \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThey’re under starter’s orders for a top night of action at Somerset Park this Saturday.

The ailing Kyle Centre is to lodge plans for a round the clock fitness facility. Retail chiefs want to rival Heathfield’s bid for a similar project on the outskirts of town. Both are now set to go before South Ayrshire Council in a battle for planning permission. Kyle Centre boss, Fiona Paton, said: “Lifestyles and work patterns are changing and we believe there is demand for this. “There is no escaping that we, as a centre, need to evolve and we’ve had to adapt our business model since I came here 10 years ago. “Opening a gym is part of that direction of travel and can help sustain the centre moving forward.” Energie Fitness has agreed a deal to open an 8000sq foot unit within the barren centre. And bosses claim their stalling dream to open a cinema is far from dead.  Negotiations, understood to be with screen giant Odeon, have so far failed to bear fruit.

collaborations between Scottish and Barbadian or \u0026ldquoBajan culture.\nMusicians, dancers, drummers and pipers all come together for a fun-filled weekend, accompanied by top chefs, serving up much loved Scottish meals with a distinct Bajan twist.\nThe now popular festival had humble beginnings in the 1990s when a Welsh men\u0026rsquos choir travelled to the island to perform in a local concert hall.\nSince then, the celebration has expanded and has featured Celtic acts from Canada, across the UK, Ireland, the USA and even Australia.\nFestival director Carol Anderson from Edinburgh

dogs \u0026ndash but gave just six advisory notices and five dog control orders to irresponsible owners.\nHowever, following a meeting with Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale MSP Christine Grahame, the council has revealed it has handed out 15 dog control notices over the last 12 months, with two still pending.\nMs Grahame, who introduced the Control of Dogs  Act 2010 as a member\u0026rsquos bill, said: \u0026ldquoI had a very useful discussion with the representatives from Scottish Borders Council and it was important to hear first-hand how this legislation is being used in practice.\n\u0026ldquoIn the last year there have been 15 dog control notices with two pending, although there are some issues with obtaining owner details. Some owners just need to be spoken to and advised of their responsibilities.\nDog control orders allow Scottish Borders Council to impose certain conditions on dog owners. For example, a dog which frequently runs away may be required to be kept on a lead at all times, or an aggressive dog may have to be muzzled when in public spaces.\nThe control orders can also be used to compel dog owners to seek training for themselves and their pet. Failure to adhere to a dog control order could lead to a ban from keeping animals or the dog being put down.\nA Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe council is currently reviewing its responsible dog ownership strategy, which will aim to remind owners of their social and legal responsibilities.\n\u0026ldquoAs part of this strategy, the council works in partnership with local and national charities to promote responsible ownership and dog control by educating the public at ious events across the Borders.\n\u0026ldquoThe council responds to all complaints received concerning out of control dogs, but in order to assist us in investigating each complaint fully, we ideally require the dog owner\u0026rsquos details.\n\u0026ldquoMembers of the public can contact 0300 100 1800 or visit www.scotborders.gov.uk if they have a concern about a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour.\nMs Grahame added: \u0026ldquoMy main concern is that members of the public may not be aware that if a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour is causing concern, for example being allowed to be out of control, they can report it to the council through this route.\n\u0026ldquoThe police, of course, deal with the most serious incidents.

It was nailed to the stretcher rather than the modern method of stapling. At some stage a further bar of yellowed wood had to added to keep the canvas taut.Further internet research revealed a painter known as H Shapiro, who was born in 1933. Helen was born in 1946.Unfortunately for those hoping for a massive price tag, the H stands iously for Hermon or Herman.A painting with a similar style, titled Loch Long, appeared recently on eBay and was described as: ‘Oil on canvas, possibly an early work by the artist Herman  Shapiro.‘It is hand signed, lower right, with “H. Shapiro” and dated ‘52 .’A large collection of Mr Shapiro’s other work, mainly of life studies of a distinctly different style is for sale with a gallery, named Hatfield Hines in Norwich.One of the partners at the gallery said they had bought the paintings. Despite having much biographical detail the partner claimed they had no way of contacting Mr Shapiro.That gallery states that Mr Shapiro was born in London and is settled in Scotland, which fits Clachan’s picture.He studied at Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts from 1949-54 where he was apparently influenced by Bloch, Minton and Vaughan and was associated with the acclaimed Camberwell Group.By the mid 1950s he had started teaching in South Wales schools and went on to lecture at Cardiff College of Art.His paintings and sculpture are mostly based on the female figure, more recently in a domestic environment. He also enjoys the open, figureless, landscape.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"from our facebook beautiful and impressive sunflowers","story":"Below are some of their comments.Jane Wykes, from Dunoon, said: \u0026#8216Loved this on our arrival.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do? Are they determined to strip Prestonpans of everything?  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe changes being made differ from those proposed in 2016. Housing enquiries will continue to be dealt with at Aldhammer House, while payments for other services can be made at the library. This will in turn improve the range of services available at our improved library \u0026ndash and we are grateful for the positive feedback we have received on this from customers so far.  Tim Porteus, Prestonpans storyteller and Courier columnist, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom disappointed. I recognise the council is under pressure to make cuts but they should say that it what is about: saving money."},{"url":null,"title":"merger-of-prestonpans-schools-proposed","story":"  East Lothian Council launches a public consultation exercise on Monday where members of the public are asked for their thoughts on the potential move.  If approved, the merger would follow the expected merger of Haddington Infant School and King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, which have Jacqui McKinnon, headteacher at Cockenzie Primary School, as interim headteacher until their formal merger goes ahead.  According to the Prestonpans proposal, the two schools would \u0026lsquoclose\u0026rsquo in February \u0026ldquoor as soon as possible thereafter, with a new non-denominational primary school then created. The town\u0026rsquos St Gabriel\u0026rsquos Primary School would be unaffected.  The merged school would continue to operate over the two sites within the existing buildings and facilities, but with a single management team.  Currently, Prestonpans Infant and Nursery School, on West Loan, has a school roll of 358 up to P3, with the primary school, on Preston Road, home to 332 pupils from P4 to P7.  The leadership of Prestonpans Early Learning and Childcare Centre, which opened last year on Kirk Street to provide additional nursery places for the town, would also transfer to the headteacher of the new single school structure if the move goes ahead.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, was surprised to hear the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoFirstly, I would like to see the details of it and what is behind the proposals because the infant school is a superbly-run school and works exceptionally well.  \u0026ldquoThe primary school is a very well-run and successful school as well \u0026ndash we have got two very well-run and successful schools.  \u0026ldquoWe would need to look at what the implications are.  Fiona Robertson, East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos head of education, stressed the local authority was \u0026ldquoabsolutely committed to continuously improving the quality of education at the two schools.  She said: \u0026ldquoOur Education Service Local Improvement Plan sets out a range of key outcomes, one of which is to ensure consistency in our approaches to planning learning, teaching and assessment.  \u0026ldquoWe believe that the proposal to establish a single school operating under a single management team offers the best solution to ensuring this consistency, improving transitions for children, and will deliver considerable educational benefits to all of the schools\u0026rsquo children and young people.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet member for education and children\u0026rsquos services, said: \u0026ldquoOur first priority is to ensure that we provide the best educational experiences and outcomes for the children and young people of Prestonpans. The consultation process will focus on how we do this through an educational benefit statement.  \u0026ldquoWe have already informed the chairs of the parent councils of this proposal.  \u0026ldquoAll parents, carers and the wider school community will have the opportunity to comment on the proposal once the consultation has been published and the statutory consultation period begins on Monday.  The consultation runs to October 2, with drop-in sessions held at both schools next month.  Prestonpans Infant School hosts a consultation event on September 4 from noon to 5pm, with the primary school event taking place a week later between the same times.  Finally, a public meeting takes place on September 26 from 7pm at Preston Lodge High School.

Among the East Lothian pubs to have permanently closed during this period are the Elphinstone Arms in Elphinstone The Hub in Tranent the Bay Horse in Haddington and The Hayweights, Burgh and Mrs Forman\u0026rsquos in Musselburgh.  The figures from the Office for National Statistics  show that in 2010 there were about 55 pubs and bars in East Lothian but by 2017 that had fallen to about 45.  Michael Peters, who is behind The New Pheasant in Haddington \u0026ndash which opened this week at the site of the former Pheasant, which shut in 2009 \u0026ndash was not surprised by the figures.  He said that there were a iety of reasons for the decline in the number of pubs, including the lowering of the drink-drive limit in Scotland in 2014, issues with breweries, and the state of the economy.  Mr Peters felt that there was a real need for pubs in towns and villages and said: \u0026ldquoI am not biased but every town needs a pub.  \u0026ldquoIt is not just for drinking but socialising and the community \u0026ndash nothing would be happening. Most things that happen \u0026ndash golf trips, football, anything like that \u0026ndash it is organised when you are in the pub.  \u0026ldquoWhere do most people socialise?  Across the UK, 5,745 pubs closed over the same period, and there are 54 local authorities across the country where 30 or more shut.  Pubs have been pointing the finger of blame at the taxman for their troubles, complaining about the duty on beer, VAT levels and the cost of business rates.  Britain\u0026rsquos Beer Alliance, a group of organisations in the pub and brewing sector, has started a campaign called Long Live the Local with a petition and calls for people to write to their MP to have beer duty reduced.  The latest data from the ONS shows that between 2016 and 2017, 655 pubs and bars across the UK called time for the last time.  In East Lothian there was a slight upturn in that period, with numbers up by about five.  A change in consumer habits, with people drinking at home more often, has been blamed for fewer people visiting pubs.  There are 21 areas of the country that have bucked the decline and have more pubs now than they had in 2010. Top of the list is Hackney in East London, which had 55 more bars in 2017 than it did in 2010."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-mermaids-magic-storm","story":"  AFTER our return from a final camping trip in the midges and mist, my youngest daughter started school. She needed an early-morning shower to remove the lingering smell of wood smoke in her hair this morning before getting ready.  She protested a bit, as she said she liked the smell of wood smoke because it reminded her of camping in the Highlands. But soon she was all excited to be dressed up, smart and clean for school. She is attending Prestonpans Infant School, as her big sister did before her, and as I did when it was the primary school.  She looked so smart and business-like as she walked into class with a beaming smile. We shared this moment with many other parents, who were taking the same photos and shedding similar tears. Only the day before, Skye had climbed the side of a mountain in Glencoe as if she had once been a mountain goat and proclaimed she wanted to live by a waterfall.  Now, all dressed to conform , she has entered a formal system which in my day did its best to  beat out any original creativity that didn\u0026rsquot fit in with teachers\u0026rsquo expectations.  But as our daughter walked through the same doors I had once gone through, I was uplifted by a hopeful expectation that when we come to pick her up she will be less smart, less clean and her hair even wilder. That\u0026rsquos what school should be like for a wee girl not yet reached five. And I know she is in good hands in that respect at Prestonpans Infants.  But as I kissed her goodbye this morning, she asked: \u0026ldquoCan we have tea by a campfire in the woods? The campfire had been the communal focus during our camping trip. As darkness fell, the spirit of the fire glowed brighter and danced with our imaginations as we told stories and riddles with each other. I of course agreed, but her comment helped me think of which tale to tell this week.  Much of our summer has been spent exploring the wonders of East Lothian. We explored beaches and caves. We climbed hills and moors. We swam and paddled in rivers, climbed trees and sat under them having picnics.  But wherever we went there was one thing that we always saw, even in quite remote places: litter. Sometimes there was more, sometimes there was less, but we couldn\u0026rsquot escape it. My children notice it I suppose because I mention it. Our children pick up other people\u0026rsquos litter as we walk, so we now need an extra rucksack to carry it.  \u0026ldquoWhy do people do this? asked my nine-year-old after she had watched a family sitting in a car in a car park by a beach. They had been eating sandwiches and drinking juice, and then threw all the packaging out of the windows. The plastic juice bottles rolled about in the breeze and the sandwich packaging blew away and got caught in some sea buckthorn bushes nearby. The family then drove away, no doubt having had a nice day at the beach, but leaving their rubbish for others to enjoy.  I make no apologies for sounding angry at this. And I do not blame the children, it\u0026rsquos the adults who frame this behaviour. I understand people want to keep their cars tidy but I couldn\u0026rsquot answer my daughter\u0026rsquos question as we sat watching someone else\u0026rsquos rubbish desecrate a beauty spot. I just can\u0026rsquot understand the mindset. So all I said was: \u0026ldquoWell they just don\u0026rsquot know any better I suppose, or maybe just don\u0026rsquot care.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos so sad, she replied, then went very quiet. Then she came up with an answer to the problem: a story:  \u0026lsquoThe king of the sea told all the mermaids not to go close to the shore because of the dangerous litter that humans pollute it with. One mermaid asked what litter was and the king replied it was many things, such as broken glass and plastic which kills sea creatures, as well as making the place humans live look ugly.  \u0026ldquoWhy do they do this? asked the mermaid. The king shrugged his shoulders, and said: \u0026ldquoThey must be less clever than the animals they kill.  But one day the mermaid disobeyed her king and swam to the shore close to the beach at North Berwick. But her tail was cut by broken glass and then she got caught in plastic bags floating on the surface. She was in trouble and a fisherman saw her.  He helped her remove the bags and gave her cream for her cut tail.  \u0026ldquoWhy do you people do this? she asked him. He felt ashamed because he also would throw litter. He promised her he would never do it again. But there was so much rubbish in the sea that they agreed they would try and collect it.  So the mermaid gathered her friends and collected the rubbish. The fisherman\u0026rsquos boat was soon so full that it nearly sank, and when he returned to the harbour people saw the mountain of rubbish he had caught. They laughed at him, thinking he was not a good fisherman because all he had caught was litter and rubbish.  \u0026ldquoLook, said the fisherman, \u0026ldquothis is what we are doing to the sea and the land. Why do we do this? But nobody cared.  \u0026ldquoThis is impossible, we can\u0026rsquot collect all of it, said the mermaid, \u0026ldquoand every day the wind blows more into the sea.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos hopeless, people will never change, said the fisherman. But the mermaid was angry: \u0026ldquoThey must change or else we will all die, including them too eventually.  Mermaids have powers to control the wind. They can whip up storms and so she decided she would make a very unusual, magic storm.  The wind blew not everywhere but where the litter lay. It blew all the rubbish thrown by the humans back into their houses and cars. People woke up with broken glass in their beds and plastic bags covering their children. Their homes were piled high with dangerous and ugly rubbish. When they tried to get rid of it, it just blew back in.  The countryside and sea became wonderfully litter free because of this magic storm, and when people littered the storm whipped up again and blew it straight into their house or car. They couldn\u0026rsquot escape from it. People were living knee-deep in the rubbish they had thrown out of windows or not recycled.  So soon they stopped littering because now they understood what it meant for the other creatures. Finally they cared, because they were the ones who suffered most. At last they got the wisdom of the animals.\u0026rsquo  This story, I think, would make the perfect start to any school day."},{"url":null,"title":"new-world-record-set-at-haddington-rugby-club","story":"  A total of 458 men, women and children took to the pitch at Neilson Park on Sunday as part of the Haddington 700 celebrations.

He said: \u0026ldquoThe day was a fantastic occasion despite the worst day of weather all summer, and we were delighted by the huge effort and support from the club and the rugby and local communities in getting past the record.  \u0026ldquoAs a celebration of the town\u0026rsquos 700 years of the Royal Charter it was a great success, with the match kicked off by Provost John McMillan, and great support from the town, with particular thanks to the boys\u0026rsquo football team who arrived late on, like the cavalry, to help get us over the line.  \u0026ldquoMore than that, though, it was brilliant to see players [aged] from five to 73 enjoying our great game, with several cases of three generations from the same family playing at the same time, including one connected family group of 18.  \u0026ldquoThis is the power of rugby. We look forward to seeing many of our record-breakers back at the club in the near future.  \u0026ldquoWe would also like to thank the Royal Bank of Scotland, sponsors of RugbyForce day of which we were one of two top prize winners, without whose support the event would not have been possible \u0026ndash in particular their many staff, including a good number from the local branch who helped massively on the day.  The match between Haddington President\u0026rsquos XV and Haddington Barbarians XV was kicked off by Provost John McMillan.  The councillor, who previously played for Murrayfield 3rds, said: \u0026ldquoIt was a real honour. I have not played rugby for well over 40 years and it was an amazing day, with a great turnout.  \u0026ldquoIt was very well-organised, despite the horrific weather. It was a great community thing and I was impressed how many people were there \u0026ndash men, women and children of all ages.  \u0026ldquoIt was a great tribute to the club but also the community.

Haddington RFC will also use the prize money to contribute towards a recruitment drive to increase playing numbers at all levels and fund community engagement projects.  Haddington RFC\u0026rsquos charity partner Wooden Spoon were also in attendance on the day.  Mr Wallace, who took part in the early stages of the mammoth six-hour match, thanked current Scotland internationalists Stuart McInally, Willem Nel and Sarah Law while there was also an appearance from ex-Lions and Scotland forward Finlay Calder, who grew up in Haddington.

Ms Cook, who lives in the county, previously worked in Edinburgh at a number of schools, including Drummond Community High School, Leith Academy and Tynecastle Academy.  The teacher, who has a background in physical education, started on Monday.  Two in-service days gave her the chance to meet the staff before pupils arrived.

It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.

Mother Nature has been kind and the pipe is, by and large, under sand once again \u0026ndash though there are concerns it is likely to be exposed again in future if a permanent solution is not found.  As well as being an eyesore at a popular tourist spot, sand and rocks collect around the pipe and are then blasted by the tide at the sea wall, causing it damage.  The town\u0026rsquos community council has long voiced concerns over the issue and claims houses overlooking the iconic West Beach are \u0026ldquoin danger.  North Berwick Community Council  contacted Scottish Water over the issue and the company\u0026rsquos response was read out at a NBCC meeting last week.  A letter from Brian Lironi, director of corporate affairs, said: \u0026ldquoWe are not able to re-lay this section of pipe. However, following an inspection of it, we plan to carry out some work on the casing around the laterals and raised manhole columns.  \u0026ldquoThis work will take place outside of the bathing season when the laterals are more exposed and the beach is less busy. This should help to improve the aesthetic of the pipe.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoOn the point of erosion, we do not believe our pipe is to blame for this. With that said, I am asking for this to be looked at in more detail as it is important that we take an evidence-led approach. This will not happen during the bathing season.  Mr Lironi said the community council would be kept informed of any developments.  Spring 2018 was not the first time that severe weather saw the sewage pipe badly exposed. The pipe was clearly visible in the aftermath of storms in December 2010 and it took many, many months before the tides re-covered it with sand."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  HADDINGTON...

Plans lodged with East Lothian Council are split into two.  The design and access statement states: \u0026ldquoThe brief is twofold: to diversify the core business on the site with the introduction of small-scale gin and whisky distillation to enable the production of speciality spirits for sale within the business pub chain.  \u0026ldquoSecondly, in light of the increasing demand for both brewery tours and the use of the Monk\u0026rsquos Retreat as a function venue, it is felt that the facilities require being upgraded, both in terms of general amenity, improving the visitor experience and to provide for the disabled visitor with the addition of a platform lift and accessible toilet.  A spokeswoman for owners Greene King explained why they were looking to diversify at the site, on Belhaven\u0026rsquos Brewery Lane.  She said: \u0026ldquoLike any business we are always exploring options to develop our business and facilities. The recent planning application is just one of many opportunities we are considering but no decision has been made yet about whether it is an option we will pursue if planning permission is granted.  In terms of the production of gin and whisky, a still house would be created.  According to the design and access statement: \u0026ldquoThe distillery will be designed to produce 250 litres of spirit a day. It will be unique in the marketplace, making spirit from the same wurt as the beer.  \u0026ldquoThe spirit will be a mixture of Scotch whisky, gin and rum.  \u0026ldquoThis volume and complexity will mean that the brewery will need to employ an additional person to run the distillery.  \u0026ldquoIn time the site would like to re-instate a historical greenhouse within the gardens in order to grow their own botanicals to add to the gin however, this will be part of a separate application.  The new still house would mirror the mash house, which was given planning permission in January 2011, in terms of its look.  It is two storeys, with a more modern design than some of the historic buildings on-site.  If the plans were given the green light, work would also be carried out at the main building on the Belhaven site.  A museum is already in place on the ground floor of the main building, with a pub on the first floor.  Plans show a refurbishment of both floors as \u0026ldquothe existing interiors are now tired and dated and in need of a revamp.  The application, which could go before members of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee later this year, adds: \u0026ldquoConsidering the site\u0026rsquos historic importance both locally and within Scotland, it is clear that any development both internally and externally requires to be sensitive.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to recognise the value of this development in terms of the improved visitor experience, which will impact visitor numbers to the area as a whole, and the business diversification."},{"url":null,"title":"avid-lynyrd-skynyrd-fan-pens-foreword-to-new-book-about-his-idols","story":"  Iain Monk has contributed to The Gospel According to Abraham by Paul Abraham, who was the American band\u0026rsquos road manager for a decade.  The new book is full of stories about the band, best known for hits such as Sweet Home Alabama and Free Bird.  Iain said: \u0026ldquoI became an instant fan of the band in the 1970s and was instantaneously hooked by the music, that kind of southern rock music.  \u0026ldquoMy obsession for the band just grew from there but the first time I saw them live was in 1988 in New York when I flew over to see them.  \u0026ldquoI had written to the band\u0026rsquos management to see if they could help me with tickets and I think they were impressed that I was coming from Scotland to see the band.  \u0026ldquoThat relationship grew with management, road crew and members of the band and I started following them across America.  Iain, who lives in Gullane, has spent countless hours travelling across the globe to see his idols perform at 31 shows, ranging from New York, Boston and Washington to Belgium, the Netherlands and all across the UK.  His friendship with band members and those associated with the band has even seen him spend a week at the family home of Randall Hall, who was the band\u0026rsquos guitarist, in Florida. A friendship also grew with Paul Abraham, with Iain interviewing the road manager for his Lynyrd Skynyrd blog about his intention to write a book.  Iain said the band, which was formed in 1969 and continued following the tragic death of lead singer Ronnie Van Zant in 1977, were \u0026ldquoamazing live but also \u0026ldquolovely people.  He added: \u0026ldquoThey are down to earth, very friendly people in my experience and the people that formed the band are very approachable.  \u0026ldquoI have been very, very fortunate that I have been given access to the band over the years.  \u0026ldquoThat is something most fans would simply not get and I think that is down to trust and trusting me not to take advantage of their generosity.  The 55-year-old was delighted to be asked to write the foreword for the book, which is now available online.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis memoir provides a ringside seat, it is an intriguing glimpse into Skynyrd\u0026rsquos world. Fans will feel more than satisfied. Paul had a lot to get of his chest. The book offers up more explosive revelations than a Donald Trump press conference.  \u0026ldquoOver the many years I followed Skynyrd on tour, I was treated like royalty by the band. That was all down to Paul so I was delighted to contribute to his fascinating book."},{"url":null,"title":"teenage-tranent-judokas-shock-visit-from-love-island-star","story":"  Hannah Wood was stunned when Jack Fowler, one of the stars of the hit ITV2 dating show Love Island, walked through her door on Sunday.  Hannah\u0026rsquos world had come crashing down when she tore her ACL last April while fighting in a competition in Berlin, leaving her facing a summer on crutches.  Having binge-watched Love Island while off her feet, the 16-year-old Ross High School pupil was starstruck when Jack \u0026ndash who was already in Tranent to visit family \u0026ndash appeared at her Church Street home to wish her well.  \u0026ldquoIt was mental, Hannah told the Courier.  \u0026ldquoHe was in Tranent and my little sister [Sophie, 12] had messaged him, and I didn\u0026rsquot know.  \u0026ldquoShe told him I\u0026rsquod had surgery and was being really moody! He said he\u0026rsquod be down soon and the next minute he was at the door!  The 22-year-old came sixth with partner Laura Crane on this year\u0026rsquos season of Love Island. Having only entered the show\u0026rsquos Majorcan villa in the fourth week, he proved an immediate hit with viewers.  \u0026ldquoHe was always my favourite, said Hannah.  \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos just dead nice. He has family up here so he was up visiting them.  \u0026ldquoHe stayed for about 20 minutes. He plays sport too, so he was asking about my injury and about judo.  \u0026ldquoI just asked him about Love Island, and what life was like after the villa.  \u0026ldquoHe said that he had a gut feeling he was going to leave, and that they all shared clothes and had a laugh. He said they\u0026rsquore all best friends after the villa.  But what did Hannah\u0026rsquos mum think when a 6ft 3ins-tall personal trainer from London walked in her door?  \u0026ldquoSophie told her before me but I still think she was a bit confused, Hannah laughed.  After posting news of her surprise house guest online, Hannah said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove gained 4,000 followers on Instagram and had loads of people messaging me wishing me well. My friends all said they should\u0026rsquove come round to see me!

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance. It is important that the local community has its say and we look forward to engaging with this process."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-when-haddington-was-underwater","story":"  John Hamilton of the Facebook page Lost Haddington got in touch with the Courier to highlight how the floods of 1948 would look in present-day Haddington.  He said: \u0026ldquoUsing the flood mark in the video-still as a reference, I got a friend who has access to a theodolite to use this and project this water level to other landmarks around the river and town centre.  \u0026ldquoRobert Byers from Haddington Camera Club then used his photo editing skills and a photoshop \u0026lsquoflood\u0026rsquo plug-in to reconstruct the photos.  In August 1948, persistent heavy rainfall saw the county face its most serious flooding in history.  Although much of East Lothian was affected, Haddington took a major hit. High Street as far west as the Town House was under several feet of water which stretched to the gates of Amisfield Park, a distance of more than half a mile.  Distillery Park, the Nungate, Peffers Place and Brewery Park were similarly devastated.  The Biel Burn also flooded, submerging all the low-lying land north and west of West Barns.  The flood occurred as the culmination of a period of truly exceptional rainfall \u0026ndash 122 mm of rain fell between August 1 and 8, followed by 153 mm in the next five days.  The saturated ground then received a huge 139 mm of rain in the next 24 hours, bringing severe flooding across the county.  The Haddingtonshire Courier reported on \u0026ldquodisastrous flooding without parallel in living memory \u0026ndash if not in history.  In the August 20, 1948 edition of the Courier, \u0026ldquoserious damage was inflicted on the banks of the River Tyne while other streams burst their banks and \u0026ldquoleft destruction in their wake.  It added: \u0026ldquoSo heavy was the flood of water that the streams made courses for themselves, with the result that many people were flooded out of house and home.  \u0026ldquoOne of the worst areas to suffer was Haddington, where a large number of people were rendered homeless, while shops and business premises were flooded to a depth of several feet.  Meanwhile at West Barns, the Biel Burn overflowed, causing serious damage to houses and shops in the village but fortunately \u0026ldquono loss of life is reported, although some people had narrow escapes, so suddenly did the water levels rise.  The floods also caused serious damage to crops on farms close to the Tyne and extensive damage was also caused to the now-demolished New County Cinema on Hardgate.  Nungate residents who had been enjoying the evening\u0026rsquos film were instructed by cinema management to return home to avoid being cut off as water levels rapidly rose.  And slightly further afield, the electricity supply in Gifford and Saltoun was interrupted, and at the Maltings in Haddington the sub-station was completely swept away. It was anticipated it would take many months for the affected areas to return to normal, and calls for assistance to help with the recovery were issued."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-commodore-of-haddington","story":"  TEENAGERS often get a bad press. To be sure, it\u0026rsquos a time when parents wonder what has happened to their children and feel they have lost them or gone wrong somewhere. This is because teenage years are a time of great change in terms of brain development. Quite literally the teenage brain is being remodelled and new priorities and emotions are created as a result.  It\u0026rsquos a time when peers and their approval become more important than parents or family, or almost anything else. Taking risks, or doing seemingly foolish things, are all part of this. We are familiar with the term \u0026lsquopeer pressure\u0026rsquo, but in our teenage years, approval by our peers and being included by them takes on a massive importance. It is an essential part of growing up and creating a new self-identity.  And a story from over 200 years ago shows that although the word teenager may not have been invented, and that there was no such thing as \u0026lsquoyouth culture\u0026rsquo as we now know it, behaviour was much the same.  It involves a group of young men who we would now call teenagers. They were a group of friends from Haddington. They included George Neill, John and William Haldane who were brothers, Peter Martine, Benjie Hunter and John Davie, whose nickname was \u0026lsquoLettie\u0026rsquo. They were all from Haddington, and their escapade became a story told well into their senior years. The nickname \u0026lsquoCommodore\u0026rsquo was coined for George on this day and stayed with him until he took it to his grave many years later.  Much of the tale is left to the imagination but the essentials were well told. One of the group came up with the idea of hiring a boat and heading out to Fife. These young men were not from poor backgrounds and so had the means to do this. So with the madcap plan devised, they set off as a group to the fishing village of Prestonpans.  The negotiations to hire a boat were concluded and they set off for the foreign shore of Fife, aiming for the town of Kirkcaldy. I cannot comment on their sailing abilities but they must have had some experience for they successfully navigated themselves to the shore of the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo, possibly using the Lomond hills as a marker.  They came ashore like invading Vikings, intent on mischief. No social media in those days, but each town had a drummer who would disseminate news. And so they found Kirkcaldy\u0026rsquos drummer and paid him to announce to the town that at three in the afternoon there would be a spectacular diving and swimming show at the harbour entrance. The drummer set forth announcing the news, creating an air of expectation.  The group chose Lettie to be the performer. He was the best swimmer amongst them. As 3 o\u0026rsquoclock approached, a large excited crowd assembled on the harbour walls. The Haddington lads looked at each other with wry smiles and secret sniggers. Their ruse had worked, perhaps too successfully.  \u0026ldquoShow them what ye can dae, Lettie was told by his friends. And so Lettie stood on the edge of the boat and dived into the sea, from a height of about two feet. The crowd was silent, except for a wee five-year-old girl who clapped. She was the only one impressed by the spectacle.  There were murmurings as the Kirkcaldy folk began to realise they had been duped and were being made a fool of by these young Haddington lads. The mood began to get angry, and boos were followed by threats and words I cannot print here. It was clear it was time to go.  \u0026ldquoThank ye, the lads said, bowing to the crowd and laughing, mocking them for being so gullible. Stones began to fly towards them as they set off back towards Prestonpans, gesturing to the now-furious crowd. The lads in the boat were hysterical with laughter. They had raided and fooled the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo.  But then their laughter stopped. Emerging from the harbour was a boat filled with angry Kirkcaldy lads who were shouting serious threats. The prank looked as if it might end unpleasantly so the Haddington lads had no choice but to row for their lives.  George took command. His friends had nicknamed him the Commodore at the beginning of their voyage, not so much because of his nautical skills but because of his leadership qualities. They were now desperately needed.  \u0026ldquoRow lads, row, he called on them. To be truthful the Haddington lads were at a disadvantage. They were not skilled seamen and in truth they were more bookish than brawn. But fear can do mighty things to a man\u0026rsquos capabilities, and as the adrenaline pumped through their veins they found levels of strength they didn\u0026rsquot know they had. They rowed like true Vikings, heave ho, heave ho. The sea splashed at their feet, their hearts nearly burst, but they kept the pace.  Slowly they began to pull ahead from the Kirkcaldy boat. \u0026ldquoKeep rowing, lads, dinnae look back, dinnae slow doon, called George, who was himself rowing as hard as he could. The tide was strong, the night was drawing in and the weather was beginning to change. The Kirkcaldy boat turned back, but the Haddington lads dare not attempt a Fife landing. They had no choice but to cross the Firth.  Darkness fell, then a thick haar covered them in freezing mist. They rowed through the night not sure in which direction they were headed. They wondered if their parents would ever know what had happened to them if, as now seemed likely, they were lost at sea.  The morning sun slowly burned off the mist. Thankfully they were still in the Firth, and there in front of them was the smoke coming from the lums and salt works of Prestonpans. They wept with relief and summoned up their last drops of energy to row ashore. Their final few hundred metres to the stony beach was watched by village children and women drying clothes.  Some fishermen helped pull the boat to land and the Haddington lads literally collapsed out of the vessel onto the beach, utterly exhausted but elated to be still alive.  George Neill was later to become a well-respected Baillie in Haddington, a bookseller and publisher of great local repute. He outlived his friends who had shared that day of adventure and danger.  He was often asked by those who knew him less well: \u0026ldquoWhy do people call you the Commodore? He never tired of telling the tale of his teenage adventure."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-secondary-schools-delighted-with-pupils-exam-results","story":"  This year saw the best pass rate in Higher exams across East Lothian for five years.  East Lothian Council said that pupils across its six secondary schools \u0026ndash Musselburgh Grammar School Knox Academy, Haddington North Berwick High School Preston Lodge High School in Prestonpans Ross High School, Tranent and Dunbar Grammar School \u0026ndash improved their performances, with the number of Highers passed going up to more than 79 per cent.  Lauren Rodger, headteacher at North Berwick High School, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results are brilliant and we\u0026rsquore really pleased with how all the current sixth year pupils have performed.  \u0026ldquoI know schools are judged on their exam results, but for us it\u0026rsquos also about seeing the pupils develop \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos the most pleasing part.  Similarly pleased was Paul Reynolds, the Ross High School headteacher.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted with the exam results.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results have been record-breaking and the sixth-years who have just left us have got really positive results that will allow them to hopefully go to uni or further education.  Meanwhile, Musselburgh Grammar School is celebrating record attainment levels for S5 and S6 pupils at all levels in this year\u0026rsquos exam results.  Headteacher Colin Gerrie said that there were also many \u0026ldquoexcellent results achieved by pupils in S4.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe results achieved by our students this year are exceptionally good and continue the successes of recent years, with school records broken on an annual basis.  \u0026ldquoWe do not underestimate the hard work of our pupils and the commitment of our teachers to make this happen.  His counterpart at Preston Lodge High School, Gavin Clark, also gave his thoughts.  At PL, four S5 pupils achieved six As at Higher, although the number of pupils gaining one, two, three or four Highers dropped from the last set of results.  Mr Clark added: \u0026ldquoWe expected that to happen, as a result of our regular tracking process.  \u0026ldquoThis dip in no way diminishes the achievements of those who performed so impressively in examinations.  At Knox Academy, new headteacher Susan Cook gave an update on how the school was performing.  She said: \u0026ldquoSeventy-four per cent of S4 pupils attained five or more qualifications at National 3 69 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 4 and 47 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 5 at grades A-C and 55 per cent at grades A-D.  \u0026ldquoThere were some outstanding individual performances in S4, with eight of our candidates achieving seven A passes at N5.  \u0026ldquoThese results are a really strong foundation to build S5 performance upon and I would encourage all parents/carers to continue to support their child to study at home as the transition from S4 to S5 in terms of challenge and pace moves up a few gears and much more study is required, especially at Higher level.  Meanwhile, the performance of S5 pupils in their Higher exams was down on the previous three years.  Ms Cook added: \u0026ldquoFifty-five per cent attained one or more Highers 35 per cent three or more and 16 per cent attained five or more Highers.  \u0026ldquoTwenty-two of our pupils achieved five Highers and some with straights As across all subjects.  \u0026ldquoMany other pupils achieved a mixture of Higher and National 5 awards and will build upon these in their sixth year.  Finally, there was \u0026ldquoan improving trend for S6 pupils over the last four years at Higher level, Ms Cook added.

The event is being held ahead of the submission of a series of applications, enacting the existing planning permission for the mixed-use development.  The site is located around Longniddry Farm, to the south of the vilage\u0026rsquos railway line, and follows the approval by East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning committee of 450 new homes at the site last August, with formal planning permission in principle issued in June.  The initial plans were approved despite concerns that the new development could split the village in two.  The development includes about 25 per cent affordable homes plus associated commercial and retail space, community facilities, infrastructure and green space.  The commercial and retail space is being delivered separately by Socially Conscious Capital, acting for landowner, Wemyss and March Estates.  Should permission be received, it is anticipated that construction could start on site early next year.  Fraser Lynes, land and development director for Cruden Homes , said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted to have the opportunity to take forward the great work carried out by Socially Conscious Capital and Taylor Architecture.  \u0026ldquoOur involvement in this development confirms our commitment to the county and complements our other developments in North Berwick, Aberlady and Dirleton.  \u0026ldquoWe fully believe in the design principles which are embedded in the existing consent and look forward to delivering a truly bespoke product in one of East Lothian\u0026rsquos best locations.

That project came about following rising safety concerns from drivers who did not feel confident using the unlit road.  Since then, driver confidence has improved by 78 per cent, with the project, which was undertaken by UK-based Clearview Intelligence in partnership with Transport Scotland and Amey, shortlisted in the Road Safety, Traffic Management and Enforcement category at the National Transport Awards, which take place in October.  Councillor Norman Hampshire, a Dunbar ward councillor and deputy leader of East Lothian Council, as well as chairman of the A1 Action Group, was one of those hailing the project as a big success.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe installation of the studs has, in my view, revolutionised the driving experience on the A1 after dark.  \u0026ldquoThe studs have improved night-time visibility beyond all recognition along certain parts of the route.  Concerns about driving conditions on the unlit road were first raised by the A1 Action Group, which comprises councillors from Scottish Borders and East Lothian Councils, transportation groups and community councils.  Transport Scotland met with the action group and, upon investigating the road, recognised that entering or exiting the A1 during the hours of darkness was a key area of concern due to a lack of visibility, junction definition and consistency in signage and road markings.  Clearview Intelligence was then appointed by Amey to make improvements to the road as part of a wider project and installed the road studs to give a visual consistency to the route by ensuring all major junctions were visible and treated similarly.  This included using white, red, amber and green studs to effectively highlight road edges, the centre of the road and junctions.  Andy Salotti, director of solutions at Clearview Intelligence, said: \u0026ldquoWe are immensely proud of the work we did to improve the driving conditions on the A1 and delighted this has been recognised at a national level.

A planning statement submitted as part of the application for the site, reads: \u0026ldquoThe proposal is to restore and convert a redundant and roofed-over water reservoir into a residential dwelling and improve the quality of this site.  The report adds that the house would be \u0026ldquodesigned so that the proposal provides an acceptable solution, preserving and enhancing the character and appearance of the building, which is category B listed.

The agricultural land has been earmarked by East Lothian Council for business use but Barratt claimed the council\u0026rsquos vision was financially unviable.  They said the only way to make the \u0026ldquonumbers add up was to create a mixed use site with housing and industry.  But their claims were rejected by councillors after Provost John McMillan , cabinet spokesman on economic development, insisted: \u0026ldquoIf we build it, they will come.  The quote, paraphrasing one made famous in the US baseball movie Field of Dreams starring Kevin Costner, came as he backed council officials who recommended the plans from Barratt and site owners The Co-operative be thrown out.  Jason Watt, from Barratt, told a meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington last Tuesday that site drainage and geology issues meant it would cost \u0026pound1.5m to get ready for development.  Once general costs were taken into account, the total development bill would be \u0026pound2.25m \u0026ndash yet the value of the land was estimated at only \u0026pound1.1m.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe numbers clearly do not add up and never will unless there is cross subsidising with a mixed use development.  Ward councillor Kenny McLeod  backed the Barratt proposal, highlighting the lack of council housing available for rent in Tranent: the proposed Barratt development included 25 per cent affordable housing.  Mr McLeod said: \u0026ldquoWe need to keep the local connection and they are not building housing for rent in this area.  \u0026ldquoIt must be 50 years since a house was put in the area for rent.  However, fellow Tranent, Wallyford and Macmerry councillor Colin McGinn  said he was concerned about the traffic that would be created by more than 100 homes on the site, which is on the opposite side of the town\u0026rsquos Haddington Road from Steading View.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe have a responsibility within Tranent to increase employment and opportunities for our young people.  Councillor Brian Small , opposition leader, told the committee: \u0026ldquoThere is no point in having a [Local Development] Plan if at the first turn we think we can turn it over. We need to give this business land the opportunity to develop.  The committee was told that while the district valuer had agreed with developers that the land was not financially viable as a single business plot, they had said it could be made financially sound by developing it in phases.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoWe have enough land set aside for housing.  \u0026ldquoPeople want \u0026ndashand need \u0026ndash local employment and if we build it they will come. This is a signal to developers we want to grow the number of jobs around the county.

That means traffic was responsible for 18.5 per cent of the total amount of carbon dioxide released in East Lothian in 2016.  But in total, CO2 emissions in the county fell over the same period.  Jason Rose, from East Lothian Greens, blamed more housing developments in East Lothian for the rise in CO2 from emissions relating to transport.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoTo live [in the new developments], you need a car. More houses means more cars.  Mr Rose also highlighted the fact that nearly half of East Lothian residents commute to Edinburgh every day for work.  \u0026ldquoThe main issue is half the people who live in East Lothian work in Edinburgh, so they have to commute, he said.  \u0026ldquoBuses take a long time, you want cheap and reliable.  \u0026ldquoWith trains, there definitely needs to be more of an effort to improve length and frequency.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council should be trying to increase employment in East Lothian, so people don\u0026rsquot need to commute.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove heard some people say, \u0026lsquooh what if you open a bridge here or build another road?\u0026rsquo but creating more roads just increases traffic and spreads the problem around.  Overall, emissions from transport, both private and for business purposes, increased by 3.5 per cent in the UK over the period between 2011 and 2016.  However, total CO2 emissions fell by 4.6 per cent over the five years in East Lothian.  The county was responsible for releasing 1.1 million tonnes of CO2 in 2016 \u0026ndash down from 1.15 million tonnes five years earlier.  But Mr Rose highlighted that it was not just CO2 emissions that needed to be monitored.  \u0026ldquoWe need to watch for NO2  and PM10  \u0026ndash those are the pollutants that can cause health risks, he added.  In East Lothian, industrial and commercial activities are by far the main producer of CO2 emissions, releasing 63.9 per cent of the total. In 2016, households produced 16 per cent of the CO2 in the county, lower than five years earlier.  The Department also takes into account the amount of CO2 produced by farms and through other rural activities and the CO2 removed from the air by trees.  According to its estimates, these agricultural activities produced more greenhouse gases than forests removed, and so were responsible for 1.6 per cent of the carbon emissions in East Lothian in 2016.  Overall, the UK reduced its carbon emissions by 15.4 per cent over the five years."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  We\u0027ll also reveal the Top 25 in this year\u0027s Pet Idol competition.

Labour sources have said Field\u0026rsquos wish to serve as an Independent MP while remaining a member of the party is \u0026ldquonot possible.  Under the Parliamentary Labour Party standing orders, which governs MPs, anyone who takes such action will usually get a letter asking them to retake the party whip within 14 days or face expulsion.  Labour\u0026rsquos shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon last night called on Mr Field to fight a by-election, tweeting: \u0026ldquoPoliticians who are elected as Labour MPs by their constituents and who then leave the Labour Party should do the right and respectful thing and call a by-election straight away.  \u0026ldquoThey should ask for their constituents\u0026rsquo consent to continue to represent them on a different basis.          Politicians who are elected as Labour MPs by their constituents and who then leave the Labour Party should do the right and respectful thing and call a by-election straight away. They should ask for their constituents\u0026rsquo consent to continue to represent them on a different basis.          \u0026mdash Richard Burgon MP  August 30, 2018  Mr Field, the one-time minister for welfare reform, who was charged by Tony Blair to reform the welfare state by \u0026ldquothinking the unthinkable, said in his resignation letter that the party was now governed by \u0026ldquoa culture of intolerance, nastiness and intimidation.  He said: \u0026ldquoI am resigning the whip for two principal reasons.  \u0026ldquoThe first centres on the latest example of Labour\u0026rsquos leadership becoming a force for antisemitism in British politics.  \u0026ldquoThe latest example, from last week, comes after a series of attempts by Jeremy to deny the past statements and actions by him were antisemitic.  \u0026ldquoBritain fought the Second World War to banish these views from our politics, but that superhuman effort and success is now under huge and sustained internal attack.  \u0026ldquoThe leadership is doing nothing substantive to address this erosion of our core values.  \u0026ldquoIt saddens me to say that we are increasingly seen as a racist party. This issue alone compels me to resign the whip.  In a letter to his constituents in the Liverpool Echo, Mr Field said he had resigned with \u0026ldquoconsiderable sadness, but said he could not \u0026ldquolend any legitimacy to the most appalling culture.  He added that he had nominated Mr Corbyn for the leadership in 2015 as he wanted to see a \u0026ldquobroad debate on the party\u0026rsquos future.  \u0026ldquoMy wish to see a more inclusive debate in the Labour Party could not have been more wide of the mark, he wrote.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn addition to the leadership\u0026rsquos failure to expel anti-Semites is the charge that the national Party appears to be doing nothing to ensure that Labour\u0026rsquos dominant values of debate, good will, and inclusiveness can flourish in Constituency Labour Parties.  Labour deputy leader Tom Watson said Mr Field\u0026rsquos resignation should serve as a \u0026ldquomajor wake up call to the party.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is a serious loss to the party and I deeply regret Frank\u0026rsquos decision. It reflects both the deep divisions in the party and the sense of drift engulfing us.  \u0026ldquoIt is a major wake up call. We cannot afford to lose people of such weight and stature.  Former Labour home secretary Lord Blunkett said he had tried to dissuade Mr Field from resigning.  He told the Daily : \u0026ldquoI understand that his constituency party membership has been giving him an incredibly hard time, which is unforgivable and reminds me vividly of the Eighties, when I was involved as a member of the national executive committee in dealing with these people, particularly from Merseyside.  Labour MP Wes Streeting  raised concern Mr Field \u0026ldquowon\u0026rsquot be the last to resign.  He said: \u0026ldquoAntisemitism and the toxic political culture in the Labour Party are issues that need to be immediately addressed by the Labour leadership if they\u0026rsquore to stop this becoming a full-scale existential crisis of the Labour Party.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove made very clear that I\u0026rsquom not about to leave the Labour Party because of these people, but I\u0026rsquom afraid Frank Field isn\u0026rsquot the first Labour MP to quit and at this rate he won\u0026rsquot be the last.  \u0026ldquoIt would be an absolute tragedy if the Labour Party were to split, but we should be in no doubt that this is the biggest crisis facing the party since 1981.  But speaking on BBC\u0026rsquos Newsnight, Labour MP Chris Williamson said: \u0026ldquoThe only intolerance that I\u0026rsquove seen is inside, or a section of the parliamentary Labour party who have not been prepared to honour the democratic decisions of Labour Party members.  He added: \u0026ldquoThey are less than 0.4% of our membership and diminishing all the time.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In lengthy posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be, if not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to return to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But if this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But if Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8483341.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scotlands-only-flying-banker-clocks-up-11000-miles","story":"  Every week Anne Rendall island-hops across the islands of Orkney to open local Royal Bank of Scotland branches for customers there.

Its Public Performance Measure  \u0026ndash which records services arriving within five minutes of their scheduled time \u0026ndash has sunk to 88.2 per cent, below the target of 92.13%.  It is the third period in a row that the figures have been a record low for Abellio, with opposition parties piling pressure on new SNP Transport Secretary Michael Matheson.  Scottish Labour\u0026rsquos shadow transport secretary Colin Smyth said: \u0026ldquoMr Matheson\u0026rsquos honeymoon period is over and it\u0026rsquos time for him to get a grip on Scotland\u0026rsquos railways as passengers face more delays yet are expected to pay more for tickets.  \u0026ldquoWhen the SNP handed the franchise to Abellio, they said it would be a \u0027world leading\u0027 deal, but the reality for Scotland\u0026rsquos hard-pressed passengers has been anything but with hikes in fares, overcrowding, delays and stop skipping.  \u0026ldquoIt is time to bring this SNP rail chaos to an end and return our railways back into public hands.  \u0026ldquoFranchising has failed passengers and staff and that\u0026rsquos why Labour is fighting for publicly owned railways which will serve the many, not just the few.  PPM measures punctuality and reliability, with trains falling foul of the target if they are more than five minutes late.  But using a stricter measure which records any arrivals more than a minute late, half of all trains in Scotland\u0026rsquos busiest stations were delayed.  At Edinburgh Waverley, less than half of services were on time. At Glasgow Queen Street, just 55.8% were.  Abellio took over the ScotRail franchise in 2015, but Scottish ministers are now putting together a public sector bid for the railways.  Last week it emerged the state-owned company behind CalMac is exploring bidding for the ScotRail franchise when it ends in 2025.  A ScotRail spokesman said it knows performance need to be better and it shares the frustration of its customers when things don\u0026rsquot go according to plan.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe investment we are making in new and upgraded trains, and our recruitment drive to increase the number of people working on our frontline, will help us significantly in enhancing the day-to-day running of services.  \u0026ldquoWe are building the best railway Scotland has ever had and service performance is a huge part of this delivery. Everyone at ScotRail is working together to deliver these improvements.  It is understood almost half of ScotRail\u0027s performance issues related to infrastructure, which is the responsibility of Network Rail.  Signalling failures at Yoker and Rutherglen East Junction, as well as flooding at Dalmuir, were among the top incidents to hit services.  A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoAs has been stated on many previous occasions ministers expect the ScotRail Alliance to work closely together to build on lessons learned going forward.  \u0026ldquoWe have already secured the right for a public sector operator to bid for a rail franchise in Scotland \u0026ndash after being denied by previous UK Governments \u0026ndash which will enable a level playing field between the private and public sector in bidding for rail franchises for the benefit of passengers and best value for the public purse.  \u0026ldquoWe should not lose sight of the transformational process underway on our railways including the infrastructure enhancements, as well as the introduction of new and fully re-furbished rolling stock with the additional services that they will provide.  \u0026ldquoIn recent years 160 extra carriages were added to ScotRail\u0026rsquos fleet with an extra 200 to follow in the next 12 months giving a 50% increase in carriages since 2007."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/143149.jpg?type=article-full","title":"port-giant-accused-of-sacrificing-clyde-to-save-mersey","story":"  Peel Ports \u0026ndash which owns and manages swathes of land along the West Coast \u0026ndash have always denied favouring their substantial holdings in England.  Now a campaign questioning the concern\u0026rsquos monopoly over both the Clyde and the Mersey has been endorsed by politicians from the SNP, Labour and Green parties.  Campaigners allege Peel Ports are letting key pieces of infrastructure lie idle that could help Scotland compete for shipyard and port jobs with north-west England.  Peel Ports dismiss this claim and point to investments approaching \u0026pound900m on the Clyde in the last two decades.  The row comes amid a long-standing conflict between two multi-millionaire tax exiles over one of the biggest marine assets on the British coast: Inchgreen Dry Dock in Inverclyde.  Three years ago this newspaper revealed one tycoon \u0026ndash Jim McColl of Ferguson Marine, Scotland\u0026rsquos last commercial shipbuilder\u0026ndash wanted to lease the 1000ft long facility from another, John Whittaker of Peel Ports.  The Save the Inchgreen Campaign, in a letter sent yesterday to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and MPs and MSPs across Western Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe believe Inchgreen Dry Dock is being sacrificed to protect The Peel Group\u0026rsquos Investments on Merseyside.  \u0026ldquoThe Peel Group acquired vast areas of industrial land from Glasgow to Ayrshire when they bought Clydeport in 2002.

Glasgow North-East Labour MP and former shipbuilder Paul Sweeney has long championed a major world-class shipyard at Inchgreen, which would cost at least \u0026pound200m to build from scratch.  Jim McColl  Mr McColl\u0026rsquos yard, Ferguson Marine in nearby Port Glasgow, is currently struggling with a Scottish Government order for two new high-tech ferries for CalMac.\u0026nbsp  The tycoon had wanted to move to the roomier Inchgreen but failed to come to agreement with Peel Ports, which now runs the facility through its Mersey shipyard, Cammell Laird.\u0026nbsp  Critics say Peel Ports and Cammell Laird have had a decade and a half to outline long-term plans for\u0026nbsp  Inchgreen and other potential shipyard and harbour sites.\u0026nbsp  The concern has been piling money into the Clyde \u0026ndash but mostly on housing schemes such as Glasgow Harbour.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp  Now, aware of simmering discontent, it has announced that it will bid for the right to turn Inchgreen into a repair yard for the Royal Navy\u0026rsquos two giant aircraft carriers.

The \u0026pound1.34 billion crossing over the Firth of Forth opened to traffic on August 30 last year as a replacement for traffic using the Forth Road Bridge , coming in under budget but completed eight months later than first estimated.  Since the new bridge opened, there have been 14 occasions when the FRB would have had to close to high sided vehicles, Transport Scotland said.  On the Queensferry Crossing it typically takes around one hour to restore normal traffic conditions following an incident, compared to one to five hours on the FRB.  An Audit Scotland report published earlier this month found the Queensferry Crossing project was managed effectively and delivered value for money.  Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said: \"The recent Audit Scotland report recognised the Queensferry Crossing as having delivered its objective of providing a more reliable road link between the Lothians and Fife.  \"One year on since opening the new bridge, we are today providing further evidence that shows how reliability of journeys over the Forth have improved in the last twelve months.  \"This is in sharp contrast to the lengthy delays seen in the past on the Forth Road Bridge, where an accident or breakdown resulted in huge tailbacks and much longer journeys over the bridge and the surrounding road networks.  \"The impacts of incidents on the Queensferry Crossing have been much reduced by making use of the hard shoulders to assist in quicker response times in the recovery of vehicles and allowing for the ability to maintain two lanes of traffic.  \"There are clear and significant economic benefits from this reliable crossing for both industry and commuters alike, I am pleased to see this has been recognised by the road haulage industry today.\"  However he said the fact the contractor is still carrying out remedial and finishing work at night has an impact on those travelling outside of peak hours and has asked Transport Scotland officials to obtain an update on the work.  The road haulage industry said the new bridge has been of benefit to the Scottish economy.  Seamus Leheny, Freight Transport Association policy manager, said: \"At a time when reliable trading links across the country, and with the rest of Europe, are more critical than ever before, the Queensferry Crossing has quickly established itself as a vital component in the UK\u0027s supply chain.  \"Its ability to remain open when other options are closed by the severe weather conditions frequently experienced in this part of the world are a godsend for businesses on both sides of the border.\"  Martin Reid of the Road Haulage Association added: \"The importance of road transport to the Scottish economy and its supply chain cannot be overstated and so the Forth Crossing is a vital route to cities and major conurbations along the East Coast.\""},{"url":null,"title":"paul-sweeney-make-clyde-shipbuilding-great-again","story":"  But nearby underutilised infrastructure such as Inchgreen Dry Dock and Hunterston offer huge potential for the Clyde to expand towards large-scale shipbuilding as seen in Finland, France, Italy and Germany \u0026ndash which between them build around 90 per cent of the world\u0026rsquos complex cruise ships \u0026ndash and where average wages are actually higher than in the UK.  Those countries have succeeded in this competitive market because they viewed it as a long-term national industrial objective to patiently support investment in infrastructure and skills and they have captured the world market in the process.  Ferguson Marine is the country\u0026rsquos only remaining player in what is one of the most competitive and capital-intensive heavy industries in the world.  From dominating world shipbuilding a century ago, when the Clyde alone built more tonnage than the whole of Germany, the river today accounts for less than1% of global tonnage.  The success of the Port Glasgow shipyard is therefore critical as it is a platform from which to rebuild the country\u0026rsquos global market share and form the basis of a renaissance in commercial shipbuilding.  The two new dual fuel ferries under construction there for CalMac are crucial to this objective. The delays encountered by the yard during their construction are not unexpected due to the complexities of re-scaling the industry from near extinction just four years ago, but also because of design changes made by the customer, which have added to the cost.  In a feast and famine industry like shipbuilding, the competing pressures of maturing the ship\u0026rsquos design but also of keeping the workforce on the shop floor gainfully employed can be a difficult balancing act for shipyard managers, especially when scaling up the yard\u0026rsquos workforce from almost scratch and building what is essentially a working prototype.  Delays by the Scottish Government in signing the contract initially also added to costs, as the integrated propulsion system has been designed, manufactured and imported and has been subject to unfavourable currency fluctuations.  If we are to commit to a credible and sustainable commercial shipbuilding industry in this country, then the Scottish Government must accept that there will be risks of delays and snags as we re-learn the complex operation of large-scale shipbuilding and work collaboratively with our industry to learn those lessons.  Public sector contracts like the new CalMac ferries are an excellent way for the industry to develop the necessary resilience and efficiency in design, build, testing and commissioning vessels of this size so that it can then tender competitively around the world for contracts in the future.  The Germans Finns and Italians have shown the way. We need to do the same. We have done it before and we must now view this project at Ferguson Marine as a national mission to reinvigorate commercial shipbuilding and associated industries in Scotland.

A significant change is needed to make Scotland both more low carbon efficient and also a more resilient, desirable place to do business. Therein lies the opportunity - Scottish businesses that gain strengths in resource efficiency and environmental innovation will become increasingly valuable in global markets.  Scotland\u0026rsquos ambition is to be at the forefront of social and technological progress. In May the First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, announced new funding to support Scottish entrepreneurs, with a \u0026pound650,000 investment into Entrepreneurial Scotland .  The Scottish Government is keen to encourage an entrepreneurial focus in Scotland\u0026rsquos future, through individuals, social enterprises and across government and the public sector.  ES is at the forefront of this movement and its strategy \u0026ndash A Vision for 2030 \u0026ndash positions the entrepreneurial virtuous cycle as a key tool for success. The cycle is a simple one \u0026ndash entrepreneurial leaders drive changes which create value for society, which are embedded in the culture and go on to inspire future entrepreneurs.  One way Scotland is engaging its entrepreneurial community is through the Saltire Fellows, the next generation of Scotland\u0026rsquos brightest entrepreneurs. They are being tasked with tackling some of the biggest environmental challenges of our time to see how that virtuous cycle can unlock Scotland\u0026rsquos potential.\u0026nbsp  Entrepreneurial Scotland has recently partnered with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency  on a Sustainable Growth Agreement to create further opportunities for environmental and social success in Scotland. Last year Fellows were set the challenge of looking into the global issue of waste tyres, with the outputs feeding directly into the forthcoming sector plan that SEPA will be consulting on soon. This year the Fellows will focus on the global issue of plastics  James Stuart, managing director of ES, believes that a cooperative approach is vital to tackle a challenge that affects every business sector. \u0026ldquoA year ago we took the opportunity to work together with SEPA, recognising that while there is much talk about the scale of the problem it\u0026rsquos much more difficult to actually engage effectively with it. This joint approach allows us to look through a different lens and bring an entrepreneurial mindset to the project    Terry A\u0026rsquoHearn, chief executive officer at SEPA, agrees that there is a real challenge. \u0026ldquoIt is estimated that if everyone lived the lifestyle of us in Scotland, we would need almost three planets. We only have one. If we are to make a shift to a one-planet lifestyle we will need massive change. Everything we do has to be reinvented and reshaped and as a species we need to become more entrepreneurial.  Scotland needs to be more innovative and more collaborative, and it needs new, and perhaps unusual, partnerships to succeed.  Stuart believes the partnership between ES and SEPA is important for success: \u0026ldquoWe have the corporate knowledge of a big team with superb expertise and SEPA brings its own particular skills with people trained to think in a particular way to address the challenge of climate change. With a united approach we can bring things into the crosshairs of where these skill sets come together.  A\u0026rsquoHearn agrees: \u0026ldquoThe scale of environmental challenges facing humanity is enormous, with a real urgency to act. Poor leaders are going to pretend it isn\u0026rsquot a problem, good leaders will face the reality of the situation. Great leaders will understand that it is an opportunity. Only those that embrace the economic opportunity of sustainable solutions to environmental challenges will thrive.

It seemed the perfect job Helen didn\u0026rsquot drink yet was interested in finding out more about the process. Little did she know it would take her life in a whole new direction.  Rather than viewing distilling as chemical engineering, Helen found it felt far more artistic - all based on the creative expression of how it looks, smells and tastes. After inheriting an old family book detailing how her relatives used to distil on the family farm, Helen realised distilling was part of her history and heritage.    With derelict out-buildings on her family\u0026rsquos farm, Helen had a fresh appreciation for these old spaces once viewed as a millstone around her neck. Buildings that were near fresh spring water, surrounded by botanicals created a unique opportunity.  Gin attracted Helen initially as the old distilling manual described how people used to flavour spirits with whatever was around them. The farm had a wealth of natural botanicals, including Scottish juniper, so suddenly this untapped heather hill was incredibly valuable.  The gin is named Badvo, after Helen\u0026rsquos family farm where the stories of distilling inspired Helen when starting out. The heron logo represents the fresh spring water used, as only a very pure spring can support enough fish for a heron. To fund the start-up, Helen pre-sold the first batch of 105 bottles collectively for \u0026pound6,500, going on to use the money to unlock match funding, which snowballed until the entire distillery was grant funded.    Helen commented: \u0026ldquoI got a lot of flak for being a solo entrepreneur. Yes, there are downsides to being a one-man band, but it gives you the opportunity to be dynamic. You can make a decision and you don\u0026rsquot have to justify it to anyone or get it past any board.  \u0026ldquoIt hurts occasionally when people assume someone else set up the distillery as I am too young or too female to have accomplished this alone. I just don\u0026rsquot think some people can comprehend how you can cover so much ground at this stage in life, but I think this is the perfect time.

On the contrary, her peer group expected that students of both sexes could progress to further education, and into careers of our choice. This certainly was Julie\u0026rsquos experience.    Graduating from Glasgow University, Bachelor of Laws with Honours in 1993, Julie then went on to complete the required post-graduate Diploma in Legal Practice in 1994. A legal Traineeship commenced immediately, and she was formally admitted as a solicitor in 1995, at the age of 23. By 27, Julie had been promoted to partner. At that time, she was one of the youngest female partners in a law firm in Scotland. By 2015, more than 60 per cent of solicitors under the age of 40, practising in Scotland, were women \u0026ndash unimaginable in 1995, far less in 1918. For the following 11 years, Julie practised a wide range of areas of law and managed three of her firms\u0026rsquo branch offices. She was in charge of HR, and worked long hours.  In 2010, Julie decided to leave the relative security of her large firm behind. Seeking a better work/life balance, she set up her own firm \u0026ndash Millen Solicitors. Hard work continued, and although she faced pressures of a different kind as a sole practitioner, she succeeded in achieving a balance, not only for herself, but for every member of her team.  From the outset, Julie envisaged a practice which would provide an exceptional level of service to clients, and a collegiate and stimulating environment for employees. These values continue at the core of Millen Solicitors as they approach the end of their 8th successful year.    \u0026ldquoFamily Solicitors For Generations is the business maxim, with a nod to their specialisms in all aspects of family law, as well as powers of attorney, wills and executries. Julie and her team provide an outstanding, supportive and compassionate service to families, parents, grandparents and children in times of crisis or uncertainty, at ying stages of their respective lives. Their clients agree, with the majority of work now coming in the form of referrals from satisfied clients, and professional colleagues seeking their expertise.  Julie comments: \u0026ldquoI am proud to have contributed to the cracking of the \u0026ldquoglass ceiling, and I look forward to seeing Scotland\u0026rsquos entrepreneurial women achieve its eventual demise.

Mr Salmond has been heavily criticised over his decision to crowdfund his legal fight with the Scottish Government, with opposition parties accusing him of \u0026ldquoabusing his power, and dragging Scotland into the gutter.  Ms Sturgeon stressed there was an \u0026ldquoobligation not to discourage women from raising complaints.  She told the BBC: \u0026ldquoWhatever any of us do and say in the context of this very high profile case, we must absolutely make sure we don\u0026rsquot make it harder for \u0026ndash or discourage \u0026ndash women from coming forward in the future.  \u0026ldquoI think that\u0026rsquos an obligation on all of us right now. And what we should be focusing on is that fairness of process that is now important to all concerned.  Mr Salmond announced he was resigning from the SNP last night, insisting he wanted to avoid splitting the party.  He has been a member of the SNP for 45 years and its leader for 20, taking it to its greatest electoral heights and closer than ever to realising its goal of independence.  His crowdfunding appeal was set up to cover the costs of taking the Scottish Government to court to challenge its handling of the complaints, and has already smashed its target of \u0026pound50,000. By 2pm on Thursday, it had raised almost \u0026pound80,000.  But opposition figures criticised the fundraiser as \u0026ldquoastonishing, and suggested Mr Salmond was \u0026ldquosending a signal to those who have made allegations that he has the upper hand.  Former Labour first minister Jack McConnell was among those who urged people to donate to charities helping victims of sexual assault and harassment. Other Labour figures\u0026nbspcalled on supporters to donate to Women\u0026rsquos Aid.  In what some interpreted as a coded rebuke to Mr Salmond, Ms Sturgeon also tweeted her support for the Women\u0026rsquos Aid fundraiser on Thursday afternoon.  Ms Sturgeon previously said she felt a \u0026ldquohuge sadness and called the situation \u0026ldquoincredibly difficult both for the party and for the women who had complained about Mr Salmond.  She also restated her conviction that the complaints against him \u0026ldquomust be investigated without fear or favour and said independence was \u0026ldquobigger than any one individual.  Mr Salmond, 63, has started a judicial review at the Court of Session, arguing he was denied a fair chance to respond to the claims against him while being investigated by civil servants.  He said the costs would be \u0026ldquohuge and all sums received would go to his legal action, with anything left over going to good causes.  It comes after two civil servants complained about Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos behaviour while he was first minister, accusing him of sexual misconduct.  Police are examining the allegations, which Mr Salmond strenuously denies.  Earlier this week, he wrote to Scotland\u0027s top civil servant, calling for an inquiry into how the allegations against him were made public.  \"In this case confidentiality has been broken greatly to my detriment and in a way which puts at serious risk the anonymity of both complainants,\" Mr Salmond said in the message.  \"It urgently needs to be established who breached that duty of confidence and why.\""},{"url":null,"title":"sse-and-npower-merger-provisionally-cleared-by-regulator","story":"  The Competition and Markets Authority  had raised concerns that the tie-up could reduce competition in the market, which would likely lead to higher prices.  A watchdog investigation found that the two firms did not compete closely for customers on default tariffs which most people are on. Few people switched between the pair, it added.  The merger would see SSE and Npower\u0027s parent company, Germany\u0027s Innogy, merge their household energy supply and services business in Britain, turning the Big Six energy suppliers into five.  The CMA had been carrying out a review into the proposed tie-up amid fears it would weaken competition in the market.

Soon, he had put that to the test, acquiring status by shooting a rival gang member in the head, but nine years later Marcos was handed a jail term which kept him behind bars in Pelican Bay supermax prison for 18 years.  Now he is a \u0026lsquotrainee\u0026rsquo with LA\u0026rsquos Homeboy Industries, a collection of social enterprises which employ and rehabilitate former gang members.  For men like Marcos, the scheme offers an alternative version of manhood, according to researcher Professor Ross Deuchar \u0026ndash for criminals who have only found family and role models in the gangs.  Marcos acknowledges this now himself \u0026ldquoI was basically looking for family, looking for some type of father-figure, you know? And then my older \u0026lsquohomies\u0026rsquo were father figures, he says.  Marcos features in a new book by Mr Deuchar, professor of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of the West of Scotland, highlighting the way Homeboy Industries and similar schemes on three continents are using spiritual approaches to reform gang members and offer them an alternative kind of masculinity.  The book also looks at work with biker gangs in Denmark, incorporating programmes based on yoga and breathing exercises, and a Christianity-based initiative with former triad members in Hong Kong.  Gangs And Spirituality - a Global Perspective - is being launched at an event at the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday, when Deuchar will discuss the Danish model and call for the Scottish Government to do more to promote such approaches in Scotland.  Street and Arrow, a food-truck business based on Homeboy Industries has already been established in Glasgow, but Scottish recidivism schemes tend to shy away from the spiritual, he says.  Yet the evidence is that participation in such programmes can change the lives of participants and give them a new way of thinking about manhood, he says. His book offers \u0026ldquonew insights about how the Scottish justice system can learn from the approaches used in Denmark.  While the Hong Kong scheme is Christian and Homeboy Industries was founded by a Jesuit priest, acts of faith are not critical, he argues. \u0026ldquoReligion is a system of worship and tradition but spirituality means different things to different people.  \u0026ldquoFor the older guys it was about having a language and framework for change. But they described it as almost a religious, spiritual experience, healing from the lifestyles and addictions they\u0026rsquod developed.  Crucially, all the groups he studied acted as an alternative to the \u0026lsquofamily\u0026rsquo of the gangs.  \u0026ldquoIt almost gives them a new kind of fellowship. Homeboy Industries is very much about love, kinship and community building.  \u0026ldquoDenmark is an increasingly secular society like our own, and religion is not seen as much more palatable, but meditation and breathing can be very powerful.  Seeing members of dangerous Danish biker gangs using Yoga to move away from dependency on drugs or violence was as impressive as it was counterintuitive, he says. But he was struck by the importance of ideas of what a \u0026lsquostrong\u0026rsquo man was to very many participants.  \u0026ldquoWhat if found with these groups all around the world was that as well as abuse and trauma in their background, they had this very toxic perception of what masculinity is about. These approaches let them deconstruct such narratives of violence, aggression and dominance. It is an approach we really need to become more open to."},{"url":null,"title":"serial-alex-salmond-critic-defends-former-leaders-actions","story":"  Jim Sillars, who was Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos SNP deputy in the early 1990s but is now a frequent critic, said the former leader deserved respect for his record.  He said his resignation from the SNP was \u0026ldquothe right thing to do as it took Nicola Sturgeon \u0026ldquooff the hook of having to respond to opposition calls to suspend him.  Mr Sillars said: \u0026ldquoHe did Nicola and the party a great favour.  Despite having five pensions and a show on a Kremlin-backed TV channel, Mr Salmond was not a wealthy man, Mr Sillars said.  It was therefore legitimate for him to crowdfund his judicial review at the Court of Session, especially, as he also faces the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos costs if he loses.  He said SNP members didn\u0026rsquot see it as a fight between Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon, but one between Mr Salmond and the administration overseen by Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos perfectly legitimate for Alex to ask the party that he has served so well over the years for help, and the response from people shows their regard for him.  \u0026ldquoThe fact is that Alex and I have disagreed over the years both over policy and how to run the party, but you can\u0026rsquot take away the service that he has given to the independence movement.  However Mr Sillars also rebuked Noel Dolan, a former special adviser to both Mr Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon as first minister, who said Ms Evans should quit if Mr Salmond won his judicial review action.  Mr Dolan, who is now retired from the Scottish Government, told the Sunday Herald: \u0026ldquoI have known Alex Salmond for over 35 years and I\u0026rsquove never seen any inappropriate behaviour, nor have I heard any allegations of sexual harassment prior to [last] Friday morning.  \u0026ldquoI expect Mr Salmond to be cleared of these allegations, and when that happens I hope Leslie Evans, the Permanent Secretary, will consider her position and resign.  Mr Sillars said it was far too early in the process to start talking about resignations, before anything had been examined at the Court of Session.  He said: \u0026ldquoMy advice to Noel Dolan is wait until we know the full facts and the full judgment before talking about anyone resigning their job.  In previous years, Mr Sillars has condemned the \u0026ldquocult of personality in the SNP around first Mr Salmond and then Ms Sturgeon.  In 2012, he also accused Mr Salmond of creating a \u0026ldquototalitarian party that quashed internal dissent and had become \u0026ldquointellectually dumb as a consequence."},{"url":null,"title":"salmond-no-longer-working-for-lbc","story":"  LBC, which gave the former First Minister a weekly radio show two years ago, confirmed it was not working with him on any other projects.

In a letter Cosla\u0026rsquos leadership group he said: \u0026ldquoI am writing to express the frustration of Scottish teachers at Cosla\u0026rsquos continuing procrastination in terms of this year\u0026rsquos pay negotiations and, also, to express our growing anger at Cosla\u0026rsquos attempt to use the plight of teachers as a political pawn in its own dispute with Scottish Government.  \u0026ldquoThe EIS is very clear that we have distinct bargaining machinery in the tripartite arrangement of the SNCT.  \u0026ldquoCosla needs to respect the integrity of the SNCT negotiating machinery and support a pay settlement for teachers that will address the problems of recruitment and retention, highlighted in our submission.  Mr Flanagan called on Cosla to recognise the legitimacy of the teachers\u0026rsquo pay claim and the challenges which Scottish education continues to face.  \u0026ldquoThe EIS is committed to achieving a negotiated settlement through the SNCT and we hope that Cosla will demonstrate that it shares this commitment, he added.  A Cosla spokesman said: \u0026ldquoEveryone associated with the SNCT negotiating process is working extremely hard to find a solution to a very difficult pay round.  \u0026ldquoWe have already confirmed with both Scottish Government and the teachers unions that we will meet them in early September to resume talks and hopefully we can find a mutually agreeable solution."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-stands-firm-on-brexit-demands-as-eu-begins-to-soften-its-stance","story":"  Speaking on the final leg of her African tour, the Prime Minister said the Chequers proposals, which triggered high-profile Cabinet resignations and have thus far received a cool response from the European Commission, would be mutually beneficial.  \"Chequers delivers on the Brexit vote.

The French President aims to use an informal EU summit next month in Salzburg to push for a new \"alliance\" between the bloc and Britain.  His plan includes creating a new continental structure, which would see \"concentric circles\" with the EU and eurozone at its core and the UK in a second ring.  The claims emerged after Michel Barnier, the EU\u0027s chief negotiator, struck an optimistic tone, pointing to meeting Mrs May\u0026rsquos desire to get a bespoke Brexit deal. He said: \"We are prepared to offer Britain a partnership such as there never has been with any other third country.\"  As the deadline to Brexit approaches, London is intensifying its withdrawal agenda with \u0026ldquocontinuous talks.

His fundraiser had last night raised almost \u0026pound90,000 to cover his legal bills, smashing his target of \u0026pound50,000 in less than 12 hours.  But some independence supporters branded it \u0026ldquorepulsive and \u0026ldquoremarkably dispiriting, and took issue with his apparent attempt to link it with the constitution.  Nicola Sturgeon has insisted she fully supports the investigation led by the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans. Two civil servants have made complaints about Mr Salmond\u0027s behaviour dating back to his time as first minister.  But high-profile figures within the SNP threw their weight behind Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos court bid.  Colin Beattie MSP, the SNP\u0026rsquos national treasurer, appeared to contribute \u0026pound20 towards the fundraiser. He did not respond to multiple attempts to contact him, and the donation was later removed.  SNP MP Angus MacNeil also appeared to welcome the appeal on Twitter, and even retweeted one user who said: \u0026ldquoCan\u0026rsquot help but think this is a terrible indictment of the SNP\u0026rsquos disciplinary culture. Innocent until proven guilty!

Posting a link to his fundraiser on Wednesday night, Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos Twitter account claimed he was putting Scottish independence first through his decision to resign his SNP membership.  The tweet read: \"Salmond puts Scottish independence first. Help support the costs of Alex Salmond\u0027s Judicial Review in the Court of Session.\"  Lawyer and pro-independence commentator Andrew Tickell labelled it \u0026ldquoremarkably dispiriting.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe former first minister is accused of sexual assault. We have no idea where the truth lies. We presume him to be innocent. Where is the authentic locus to bring the constitution into this?  Former Labour first minister Jack McConnell was among those who urged people to donate to charities helping victims of sexual assault and harassment. Other Labour figures called on supporters to donate to Women\u0026rsquos Aid.  Posting a link to a Women\u0027s Aid donation page, Labour MP Danielle Rowley said: \"Instead of donating to a rich and powerful man, I have a better idea.\"  In what some interpreted as a coded rebuke of Mr Salmond, Ms Sturgeon also tweeted her support for a Women\u0026rsquos Aid campaign against the UK Government on Thursday afternoon.

An open meeting, ‘Winter Fodder – Dealing with a Shortage’ was held on Friday, August 17 at Thainstone Centre and farmers heard about different strategies to help with winter fodder budgeting, managing stock numbers, and alternative fodder and bedding options.                                                    Farm Profit Programme advisors Declan Marren and Robert Gilchrist, along with focus farmers Scott Duguid, Andrew Biffen and Jim Gammie shared their on-farm successes and strategies.                                                    John Gregor, Executive Director at ANM Group and Chairman of the event, said: “We are pleased with the success of this event and strong attendance from the farming community. The Farm Profit Programme advisors and focus farmers did an excellent job sharing their expertise and provided a wide range of practical steps available to farmers as they plan for the winter ahead. It is incredible how a number of small changes can make a significant difference to the fodder challenge.        “ANM is committed to supporting our members and more information is available by contacting our Farm Profit Programme advisors or by getting involved in a focus group.”At the outset, farmers were urged to create a winter fodder plan by determining current levels of fodder supplies, how many animals they need to feed, and the extra fodder required.  To reduce fodder and increase commercial productivity, Mr Gilchrist advised to implement a strict bulling period, scan for pregnant cows 40 days later, and cull the poor performing, non-pregnant cows to achieve 90-100% fertility rate in the herd. This will ensure the calving interval is shorter for next spring and reduce the number of animals on the farm this winter.By identifying non-pregnant cows earlier, they can be removed from the system before the expensive winter period. The next decision to make is whether or not it is worth feeding them prior to the sale. Where grass and fodder reserves are extremely tight, selling will be the best option. Where younger, easier fleshed cows are scanned not in-calf and are thin, it may be worth feeding them for a short period to increase the sale value. Feeding 5kg concentrates at grass for five weeks pre-sale will cost £35 but has the potential to increase cow weight by 52kg and the overall value of the cow by over £130 per cow.                                                                                                        Next, weaning calves early in October will help maintain cows’ weight leading up to winter, as cows utilise this condition throughout winter before the calving period begins. Supplementing growing calves instead of cows will realise a better conversion of around 4kg of concentrate to 1kg of live weight gain, which is the preferred option rather than trying to build up flesh in cows whose feed-to-gain efficiency will be poorer.Mr Marren reported that there is a fantastic opportunity to increase fodder supplies as the soil temperature is currently above the seasonal average at 14°Celsius and grass is growing at the rate of 40-50kg of dry matter produced per hectare. Farmers also have the chance to optimise grass growth by blanket spreading nitrogen across the whole farm. Nitrogen can be spread right up until early September with the confidence that you will receive an economical response to the application. Applying 40kg of nitrogen per hectare will grow at least an extra 600kg of dry matter per hectare at the cost of £35 per hectare.Alternative bedding options presented on the day included woodchip, recycled wood, sand and rushes. Once the animals are housed, one option for farmers is to replace 6kg of silage with 1kg of straw and 1kg of barley per day for one month. Over a four-week period and 63 cows, this will result in 11 tonnes less of fodder supplies used. While, focus farmer Jim Gammie reported success using woodchips over the last two years, which he is also composting for further land use.Those interested in finding out more or getting involved in a focus group, are invited to get in touch with Declan or Robert on 01467 623 838 or farmprofit@anmgroup, or by stopping by the Farm Profit Programme office located in the concourse at Thainstone Centre.

However after discussing the plan at a meeting of the Garioch Area Committee on Tuesday, August 28, councillors decided to refuse the application.                                                    During the debate, councillors said that their decision was made as they felt the business case was not robust enough, that what the Partnership were prepared to pay was too low compared to the value of the estate, and the model by which they proposed operating it was not financially sustainable.        Members of the committee told the Partnership that this was not a straightforward decision, which was given the correct amount of scrutiny as a result. The debate referenced an amount of misinformation locally about the Community Campus and what it will provide.They stressed that the new facility will add more community space to the town, which can be used alongside the school, not in isolation.The perception that the community will only get access out with school hours is not the case, and the facility has been designed to ensure the community and school will use the premises side-by-side.                                                                                                         Speaking after the meeting, Garioch Area Committee Chair Cllr Fergus Hood said: “Committee took this decision today based on the application before us.“The application and business case we scrutinised did not fully articulate either the community or financial benefits of this transfer. “It is our view, and that of officers in their recommendations, that this application was not detailed enough, not fully thought-out and placed a number of expectations and burdens on Aberdeenshire Council.“The offer from officers and members still stands, we would like to work with the Garioch Partnership to find them a more suitable location for a third sector hub.                                                                                                        “We support the aspiration behind this application but we do not think that this application we saw today will fulfil this need.” Market Place School closed its doors in October last year and its pupils relocated to Uryside School.The town centre building has been vacant since.

Colin Clark, MP for Gordon, said that retailers will have to reflect vastly lower yields due to the prolonged hot and dry weather this summer.                                                    He also suggested that supermarkets will increase the range of what can be packed in order to keep prices down.                                                    Mr Clark is a shareholder in a vegetable growing and packing company based near Inverness supplying carrots and potatoes to supermarkets.        Speaking during a visit to a farm in Moray, Mr Clark said: “This has been the worst drought since 1976 but it is a wake-up call for the supermarkets.“I have been involved in supplying fresh produce to the supermarkets for almost 30 years. Farmers and growers have become so professional that supermarkets and perhaps customers no longer understand how fragile the supply chain is.“Scotland will come into its own this year with availability of water and serious investment in irrigation.“Retailers will have to reflect vastly lower yields due to the hot dry weather. The east coast and the southern half of England have disastrous yields, crops have wilted and failed, the same is true across Europe.                                                                                                         “Supermarkets will increase the range of what can be packed to keep prices down. “With less intense farming plant disease pressure is less, traditional rotations and precision farming give Scottish vegetable growers serious advantages.“Climate change predictions suggest the use of water will become critical and UK producers will have to be more efficient.”Mr Clark also sounded a note of warning about the ongoing row over UK-wide frameworks in areas like agriculture post-Brexit.                                                                                                        He said: “The vast majority of output is supplied south of the border to national supermarkets who value the quality of Scottish produce.“A fully integrated UK market is essential to Scottish farming. This year more than any other shows how important food security is and the opportunity for Scottish growers to displace imports.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"strong prices at thainstone collective sale","story":"        Over 2,000 buyers and sellers attended the latest collective sale of plant, machinery and equipment at Thainstone.

Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Friday 31 Aug 2018 7:44 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117108.jpg","title":"Dont be put off if youre being bullied employees are told after Scrabster complaint is rejected by tribunal","story":"A LOCAL advice service is stressing that although a tribunal has rejected a complaint of workplace bullying made by a Scottish Government agency employee, others should not be deterred from launching similar action.DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment while employed as a fisheries officer for Marine Scotland at Scrabster harbour, but a tribunal this week ruled against her in the case.Speaking to the Groat, Iain Gregory, the deputy manager of Caithness Citizens\u0027 Advice Bureau , stressed that bullying regularly takes place in the workplace, and each year he hears numerous complaints.\"Clients feel that they have been the victim of unfair dismissal, discriminatory treatment, bullying or other types of incorrect treatment,\" he said.\"Anyone who feels they have been the victim of such conduct or treatment should never be deterred from reporting the matter.\"DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment after she became a \"whistleblower\" while employed as a fisheries officer at Marine Scotland at Scrabster.The 49-year-old Canadian national told an employment tribunal in Aberdeen recently that she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards between 2015 and 2017, and claimed she was targeted with sexual harassment, for being a woman, and because of her age.In a previous hearing, Ms Fitzpatrick had also alleged that she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010.The employment tribunal, however, ruled against Ms Fitzpatrick in its decision on the case.In its judgment, it said it could not agree whether the cards came from current colleagues, and is understood to have been unable to consider the chair allegation as it was said to have taken place more than three years before the complaint was brought.Mr Gregory says that each year CAB deals with a \"substantial number\" of bullying cases, each of which is examined carefully and then detailed evidence is obtained.He says in many cases CAB is able to resolve matters without progression to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service  or to a tribunal \u0026ndash \"perhaps by raising a grievance with the employer or by negotiation\".He added: \"However, there are numerous cases which require referral via ACAS and we can often resolve issues at this point by using the \u0027Early Conciliation\u0027 process.\"He underlined that it is \"comparatively unusual\" for a case to proceed to tribunal, with only a \"small percentage\" going that far.\"While it would be inappropriate to comment on any case in which we were not involved, I would stress that people should not under any circumstances be dissuaded from pursuing their rights,\" Mr Gregory said.\"The system exists to ensure that your case can and will be properly considered and we can advise you and make sure that you understand it.\"Friday 31 Aug 2018 7:44 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Jobs boost for AMTE Power in Thurso","story":"THE number of staff at a Thurso business is to increase by 25 per cent over the next year following a partnership deal with a British technology company.The workforce at AMTE Power Ltd, based at Thurso Business Park, is expected to rise from 32 to 40 following the deal with QinetiQ whose headquarters are in Farnborough in Hampshire.

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Friday 31 Aug 2018 7:44 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

This is a deal with one of the biggest names in international air travel, and we see it as the start of a partnership that will develop into a full codeshare agreement later in the year.”Gokhan Haciibrahimoglu, general manager of Turkish Airlines Scotland said: “We are pleased to be working with Loganair for our flights operating from Edinburgh Airport, thus giving Turkish Airlines the opportunity to extend its network and better serve Scotland. Our partnership will allow both of our passengers to easily connect with the regional airports of North and West Scotland to over 304 destinations and 122 countries.”The move is the latest in Loganair’s Better Connected programme, which aims to provide the Scottish airline’s key destinations with a wide range of links both for local community travelling worldwide \u0026#8211 but just as importantly to also enable incoming visitors, whether for tourism or business, to enjoy ease of booking and ease of access.Deals have already been signed with Air France, Dutch giants KLM, Emirates, Thomas Cook Airlines, and customers can through-ticket and through-check baggage where flights connect at Glasgow, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Inverness and Norwich. Single ticket booking for ongoing flights with more than one carrier offers multiple benefits including through check-in, protected connections in the event of delays and, importantly, the APD saving on flights from the Highlands and Islands which can be as much as £78 per person if connecting onwards to long-haul destinations.The partnerships with KLM and Air France allow passengers from all Loganair’s Highlands \u0026amp Islands destinations to travel via Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow or Inverness onto KLM flights to Amsterdam and from there to destinations worldwide and via Aberdeen and Edinburgh to Air France flights to Paris Charles de Gaulle and again onwards to destinations worldwide.The deal with Thomas Cook Airlines allows holiday connections from the Highlands and Islands via Glasgow to destinations including the USA, and the same will apply to Emirates services to the Middle East and to the Far East and Australia.The Thomas Cook partnership also provides long-haul connections from Inverness and Norwich via Manchester to destinations including New York, Los Angeles, Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, Orlando and Las Vegas on a single ticket.It also complements codeshare arrangements Loganair already has in place with British Airways and its partner airlines at Manchester, offering connectivity to transatlantic routes, including Chicago and Philadelphia, with onward connections throughout the US.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It sounds like a long time, but my experience of these things is that it catches up on you very quickly and there’s a lot of work to do between now and then.”Excellent communication and interpersonal skills, in addition to good team-working are vital attributes. However, notably, an interest in sport is not essential.The voluntary services of personnel with experience in event planning, fundraising and sponsorship, business and project management, procurement, marketing and PR, communication and strategic planning, are also being sought.Mr Deans added: “We’re looking for people with the skills, but they really need that long-term commitment and time to devote to this.”Recruitment information and an online application can be found at www.oiga.org.uk/organising-committee-recruitment-statement/For further information, and any queries, email info@oiga.org.uk.The deadline for applications is Saturday, September 29.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Local residents are digging in the last few metres of cable to more than 35 per cent of the properties.Community spokesman Steve Jones said: \"It\u0026rsquos a tremendously exciting time. Like many residents I\u0026rsquove only been getting very slow speeds capped at 0.5Mbps, making even the most basic of online activities difficult and frustrating, so looking forward to ultrafast speeds is fantastic.\"Fast, reliable broadband will bring huge potential to regenerate our scattered communities. It\u0026rsquos a prerequisite for attracting families and businesses to the area, where the population has fallen in recent years. People now expect good internet as a basic. In essence, it will help us to build a closer and more integrated community.\"Lesley Negri, who runs the historic Aultguish Inn near Garve with her husband Dario, added: \"It will make a huge difference to us, especially for our booking system and payments.\"At the moment everything slows down from 4pm and we can\u0026rsquot manage customer expectations. Many of our customers want to stream things or download photographs and it\u0026rsquos impossible to do that at the moment. We\u0026rsquove lived with slow broadband for so long that we can\u0026rsquot imagine what it\u0026rsquos going to be like when we can access ultrafast speeds!\"Friday 31 Aug 2018 7:44 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Although the provision of public toilets is a non-statutory function of local authorities, the Scottish Government ensured that the criteria for the fund did include capital support for toilet provision, where there was a demonstrable need.\"She added that she was aware of the council\u0026rsquos toilet closure plans and said she had \"personally pressed\" the local authority to reconsider.Council leader Margaret Davidson said the cuts were part of wider measures to \"balance the budget and safeguard essential services\" amid a climate of reduced funding for councils across Scotland and the wider UK.What do YOU think?

It consists of a retail box of fresh fish, sent directly to consumers all over the UK within hours of being landed. Fishbox now boasts in excess of 2000 subscribers with 100 new customers signing up every month.Mr Houston told the North Star: \"These are very exciting times for us. We will leave the Inverness premises on August 24. We have simply outgrown the premises and all of Coast \u0026amp Glen will relocate to Alness.\u0026nbsp We currently have 14 staff, plus four staff we have taken on from Summer Isles and are recruiting a further eight staff. There will me more next year too.\"Fishbox currently employs nine staff and this will increase next year too. We have big expansion plans for both companies.\"The award-winning businessman, a former motorcycle racer who taught himself the trade after a bad crash, has built up Coast \u0026amp Glen to a turnover exceeding \u0026pound2.2 million. The combined turnover for the two companies at the end of this year is set to top \u0026pound3m.His change in direction came by chance whilst out on a fishing boat. He went on to buy a small 21ft fishing boat, teaching himself from YouTube and Google. He decided to start selling his own catch and found the demand was so high he started selling from other boats. With the high demand from restaurants for a wider iety of products, Coast \u0026amp Glen was born.He said: \"I have always thought it\u0026rsquos very important to support the local community with jobs. It would be much easier for us to send fish to Glasgow to get processed just like majority of the salmon companies do and the whisky companies do for the bottling of their whisky, but that would have an impact on the area I was born and brought up in.\"This was the reason that I put a lot of time pressure on the people involved in the transition of the purchase of Summer Isles Foods.\"Friday 31 Aug 2018 7:45 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Other artefacts include a medieval shoe, a 300-year-old smoking pipe and part of a 12th-century jug.             Experts say the pieces represent a time capsule of life in Edinburgh through the ages.            Most of the finds were discovered in or around the Abbey Strand buildings in the Canongate, which are among the oldest surviving structures in the Scottish capital.They were revealed during archaeological investigations being carried out as part of a £10 million overhaul of facilities at the palace. Digs have revealed timber posts dating back to the 12th century, representing the earliest evidence of settlement on the site. It’s thought they may mark the location of a terrace that led to what was once a low-lying island, on which Holyrood Abbey was built in 1128.Bones of Highland cattle found in the Abbey Strand gardens provide evidence of trading between Edinburgh and the Highlands and Western Isles.             Other animal bones, a large quantity of oyster shells and fragments of wine bottles give an insight into the diets of courtiers and ambassadors who stayed at the royal residences during the reigns of Mary, Queen of Scots and King James VI. One of the oldest finds is a medieval leather shoe, discovered beneath one of the cellars in the Abbey Strand. Wine and spirit bottles, food debris and fragments of children’s games stem from the 18th and 19th centuries, providing a glimpse of life for 25 impoverished families living in cramped tenements at Holyrood at the time. Investigations in the palace grounds found evidence of how the site has changed through the centuries, from the flower gardens and orchards of the 12th-century monastery to formal gardens during the time of Mary, Queen of Scots and a physic garden that inspired the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh.Pottery remnants uncovered include part of a 12th-century green-glazed jug, which was imported from Europe.              A clay pipe dating from the 17th century bears the initials of one of Scotland’s earliest pipe-makers.Among the more unusual discoveries is the complete skeleton of a horse, uncovered under the lawn next to the palace forecourt. This area was close to the site of a medieval graveyard serving the Canongate, but when and why the animal was buried there remains a mystery.Gordon Ewart, of Kirkdale Archaeology, which led the dig, said: “The survey has provided a unique opportunity to understand more about the fascinating development of the Abbey Strand and its surroundings, and to explore how the site has been the historic and symbolic bridge between the palace and the city of Edinburgh for centuries.”Holyrood was first founded as an Augustinian abbey in 1128. According to legend, it was built on the spot where King David I had a religious vision while out hunting deer on Holy Cross Day.After Edinburgh became the capital of Scotland in 1437, successive monarchs opted to stay in the royal chambers at the abbey rather than at the less comfortable castle a mile up the road. This sparked numerous developments and additions over the years.            Today the Palace of Holyroodhouse is the Queen’s official residence in Scotland, but it has a colourful history going back several centuries. It was in its tower that Mary, Queen of Scots witnessed the brutal murder of her Italian secretary and rumoured lover at the hands of her husband.Robert the Bruce hosted parliament there in 1326 it was occupied by Oliver Cromwell in 1650 during the civil war and Bonnie Prince Charlie held court at the palace during his 1745 bid to restore the Catholic line to the British throne."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4783471.1534192405!/image/image.jpg","title":"chris bambery how scotland s own occupy movement took over edinburgh 80 years ago","story":"        Frustration and anger at rising inequality is nothing new, as a largely forgotten chapter of Scotland\u0026#8217s history of protest shows, writes Chris Bambery                In June 1933, for three days and nights, jobless protesters occupied the centre of Edinburgh, sleeping out on Princes Street under the windows of the city elite’s gentlemen’s clubs.            An army of the unemployed descended on Edinburgh from all corners of Scotland. With them were bands, field kitchens and banners. Each marcher had a knapsack and blanket. The goal of the marchers was to meet with Sir Godfrey Collins, Secretary of State for Scotland, to demand the abolition of the means test, increased relief for men, women and children and for work schemes to provide jobs. The city authorities made it clear the marchers were not welcome and they would provide no accommodation or food.            The march was organised by the Communist-led National Unemployed Workers Movement , whose Scottish organiser was the veteran agitator, Harry McShane, but it won support from the Independent Labour Party, the trade unions and Labour Party. The Aberdeen and Dundee contingents marched south to join with the Fife contingent in Kirkcaldy. The Ayrshire contingent joined with Lanarkshire marching via Shotts and East Calder. The Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire contingents, including a women’s section marched via Glasgow, Coatbridge, Airdrie, Bathgate, and Broxburn. The main Glasgow contingent marched to Kilsyth and Falkirk, where they joined with Stirlingshire, and onto Edinburgh via Bo’ness.READ MORE: Video: Rare footage of Edinburgh in the 1930sOn Sunday 12 June, they joined up in Costorphine for their entry into the capital. The next day 20,000 people greeted them at the Mound. The first sign of a thaw on the part of the authorities was when the Ministries of Labour, Health and Education agreed to meet delegations of marchers. But there was still no reply from Collins. A second victory was when the police lifted a ban on street collections. But Collins refused to meet with them.The NUWM members paraded through the royal palace of Holyrood with their band playing ‘The Internationale’ and other socialist tunes, and when the city council refused to provide accommodation their leader, Harry McShane, said they’d sleep on the pavement of Princes Street, the city’s most prestigious thoroughfare, as marcher William McVicar recalled: “I think someone offered us somewhere [to sleep] like Waverley Market or somethin’. And McShane and them wouldn’t accept that, they says, ‘No, no, we’re not going there.’ So they says, ‘Oh well, we cannae give you anything else.’ And of course he says, ‘Right we’ll sleep in Princes Street.’” The Edinburgh Evening News reported McShane telling the marchers as they gathered on the south side of Princes Street: “So far here we are and here we stay until another decision is reached. We can breakfast, dinner or tea here, and the men require a rest. They can have that rest in Princes Street. We have decided to give them a long lie in ‘bed’ this morning.” The Edinburgh Dispatch caught the mood among the ordinary folk of Edinburgh as they made thier way along Princes Street on that first morning: “Walking along on the carriageway one heard snatches of conversation: ‘Slept well?’ ‘How did ye enjoy yer feather bed?’ ‘Did ye feel a draught coming in during the night?’”            On the first morning, women marchers blocked the tramway while men shaved using their reflections in the windows of the big department stores. Tom Ferns remembers: “And they couldnae ha’ picked a better spot than Princes Street. Under the Conservative Party headquarters, the Liberal Party headquarters and the big luxury hotels, here was hundreds and hundreds o’ angry unemployed. Obviously a sight like that is not seen every day, particularly in the capital city of Edinburgh.”READ MORE: Astonishing press photographs capture interwar-era EdinburghAnother marcher, James Allison, said, “the police were going mad”. Yet Edinburgh police were not keen on inciting a pitched battle as Hugh Sloan recalled: “At dinner time, our field-kitchen came along and the police chief told Harry McShane, ‘This is Princes Street, you can’t feed here.’ Harry told them, ‘It was good enough for us to sleep here, it’s good enough for us to feed here.’” The marchers then demanded free transport home. Eventually the city’s chief constable and deputy town clerk told them they would provide transport if McShane guaranteed there would be no more marches to Edinburgh. He refused and the chief constable, worried about disturbances on the capital’s streets, backed down. Transport was then provided to take the marchers home.            On the last night, the marchers and their supporters gathered to burn an effigy of Sir Godfrey Collins before boarding buses and a final meal paid for by the city council. The march organisers refused to give a guarantee that no further hunger marchers would defile the city!Throughout the 1930s, the unemployed protested but the NUWM also organised children’s parties in the summer and at Christmas. A number of the marchers would go on to fight in the Spanish Civil War, including the leader of the Aberdeen contingent, Bob Cooney.The inter-war period, not just the “Hungry Thirties”, was grim in Scotland. Prior to the First World War, it had been at the cutting edge of British industry. Within a few years of the wars end the traditional industries, coal, steel and shipbuilding were in trouble. Scottish banks and companies were bought up by their bigger English rivals. Unemployment was a permanent feature, peaking in the 1930s and only ending with the demands of the Second World War.The shale mining industry collapsed, for example, as cheap imported oil cut demand for paraffin. In December 1925, “The Scotsman” reported from Tarbrax, a shale mining village then in South Lanarkshire under the headline “Situation at Tarbrax: Faced With Starvation,” which reported: “Workers from Tarbrax, to the number of nearly 400, marched in procession to Carnwath, nearly ten miles distant, on Thursday night last for the purpose of asking poor relief. Relief under the emergency clause of the Poor Law Act, which enables people in a state of absolute destitution to get relief, has been given to a number of people in Tarbrax on the recommendation of the doctor there. A meeting of Carnwath Parish Council has been called for today to consider the whole situation.”  Starvation – it’s a strong word. My father was little over a year old when the mine at Tarbrax shut. His father would have been on that cold December march before briefly finding work at another pit nearby, then giving up and coming to Edinburgh in search of work. He was without a permanent job until the end of the 1930s.

The devolved Parliament was supposed to find Scottish solutions to Scottish problems, but too often it has done little more than tinker at the edges of the big issues, writes Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard.                Next year marks the 20th anniversary of the election of the first Scottish Parliament, so now is a good time to look back in order to set our forward direction.              As Labour stalwart Tom Johnston once said, a people which does not understand the past, will never comprehend the present, nor mould the future.                And for me it is unashamedly personal as well as political. One of my first jobs when I went to work for the Scottish TUC in the early 1990s, was to help develop an ‘agenda’ for the Scottish Parliament entitled “Power for Change”.  The clue is in the name. We were constructing the case for a devolved Scottish Parliament based on some important principles. Some of them were defensive, like the creation of a Parliament that would be a bulwark against Tory Governments at Westminster, others democratic like the replacement of appointed Scottish Office Ministers with a directly elected Parliament.But others again were constructed on the case that not only could we design and implement Scottish solutions to Scottish problems, but that we could also start to develop a more radical programme for Government.    The aim was to tackle the big challenges, including long-term structural weaknesses in the Scottish economy, and deliver a new agenda for Scotland’s public services, health, housing, transport and all with a cultural dimension. It was power for a purpose: it was power for change.            The Parliament has achieved much: land reform, homelessness legislation, and bold climate change targets. But yet, many of those ambitions remain unrealised and what’s worse, there is all too often an air of complacency, even indifference inside the Parliament on the Government benches.READ MORE: Richard Leonard: How public money is used to exploit Scottish workersThis has led to too much tinkering at the edges of problems: and so too much timidity and mediocrity. As a result, there is no bulwark against Tory austerity in the way that we envisaged. The Parliament looks too often like a factory conveyor belt than a workshop where we build Scottish solutions to Scottish problems.The structural problems of the Scottish economy are largely untackled. So, we still rely on just 70 producers for 50 per cent of all our export value. Five firms account for 26 per cent of all research and development by businesses.             Moreover, instead of building up our indigenous industrial base we have seen an even greater slide into a branch plant economic model, which is reliant on decisions made by remote big businesses. There is no industrial strategy at work and a singular lack of economic planning even of the first order. So, we spend on renewable energy, but fail to generate the work in the supply chain.There are those who will argue that the reason for this failure is that we do not have political independence. However, the devolved Scottish Parliament does have the powers to tackle many of these challenges, it is just that the SNP Government chooses not to use them.Meeting people in communities across Scotland – from the Shetland Isles in the north, to the Outer Hebrides in the west, and the Mull of Galloway in the south over the past few weeks – three issues came up time and again: the crisis in the NHS, the shortage of suitable housing, particularly public and housing association provided homes, and the continued squeeze on working people – including those in retirement – as a direct result of austerity. READ MORE: Richard Leonard: We can’t go back to the old style of politicsAnd just this week Scottish Labour revealed that the number of children living in poverty, despite having a parent in work, has soared to 40,000. The figure was even worse if the parents could only find part-time jobs.            It is clear that our economy desperately needs real change, not more of the same. Labour would take radical action to drive up incomes with a £10 per hour minimum wage, an end to zero-hours contracts and a £260 increase to Child Benefit, by using Holyrood’s powers over social security. Any government simply has to be judged on its actions, not its words. You cannot truthfully be said to be ‘Scotland’s champion’ while our NHS stumbles through one crisis after another, whilst police numbers are going down, when our many of our schools are struggling, and when the attainment at Higher level is in decline.We are now offering a radical agenda for change that the SNP Government is simply unwilling to match. They have failed to deliver in the areas of Scotland that needed extra support the most. Labour is the only party that offers a government that will fight for real change for working people across the country.So, let us start in this new session of Parliament with the new powers we have to improve the income of our pensioners who have served this society well, but let us also start using the old powers to put people back to work on a warm homes programme which meets an outstanding social, environmental and economic need.  The summer recess is normally a time for reflection, renewal and action, but by taking Labour’s message across the country, I have been showing how our party will deliver a government that works for all of Scotland, one that is on the side of communities and workers.That’s why I want to go to the people of Scotland in 2021 with the most radical social and economic manifesto for change in the history of the Parliament – one that is true to those founding principles which drove the campaign for the Scottish Parliament. And that is one which recognises real change is possible and that we can mould the future."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4791412.1535695419!/image/image.jpg","title":"scott macnab alex salmond saga taking its toll on nicola sturgeon","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

Britain’s competition watchdog has provisionally cleared the deal which would reduce the Big Six energy suppliers to just five.            The Competition and Markets Authority  dismissed fears that the tie-up would have an impact on the most expensive deals as its inquiry found the providers do not compete closely on standard iable tariffs .            There had been initial concerns that the proposed merger would affect these tariffs – the most common and expensive energy deals.Anne Lambert, chairwoman of the inquiry group at the CMA, said: “With more than 70 energy companies out there, we have found that there is plenty of choice when people shop around.“But many people don’t shop around for their energy. So, we carefully scrutinised this deal, in particular how it would impact people who pay the more expensive standard iable prices.“Our analysis shows that the merger will not impact how SSE and Npower set their SVT prices because they are not close rivals for these customers.”SSE chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies said: “Following a thorough and in-depth investigation, we are pleased the CMA has provisionally concluded that the proposed merger of SSE Energy Services and Npower does not raise competition concerns.            “The scale and pace of change in the GB energy market continues to be significant and requires us to evolve to stay relevant, competitive and sustainable.“We look forward to continuing to engage with the CMA as it prepares its final report ahead of the statutory deadline in October.”SSE and Npower announced in November that their UK household energy supply and services businesses would join forces.Under the deal, the new company would be listed on the London Stock Exchange with SSE shareholders holding 65.6 per cent and Npower owner Innogy holding 34.4 per cent.

Opponents question whether he needs such assistance, but there is also a wider fear it may deter women coming forward in future to make complaints against similarly powerful figures if this is the kind of PR offensive that can be mounted.            Almost £90,000 had been raised last night, with the tally still rising. To some this will be taken as evidence that the much of the grassroots Nationalist movement is backing Salmond. In fairness, it should be said 3,500 donors is set against the 100,000-plus membership of the SNP.But the concern about the impact on future victims appeared to strike a chord with Nicola Sturgeon and the party’s Westminster leader Ian Blackford yesterday.READ MORE: Alex Salmond hits £50,000 crowdfunding target within hours of quitting SNPAs Mr Salmond’s funding drive smashed through its £50,000 target, the First Minister took time out to urge her social media followers to back a Women’s Aid campaign calling for the so called “rape clause” to be axed south of the Border because it is viewed as “anti women”.It has a been a near-impossible situation for Ms Sturgeon and the strain is visibly taking its toll on her. She has rightly stood by the head of the civil service, Leslie Evans, over the process that was introduced last year and used to investigate Mr Salmond.            He has sought to raise questions over the civil servant’s role in this affair, insisting he has been denied a fair hearing, both because of the process used and in the way details of the case emerged in the media.  It is a case of “sustained” leaking from St Andrew’s House, according to Mr Salmond, but Ms Sturgeon is also feeling the pressure from her party.Senior figures were not happy Michelle Thomson was pressured into resigning the party whip when allegations of mortgage fraud emerged against her. The former Edinburgh West MP was later cleared after a lengthy probe, but lost her seat. That split in loyalties to her political mentor and the rights of women making claims is a dilemma Ms Sturgeon could do without as Scottish political hostilities resume when Parliament returns from its summer recess next week.

The Scottish Government announced yesterday that salaried doctors and dentists earning less than £80,000 a year will receive the rise in 2018-19 which is backdated to 1 April 2018.             Independent contractor GPs will also receive a 3 per cent rise, compared to the 2 per cent deal south of the border.            Health secretary Jeane Freeman insisted staff are getting “fair pay increases”.She said: “Scotland’s health service is founded on the incredible contribution of its staff and this agreement recognises the role played by our doctors and dentists. “This pay increase will be backdated to 1 April – something that is not happening in England. “It follows our minimum 9 per cent rise for NHS Agenda for Change employees over the next three years – which will give those 147,000 employees the best pay conditions in the UK.“By offering fair pay increases we can help to support recruitment and retention of staff.”            But any increase in pay for salaried doctors and dentists earning more than £80,000 will be capped at £1,600 – something BMA Scotland chair Peter Bennie \u2028branded “extremely disappointing”.He said: “This announcement comes amid significant shortages of doctors across our health system due to huge challenges of recruitment and retention and years of below inflation pay rises which have meant real terms reductions in pay rates of around 20 per cent over the last 10 years across the profession. “Today’s announcement makes very little impact on that long term trend. “We recognise the Scottish Government has not mirrored the completely unacceptable decisions made by the Westminster Government on doctors’ pay in England, particularly by rightly applying the award across the whole financial year.”             Miles Briggs, Scottish Conservative shadow health secretary, said: “Competitive salaries are only part of the reason people work in our NHS and with morale at rock bottom, it is clear some staff are being driven out due to SNP mismanagement.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006. Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what, if any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen  and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades. Munro, who left in 1997 and was replaced by Canadian singer Bruce Guthro, will be on stage as a special guest this weekend.\n\nJones’ hopes for a legacy of music that people can continue to enjoy, and be inspired by, seem assured.\nHe adds: “Even though the band’s touring and performing life will have finished, I hope that people will continue to enjoy and discover our music for many years to come, perhaps giving inspiration to musicians that will follow on from us, in the knowledge that if you stick to your own path, be true to your musical roots and retain an open mind, great things may happen.”\nAs for the future – the band say it might be the end for Runrig, but it won’t mean retirement or the end of their music-making careers.\nSaid Jones: “The first thing to say is that there will be a long wind-down period – for instance we’ll film and record Stirling, so that will have to be worked on and brought to some sort of completion, plus there is the whole ongoing administration of the band archive and legacy which may lead to some interesting sideline projects.\n“Beyond that, we’ll all still be involved with our own individual performing, writing and music-making projects – that’s something you never retire from.\n“Personally, I’ll miss the band dreadfully but on the positive side I’ll spend more time on Skye plus I’ll have time to learn some new accordion tunes!”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/001WH1708NCA.jpg","title":"oidhche mhath runrig whfp editorial 24 8","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n night spoke for the Highlands.\nThe unassuming Malcolm has often been a coolly detached figure on stage, concentrating solely on his guitar.\nBut he has been playing with the Run Rig Dance and Ceilidh Band since he was 17 years old and he is now in his 60th year. The emotion of the Last Dance caught up.\nIn the dark, under the ramparts of Stirling Castle, over two long nights it caught up with 50,000 people.\nThe concert itself was, as you might have hoped, more of a celebration than a wake.\nIt was the biggest outdoor Highland wedding reception you\u0026#8217ve ever known, with the best ceilidh band in the world playing.

They still look like the boys from the dance hall, even though the boys are now virtuosos.\nGaelic was woven into every moment of Friday and Saturday nights, from the Glasgow Islay choir singing with Donnie Munro to Malcolm Jones being projected onto the walls of Stirling Castle riffing MacCrimmon\u0026#8217s Lament.\nMost people might not have been there for that. Runrig and the legacy of fresh Gaelic musical talent that came in their wake are now bigger than their Highland infancy.\nBut whenever you listen to a Runrig song, there will always be an echo of that dance hall accordion, of Robert MacDonald, of Blair Douglas, of the island fan base that sent them on their way.\nIn the words of the title of their first, vinyl, album, they will always Play Gaelic.\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales.jpg","title":"uig to tarbert service delayed due to medical","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe 2.10 pm sailing from Uig, Skye to Tarbert, Harris on Wednesday  has been delayed due to a medical emergency.\nThe announcement was posted on the CalMac Service Info Twitter account around 2.45 pm, and a further post has since stated that subsequent sailings will be delayed.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27459  ","story":"Sinn Féin spokesperson for Business, Innovation and Enterprise Maurice Quinlivan TD\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The government is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming the apprenticeship system.

We want to build on the success of the traditionalcraft trades in Ireland such as plumbing, bricklaying and plastering, andexpand this way of learning, into a host of new fields.\n“Apprenticeships in fields such as green energy, retail, hospitality andfinancial services are hugely popular in other European countries. We aim toexpand the system into these areas to create different opportunities for allyoung people including more females and people with disabilities.”\n Currently,most apprenticeships are aimed towards male participants with just 160 out of13,589 people in apprenticeship programmes across the state being female in2018. In addition, the physically demanding nature of the current availableapprenticeships has resulted in just 1.7% of total apprentices in 2016 beingpeople with disabilities.\n\nSinnFéin aims to increase investment in apprenticeships to over €350 million perannum within five years. \nTheLimerick City TD, Deputy Quinlivan has said that this will “fund the treblingof the number apprenticeship programmes and provide places for 60,000apprentices”.\nDeputy Quinlivan continued: “€5,166,000 of investment will be required overfive years for the development of 63 new apprenticeship programmes, bringingthe total number of craft and new courses to 100.\n“Ireland’sallocation from the EU for training and education of the young is €68 million.Fine Gael was forced to return €19.8 million of this allocation in 2016, asthey failed to submit a payment application.\n“SinnFéin will ensure all EU monies allocated to Ireland would be fully utilised, tobenefit the education and training of our young people.

But more than that, it is an opportunity to do something about it and that opportunity should be grasped. \n\"While the letter from Pope Francis acknowledged that hurt and suffering, it needs to be followed with more than words action is required,\" he said. \nThe former minister said the Catholic church needs to cooperate with investigations into abuse and address the legacy of abuse by providing redress to victims. \n\"This issue is not going away. While I acknowledge that the Pope will meet a number of victims and survivors of clerical abuse and it is important that he hears and listens to their stories, more is needed. The Vatican must release any and all files it holds that would help investigations and inquiries into abuse by priests and religious in Ireland and it must also commit itself to providing redress, including financial redress to victims of abuse north and south,\" he said. \n\ntest\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27464  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\nThe first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades.\nToday, 24th August, marks the 50th anniversary of the first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon in County Tyrone. \nThe Brantry Republican Club, led by Annie Mary Gildernew, had campaigned against the lack of council housing in the area. \n spoke exclusively to Colm Gildernew, Sinn Féin MLA for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and grandson of Annie Mary or better known as ‘Nana’ Gildernew, about the first civil rights march and events leading to it.\n“Fifty years ago, on the 12th of October 1967, Dungannon District Council convened its monthly meeting.  \n“One of the decisions they were about to take would reverberate across decades and bring the northern Unionist state to its knees and, some argue, ultimately led to its demise as a one party Orange state.\n“The Brantry Sinn Fein Republican Club, under the leadership of Annie Mary Gildernew  had been trying to secure housing in the local area for nationalist families. \n“Dungannon Council refused point blank to build social housing in the Brantry area as this would also provide local nationalists with votes as well as housing.  \nInstead they agreed to build 15 houses in the then predominantly unionist village of Caledon and stated they would allocate these homes on the basis of half to unionists and half to nationalist families to ease the housing crisis.\n“At the council meeting this deal was reneged upon Unionist Councillor William Scott simply presented a list of 15 names which he had decided would be housed, no debate, no discussion, no democracy.\n“The Brantry Republican Club met immediately to assess their next move.  It was decided that they were left with no alternative but to take immediate and direct action.  \n“At 2am, on Friday the 13th of October members of the Gildernew, Goodfellow and McKenna families supported by the Brantry Republican club went to Caledon and took possession of two of the newly allocated homes,  including a three bedroom house which had been allocated to a single 19-year-old woman who worked for a Unionist election candidate.  \n“In May 1968, following a 6 month series of court action and coercion, the State’s patience gave way a force of policemen, led by the brother of the young single girl who had been allocated the house, evicted Nana Gildernew, her daughter Mary Theresa Goodfellow with a three-month old baby and two other small children, and her daughter in law Geraldine Gildernew, expecting me at the time and with two young children.  They were forcibly dragged from the house under the gaze of the world’s press. \n“This led to the organisation of the first Civil Rights March from Coalisland to Dungannon was 24th of August to protest the eviction. The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north.

They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment returning from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_935986.jpg--.jpg?1534836507000\n","title":"the sky s the limit for stephens catering equipment abseiling team","story":"  \n \n  \nAN adventurous group of employees from Stephens Catering Equipment are going to great heights to raise money for Northern Ireland Chest, Heart and Stroke charity.\n  \nThe 12 strong team will be abseiling from the Europa Hotel on September 23 and what makes this even more of a challenge for the team is that most of them are afraid of heights!\n  \nClaire Adair explained: “This is the first abseil for most of us and a real challenge. \n  \n“I wanted to arrange a charity event that will really make us face our fears. \n  \n“Most of us taking part have a fear of heights so it will be a huge challenge.

This is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK. \n  \nWe have heavily invested in research throughout the production chain and we have already implemented new ideas such as hot water heating, double barrier changing facilities in each house and other technologies which we firmly believe have had a major impact in reducing the number of our birds which can become infected with Campylobacter. \n  \nFurthermore, we are focusing on excellence in biosecurity and innovative processing technologies.\n  \n\n  \nOngoing challenges\n  \n\n  \nControlling infectious disease in poultry is an ongoing challenge Moy Park face, in particular avian influenza . To address this, they have upgraded their AI contingency planning, rewriting the rulebook in the past year to ensure they have a robust plan in place.\n  \nWe have to think carefully how we would react and prevent spread if AI came in to Northern Ireland and together with agencies and Government departments we exchange views regularly with working groups, in order to remain on top of this key issue, Peter said.\n  \n\n  \nCareer Highlight\n  \n\n  \nOver his 40 years with the company Peter said a key highlight has been promoting ownership and pride with the people he works closely with.\n  \nA back to basics approach is one of my fundamental pillars, and I still firmly believe that bird husbandry and welfare are key to producing a high-quality product.\n  \nThere are endless opportunities for those considering a career in agriculture and food production, and as my wife and son also work in the poultry industry, I can definitely vouch for that!\n  \nAs the world population continues to expand, the demand for goods also increases and food production, and those working in the industry, will have to keep up with this development.\n  \nBy strengthening our production capabilities over the past number of years, we are well placed to meet this demand, with poultry a healthy and versatile source of protein which is also good value for money.\n  \n\n  \nPositive outlook\n  \n\n  \nPeter concluded: As I look back on my time in the industry and at Moy Park, I’ve always started each morning the same way, and I think it has stood me in good stead!\n  \nThe first thing I think of is ‘today will bring a new challenge, a new opportunity and I will most likely learn something new’ as every day is a school day!”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_995387.jpg--.jpg?1535635242000\n","title":"superb gcse results for dunclug college","story":"  \nDUNCLUG College is celebrating historic levels of achievement at GCSE level. \n  \nAll students, including those with ious learning challenges sat a minimum of 7 GCSE subjects, including the compulsory core of English, Maths and Science and a range of GCSE optional choices in a balance of General and Applied courses.\n  \n Many gifted and competitive students sat 8, 9 or 10 subjects.

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

The Skoda man felt the format incurred unnecessary expense in terms of fuel costs.\n\u0026#8220The fuel isn\u0027t cheap and the cars run on it whether you are driving a stage or the road sections, said Bogie.

The results are amazing and they have clearly drawn inspiration from a iety of sources.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“I would like to congratulate all our finalists, Andrew Moore, James Magennis and Charles Leathem, who have each taken some of our iconic packaging and transformed it into a catwalk sensation, showcasing the raw talent of some of our stars of the future.”\n\nClaire Concannon, course co-ordinator from Belfast politan College, added: “Working with crisp packaging has been a very valuable learning experience for our ingenious students who have more than risen to the challenge. The judges had an almost impossible decision narrowing the entries down to just three finalists who all showed technical ability combined with creative flair and imagination. The finalists were then featured on the Tayto Northern Ireland facebook page with more than 2000 people voting for their favourite.\n\n“All three finalists should be very proud of what they have achieved and they have certainly made a lasting impact on the catwalk and attracted huge interest from those attending – it’s hard to believe that these are made from material more commonly seen on the production lines at Tayto Castle.\n\n“We would like to thank everyone who took the time to vote and for the many shares which helped to bring our students’ work to a wide audience.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTayto crisps have been made at Tayto Castle, Co Armagh, since 1956 when Thomas Hutchinson spotted a gap in the market to make tasty potato snacks. The company remains family-owned by the Hutchinsons and is now run by Thomas’s children. Since its beginnings more than 60 years ago, Tayto has grown into an international business, supplying crisps and snacks produced in Tandragee to more than 40 countries across the world.\n\nDuring the last 12 years, Tayto has acquired iconic crisp and snack brands, Golden Wonder, Real Crisps, Mr Porky, Jonathan Crisp and Portlebay Popcorn through its parent organisation Tayto Group. Across the Group, more than five million packets of crisps and snacks are produced each day at its six UK factories.

\n            \n\nPrincipal Mrs A McCullough said the results reward the hard work of the pupils, the dedication of the staff and very positive parental support. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“It is also important to recognise the contribution of our partners in the Banbridge Area Learning Community, “ she said. “This partnership allows us to offer a diverse range of subjects which affords pupils a wider choice at KS4.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“This year’s set of results reinforces our reputation as a high performing, non-selective secondary school. \n\n“Rathfriland High School has provided opportunities and opened doors across a diverse range of further education and training which will allow these leavers to choose whichever pathway most suits their skills and talents. \n\n“I would like to congratulate our pupils on their success, perseverance and industry. \n\n“I would also pay tribute to the talented and professional teaching staff who play a pivotal role in these achievements.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Parents also provide crucial

Championships clicked into gear at the weekend with a mixed bag of results for city teams.\nIn the Bathshack Antrim Senior Hurling Championship, St John’s booked their place in Group Two alongside Rossa and Loughgiel as they defeated Ballycastle 2-21 to 2-13at Corrigan Park in their second leg tie to win 59-37 on aggregate.\nThe Johnnies wasted no time in adding to their 14-point pre-game lead when Michael Bradley cracked home an early goal and while Kevin Barry McShane responded in kind for The Town, a Conor Johnston goal from a penalty gave the Whiterock side a 2-11 to 1-10 half-time lead.\nIt was plain sailing for the hosts in the second period with Johnston and Mícéal Dudley clipping over the scores and while Dermott McShane goaled for Ballycastle, this tie has long been settled.\nSt John’s will enter Group Two where the first game took place on Saturday lunchtime with Loughgiel romping to a 6-22 to 0-7 win over a badley depleted Rossa.\nShamrocks had this game decided by the break with Tiernan Coyle scrambling home their first goal on 13 minutes, while team captain, Shay Casey bagged two more before the interval to establish a 3-12 to 0-3 lead – Rossa’s scores coming from Stephen Beatty and Tiernan Murphy .\nThere was no let-up from Loughgiel in the second half as they emptied their bench.\nSian McGrath lobbed Danny Murray for goal number four on 51 minutes, while Dan McCloskey found the net twice more in the closing stages to complete the rout.\nIn Group One on Saturday evening, defending champions, Dunloy travelled to Cushendall and edged home by a point, 0-18 to 0-17.\n\nIntermediate Hurling Championship\nIn the Intermediate Hurling Championship, St Gall’s withstood three red cards to overcome Gort na Móna 4-10 to 2-11 on Sunday afternoon.\nMark Napier and Tomás O Cíarán hit first-half goals for St Gall’s before Conor Burke saw red, while Dessie McClean kept the Gorts in touch with a goal from a free to leave it 2-7 to 1-4 at the half.\nCJ McGourty and Jackson McGreevy plundered a further two St Gall’s goals early in the second half, but McGreevy and then Napier were both send off to leave them with a major disadvantage,\nHowever, Gort na Móna couldn’t take advantage with Darren Boyd’s goal with 10 to play ultimately proving mere consolation.\nEarlier in the day at Creggan, a badly depleted Lámh Dhearg were on the receiving end of a 3-21 o 0-1 defeat to Glenariffe.\nJohn Boyd hit the Red Hands’ only point of the game in the first half, but Glenariffe registered 2-11 in the opening period – Alex O’Boyle with their two goals.\nThere was no let-up from Oisin’s after the break as they piled on the scores and O’Boyle completed his hat-trick of goals to run out convincing winners.\n\nJunior Football Championship\nIn the Junior Football Championship on Friday, last year’s beaten finalists, St Patrick’s, Lisbirn eased to a 3-13 to 0-3 over Éire Óg at the Cricky.\nThe Lisburn men were well on top and were 0-9 to 0-1 ahead at the break with Eoin Fay, Shane McEvoy and Josh McMullan catching the eye.\nMcMullan fisted home a goal early in the second period with Denver Taggart adding a second, while Cathal McMeel stroked home a penalty as Éire Óg crashed out.\nAt Woodlands, Pearse’s overcame newcomers, Laochra Loch Lao 3-18 to 1-3.\nThe North Belfast men asserted themselves from the start with goals from Conaill Campbell and Daniel Magee and while Feargal Mac Ionnrachtaigh netter just before the break, Pearse’s still held a healthy 2-9 to 1-2 lead.\nThe New Lodge men kept driving forward in the second half and a third goal arrived from Liam Deegan from the penalty spot to wrap up their victory and place in the last eight.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"passengers can use glider from today","story":"\nMEMBERS of the public will be able to travel on-board the Glider vehicles during the last days of testing before the service goes live on Monday. \n\nShadow running will see both Glider and  vehicles operating along the Glider routes for three days. Glider services are on schedule to launch on Monday 3 September on cross-city routes between West and East Belfast  and the city centre to the Titanic Quarter .\n\nWith Monday being the day the schools go back after the summer holidays – which always leads to an increase in traffic – many drivers are bracing themselves for delays along the main arterial routes in West Belast.\n\nRobin Totten, Translink’s Glider Senior Project Manager said they are entering the final phase of testing which will see most of the infrastructure, vehicles and off-board ticketing systems tested by their passengers before they go live on Monday. \n\n“During this final week of testing, passengers travelling on the East – West route will be able to travel on Glider on Thursday 30th August with a valid ticket or Smartcard,” he explained.\n\n“ services will continue to run the scheduled timetable, with Glider ‘shadow running’ more infrequently along the route, calling at Glider halts. \n\n“Glider services during these three days will operate half-hourly from approximately 7am to 7pm. Passengers who have a valid ticket or validated Smartcard will be able to use either  or Glider, if waiting at one of the new Glider halts.\n\n“We have trained around 60 helpers from Volunteer Now, who will assist Translink staff at halts during this final phase to support passengers to get familiar with the exciting new service and ticketing system.  The volunteers will also be in place for the initial introduction of the service to boost passenger confidence and ensure a smooth transition to the new Glider service.\n\n“We have also completed over 150 public information and engagement events along the Glider routes, meeting many community groups, disability groups, businesses and local stakeholders to show them how to use the new services and ticketing, this will now be the an opportunity to try the service for themselves.\n\n‘‘We are delighted that communities and stakeholders right across the city see Glider as a positive development, and are enthusiastic about the introduction of this iconic new service and the benefits it will bring for the city.\n\nTranslink have also published ‘how to use’ guides and short videos on You Tube to help direct and make the service easy to use for passengers.

What is important to us is a solution that is in the best interest of the people of Belfast, the employees of House of Fraser and our investors.\"\n\nCommerz Real would not give any detail on the identity of the retailers who have expressed interest in the site. The spokesman said: \"It is simply too early to communicate any details. First we have to have clarity about House of Fraser. We have been very satisfied with their performance and would like to further co-operate with them.\"\n\nCommercial property agents Lambert Smith Hampton, which manages lettings at Victoria Square, said it had no comment to make on the prospect of a new tenant at the House of Fraser unit.\n\nTycoon Mike Ashley bought House of Fraser out of administration for £90m earlier this month. \n\nTalks with landlords have resulted in around seven House of Fraser branches being saved from closure, including one in London\u0027s Oxford Street.\n\nHowever, there has been no confirmation about the fate of the Belfast store. \n\nHowever, one industry insider said he believed the unit would be easily filled in the event of a decision to shut it down. He said that Victoria Square was considered a desirable retail location as it was built only 10 years ago.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dup received more than 200000 in public funds in","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

We welcome the public scrutiny and transparency this allows within our democratic process.\n\n“However on this occasion it is disappointing to report that four parties failed to deliver their returns on time.

We also sub-let offices to a range of tenants.\n\n\"In over 20 years, we had only one visitor who called and was fully aware of the history of the building as a boys\u0027 home.\n\n\"After 2010 we formulated plans to refurbish the building. \n\n\"However, in April 2015 these plans were thrown into the air by statements made by Mr Peter Robinson, then First Minister, calling for the building to be \u0027razed\u0027 more than 40 years after its period of notoriety.\"\n\nMr Black said that a series of protests followed and the new focus on the building led him to decide to put the redevelopment plans on hold.\n\n\"We no longer consider that retention of the existing building with the planned development is commercially attractive due to its history having been thrust back into the public eye.\n\n\"Consequently, we have decided to apply for planning permission for 12 apartments on the site and gauge interest from developers.\"\n\nNews of the sale came on the same day a law firm said Kincora should form part of official efforts to address the legacy of the Northern Ireland troubled past.\n\nKRW Law represents Richard Kerr, who alleges he was abused by \"very powerful people\" with links to Kincora and does not accept the conclusions of the four-year Historical Institutional Abuse  inquiry.\n\nThe inquiry dismissed claims that senior politicians, civil servants and businessmen were complicit in a paedophile ring that operated at the home in the 1970s and for which three staff members were jailed. \n\nPublishing the HIA findings in January, inquiry chairman Sir Anthony Hart said of Kincora: \"It was not a homosexual brothel, nor was it used by any of the security agencies as a honey pot to entrap, blackmail or otherwise exploit homosexuals.\"\n\nThe retired judge added: \"It is now time to finally lay these unfounded myths to rest.\"\n\nBut a statement from KRW said: \"On his  behalf, KRW is considering issuing legal proceedings over failings in the Kincora investigation by way of a judicial review.\n\n\"In addition to proposed legal proceedings, KRW will argue that the Kincora scandal must be considered as part of the legacy of the conflict.\"\n\nThe 2,299 sq ft property is listed by Frazer Kidd estate agents.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"gerry adams united ireland makes economic sense and is affordable its no longer a matter of if

This figure is used by political unionism and others to argue that there is a £10bn deficit,\" Mr Adams wrote.\n\n\"Of this £24bn figure £3.7bn is spent on British defence, overseas representation, and debt. This spending does not relate to the north. It is a matter for the British state and is not our debt. That leaves £20.3bn.\n\n\"The British Government estimates revenue generated within the north at £16.7bn. That means that the gap between what is spent and what is raised in the north is closer to £3.6bn.\"\n\nThe Louth TD said that real deficit was actually much smaller than claimed. \n\n\"In addition British Government Departments claim that they spend 1.8bn of this on the north. Aspects of this spending may or may not be considered to be essential. It is Sinn Fein’s position that this spend cannot fully be considered to be local debt until it is devolved to local budgets,\" Mr Adams wrote.\n\n\"Therefore the local spending deficit - which is the difference between the amount of money spent and raised in the north by the Executive and local authorities - is £1.8bn. To summarise, based on official British Treasury information the fiscal deficit in the north is at most in the range of £1.8bn to £3.6bn.\"\n\nMr Adams wrote that a united Ireland would receive benefits from being a sole European Union member. \n\n\"In the context of Irish unity, in which the entire island is part of the EU, where the additional costs relating to the duplication of services are ended and with Irish control of our economic strategies, investment and growth, it is clear that Irish unity makes economic sense and is affordable,\" wrote the former Sinn Fein President.\n\n\"It’s all to play for.

I note that he\u0027s been dubbed an outsider, I reject that,\" Mr Flanagan said. \"He is an experienced police man. He has spent all of his career on police issues.\"\n\nThe minister also rejected claims Mr Harris could not have been properly vetted due to the fact that he lives outside of the jurisdiction. \n\nMr Flanagan said he is satisfied the appropriate levels of scrutiny will apply. \n\nAsked if Mr Harris had secured his Irish passport to date, the minister said: \"Drew Harris is an Irishman. He served with distinction in Northern Ireland in very difficult circumstances, saw first hand the Troubles on the island of Ireland with the loss of his father.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts one lane of","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Here we look at what the restrictions will mean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n– What is being banned?\n\n\nDrinks with more than 150mg of caffeine per litre, like Red Bull, Monster, and Relentless, will be affected.                    \n\nOne regular 250ml can of energy drink contains around 80mg of caffeine – equivalent to almost three cans of cola.\n\nMany popular energy drinks now come in 500ml cans.\n\nSales will be restricted to either over-16s or over-18s, depending on consultation responses.\n\n\n– What are the concerns?\n\n\nThere are fears children’s health and education are being harmed, with the drinks linked to behavioural issues and poor classroom discipline.\n\nMany also have very high amounts of sugar, contributing to tooth decay and obesity.\n\nStudies have shown regularly consuming large quantities of caffeine can result in increased blood pressure, sleep disturbances, headaches and stomachaches.\n\nCampaigners have also criticised how much children can get their hands on with just pocket money, with four cans of generic 250ml energy drink available for as little as £1.\n\n\n– Why is it relevant to Britain?\n\n\nBritish children consume energy drinks way above the European average, contributing to emotional difficulties and tiredness, public health minister Steve Brine has said.\n\nNearly 70% of UK children aged 10 to 17 years old consume energy drinks, according to the Government’s childhood obesity plan.\n\nAnd those who do so are drinking on average 50% more than the EU average for that age group.\n\nJenny Oldroyd, deputy director for obesity, food and nutrition at the Department of Health and Social Care, has previously warned: “Around a quarter of adolescents are consuming more than three energy drinks in one sitting, so it’s that high level of consumption that concerns us.”\n\n\n– Why has the issue gained prominence?\n\n\nA boom in the energy drinks market, high-profile calls from figures such as TV chef Jamie Oliver, and the relatively low cost of some types compared with general soft drinks.\n\nWhile many major retailers already do not sell to under-16s, just 21% of the UK grocery market, including corner shops, are signed up to voluntary restrictions, No 10 said.\n\nUK energy drink sales jumped by around one-fifth  between 2012 and 2017, with total sales estimated at £1.65 billion last year, according to analysis from market researchers Mintel.\n\nA further 10% growth for the energy drinks market is expected for 2017-22, it added.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed how much dentists earn in northern

Primark was one of the best performing sites in the city centre, and it\u0027s impossible to quantify the economic impact, it\u0027s a big loss.\n\n\"It\u0027s a double loss as Primark was a big draw, and the fact that Castle Place junction has closed creates a full stop at four roads where pedestrians and buses would come into the city.\n\n\"Our message is: \u0027We are open now, please come back and give us your patronage\u0027.\n\n\"I think the Glider will be positive when it comes in next week.\"\n\nMr Rana said that businesses within the cordon area should not have to pay rates while the barrier remained, and that Belfast City Centre Management was holding a workshop for traders to give guidance on insurance.\n\n\"These businesses could be out for several weeks,\" he added.\n\n\"We are trying to look at alternative accommodation in the city centre, vacant units, trying to see if some businesses could open pop-up shops.\n\n\"Businesses can hopefully relocate and still keep trading.\"\n\nPizza Boutique on Castle Street was among a number of businesses forced to close for two days following the blaze on Tuesday.\n\nJoint owner James Neilly said his staff were delighted to reopen yesterday, but he was worried about the impact of the lost trade. Having only been open for a year, Mr Neilly urged people power to help businesses like his recover.\n\n\"The message has to be firmly that we are open for business,\" he said. \"We need the local people of Belfast to come out and support us, to support local businesses.\"\n\nMourne Seafood Bar was also forced to close for two days, resulting in estimated lost revenue of £10,000. Its Bank Street premises reopened yesterday morning and was looking forward to serving a fully booked restaurant last night.\n\nJoint owner Bob McCoubrey said their premises escaped without damage.\n\n\"We are lucky in that we don\u0027t rely on passing traffic, people coming to us have booked,\" he said. \"It has been much more difficult for businesses on Castle Street who reply on footfall.\"\n\nYesterday, Belfast City Council hosted a multi-agency meeting at City Hall in the morning, and a Business Recovery Group meeting in the afternoon.\n\nA City Hall spokesperson said it was considering a publicity campaign.\n\n\"Council is committed to doing everything it can to support businesses affected by the fire, and to keep Belfast city centre open for business,\" they said.\n\n\"We are working closely with Belfast Chamber of Trade and Commerce as well as Belfast City Centre Management and others to consider how we can best support businesses in the area in the days and weeks ahead, and this could include ious initiatives including a campaign.\"\n\nLord Mayor Deirdre Hargey said: \"Belfast City Council will continue to host meetings for key holders and businesses to provide information and support in the days ahead.\n\n\"Council officers are also in close contact with businesses in the immediate area of the fire to offer whatever support they can to ensure they can continue to operate where possible.\n\n\"We are liaising with representatives from Primark to assist in any way we can should they wish to seek alternative accommodation within the city centre.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Land \u0026 Property Services  said details of the 14 businesses which remain within the cordon area have been supplied to LPS.

Those who haven\u0027t had a repeat test have either chosen not to take up the offer, or have an identified reason for why a test is not appropriate for them at this time.\n\n\"As expected, the majority of results of the repeat tests have been reported as normal.  A very small number of women have been referred to colposcopy for further investigation. \n\n\"The PHA and HSCB are unable to release specific numbers or further details to ensure that patient confidentiality is maintained.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"widows pride as tragic gaa player leaves beautiful legacy in shape of little ellen","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It happened on the Glenshane Road, not far from the house he had set up with Sinead in Maghera, halfway between their family homes in Newbridge and Ballerin, near Garvagh.\n\nA transport planner in Swatragh who married Sinead in July last year, he had been told just weeks before his death that he was going to be a dad, and friends said he was ecstatic.\n\nAfter passing away several days after the collision, Sinead, a dental nurse in Antrim Area Hospital, donated his organs for transplant, and she was later told they had saved lives in three major operations.\n\nAs she tried to cope with her grief, Sinead was preparing to give birth to her baby, who was due on July 2.\n\nShe said: \"They were going to let me go 10 days before bringing me into hospital but I didn\u0027t want to be there around the time of our first wedding anniversary on the 14th. So I asked if I could go in earlier.\"\n\nSinead said she tried to focus her attention on the baby, but she had a photograph of Shaun beside her all the time.\n\nSeventeen hours after Sinead went into the maternity unit her labour started, and Ellen made her entrance into the world 15 minutes later as her mother received encouragement from sisters Marian and Clare.\n\n\"Everything was fine and when I held Ellen Rose in my arms it was a great feeling. She was just gorgeous,\" Sinead added. \n\n\"I don\u0027t know who she looks like. I think there\u0027s a bit of both me and Shaun in there somewhere but she changes from day to day. I\u0027m just pleased that Ellen is healthy and doing so well. Sean would have spoilt her rotten. He was fantastic with children. He doted on all his nephews and nieces and they all adored him.\n\n\"He was very excited at the prospect of being a father. And we discussed a couple of names, though we didn\u0027t know if I was having a boy or a girl.\n\n\"Shaun knew that the name Ellen was a strong possibility because his late mum was called Helen.\"\n\nSinead says Shaun\u0027s relations have been extremely supportive of her and the latest addition to the family.\n\nFive days after what would have been the Mullans\u0027 first wedding anniversary in July, Sinead introduced her baby on social media. And she also talked movingly about the pain of losing her husband.\n\nSinead described Ellen as \u00276lbs 11oz of perfection\u0027 and she appealed for friends to share stories about her dad.\n\n\"As hard as it is to talk about Shaun, I want Ellen to know everything about her daddy, so all PG stories are welcome,\" she wrote, adding that she knew how much Shaun would have loved his daughter.\n\n\"That makes it all the harder. My head and my heart are full of mixed emotions. I would love to hear Shaun talk back to me to give me some advice. I know he wouldn\u0027t want me to feel so down and would want to make it right.\"\n\nSinead said her daughter is a dream baby. \"She\u0027s sleeping right through the night already,\" she added. \"She\u0027s very mellow.\"\n\nEllen has captured the hearts of Shaun\u0027s former team-mates at his football club. Sinead took her to a recent wedding of one of her husband\u0027s friends.\n\nAnd a colleague who was there said: \"Ellen had supposedly big and tough Gaelic footballers cooing all around her. She\u0027s lovely. She would have been the apple of Shaun\u0027s eye.\"\n\nEllen won\u0027t remember a thing about it, obviously, but she\u0027ll get her first taste of Gaelic football\u0027s big time on Sunday. Sinead says her baby\u0027s name was picked out of a raffle for two tickets for the All-Ireland final.\n\nSinead\u0027s brother Matthew bought the raffle tickets for his new niece at his GAA club in Newbridge. Initially it was thought that Sinead could take someone else, as well as Ellen, to the final.\n\nBut she has been informed that babies who go to Croke Park for sell-out games still need a ticket of their own even if they are in the arms of a parent.\n\nSinead and Ellen have an important \u0027fixture\u0027 the day before the final.\n\nFor that\u0027s the date of the christening, and she\u0027ll be wearing a very special gown for the ceremony.\n\nThe proud mum added: \"I\u0027ve had it made from material from my wedding dress and from the shirt that Shaun wore on our big day.\n\n\"We will head down to Dublin on Sunday morning. It\u0027ll be a busy weekend,\" said Sinead, who insisted that she\u0027ll be maintaining a diplomatic neutrality during the showdown between two teams who aren\u0027t exactly huge favourites in the Oak Leaf County.\n\n\"I\u0027m just going for the day out,\" she laughed.\n\nShe says that she\u0027s still missing Shaun desperately, writing online of the tragedy that engulfed her.\n\nShe wrote: \"I would never wish this upon anyone but wish it wasn\u0027t us. Our plans got cut short and for now I just exist.\"\n\nSinead said she has been pleased to hear the difference Shaun\u0027s organs have meant to other people.\n\nHis liver was donated to a man in his 60s for a life-saving transplant.

political row saw Sinn Fein apportion blame to the DUP, whose leader Arlene Foster was minister at the former Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment when the scheme was introduced to Northern Ireland.\n\nFormer deputy first minister Martin McGuinness resigned from his position in January 2017, effectively collapsing the Northern Ireland Assembly, in protest at the DUP’s “handling” of the scheme.\n\nHow the scheme went so wrong is currently being examined by an independent inquiry.\n\nThe RHI scheme continues to run with more cost controls.\n\nThe Department for the Economy ran a public consultation in June over the long-term future of the RHI scheme.\n\nBut Sinn Fein says in its response to the consultation that the RHI scheme should not continue in any form, arguing it is not effective in reducing carbon emissions.\n\nAppearing at a press conference at Stormont on Thursday, Mr Murphy, flanked by party colleagues Mairtin O Muilleoir and Caoimhe Archibald, said they believe even with more cost controls, the scheme remains vulnerable to abuse.\n\n\nSinn Féin’s Conor Murphy says the continuation of the RHI scheme can no longer be justified and says it should be closed down \n#RHI\n \n#Stormont\n \npic.twitter/VMelLk3xLl\n\n— Rebecca Black  \nAugust 30, 2018\n\n\n\n\nMr Murphy said the funding for the RHI scheme should be redirected into another scheme that would be more effective in cutting carbon emissions.\n\n“RHI is not a good scheme that went wrong, it was a bad scheme that was made even worse,” Mr Murphy said.\n\n“We are now aware that before the RHI scheme was set up, a report commissioned by the department showed that compared to an alternative scheme, this scheme was less effective in reducing carbon emissions and nearly £200 million more expensive.\n\n“Despite this evidence the minister then responsible, Arlene Foster, opted for the less effective, more expensive option of RHI.\n\n“The original error of establishing RHI was then compounded by incompetent design.”\n\n\n\nThe RHI scheme is fundamentally flawed and should be closed down\nSinn Fein MLA Conor Murphy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Murphy said his party believes if continued there is a risk that the scheme could be abused in the future, and says it should be shut down.\n\n“Spending more public money on a scheme that is at best ineffective, and at worst counter productive to the goal of carbon reduction, cannot in our view be justified,” he said.\n\n“The RHI scheme is fundamentally flawed and should be closed down.\n\n“The money saved from RHI should be invested in a new scheme that is actually effective at reducing carbon emissions and tackling climate change which was the original intention of this sorry episode.”\n\nThe RHI inquiry remains ongoing at Stormont.\n\nIt was ordered by then finance minister Mairtin O Muilleoir in January 2017.\n\nThat came over a week after the resignation of Mr McGuinness, leading some to accuse Sinn Fein of flip-flopping on whether RHI should be subject to a full public inquiry or an independent investigation.\n\nSpeaking on Thursday, Mr Murphy said there are indications the inquiry is likely to hear more explosive evidence over the next few weeks.\n\nWhen asked when Stormont might resume, Mr Murphy said his party intends to have ministers in place by next April 1, the start of the new financial year.\n\n“Our intention is to have ministers in place by April 1, our intention is not to sit back here and allow the timetable of drift to be dictated by the British Government and the DUP in terms of their own Brexit interests,” he said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"cocacola to buy costa coffee for","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n |

as a separate entity, following pressure from activist investor Elliott.\n\nBut on Friday the company said a sale of the business is now “in the best interests of shareholders”.\n\nProceeds of the deal will be used to pay down debt and boost the pension fund.\n\nWhitbread added that it intends to return a significant majority of net cash proceeds to shareholders.\n\nThe Press Association reported earlier this year that Whitbread has been approached informally over a potential buyout of Costa.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nWhitbread chief executive Alison Brittain \n\n\n\n\nThe company said the sale of the coffee chain will allow it to focus on its Premier Inn hotels business.\n\nChief executive Alison Brittain said: “This transaction is great news for shareholders as it recognises the strategic value we have developed in the Costa brand and its international growth potential, and accelerates the realisation of value for shareholders in cash.\n\n“This combination will ensure new product development, continued growth in the UK and more rapid expansion overseas.”\n\nWhitbread acquired Costa in 1995 for £19 million from founders Sergio and Bruno Costa when it had only 39 shops.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIt now has more than 2,400 outlets and is embarking on overseas expansion.\n\nCoca-Cola boss James Quincey said: “Costa gives Coca-Cola new capabilities and expertise in coffee, and our system can create opportunities to grow the Costa brand worldwide.\n\n“Hot beverages is one of the few remaining segments of the total beverage landscape where Coca-Cola does not have a global brand.\n\n“Costa gives us access to this market through a strong coffee platform.”\n\nThe deal comes hot the heels of another big money acquisition in the sector.\n\nPret A Manger was earlier this year sold by Bridgepoint for £1.5 billion to a company controlled by JAB, the investment vehicle of Germany’s wealthy Reimann family.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"theresa may assassination plotter due to be sentenced","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

Ugandan pop star-turned-opposition politician who was charged with treason after he alleged torture in detention has been stopped from leaving for the United States for treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nLawyers also said on Thursday that a colleague was stopped from travelling to India.\n\nThe police action has escalated a political dispute between the government of longtime President Yoweri Museveni and a youthful generation that fears he intends to rule for life after 32 years in power.\n\nBobi Wine, whose real name is Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, was stopped while trying to board a flight at Entebbe airport and police did not explain why, lawyer Asuman Basalirwa told The Associated Press.\n\nHe was checked into a hospital in the capital, Kampala, in a “worrying condition” the lawyer said.\n\nThe 36-year-old was freed on bail on Monday but faced no travel restrictions after he and more than 30 other politicians were arrested over an incident in which the president’s motorcade was pelted with stones and Ssentamu’s driver was shot dead.\n\nA lawyer for the singer has called the charge false.\n\nSsentamu has emerged as a powerful opposition voice among young people frustrated by Museveni, especially after the constitution was changed last year to remove an age limit on the presidency.\n\nThe singer won a parliament seat last year without the backing of a political party.\n\nDozens of global musicians including Chris Martin, Angelique Kidjo and Brian Eno last week wrote an open letter condemning the treatment of Ssentamu, who in his first public appearance after his arrest had to walk with support and appeared to cry.\n\nOn Thursday, police “violently abducted” Ssentamu and put him into a police ambulance, another lawyer, Nicholas Opiyo, said on Twitter.\n\nAny doctor who treats the singer without his consent is violating his or her oath and “will be personally pursued”, he added.\n\nSsentamu’s wife, Barbara, said in a Facebook post that security forces “manhandled” her husband, who “groaned in pain” as he shouted for help.\n\nAuthorities earlier on Thursday prevented another politician, Francis Zaake, from boarding a plane to India, saying he was a suspect in a criminal case.\n\nGovernment spokesman Ofwono Opondo said on Twitter that Zaake, who has not been charged with any crime, escaped police custody “and should be arrested at the earliest”.\n\n\n\n@HEBobiwine\n and Francis Zaake will be allowed to proceed for further treatment abroad after government doctors have examined them to ascertain their medical conditions \n@UgandaMediaCent\n \n@nbstv\n \n@ubctvuganda\n \n@ntvuganda\n\n— Ofwono Opondo P\u0027Odel  \nAugust 30, 2018\n\n\n\n\nAfter the outcry over Ssentamu’s treatment at the airport, Opondo said both he and Zaake can travel “after government doctors have examined them to ascertain their medical conditions”.\n\nBoth men had been taken to hospital with serious injuries they said they sustained at the hands of security forces during detention.\n\nThe speaker of Uganda’s parliament, Rebecca Kadaga, in a letter to Museveni this week described Zaake as “gravely ill” and said Ssentamu “has visible signs of torture and beatings”.\n\nThe government has denied the allegations of torture.\n\nThe treason charges against Ssentamu and others have heightened concerns about a crackdown on the opposition in the East African nation and led to protests in the capital.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"appreciated im not 100 per cent sure hopefully derry city chairman philip odoherty speaks recent criticism magee university","story":"\nBy Gary Ferry\n\n[email\u0026#160protected]\n\n\nHE provides almost a thousand jobs locally and has saved Derry City Football Club on two occasions, but for some, Philip O’Doherty is still not exempt from criticism.\n\nRecent reports to Derry City FC’s shareholders have revealed that the club’s Chairman has contributed £300,000 of his own money on an annual basis, just to keep the club afloat.\n\nOn top of that, he has built E\u0026ampI Engineering to a stature that it is respected across the world, a real jewel in the Irish landscape that sits in Burnfoot.\n\nIn its 32nd year in operation, E\u0026ampI is still growing, with a new extension set to be completed on site by the end of October. \n\nThat will bring yet more jobs to the local economy, north and south of the border, news of which will be lauded by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar when he visits E\u0026ampI on September 11. \n\nSo when an angry Derry City fan accosts him whilst doing his shopping in Sainsburys, or when he is socialising with friends, what is his response?\n\n“The first question I usually ask them is ‘Are you a season ticket holder or do you go to the matches?’ If the answer is no then there is no point in me talking to them,” he states. \n\n“Why are they criticising if they don’t go to the matches and pay their money? If they do pay their money then I will have the conversation with them. \n\n“Usually it’s when results are bad. I feel exactly the same as they do. It does get a bit personal sometimes. We went through a few managers there and I did get a bit of stick about that.”\n\nO’Doherty is crazy busy, admitting himself that he spends 70 per cent of his time travelling across the world to meet customers personally. For him the personal touch is vital when it comes to meeting customers and establishing relationships. \n\nFor that reason he is a hard man to nail down, but he is not afraid to raise his head above the parapet, as he did during the recent controversy over the pricing of Europa League tickets at the Brandywell. \n\nBut with 840 families in Derry, 400 in South Carolina and 320 in Dubai relying on his ability to grow his business, there are more important issues on his mind day to day. \n\n“I would never let Derry City get in the way of that because too many families depend on me here to pay mortgages and car payments and stuff like that,” he continued. \n\n“I’ve always made it clear to the board that I’m not going to available. The big concern I do have is that I am away so much, probably 70 per cent of the time I’m out of Derry – is that reasonable for a chairman? I don’t know, but that’s the way it is at the minute. \n\n“When things are going well it’s an easy job but when things aren’t going well, it’s a difficult job.”\n\n\nResponsibility\n\n\nWith around 1,500 employees to cater to worldwide, there is a huge responsibility on O’Doherty’s shoulders, but it is one he carries well, with E\u0026ampI’s profits and workforce growing year on year. \n\nEven in his home town, so many rely on him. \n\n“I don’t even think about that, there’s no time to worry about that, you just have to get on with it,” he admits. \n\n“If I can keep the customers happy and bring in the sales from those customers, that’s key. It’s very easy to bring in a sale from customers who were happy with their last order. If that’s gone well, it’s easy to get the next ones. \n\n“We have some long-standing relationships with very big companies, some multinationals and the internet sector, we would count as customers and I would look after them personally.\n“I just keep going. I work very heavily in sales so I’m away a lot.\n\n“I suppose at the end of every year you sit down and see what the achievements were for the year and what you’re going to do next year. But I think I’m just too busy to reflect on where we are versus where we started.”\n\n“At the last count, O’Doherty’s personal value was estimated at £163 million, making him one of the most successful businessmen in Ireland. \n\nAt 25 years old, O’Doherty left Du Pont to start a business which focused solely on engineering. \n\nNow, 32 years on, the former St. Columb’s College student retains his hands-on approach. \n\n“I do get involved in things and because I’m an engineer, I’m very interested in research and development. I talk to a lot of customers who say: ‘I wish we could get this or I wish we could do that’, so that turns into a project. \n\n“I’m partly doing technical sales, but I’m partly working in research as well. I am using my engineering skills it’s not just a management job where I’m not actually doing things. \n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“I think getting close to customers is really important, because you have to ask the question – why do people in Silicon Valley place orders with a company in Donegal? They don’t just happen to be driving past and call in and see us, we go out and talk to them and show what we have.\n\n“We have a fabulous work force, which is the big advantage that we have. It’s a mix between Derry and Donegal people who have a great work this, a good education.”\n\n\nDown time\n\n\nThat passion for his work continues to drive him on, be it in his office overlooking the building in Burnfoot, in Anderson, South Carolina or in Dubai. \n\nThere is no down time for O’Doherty it seems. \n\n“To be honest, I’m quite happy with my lifestyle at the minute,” he shrugs. \n\n“I would like a little more free time. I’ve just become a grandfather my grandson is 14 and a half months and I would definitely want to spend more time with him. I have two kids, a boy and a girl, so I would like more family time but at the same time I like what I do. I like engineering.\n\n“Earlier this morning I was looking at some drawings for a large project we’re doing for a client and I really enjoyed going through them. I wouldn’t want to be an accountant. A lot of engineering people tend to make out that they’re management only then all of a sudden all they are doing is looking at financial statements all the time. \n\n“I do do that. I can read a balance sheet, but I wouldn’t want it to be the main focus of my job.”\n\nO’Doherty has created something hugely significant right on his own doorstep. His value to his home town cannot just be measured in jobs alone, but by other contributions, which he does not want acknowledged in print. \n\n“He has helped bail Derry City out twice, once in 1995 and again in 2010. From whatever angle you choose to look. It’s clear that O’Doherty cares, and cares deeply about his home town, and the people in it. \n\n“We have the right people in this area,” he explains. “We probably underestimate how talented our people are. I sometimes think we lack in confidence. I go to other cities in Ireland and the UK and they seem to be very confident whereas as soon as our people get stuck into a project, they are probably more impressive than people from these other locations. I think that’s the work ethic particularly. \n\n“What I notice about people here as well, is that if they encounter a technical problem they are very innovative in coming up with a solution. They tend to try and work solutions out themselves. I think that’s natural. I think this innovation is very, very important.\n\n“It’s not all me. I started it off but I developed a team. My workforce and in particular my two directors Damien and Cathal they have done a lot more than I have in terms of what’s in this building. I may bring the sales in but what you see in the factory is largely down to them.”\n\nAnother key issue for O’Doherty is education in the city, primarily the development of Magee university, which he believes has been held back in recent years. \n\n“We’re still short engineers there’s not enough engineers and there’s the lack of a proper university here,” he insists. \n\n“Magee is definitely making progress with the new vice-chancellor but it should have been making that progress years ago. \n\n\"The reason that I feel so disappointed at the lack of sufficient progress in the university, is that, when I meet other people who own businesses and you get talking to them, one of the questions I get asked is ‘Why have you built your factory in such and such a place?’ There’s two answers I give them one is that I was born here, and two is that \n\n“I went to university here and I met my wife. I think you need a good university to attract good people and I think the university will attract people who will eventually settle here as well.\nThat will create businesses which will help the university and all of a sudden you have a virtuous circle of good stable employment. Without a university, it’s definitely more difficult.”\n\n\nRetirement?\n\n\nSo, does he have an end-game? At 57 years old, is retirement now starting to creep into his thinking?\n\n“I certainly think I have got seven or eight more years until I think about retiring. \n\nI will probably wind it down a bit. \n\nI would like to work less hours and spend more time with my grandson particular, but I still want to do something. I don’t play golf,” he laughed.\nThe last question is a simple one- ‘Do you feel appreciated?’\n\n“I think I am, not by everybody but it really doesn’t matter,” he says. \n\n“I’ve got a very good relationship with my shop floor in particular. I tend to come down here on a Saturday morning if I’m not away and walk around. \n\n\"I just want to know what’s happening, because I don’t have time during the week because of my travels. I just don’t get time. I like to walk around and if there are any new starts I have a worked with them.\n“Am I appreciated? I’m not 100% sure, but hopefully.”\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"call rural businesses derry strabane area attend workshops funding next week","story":"\nRural businesses in the Derry and Strabane District Council area are being encouraged to avail of LEADER funding that is available under the NI Rural Development Programme 2014-2020.\n\nThe Scheme is now open for its fifth call and is encouraging new and existing rurally based micro/small businesses and social economy enterprises involved in non-agricultural/non agri-food related activities who may be eligible, to apply.\n\nA series of pre-application workshops have been scheduled as part of the funding scheme and anyone interested in applying is advised that they must attend one of the sessions and fill out an expressions of interest form to make an application.\n\nThe mandatory information session will be held on Thursday 06 September at the Belfry Countyr Inn at 7pm Friday, 07 September at the Strabane Enterprise Agency at 10.30am Monday 10 September at the Derg Valley Leisure Centre in Castlederg at 2.30pm and Tuesday 11 September at St Columb’s Park House, Derry at 7pm.\n\nThe NI Rural Development Programme 2014-20 is part-funded by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs  and the EU.

Enhancing connectivity and supporting rural enterprise and investment are essential to the success of the local economy and are key priorities of the Strategic Growth Plan for the City and District.\n\n“This scheme offers the opportunity for small rural companies to avail of the support they need to take their business to the next level. I would really urge business owners to go along to the workshops to find out how they could benefit.”\n\nChair of Derry \u0026amp Strabane Rural Partnership, William Lamrock said: “This is the fifth call for this round of funding and we are delighted that the scheme is already having a positive impact on rural business with up to 69 new jobs being supported to date through the scheme.

Building on the success of last year’s event, SuperValu has introduced new categories to help capture the good work done across the whole spectrum of Northern Ireland society.\n\nLast year Derry man, Nathaniel Hunter was named joint second place whilst teenager, Jamie Harkin, took the joint third place, both winning SuperValu shopping vouchers and a framed certificate.\n\nNathaniel was awarded for his quick thinking and reactions when a pleasant stroll along the beach turned into a rescue drama for himself and his wife when they realised three children, aged 10, 11 and 12, had been swept out to sea. The coastguard had already been alerted and were on their way, but Nathaniel knew there was no time to lose, dashed to get a buoyancy aid and raced into the water, swimming out to the terrified kids.\n\nAnother young man followed and brought the closest child to safety whist Nathaniel swam on, getting hold of one youngster and throwing the aid to another. A strong swimmer, he brought them both back to the beach were they were treated in hospital but lived to tell the tale. Nathaniel was praised by the coastguard and of course the families of the young lives he saved that day.\n\nJamie also from Derry, had a story of extreme courage and kindness in the most challenging of circumstances. Poignantly, this exceptional young man was nominated by his mum Trisha, who had recently passed away but the family took the tough decision to proceed with the SuperStars nomination in their mother’s honour. Seven years previously Jamie was diagnosed with blood cancer Hodgkin’s Lymphoma.\n\nHis late mum told of how, before, during and after an unsuccessful organ transplant Jamie never complained. He went on to set up a wonderful support group called Jamie’s Journey in a bid to give hope to other young people touched by cancer. During his exams, the brave young man, whilst taking regular hits of morphine due to the pain, battled on and gained 10As and A*s in his GCSEs. Like many, the inspiring young man is a Star Wars fan, and after winning every fan’s dream prize of a custom light sabre, he selflessly raffled it to raise funds for charity.\n\nDue to popular demand, the deadline for entries has been extended by two weeks to Friday 14th September.\n\nStephen Bogle, SuperValu Brand Manager, said: “With entries flooding in from right across Northern Ireland, we are one step closer to finding this year’s SuperValu SuperStars.

There is a lot of incredible work being done by individuals who work at social enterprise companies and community groups, as well as adults and kids, that goes completely unrewarded. We hope to shine a light on just some of these people and I can’t wait to meet all of our finalists on November 22 in the Titanic Hotel.”\n\nStephen Bogle, continued “Often in our society people don’t get the recognition they deserve SuperValu SuperStars will celebrate the contribution real life SuperStars make in our communities. Through this exciting initiative, we are proud to provide a platform to honour people and their organisations whose selflessness, commitment and determination make this such a great place to live.\n\n“We’re calling on everyone to get involved - if your friend, teacher, nurse, family member, neighbour, work colleague or someone in your community deserves recognition, this is your chance to give them their moment in the spotlight.”\n\nIt’s easy to nominate your SuperValu SuperStar – just log onto \nwww.supervalu\n and fill in the nomination form.\n\nSuperValu SuperStars media partners are The Sun and U105 and is sponsored by Denny, Action Cancer, Robinsons and Dove.\n\nFor further information and to nominate your local SuperStar, visit \nwww.supervalu\n.

When families or friends know the wishes of their loved ones it makes the situation less stressful and can give them the confidence to fulfil your wish to be an organ donor.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“No one wants to think or talk about dying but set in the context of helping one or more than one person after death, the conversation becomes easier. The more people pledge to donate their organs and tissues after their death, the more people stand to benefit. Between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018 there were seven organ donors in the Western Trust area, resulting in 20 patients receiving a transplant.”\n\nDr Grace continued: “There is a constant drive towards promoting organ donation in the Western Trust and it has been successful. This is shown in the number of people registered as potential donors which has increased from about 25% to 43% in Northern Ireland over the past five years. While this is very encouraging, there is still a lot of work to do to ensure as many people as possible join the Organ Donor register and tell their loved ones about their wishes.”\n\nThere are many ways to register as a potential donor:\n\nRegister online at \nwww.organdonation.nhs.uk\n or \nwww.organdonationni.info\n\nRegister when applying for or renewing a driving licence.\nRegister when registering with a G.P Practice.\nTelephone the N.H.S. Donor Line 0300 123 23 23. Telephone lines are open 24 hours a day all year round.\nDownload a form from \nwww.organdonation.nhs.uk\n, print it and return it by Freepost\nRegister when applying for a Boot’s Advantage Card.\n\n\nPictured above: Highlighting the need for more people to sign up to the organ donor register and telling your family your wishes is: Maria Coyle Specialist Nurse in Organ Donation and Dr Declan Grace Lead Clinician for Organ Donation in the Western Trust.\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"machynlleth festival reaches its finale","story":"\nElin Manahan Thomas will be performing at the Machynlleth Festival.\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8106823/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" height=\"\"\n                                                                                                                        \nCelebration of Welsh composer at Machynlleth\n\nAnn Murray will be leading a workshop at the Machynlleth Festival.

delivering one of three parts of the intermediate level beekeeping course.\n\nThis builds on the knowledge gained from the preliminary course and improves the understanding of both the scientific and practical aspects of beekeeping.\u0026nbsp\n\nIt consists of three parts \u0026mdash scientific, practical and apiary practical \u0026mdash delivered over a period of at least two years and leading to the Federation of Irish Beekeepers\u0026rsquo Associations  Intermediate Certificate of Proficiency in Beekeeping.\n\nHolders of the FIBKA Preliminary Beekeeping certificate \u0026mdash or equivalent \u0026mdash may wish to increase their knowledge, understanding and practical skills in beekeeping. Those applying should be aware that independent study is essential in addition to attending classes and apiary workshops.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe practical written element of the course will be held in Dromore High School and will consist of 15 evening classroom sessions between September and April, followed by a three-hour written examination in April or May.\n\nThe first class will start on Wednesday, September 12, at 6.30pm. Elements covered will include migratory beekeeping, queen rearing, management of nuclei, disease and pest control, equipment, preparation of honey and wax for show, legislation and starting up in beekeeping.

Such was the demand that people were even contacting me on Saturday night to see if we had any spare tickets, he said.\n\nLocal priests who attended the mass were Fr Gerry McCloskey from Ardglass and Fr Brian Brown of St Patrick\u0026rsquos in Ballynahinch.\n\nChurch of Ireland Dean Henry Hull from Down Cathedral travelled on the coaches with the pilgrims and tweeted after his experience \u0026mdash \u0026ldquoSafely home after a very blessed and uplifting day in Dublin #PapalVisit.\n\nDespite the visit being viewed a difficult one as Pope Francis was being called upon to address the many instances of institutional abuse and clerical sexual abuse of children and women in the island\u0026rsquos recent history, parishioners were still excited to see and eager to listen to the words of their spiritual leader.\n\nDownpatrick man Jackie Breen, who attends St Patrick\u0026rsquos Church, says that the experience of seeing his spiritual leader will stay with him for a lifetime.\n\nHe made sure to make the visit special for his family by personally attending the earlier Festival of Families events on Thursday and Friday, attending the Croke Park concert with his wife Tracey and daughter Lucy and then the Phoenix Park mass on Sunday with his son Dylan.\n\n\u0026ldquoPope John Paul gave us the blessing of peace in Ireland when he spoke here and that was also\u0026nbsp seen in Europe a few years later and I believe that Pope Francis has left us with the special blessing of hope and healing in his visit, said Mr Breen.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a message of hope and healing not just for Catholics but for all Christians.\n\nHe added that the entire Festival of Families and the Pope\u0026rsquos words helped to underline how crucial the role that families have in global society.\n\nMcCartan Digney , says that he felt very emotional about the entire experience.\n\nHe travelled with his mother Louise to Phoenix Park and proudly carried the yellow and white Papal flag that she had when she went to see Pope John Paul at the youth Mass in Galway.\n\n\u0026ldquoEver since I watched a TV documentary about nine years on the 30th anniversary of Pope John Paul\u0026rsquos visit, I\u0026rsquove wanted to see our Holy Father myself and kept the flag for my chance and I couldn\u0026rsquot believe that I got the chance to do so, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt was very emotional from all the singing and the long walk there. There were tears of joy and tears of sadness\u0026nbsp when Pope Francis acknowledged for the first time the hurt that has been done, but it really needed to be said and it was good to hear the words from the head of our church.\n\nFor Mark Ferris from Drumaness and his partner Kathleen Oliver, their attendance in Dublin during the entire Papal visit was the highlight of a very religious week.\n\nEarlier in the week while holidaying in Portugal, the couple visited the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima.\n\nMr Ferris was a boy of eight when he last saw a serving pope in Ireland when Pope John Paul II visited in 1979.\n\nHowever, he watched the mass at Drogheda, estimated to have nearly attracted 1.3m people, on the television at home with his family.\n\nFor this visit, Mr Ferris says he was determined not to miss out.\n\n\u0026ldquoMy partner had arranged for us to go to Dublin for the Pope\u0026rsquos visit as a birthday celebration but I would have been there no matter what.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis experience was something that I would never will forget and well worth the blisters I have on my feet in walking the five or six miles to Phoenix Park.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoWhen the Pope did his tour of Dublin, we were really close when he pass by and I believe he looked directly at me.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe concert was absolutely brilliant as was the Mass and we really enjoyed the entire weekend.\n\nSouth Down MLA Colin McGrath also attended Sunday\u0026rsquos Papal Mass.\n\nWhile he represented the SDLP along with deputy Nicola Mallon, he travelled down as part of the Downpatrick and Lecale parish group.\n\nHe said that the event was notable for the number of young people who attended.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe atmosphere was electric and it was a special moment when the Pope arrived.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe overall theme of his visit was obviously \u0026lsquofamilies\u0026rsquo and it was great to see so many families there together too. There was a great connection amongst the Downpatrick Parish group with over 200 travelling together. \n\nHe added: \u0026ldquoPope Francis also sent a special message of forgiveness and healing for the Church\u0026rsquos involvement in difficult matters in the past which was important too.\n\n\u0026ldquoAll together, it was a fabulous event which will be remembered for a generation.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"}]
