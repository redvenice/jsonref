While not visible to the eye, small gaps in the fabric are enough to allow for a vast majority of particles to get through.‘Masks are air filters, and woven fabrics, such as cotton, make for good jeans, shirts, and other apparel, but they are lousy air filters,’ Richard Sear, co-author of the study and physicist at Surrey University, said. KN95 masks are built to filter out particles, and have a standard filtration of 95 percent.‘The filtering layer of an N95 mask is made from much smaller, 5-micrometer fibers with gaps that are 10 times smaller, making it much better for filtering nasty particles from the air, such as those containing virus,’ Sear said.KF-94 masks are considered to be very effective as well, with the ability to filter out 94 percent of particles.Filtration efficiency is not the only two benefits of those masks, though. Fit is very important as well.A mark should fit tightly around a person’s face, almost hugging their nose, cheeks and chin. This is to avoid leaving gaps above or below the mouth and the nose where air can escape.Even if a person does have a mask that can filter up to 95 percent of particles, if the mask isn’t well fitting then the particles could just escape out of the side anyways. This is why Sear also does not recommend the use of surgical masks.‘Surgical masks fit badly, so a lot of air goes unfiltered past the edges of the mask by the cheeks and nose,’ he said.Data from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) shows 39,000 Britons tested positive, down 5.2 per cent on the 41,130 cases detected last Tuesday.The vast majority of the cases, 26,711, were registered in England, while 2,225 were logged in Wales and 2,567 were detected in Northern Ireland. Another 2,567 people tested positive in Scotland.The true scale of infections is hard to interpret, experts warn.Some 643,136 Covid test results were logged yesterday, compared to more than 2million at the height of the Omicron wave.But the positivity rate in England – the proportion of Covid tests that turn out to be positive – increased to 10.9 per cent last Tuesday, the latest date figures are available for, compared to 10.4 per cent one week earlier.Meanwhile, 1,015 infected people were admitted to hospitals across the UK on Friday. The figure is just 2.6 per cent lower than the week earlier.And 10,551 Covid-infected people were in hospitals across the UK by 8am on Sunday, down 6.8 per cent in a week.Another 194 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were registered, bringing the total since the start of the pandemic to 161,630.Vaccination data shows 91.5 per cent of over-12s in the UK have now had at least one Covid vaccine, while 85.2 per cent are double-jabbed and 66.5 per cent are boosted.Professor Paul Hunter, an infectious disease expert at the University of East Anglia (UEA), told MailOnline it is challenging to interpret daily infection data because the proportion of cases being picked up through testing is dropping.Comparing daily case data with estimates from the Office for National Statistics on the true infection rate, Covid tests picked up 45 per cent of infections in early January, Prof Hunter said. But this dropped to 25 per cent by the second week of February, he noted.‘Although infection numbers are probably still falling, BA.2 infections were still increasing at least a week ago – when the latest Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium data is available,’ he said.‘So overall I think cases are still probably falling but maybe not for much longer now that BA.2 is dominant and probably still increasing.‘However, I doubt BA.2 could continue to increase for much longer. It is already increasing much more slowly than a few weeks ago.’The UKHSA revealed BA.2 was behind 52 per cent of all cases in the seven days up to February 20. The sub-variant has completed its rapid rise to dominance just a month after it was first spotted in the UK. "},{"url":null,"title":"Peter Crouch joins exodus BBC Ex England star takes Radio 5 Live podcast Acast","story":"Share this article She was at the centre of a row in 2020 when the BBC decided she had breached rules in a monologue about Dominic Cummings\u0027s trip to Durham during lockdown.In June, she was reprimanded for sharing a Twitter post by Piers Morgan about the pandemic that the corporation said was \u0027clearly controversial\u0027.A senior source said the pair\u0027s defection was \u0027extraordinary\u0027 particularly as Mr Sopel was the \u0027clear front-runner\u0027 to replace Laura Kuenssberg as political editor.The role is seen as the most high-profile reporting job in British TV.

He says sanctions are having an impact. He says the government will subsequently publish a full list of people associated with the Putin regime (who will be sanctioned, he implies).That’s all from me for today. But our Ukraine coverage continues on our global live blog. It’s here. Earlier he was taking questions in the Commons, where he was beside Boris Johnson during PMQs. Hamilton is Labour’s candidate in the Birmingham Erdington byelection tomorrow and is the clear favourite to suceed Jack Dromey as the constituency’s MP. But her campaign hit a last-minute hitch when GB News revealed that, at a meeting in 2015, on the topic “the ballot or the bullet”, she suggested violence might be an acceptable way of achieving political change. She said: Labour told GB News: “Paulette Hamilton is arguing for better representation for the black community in public life and as she is campaigning to become Birmingham’s first black MP she has a point.” McDonnell told LabourList that he did not want to be drawn into an internal Labour party row. In her report Sienna Rodgers quotes McDonnell as saying: McDonnell said Labour members needed clarity about what was and was not allowed. But he also stressed his commitment to party unity. Today the IFS has published an updated analysis saying that students who go on to get relatively low-paid jobs will lose out by even more than it originally calculated. In another tweet, Paul Johnson, the IFS director, explains why: “That’s because the earnings threshold for repayments is set to be increased with inflation, not earnings as previously. Sorry we didn’t spot that before - rather buried in the supporting documentation.” The government has made levelling up its core domestic policy aim. Yet the Department for Education’s own equality impact assessment (pdf) of the plans echoes the IFS assessment and says that poorer graduates, as well as those from the north of England, are likely to lose out. It says: And here is video of the applause. Asked if those on the list could face sanctions, he replied: “I think you would expect that a significant proportion would end up on our sanctions regime or indeed sanctions we are coordinating with the EU and the US.” Asked if the Conservative party would take that advice on board, the PM’s press secretary said: “Yes.” (At the weekend the Sunday Times reported that Quintessentially, the luxury service company founded by the Conservative party co-chair, Ben Elliott, employs 50 people in its Moscow office and does a lot of work for wealthy Russians.) At the briefing, asked whether Boris Johnson regarded the Russian attack on the Kyiv holocaust memorial at Babi Yar or the targeting of apartment blocks as war crimes, the PM’s spokesperson said: The spokesman confirmed it was the first time No 10 had explicitly stated that view. But he did not get an easy ride at all. It may not have been a disaster, but it was a deeply uncomfortable PMQs for the prime minister, that left him looking compromised and exposed. Johnson faced repeated criticism, on two issues. First, there were complaints that the UK should be following the EU and adopting a much more generous approach to Ukrainians fleeing the war and seeking sanctuary. Labour has been pushing this argument, and at PMQs it was also made strongly by the Scottish and Welsh nationalists (who represent countries where the political consensus on immigration is quite different to England’s). Johnson is probably only PM because he adopted a political cause fuelled by public concern about migration from eastern Europe, but he must be wondering whether, on this issue, he is now on the wrong side of public opinion. The polling certainly suggests he is. (See 11.56am.) But on Ukrainian refugees, Johnson at least at an answer. When questioned by Keir Starmer on sanctions, and in particular on the government’s failure to impose sanctions yet on named oligarchs, Johnson was floundering badly because he did not have credible answers at all. To illustrate the point here (from PA Media) are Starmer’s first three questions. He started with this: Johnson said it would not be “appropriate” to comment on iniduals cases at this point - before saying that later the government would publish “a full list of all those associated with the Putin regime”. Starmer’s next question was about another oligarch. Johnson dodged this one too, saying he was “proud of what we have done already”. Starmer then asked about Shuvalov again. In reply, Johnson claimed the UK was “doing everything that we can to expose ill-gotten Russian loot”. But this boast is untrue - as Chris Bryant illustrated when he returned to the government’s failure to sanction prominent Russians. Starmer did not directly raise the large sums given to the Conservative party by Russian linked donors over the years, but another Labour MP, Bill Esterson did - perhaps a sign that Labour MPs are coodinating their questions with the frontbench? If so, it’s working, because collectively Starmer and his colleagues built a strong case against the government. (A Tory MP, Bob Seely - a leading Commons hawk on Russia - also chipped in, compounding the PM’s embarrassment.) Journalists have been writing about Tory links with wealthy Russians for years, but it has been hard to prove that ministers are in the pocket of pro-Kremlin oligarchs. That’s because a) it is never quite clear how close to Vladimir Putin these donors are (although they tend not be be fierce Putin critics - because those are the Russians who end up dying in the UK in mysterious circumstances) and b) it is not obvious what they are getting for their money (favours for Putin, or protection from Putin?). But the impression remains that there is something murky going on, and Johnson’s inability today to explain why sanctions are not being pursued more vigorously won’t have helped."},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"Options to consider \u0026ndash and reasons to be cheerful \u0026ndash when selecting your move after the examMaking important life decisions is never easy - but there are tools to helpJunior Cycle and Leaving Cert exams to commence on Wednesday, June 8thThe fairness of some aspects of the college application system is open to questionMinister for Education confirms move for Leaving Cert and Junior Cert studentsSudden shift to pre-pandemic standards is not expected, says Department of EducationYou need to register now to apply for college through the CAO, but you have until July 1st to make a final decision on your course choiceCAO 2022: Most applicants get an outcome which enables them to successfully progress to the next stage of their educational journeyFrom nursing to engineering and environmental studies, there\u0026rsquos plenty of choice"},{"url":null,"title":"ex rt%C3%A9 presenter eoghan mcdermott seeks to clear name after false accusations","story":"Mr McDermott, who stopped working at 2FM almost a year ago, posted a legal letter on Twitter on Wednesday which addressed “unfounded allegations” including sexual assault and illegal drug use.

More than a third of Northern Ireland’s population hold an Irish passport, according to latest official figures.While applications plunged amid overseas travel restrictions during pandemic lockdowns, fresh data from the Department of Foreign Affairs shows numbers rebounding.Already this year, 24,643 people were issued with Irish passports in the North through Northern Ireland Passport Express (NIPX), which is available at post offices in the North. This is more than 400 every day. The figures do not include Irish citizens in the North who apply for their passports directly from Dublin.If the trend continues it suggests more than 150,000 Irish passports would be issued in the North by the year end.This would eclipse, dramatically, the 107,937 issued through NIPX in 2019 – the last full-year figure before coronavirus prevented international travel for most.Issued passports during 2019 in the North soared 27 per cent from the previous year (84,855). This continued a pattern of rising Irish passport applications in the region against declining British applications following Brexit. Official figures show there were 110,506 applications from Northern Ireland for a UK passport in 2019. This was down from 119,298 the previous year, in a continuing 15 per cent slide in such applications from people in the North over a five-year period.LockdownDespite the virus grounding most of the world’s aircraft since the outbreak began, 56,709 Irish passports were issued in the North last year, up almost 16 per cent from 48,911 in 2020, when the first pandemic lockdown was imposed in Ireland.Aggregate figures for the decade 2012 to 2022, to date, show 660,427 Irish passports issued in the North, about 35 per cent of the region’s 1.8 million population. Under the Belfast Agreement, Irish and British governments recognise the birthright of all people in Northern Ireland to identify as either Irish, British or both. There is also a right to dual citizenship and people can carry Irish and British passports. Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, is down to increasing pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union. An Irish passport allows them to travel freely within the EU. The Democratic Unionist Party’s Sammy Wilson has previously said he gets “quite a lot” of loyalist voters in his constituency who ask him to sign off on their applications for Irish passports. The East Antrim MP said he encourages constituents going on holidays to opt for an Irish passport as it is a quicker process and negates restrictions imposed on British citizens in the EU as a result of Brexit.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"alan kelly expected to make statement amid speculation about labour leadership","story":"Labour Party leader Alan Kelly is expected to make a statement on Wednesday evening amid speculation about his future in the role.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillIt took the threat of a third world war for peace to break out between Micheál and Mary Lou, but even a small mercy is welcome in these monstrous times. The last time the Taoiseach and the Sinn Féin leader were in such accord Ireland was staring down the barrel of a pandemic. If catastrophe makes these two see eye to eye, maybe we’re good with the relative mundanity that accompanies their verbal warfare. There was a muted atmosphere in Leinster House afternoon when the Dáil resumed for the week. On one side of the foyer, four flags were arranged in a line on the marble floor, two on either side of a gilt-framed original copy of the Proclamation: the Irish and EU flags, the UN flag and the flag of Ukraine. Later in the afternoon the House was due to hear statements on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with more than three hours set aside for TDs to register their condemnation of megalomaniac Vladimir Putin and his barbarous military offensive on a neighbouring democratic country.But the chilling events unfolding on the other side of Europe could not be boxed off into one say-everything set-piece after the usual knockabout was done. From the opening round of Leaders’ Questions and on through the Order of Business and Questions to the Taoiseach, deputies could talk of little else. “What we are witnessing is scarcely believable,” said Micheál Martin, echoing what everyone else was feeling. “But it is very real to the people of Ukraine.” When he called Putin “a bully and a thug”, he did so with the full and unreserved backing of TDs from all sides. That same sense of unity and purpose did not make it across to Brussels, where two Irish MEPs voted against the European Parliament’s resolution condemning Russian aggression against Ukraine. Political half-doors Mick Wallace and Clare Daly, perpetually engrossed in a self-indulgent, left-wing ideological binge, seemed to side against reason, decency and humanity. The parliament voted to condemn Russia by 637 votes to 13. By contrast, in Leinster House there was still plenty of room for differences of opinion, but all speakers were well able to recognise what is right from what is wrong and what is good from what is incontrovertibly evil. People were shook. There are issues and questions around how Ireland will deal with the crisis in the weeks and months to come. Mary Lou McDonald, and Catherine Murphy of the Social Democrats, tentatively began to ask them on Tuesday. Questions about the imposition of further sanctions, how the State will look after the influx of refugees, how Russian money sloshing around the coffers in the IFSC can be frozen and how financial loopholes can be stitched shut.Suddenly discourse in Dáil Éireann starts to sound like it’s been taken from the pages of a cold war novel. TDs and the Taoiseach are discussing the presence of Russian agents living among us and it’s deadly serious. How many to expel? How many, if any, diplomats to keep? Russian embassyThis was one of those days when the word “unprecedented” could be bandied about any number of times. What about the staff in the Russian embassy? Catherine Murphy asked the Taoiseach if the Government has “identified spies” among them. He didn’t say. But as for Russian money resting in Dublin, Martin insisted the State would not go easy on the billionaires. “We have no interest, none, zero, in enabling any Russian oligarch or anyone who is part of the sanctions list, either to evade or avoid being fully accountable to that sanctions regime. We have no interest as a country in protecting anybody in that regard. I have to be crystal clear about that.”With the Dáil talking about oligarchs, there was talk in the chamber of trillions, a figure rarely heard when the ordinary finances of our entire nation is discussed. “The Central Bank has advised that total Russian assets held on December 31st, 2021, are estimated at €11.4 billion, or 0.3 per cent of total Irish fund assets of €3.8 trillion”, he said.People may talk about Londongrad across the water, but apparently there is no such place as Dublingrad over here. Although you wouldn’t want to bet the dacha on that, given the strained relationship many Irish financial institutions have had with the truth in recent years.As the day wore on, the time came for the “statements of support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine”.“February 24th, 2022, is a day that will live in infamy,” said the Minister for Foreign Affairs, borrowing Franklin D Roosevelt’s famous line uttered after the bombing of Pearl Harbour. Simon Coveney opened the session by saying the motion showed the support every political party and every TD had for Ukraine. “This is Putin’s war,” said Minister for Justice Helen McEntee. “It is an act of an autocratic and dangerous bully.”Less filler, more passionThe speeches continued for more than three hours. In Leinster House, TDs often, after demanding more time discuss a burning issue, run out of speakers and steam well before the cut-off point. In this case, confronted by such a gut-wrenching and compelling subject, deputies spoke over and above the allotted time, with much less filler and far more passion. Talk has to be done, but at times, listening to the very concerned and genuinely angry contributions from deputies, that old chestnut of the Skibbereen Eagle newspaper keeping its eye on the tsar came to mind. But talk they must and, to a woman and man, they did, and as they talked a group of orchestral students from the nearby Royal College of Music assembled with their instruments outside the gates on Kildare Street and prepared to pay philharmonic tribute to Ukraine and its besieged people. About 30 students unfolded their collapsible chairs and assembled their music stands and played the Ukrainian national anthem. People stopped to listen, and politicians came out to hear them. The music was beautiful and it was a desperately sad but lovely occasion. A man by the railings waved a Ukrainian flag and sang quietly. Two younger men, also from Ukraine, sang with pride. Their eyes were brimming with tears, but they were not alone. Nobody spoke much because, well, we didn’t want to cry.In English, this is some of what the distraught and heart-broken Ukrainians sang:Ukraine is not yet dead, nor its glory and freedom,Luck will still smile on us brother-Ukrainians.Our enemies will die, as the dew does in the sunshine,and we, too, brothers, we’ll live happily in our land.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireThe excavation at the site of the former Tuam mother and baby home will be “one of the most complex forensic excavation and recovery efforts” ever undertaken “anywhere in the world”, the Minister for Children has said.Roderic O’Gorman said the excavation would involve a DNA identification process “on a scale never done before” in Ireland. The Minister was speaking as the Dáil debated the Institutional Burials Bill 2022 on Wednesday, which will provide a legal basis to allow for the excavation of sites, such as that of the former Co Galway home. Following the work of local historian Catherine Corless, the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes concluded last year that 978 children had died at the Tuam home. It said the “physical conditions were dire” at the home owned by Galway County Council and run by the Bon Secours Sisters. The commission issued its final report in January of last year, though the methodology used in compiling it was criticised by some survivors’ groups.Mr O’Gorman said the legislation was not “site specific” but that Tuam would be “the first such excavation and exhumation”. “I know that there are concerns about other sites, like Sean Ross and Bessborough,” he said. ‘Stain’The Minister said what happened at Tuam was “a stain on our national conscience”. He said he had met many of the families affected and heard “the sense of urgency and frustration around why the exhumation has not happened yet”. “I share that frustration.These families want to give their loved ones the respect and dignity they were so grievously denied in their short lives,” he said. “The uniquely tragic nature of the site at Tuam means that legislation is required to undertake this work.“This will be one of the most complex forensic excavation and recovery efforts ever undertaken, not only in Ireland, but anywhere in the world. It will encompass a DNA identification process on a scale never done before in Ireland.”Mr O’Gorman said “significant” changes had been made to earlier drafts of the legislation, including removing a restriction on the jurisdiction of the coroner, which campaigners had said could prevent inquests from being held. Independent agencyUnder the Bill, an independent agency will be set up to oversee the excavation, exhumation, identification and reburial of any remains found at the sites.The identification programme has also been expanded to include a wider circle of relatives including grandparents, aunts, uncles, nephews and nieces who could provide DNA to compare with remains.Mr O’Gorman thanked Ms Corless, who he said had become “a voice” for the children in Tuam and that the State “owes her a debt”.“We can never erase the immense tragedy of what happened there, but this Bill will allow us, at long last, to afford the children interred at that site a respectful burial,” he said. “It is long past time that we afford those children that basic dignity, so long denied to them.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"Authors are tackling topics from transgender rights to Islamic extremism, and picking up plenty of awardsAbout 2.4 million forced to leave their homes during 13-year-long war with Boko HaramTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid modelling cannot accurately predict numbers admits government","story":"Modelling cannot “accurately predict the numbers”, the chairman of the Government’s modelling taskforce admitted as he was questioned by MPs on why experts had got omicron projections so wrong.Prof Graham Medley, of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (Spi-M), said that the models had not sufficiently accounted for voluntary behavioural changes by the public even without restrictions.Speaking to the Commons science and health select committee, which is scrutinising the pandemic response, Prof Medley said: “The modelling is there to understand the process and what’s going on. We know we can’t accurately predict the numbers, but we can give insight into the processes that determine the outcomes.”Scenarios released in models before Christmas estimated that up to 6,000 people a day could die at the peak of the omicron wave, with tens of thousands of daily hospitalisations, leading to calls for a national lockdown.However, deaths peaked at 306 on Jan 21, while daily admissions never rose beyond 2,615.Prof Medley said: “At the time of the beginning of December, everything we knew about omicron was not good.“What happened subsequently is that everything turned out well. But that doesn’t mean to say it was going to happen. Our job is to lay out the landscape in terms of the possibilities to Sage. And so inevitably, our worst case is always going to look worse than reality. Hopefully, the lower case looks better than reality. But in this case, it didn’t.”Greg Clark, the chairman of the committee, pointed out that policymakers had been “left in the lurch” by not having probabilities ascribed to the forecasts, which could have helped them understand which was more likely to happen.Prof Medley said: “We could guess, and our guesses might be 10 per cent more accurate than other people’s, but they are still guesses and I think it would be wrong for policy decisions to be made on the basis of guesswork.”After the models were published in the middle of December, the Government faced calls to lock down but resisted and instead brought in Plan B measures, which advised working from home. They also brought in vaccine passports and mandated masks.The committee heard how, during this period, the Government had relied heavily on the advice of Dr Raghib Ali, an epidemiologist and consultant in acute medicine at Oxford University Hospitals, who correctly predicted that the omicron wave would be mild.Dr Ali told MPs that it was clear from the previous wave that people acted more cautiously when case numbers rose, regardless of government intervention. However, such behaviour change was never factored into the modelling.‘There is a problem on Sage’He said: “What has an impact is people just knowing a friend or relative has got Covid. People’s behaviours do change, and it doesn’t make sense not to include it in the models.“I was confident enough on the basic information we had there to say that the most likely scenario was going to be the best case scenario, or better based on the experience of previous waves.“The second thing is being a clinician, from the early data we had, we already had fairly good evidence that omicron was less severe at the clinical level. I think there is a problem on Sage that there are not enough clinicians.”The committee heard how Denmark had more accurately estimated the impact of the omicron wave because its models had factored in behaviour change.The latest data from the Department of Transport show that there has been little change in people’s movement since the Government released its “living with Covid” strategy, suggesting the public is still exercising caution despite the lifting of restrictions.Figures showed that train capacity reached no higher than 58 per cent last week. In the previous week, train occupancy was between 66 and 74 per cent.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: \u0026#39Colossal destruction\u0026#39 in Mariupol after \u0026#3914 hours of non-stop attacks\u0026#39Vladimir Putin resorts to brutal bombardments after ‘Western’ approach to Ukraine invasion failsWatch: Russian delegation hold grenades in the air after being escorted from mayor’s officeBoris Johnson\u0026#39s godfather convicted of careless driving after motorcyclist loses legUkraine’s hospitals under fire in possible ‘violation of international law’Left-wing ‘unity candidate’ fails to make French election ballot as Zemmour and Le Pen scrape inMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid likely caused 140000 uk","story":"Covid likely caused , UK deaths as stats chief disputes lower figureEd Humpherson, the head of the Office for Statistics Regulation, said a lower death toll sometimes cited by lockdown sceptics is highly misleading because it’s taking a very small subset of those death certicates where Covid is listed as the underlying causeThe national Covid memorial wall in London bears hearts drawn by relatives of people who have died of the virus Image: PAByMartin BagotHealth and Science editor:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar |commentsOne of Britain’s top statisticians has said Covid- is likely to have caused , deaths in the UK.MPs have grilled the head of the UK statistics regulator on what should be counted as a Covid- death. The Commons Science Committee discussed which was the best measure of the death toll from the pandemic as many indicators show the UK has fared worse than most comparable nations. Ed Humpherson, the head of the Office for Statistics Regulation, was grilled on which of the data was the best measure of Covid deaths. Labour MP Graham Stringer suggested a lower measure of less than , deaths for which Covid- is the only cause listed on the death certicate could be the best measure.This measure has been highlighted by lockdown sceptics to play down the true impact of the pandemic.  Mr Humpherson told MPs: “I so dislike that figure I’m not going to repeat it back. “There is a figure which has been circulating which is based on the number of cases where the only cause listed on the death certicate was Covid. “Butyou look at the all of the death certicates where is Covid is listed as the underlying cause that’s ,. “That the smaller number is highly misleading because it’s taking a very small subset of those death certicates where Covid is listed as the underlying cause.” How Britain measures deaths has been the subject of some debate. The daily data on the Government dashboard includes any where someone died within  days of someone tested positive for Covid- and currently stands at ,.The -day measure has been used by many other countries. It has been pointed out that some of these deaths would have been caused by something  and the virus would have only been incidental to the death. Mr Humpherson said: “The key way to think about these statistics is to make sure that we’re using the statistics for the purpose that they’re intended. “Whilst  days measure has its limitations it does have a purpose, which is this leading indicator gives us quick -hour response at times when the pandemic is increasing signicantly. “That is a very useful measure for society, policy makers and for the public more broadly to be to be aware of. “If we want to have a more complete picture of Covid people dying from, as opposed to with Covid, then we use the ONS figures [on people for whom Covid is the underlying cause]. “If we want to have a broader sense of the overall impact of the pandemic on mortality, we look at the excess deaths because the number of deaths which are above the five year average.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Office for National StatisticsPoliticsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Activists have braved four named storms in a bid to drum up support for the city councillor, who has vowed to press the Government over its Levelling Up plans. Keir Starmer, who has visited the seat several times on the campaign trail, has been enjoying a boost in the polls after the Prime Ministeraposs popularity was damaged by rule-busting parties at Downing Street during lockdown and Tory sleaze.Most recent polls put Labour between four and six percentage points ahead of the Conservatives. But some Tories believe their candidate, Robert Alden, has an outside chance of pulling off a shock win. The leader of Birmingham City Councilaposs Conservative group has stood for the seat in every election since . Labour insiders still nervous after losing the Red Wall seat of Hartlepool admit turnout in the constituency, which has historically been very low in the area, and a large number of independent candidates makes the result hard to predict.  She said: “This is such an important election for the people of Erdington, Castle Vale and Kingstanding. We’ve had two bids for levelling up funding rejected by the Tory government, yet Bromsgrove, one of the richest areas in the country, has secured millions. “This area has been ignored by the Tories for too long, and I hope to be a strong voice for Erdington and will challenge the Government on lack of investment and regional health inequalities,I am fortunate enough to be elected this Thursday.” Activists say anti-social behaviour, crime and improving the areaaposs high streets were issues that came up on the doorstep. Ms Hamilton also faces competition in the strongly pro-Brexit seat from Reformaposs Jack Brookes, Lib Dem Lee Dargue, a number of independents and the Green Partyaposs Siobhan Harper-Nunes.

Mr Alden said: “My plan is about improving le for people in Erdington and Kingstanding by providing high-quality, stable jobs and securing new investment in our local high streets.” Results of the by-election are expected to be announced in the early hours of Friday.

The increase will not sit well with voters bracing themselves for a worsening cost of living crisisMPs will see a signicant pay rise, despite every day Brits struggling to make ends meetByBenjamin LynchTrends Writer:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar |commentsMPs are set for a signicant pay rise as the rest of the country deals with a cost of living squeeze. Inflation is up, families are set for council tax rises, energy prices have soared by a wallet-crippling average of £ per year, and the governmentaposs plan to cope with the crisis still leaves people out of pocket. Now MPs are set for a healthy pay rise while campaigners point to the millions of households teetering on the brink of poverty - and set to face even more despair in April when National Insurance tax payments soar.Labour leader Keir Starmer has made it clear that he does not think the rise, which is set independently, is a good idea.He said in January: I think that MPs do not need a pay rise and we should all be saying that we don’t need that pay rise and it shouldn’t go ahead. The mechanism is independent but I think it’s for me, as leader of the opposition, to say that I do not think we should have that pay rise. Number  also advised restraint from the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authorityin January, so why are MPs getting a pay rise  Why are MPs getting a pay rise   Parliamentary watchdog IPSA is in charge of setting the rates of pay for MPs and it has decided the rise is due. It was frozen for two years during the pandemic, but IPSA has now decided it is due in order to reflect the average increases across the public sector over the last year. IPSA chair Richard Lloyd said: This is the first increase in pay for MPs in two years and follows the average of increases across the public sector last year. MPs play a vital role in our democracy and this is reflected in their pay.  There is also an argument that the nature of an MPaposs job - ministers are often described as technically having two jobs - should mean they are paid well for what they do, and that the wage packet should encourage people from all backgrounds to become MPs. Mr Lloyd continued: It is right that MPs are paid fairly for the responsibility and the unseen work they do helping their constituents, which dramatically increased last year. For Parliament to reflect society, it is vital that people from all walks of le can be an MP. How much are MPs paid   MPs are currently paid £, a year and they are set for a pay rise of .% to £,. Though pay rises were frozen as the pandemic took hold, days before the March  lockdown, MPs were told they were to be given a £, increase to their office costs budget, as well as the credit limit on their payment cards going up from £, to £,. This was due to the sht from their base in Westminster to working from home, which was advised during lockdown.  IPSA was set up in  in the wake of the expenses scandal and its purpose is to regulate MPsapos staffing and business costs, regulate pension and pay arrangements, and give financial support to MPs doing their work. It says: We are independent of parliament and the government. This means we make fair and impartial decisions about MPs’ pay, pensions and business costs.

Ukraine will prove the fatal, final mistake by a fascistic gangster who egotistically believed his own invincible propaganda after strategic triumphs in Crimea and Syria, and the  Trump and Brexit blows delivered to the US and UK. Vlad the Invader’s twitchy finger on the nuclear trigger and the offer of Potemkin negotiations are both signs even he fears this is an impending personal Armageddon. This is fuelled by brave Ukrainians fighting heroically and Russians courageously protesting “No to War”, which is inspiring resistance around the world. Supplying anti-tank, helicopter and aircraft missiles strengthens defenders and weakens attackers already suffering punishing losses. Britain, the rest of Europe and the US finally uniting over economic and cultural sanctions will eventually bankrupt the Putin machine and perhaps drive a deep wedge between the tyrant and his billionaire cronies who enjoy opulent luxury wherever they please.  And China abstaining instead of vetoing a UN Security Council motion by the US condemning the brutal invasion emphasised Putin’s isolation, as a new ally quickly distanced itself from an ageing, deranged dictator. The bloody conflict could still belong: reducing Ukrainian neighbourhoods to rubble, inflicting unbearable heartache and costing countless lives. What is becoming clearer, however, is that Putin is also likely to be one of the victims. But let’s not buy charlatan Boris Johnson’s propaganda that he is suddenly an international statesman, a Prime Minister orchestrating the resistance. Johnson let Putin walk all over him and Britain, with oligarchs smirking unconcerned whenever ruling Conservatives, reliant on Russian-linked money, talked tough then acted soft.Charismatic, cool-headed, defiant Ukrainian Volodymyr Zelensky is what a real leader looks and sounds like. Germany’s centre-Left Olaf Scholz is also rising to the occasion, standing up to Putin at considerable financial expense. A European Union that Johnson ripped Britain from as part of a career move was firmer on sanctions until shamed Johnson started running to catch up. Locking out Ukrainian refugees fleeing terror unless they apply to be fruit pickers is disgraceful and inhuman, when Poland, Romania and Hungary open their borders. Why not seize the spacious British properties of Russian oligarchs to house Putin’s casualties  I’ve watched and known Johnson for longer than the  years Putin has misruled Russia. So I’m aware of the cynicism of the great charlatan. From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times. The newsletter is sent out twice daily with the latest UK  world politics news, along with leading opinion and analysis.You can sign up here.  The first casualty of war is Partygate, with Johnson relieved that the shells and missiles are effectively providing a smokescreen. If he’s hit by a fine, the PM will pray it is today. Now wouldn’t be the moment to remove a lawbreaker in Downing Street, his apologists will argue. They’d be wrong, of course. Chamberlain was dumped by MPs to be replaced by Churchill during the Second World War then, before Japan finally surrendered, the country swapped Churchill for Attlee. Labour leader Keir Starmer will inevitably receive less airtime than the PM but should have calculated that he must be constructively critical rather than mercilessly pummelling the Tory rogue. War in Europe might save Johnsonnot an invaded country or Putin.

Badger setts are protected by law, making it more dficult to rescue an unlucky animal who falls in.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. Assisted by the RSPCA, the fire crews used specialist listening and locating devices to find the trapped canine, reports LeicestershireLive.The teams called in reinforcements to help with the digging shortly before pm on Tuesday - and managed to rescue the dog one hour later. Shook up by everything it had been through, the dog laid still on the ground until it was reunited with its concerned owner.It is thought the badger sett was inactive because no sign of any other animals were found at the scene. It comes just days after a border terrier spent six days inside a badger sett in Rowde, Wilts, after dropping into it during a walk. Owner Annie Davidson put out a missing dog appeal fearing her dog - named Bumble - might have climbed out when she was not there. But then suddenly Bumble popped her head up like a whac-a-mole and she clambered to safety. Annie said: Weaposre so delighted to have Bumble back home. The experience was traumatic for her.

Annabelle, five, went to Waterworld in Stoke-on-Trent as an early birthday treat with her family on Sunday.Ashley and Jessica Curwood splashed out £ on tickets, £. on parking, and £. on a locker after travelling from their Nottinghamshire home, StokeonTrentLive reports. They claim Annabelle suffered sore eyes and chesty coughs within  minutes of getting into the water due to the chlorine levels. They say other families had similar complaints. Waterworld has claimed that there were no health and safety breaches.  The family say they arrived at the Festival Park attraction at am and got into the water at .am. Ashley, aged , said: “Our eyes were stinging really badly and there were quite a few people coughing. We looked at the leguards and their eyes looked like they were streaming. They were going in the first aid box and getting the eyewash out to wash their eyes. “I spoke to one of them and asked what was happening. They said something had happened with one of the pumps and there was too much chlorine in the water.  “Your eyes always sting when you go to a swimming pool but this was quite extreme. You were constantly rubbing your eyes. We had to go and wash them out with water. It was mainly my daughter we were worried about.” Ashley added: “We were advised to go out of the pool for half an hour, wash our eyes out, and try not to go under the water. We tried to carry on but it was getting quite bad. “Our daughter started coughing a lot and she said her chest was hurting. She went and sat on the side, I got her a drink of water. She was upset and didn’t want to go back into the water. “I spoke to a member of staff at around pm and they said we had been in here for a few hours so they couldnapost do anything about it in terms of a refund. He said they could offer us some mini-golf tickets or change our pass so we could stay all day.“I spoke to my we and my daughter but she didn’t want to stay in the pool. We said we will do mini-golf. But when we got changed and everything my daughter said she didn’t want to do that, she wanted to go home. We told them we didn’t want to do it anymore. We were told it was either mini-golf or tickets to come back another day. We didn’t want to come back. I’m not happy about it.The couple later called NHS  and Annabelle was advised to go to AE.Ashley added: “My we was in there for about three-and-a-half hours which was longer than you got in the pool. They said she was not in any danger but they confirmed it was aposchlorine gas poisoningapos. “We have to watch her for the next few days and make sure her breathing is fine and that she is not coughing up blood.” Ashley has made a complaint to Stoke-on-Trent City Councilaposs trading standards.He said: “As soon as we got her away from it she was feeling fine. I am massively disappointed with the company. “We had an hour in the pool and the rest of the time we were out washing our eyes. “If they had just apologised, here is your money back, and we hope you come back again we probably would have. “The main thing I wanted was my money back, it’s not cheap. It cost around £ to go there. £. for parking and then £. for a locker. “It takes about  minutes for us to get there. I said we don’t fancy coming back, it’s not a two minute drive for us. I’ve emailed the website to ask how I can make a formal complaint.” Waterworld has been operating for  years and had , customers on Sunday. A Waterworld spokesman told StokeonTrentLive: All pool tests and operational plantroom procedures were followed and adhered to fully, as is the norm. There were no breaches in any health and safety protocols. As a business, we ensure our customers are dealt with in a fair manner. We do our best to make sure all customers leave with a smile. We believe the manager on duty did all he could to address the situation and offer a remedy. The Mirror has contacted Waterworld for a statement.

The ground-breaking idea has succeeded in making the learning hub hugely popular among pupils and parents. XP School in Doncaster, Yorkshire has won plaudits for its innovative teaching method which thinks out of the box.Standards are still important at the school, but it has more collaborative ethos where unorms are not required. Andy Sprakes, the co-founder of XP Trust told YorkshireLive : We have to do lots of myth-busting, because sometimes people think we just let the kids do what they want.Itaposs not like that at all. Itaposs highly rigorous. It’s standards-based, itaposs collaborative and the curriculum is collaboratively planned by teachers. It takes a lot of hard work to do that, but thethat you get is absolutely phenomenal.  The trust receives the same level of funding as any other school and every single child in Doncaster has the same chance of getting a place as anyone . But walking into the school, itaposs immediately clear that the XP Trust does things dferently. Huge murals adorn the walls, schoolwork is plastered in the corridors and teachers plan lessons directly next to students in the open-plan communal areas. Academics and teachers from Chile, Australia, America and Europe regularly visit to see how they can borrow ideas from the XP Trust and transfer them into their schools. Perhaps the most notable dference is the absence of a school unorm. All  pupils wear whatever they want, within reason. Itaposs about integrity, says Andy. We have a dress code, which is that children come ready to do schoolwork. Theyaposre not wearing short skirts or t-shirts with inappropriate slogans on. For me, itaposs about taking away ceilings. We should be saying: aposLetaposs try and see what they can doapos.  Iaposve been staggered over the past eight years when weaposve done things and the kids just take it in their stride. The idea of creating a forward-thinking school was first planted in the mind of Andy a decade ago, when he visited High Tech High in San Diego. Along with co-founder Gwyn ap Harri, Andy became fascinated by the approach to embed the school at the heart of the community by giving children more freedom. What we saw in San Diego were students who were very mature in terms of their ability to communicate with adults, but also mature in terms of their ability to talk about their learning - how they learned and why they learn. That was very impressive. We thought we wanted to do something like that in the UK. It became a moral imperative to me. I thought: ‘Now Iaposve seen it, I canapost go back.’ In , the very first XP School opened, but the new building that now houses  children wasnapost built yet. Instead, the first  XP School students were taught at Doncaster Roversapos Eco-Power Stadium, a stoneaposs throw from where the XP Trust is now established. It marked the start of a longstanding relationship with local businesses, organisations and charities.  Andy said: Schools often exist quite independently, but our expeditionary curriculum model really forces us to go beyond the school to look for partnerships which are meaningful and which have legacy as well. We have still got a very, very strong working relationship and partnership with Doncaster Rovers and Club Doncaster, the community section of the team. We use their facilities. They run our sports hall here. Weaposve got these very strong cultural bonds with groups in our immediate community, but also beyond that as well. We really try and instil a kind of civic sense of pride in Doncaster through the work that we do. Weaposve created some fantastic links with Age UK, the Conversation Club and Frenchgate Shopping Centre Shopping Centre, who really kindly display our work. One of our mantras is that we want to make the world a better place and we want our kids to do that actively, to be activists, in making the world a better place. Where better to start than your hometown. Maths, English and Science are all taught at the XP Trust and students sit their GCSEs in exactly the same way as other schools, but the structure of the lessons is vastly dferent from what you might expect. The expeditionary ethos means students often undertake lessons outside school.  And a single lesson can encompass a range of dferent subjects where they can learn elements of English, History and Science as part of the same project. Weaposve got a core curriculum, which we follow and actually is quite a traditional curriculum in a lot of ways, but how we deliver it is is not conventional, said Andy. Subjects donapost just exist in silos. There is connectivity between them and we feel that deepens and strengthens the will to learn by making those connections. Kids come to our school and understand why theyaposre learning. It could be because we need to make a film about migrants in Doncaster, we need to write a book about how important the coal mining industry is to Doncaster or weaposre going to do a poetry slam at a local arts club. So thereaposs always a meaning and a purpose to the learning. As part of evert single school day is a -minute session in aposcrewsapos as soon as pupils arrive.  Instead of sitting idly in form classes and taking a register, crews are encouraged to tackle issues affecting themselves and their peers. It could be anything from preventing littering to understanding mental health. It all falls under the banner of the schoolaposs motto: aposAbove all, compassionapos. If we get crew right, we get everything right, stresses Andy. Nothing is more important than crew. Itaposs the basis of our culture. One of the most striking examples of how crews have shaped the schoolaposs ethos is how isolation was renamed aposreflectionapos, in a bid to ensure pupils understand why they might have been taken out of the classroom. Remarkably, there hasnapost been a single student expelled from the XP Trust in the seven years since it was founded. Weaposre constantly improving, says Andy. We’re not perfect. Weaposre not anywhere near where I think we could be in terms of outcomes and Iaposm conscious that thereaposs still a great deal of work to be done, but I’m very proud. I’m not saying that weaposre the only model that works or that weaposre the best school in the world, but what weaposre doing is creating a model for how other schools could potentially do education. YorkshireLive figures show just  per cent of those who put XP School as their first choice secondary school secured a place in September.Only  were successful and including second and third preferences, there were . applications for each offered place. XP East was the next hardest secondary to get into locally, with . applications for every place offered. What started as a single school in one of Doncasteraposs most impoverished suburbs has ballooned into an eight-school academy. XP School and XP East are situated side-by-side in the middle of Doncaster, with five local primary schools. The eighth school, XP Gateshead, opened in the North East in September . While the expansion has been exciting, Andy will never stray too far from his roots and says Doncaster will forever remain the heartbeat of the XP Trust. I’m a Doncaster lad. Gwyn, who founded the school with me, is a Doncaster lad. I live in Doncaster. My daughter comes to the school. It’s personal. So when we do great work, we do great work in our home town.

Despite the recent change in UK mask regulations most airlines still insist on customers wearing one as a condition of carriage, and even Jet are still advising customers to do so, although they no longer have to.  A Jet spokesman said: “It is no longer a legal requirement to wear a face mask in England and Northern Ireland, including at our airports or on board our aircraft. “However, as per UK Government guidance, we recommend that customers continue to wear a face mask in these spaces, and we remind customers that they will need to wear one when they get to their overseas destination.” But the rules only apply to England and Northern Ireland, passengers aged six and over will still have to wear masks on flights travelling from Scotland and Wales. Masks remain mandatory on other airlines such as EasyJet, Ryanair, British Airways , Virgin Atlantic, Loganair and TUI. Jet operates entirely within Europe which means it doesnapost have to factor in as many changing local regulations and infection rates as long-haul carriers who fly to destinations all over the globe.

The snap, taken in , will go on display at Kensington Palace from Friday , as part of a major new exhibition titled Le Through A Royal Lens, exploring the British Royal Family’s enduring relationship with the camera.The striking black and white portrait showing the Princess reserved, stoic and looking away from the viewer, comes from a sitting commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery. While several photographs from this shoot were acquired for their collection, this portrait was retained by Bailey for his archive and has never been seen in public before.Several established royal photographers were suggested to the Princess for the commission, but experts say her choice of David Bailey’s bold minimalism reflected her desire to establish a new photographic identity for herself.She was only the second member of the Royal Family to sit for Bailey, the first being Lord Snowdon – husband of Princess Margaret, and himself a renowned photographer – in .Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up .The image of him smoking a cigar also features in the exhibition, and secured Bailey’s place in popular culture as a central figure of Swinging Sixties London. Postponed from its original opening in , Le Through a Royal Lens will see some of the most iconic royal photographs ever taken go on show alongside a host of images providing a glimpse of the Royal Family off duty.  From the stf formality of the Victorian era, through the high glamour of Cecil Beaton’s photographs of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, to the relaxed informality of the digital age. The David Bailey image of Diana is on loan from The Princess Diana Museum. Lord Snowdon’s iconic photograph of Princess Margaret wearing the Poltimore Tiara – designed by royal jeweller Garrard in  and worn by the Princess on her wedding day in  - in the bathtub at their home in Kensington Palace also features in the exhibition.  Elsewhere in the display, iconic magazine photoshoots including the Duke of Cambridge’s cover photo in Attitude Magazine and the Duchess of Cambridge’s centenary issue of British Vogue in  will explore how photography and image remain central to the public’s perception of the modern Royal Family today.

At the cathedral, the royals chatted with children from the associated Ukrainian school and were handed posters created by the youngsters in the colours of the countryaposs flag.  The heir looked solemn as he was handed a homemade poster by a young schoolgirl which read ‘Stop Putin’ - and told distraught members of its congregation that he could not believe what he was seeing “in this day and age”. During the visit, Charles also gave an unscripted speech where he praised the bravery of the Ukrainian people amid truly terrible aggression. He said: I must say my we and I have been deeply moved by everything we have heard today during our visit and above all by the extraordinary bravery, generosity and fortitude of the Ukrainian community in the face of truly terrible aggression. Our thoughts and prayers, however inadequate they may be are with all of you at this most critical time.

The couple also met Bishop Kenneth Nowakowski, as well as the Ukrainian Ambassador, Vadym Prystaiko, who earlier received a rare tribute from MPs, a standing ovation in the House of Commons and his we, Inna Prystaiko, who was visibly upset during the event. Camilla was also left in tears when the leading members of the UK’s Ukrainian community sang a mournful version of the song Chervona Kalyna, Red Guelder Rose.  The men, women and children performed the song famously sung by Ukrainian insurgents during the Second World War which evokes images of the Ukrainian homeland. She also hugged the sobbing we of the Ukrainian ambassador telling her: “We are praying for you.” Charles told reporters: “What does one say ” Charles and Camilla also lit a candle, placed sunflowers, the national flower of Ukraine, at the altar and received a traditional offering of bread and salt. Bread is a symbol of what gives us le and salt what sustains le.  Also at the cathedral were volunteers helping the humanitarian effort and supporting the relief effort in Ukraine and others who have family and loved ones in the country and are working to support their community. It is understood the heir to the throne had approached the Ukrainian community offering his help and he brought representatives from five humanitarian organisations he is connected with to offer practical support. A source said: “He has been deeply moved and just wanted to do something to help. He wanted to listen to people to find out what they need and how he can help facilitate that.”  The visit to the cathedral comes a day after Charles spoke out about Russiaaposs “brutal” invasion of Ukraine.Speaking at a ceremony to mark Southend becoming a city, the prince paid tribute to murdered local MP Sir David Amess saying: “What we saw in the terrible tragedy in Southend was an attack on democracy on open society, on freedom itself. “We are seeing those same values under attack today in Ukraine in the most unconscionable way. “In the stand we take here, we are in solidarity with all those who are resisting brutal aggression.Meanwhile, yesterday the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were thanked by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for their support amid the Russian invasion.  On Saturday, William and Kate issued a rare, personal message saying they stood with the people of Ukraine as the Russian invasion of the country continues.They wrote: In October  we had the privilege to meet President Zelenskyy and the First Lady to learn of their hope and optimism for Ukraineaposs future. Today we stand with the President and all of Ukraineaposs people as they bravely fight for that future.And yesterday, President Zelensky took to Twitter to say he and his we Olena Zelenska were grateful for their support. He wrote: Olena and I are grateful to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge that, at this crucial time, when Ukraine is courageously opposing Russia ’s invasion, they stand by our country and support our brave citizens. Good will triumph.” Last week, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle also put out a statement saying they stand with the people of Ukraine.The message, shared on their Archewell website, reads : Prince Harry and Meghan, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex and all of us at Archewell stand with the people of Ukraine against this breach of international and humanitarian law and encourage the global community and its leaders to do the same.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Camilla, Duchess of CornwallPrince Charles, Prince of WalesRoyal FamilyRussia Ukraine war\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The young royal is third-in-line to the throne behind his grandfather Prince Charles and dad Prince William.But before he reaches the throne, he could be set for numerous title changes over this letime - and one dramatic change could see him bag a very grand title.When his dad William is King and mum Kate is Queen, George would be the male heir to the throne.And tradition is that a male in this position is awarded the title of Prince of Wales.  It is not a given that George will get the title, as it has to be bestowed upon the heir by the monarch. However, it is more than likely that William will pass this title on to his eldest son. George will also be probably given a dukedom on his wedding dayhe chooses to marry, meaning he could have two dferent titles by that time.

So far, George has made rare public appearances with his parents and his siblings Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. On Saturday, he was taken to Twickenham to watch Englandaposs exciting Six Nations rugby clash with Wales.  Before kick-off, George accompanied his parents as they met representatives from the two rugby football unions and then joined them in stands for the big game.And it seems the youngster delighted royal fans when he was caught on camera singing every single word of the national anthem God Save The Queen - alongside both William and Kate.George could be seen looking up to both of his parents throughout the tune for reassurance as he sang the famous words.  And commenting on a video uploaded to YouTube of the moment, royal fans couldnapost hide their delight at him singing them anthem, which pays tribute to his great-grandmother the Queen, whom he used to call Gan Gan when he was younger.One royal commented on the clip saying: Wills  Kate singing the national anthem was a treat.... and the shy Prince George singing for his Gan Gan. And another wrote: Wonderful outing with Mom and Dad! Prince George is such a credit to his parents and indeed the country. Loved the brightening on his face when singing God Save the Queen.

He’s had many opportunities tohome and spend time with his family – and hasn’t – but this really will show where his and Meghan’s mindsets are. Andthey don’t come back soon, and Lilibet doesn’t meet the Queen and Harry doesn’t celebrate her le and reign with her, it could be something he comes to regret forever.

Putin raised the awful spectre of nuclear confrontation because he’s losing, or at least not winning as easily as he expected. His calamitous miscalculation in invading Ukraine is backfiring badly now, and the world is uniting against him. He faces a battle at home too, as anti-war protests swell in Moscow and other cities. The pressure on Putin must be intensied, never relaxed, until he has withdrawn the last of his forces from the country he attacked.  And then he must face judgement. He must be held to account for an unforgivable assault that will cost many lives on both sides, including civilians. Many more are being forced to flee their homes in terror. Britain has sent military equipment and is picking up speed on sanctions but much more can be done to help Ukraine. Oligarchs close to Putin must be pursued relentlessly. And we should take in our share of Ukrainian refugees.

Confused  So were we until etiquette and civility expert William Hanson explained exactly how you manage it. He explained: Holding the fork, cut off one end of the banana, then cut off the other end. Then you turn the kne on its side and cut into the skin to prise the banana open. Once this is done, you cut a little bit off and eat it. Darren also says the Queen is quite particular about the fruit and vegetables she eats during their respective seasons.You can send strawberries every day to the Queen during summer at Balmoral and sheaposll never say a word, he said. Try including strawberries on the menu in January, and sheaposll scrub out the line and say aposdonapost dare send me genetically modied strawberries.apos But this isnapost the Queenaposs only bizarre eating habit as the way she has her steak is quite surprising. Grant Harrold, who worked with the royal family for seven years as a butler to Prince Charles at Highgrove House revealed that Her Majesty likes her steak well-done and that it is apparently quite unusual for her to have it cooked like that. Grant said: The Queen likes beef well done, she has things well done, which is really interesting.

I think she and Prince Philip enjoyed that enormously.One of her favourite questions, which she asks with good theatrical timing, is ‘Are you sure ’ – well, you’d better be’. The royal expert also commented on the Queen’s “extraordinary memory and how she often recalls remarkable anecdotes when she talks to people.He noted how she is able to seamlessly move from one conversation to the next, and said: “When she says these things, when she answers these questions, she’s very often moving on to the next person. “And it’s kind of a side which comes, she just drops it to you and by that stage she’s moved on. “She’s got a very good memory. You can’t catch her out. Her random access to facts and anecdotes and stories and things is quite extraordinary.

The last time I saw her.

Over the course of two skin-crawling days, bats living in his attic were found trapped in the spideraposs web just beneath the entrance of their roost. The first bat was immobilised with its baby limbs pinned to its body. It appeared shrivelled and discoloured from the deadly arachnid eating its remains.  A second bat, which appeared to be an adult was also captured and trapped in the web but it was still alive. Fortunately, the adult bat was rescued and released. Scientists say the eight-legged terror, which can grow up to millimetres and is the size of a small fingernail - has a taste for protected Pipistrelle bats. A study of the horrying event was published by scientists from the National University of Ireland Galway in the international journal Ecosphere and is titled Webslinger Versus Dark Knight.  Dr John Dunbar, Irish research council post-doctoral fellow at the venom systems lab, and lead author of the study said the spider would not eat the entire bat. He added the arachnid would instead feed off it until it is full. The noble  widow spiders contain a fast-acting neurotoxic venom with a similar composition to true black widows. Dr Dunbar explained: In this case, bats being vertebrate, the spideraposs venom possess a powerful neurotoxin and this enables this to take down vertebrate prey. This venom can cause neuromuscular paralysis which is how they can occasionally feed on small reptiles and mammals.  According to scientists, spiders have also been known to feast on lizards in Ireland. Noble  widows are one of three  widows that are likely to be found in or around UK homes. They are the largest of these three species, with males typically growing to body s of up to mm and females up to mm. Noble  widows are not native to the UK, are thought to have arrived in the late s from the Canary Islands in banana boxes. They can be seen throughout the year but are most often seen between July and November. Noble spiders are not aggressive towards people, and generally don’t bite unless roughly handled or defending themselves. The bite can feel similar to a wasp sting, and in rare cases, a person can feel very unwell.

Pendleton Together sent a scandalous letter to tenants at the nine council-owned blocks it manages in Greater Manchester with top tips for keeping warm. Advice included wearing layers and maybe wear a hat and glovesyou still feel cold and avoiding alcohol which can give you a  feeling of warmth when youaposre actually cold. Salford residents were also told to have warming food and hot drinks and stay as active as you can in the letter that was sent in December amid freezing temperatures, reports Manchester Evening News. The housing association apologised to any resident who felt uncomfortable or patronised following the letter which came to light at a council scrutiny meeting on Monday.  Councillors had met to discuss a .% rent increase for the blocks but the focus soon shted to the letter with many expressing their outrage. Conservative Darren Ward, one of two councillors who called in the decision to increase the rent, brought the letter to the committeeaposs attention. He said that it was ridiculous and unacceptable to increase the rent under the current circumstances. Labour Councillor Tony Davies also criticised the letter and said that asking people to wear layers indoors was condescending. I just found it incredibly, incredibly condescending, he added. Labouraposs Lewis Nelson said that he thought it was shameful that residents were being told to wear hats and gloves inside.

Speaking to OK Magazine, the chef, who worked for the royals for  years, said: Her Majesty loves chocolate, but particularly dark chocolate.

There were no Easter egg hunts back then but we’d make special novelty eggs for the children.  McGrady went on to share a hilarious memory of one particular chocolate egg that he made - back when Prince William was just a young boy.

Tracey Hewitt said that she was bigger than average from a young age, and bullying from other children hardened her skin to criticism.Her weight gain accelerated due to a late pregnancy at  and a drinking habit which came afterwards.After reaching st lbs, Traceyaposs doctors told her that her weight was impacting her health. Mum-of-one Tracey said: I was coming home from work and falling asleep instantly, I was just so tired all the time. I went to a doctor and she said my weight was making it dficult for me to breathe. She said I could do with losing  pounds. I thought she was a cheeky b***h.  Former hairdresser Tracey did not plan to follow the doctoraposs advice, but her mum told her to do so for the sake of her daughter, and the two signed up for Slimming World. Three weeks later, Traceyaposs mum died from complications with the chemotherapy for breast cancer and Tracey knew that she had to follow her motheraposs advice. I thought about giving up, but I knew I had to get myself healthy for both my baby girl and my mum, the -year-old said. After spending years ignoring bullies, Tracey genuinely did not realise that there was a problem with her nutrition and fitness. I honestly didnapost realise I was where I was, she said. I was swimming every week and my job meant I was on my feet all the time, I thought I was active. It was my portion sizes that were the biggest problem - I never had a sweet tooth but I was piling my dinners onto my plate.  Tracey says that at her heaviest, she drank no water, had toast and tea for breakfast, a sandwich, crisps and biscuits for lunch, chicken, salad and chips for dinner, and plenty of wine every evening. As well as Slimming World, Tracey joined aposClubberciseapos classes, that recreate nights of clubbing to help dance the weight away. When I first started I couldnapost even lt my feet up properly, she said. I went on my own and just stood at the back. The coach, Aleasha, was so kind to me. She put me on a nutrition course and helped me gain confidence. Iaposm so much mentally and physically tougher now. I stay behind for extra classes all the time. Tracey lost another two and a half stone with Clubbercise and her continued Slimming World program.  From the beginning of her weight loss journey four years ago, Tracey has dropped around  stone and has gone from a dress size  to size . Tracey now drinks two litres of water a day, a bagel or poached eggs for breakfast, tuna pasta for lunch, and gammon, mashed potatoes and vegetables for dinner, and goes to the gym three times a week. My le has definitely changed, she said.  I have more knowledge which can help my family to make better choices. I am physically stronger. I love exercise, because even at my biggest, I still swam and went to the gym, but god, my energy and stamina is something  now. I actually like being me now. I like what I see.

Chloe, who posts photos and videos of her adventures on her social media accounts, has been exploring buildings such as houses, churches and community centres since .Speaking to The Mirror, she said: What got me interested in exploring abandoned places was coming across YouTube videos of people going into abandoned hospitals.She added that, in particular, she was fascinated by influencer Joe Welleraposs trip to an abandoned psychiatric unit in Hellingly, East Sussex, and wanted to get in on the action herself. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Chloe says she finds dferent things on every visit and she tries her hardest to mix up the type of building she explores. She said: The most common thing I find in these places are old singer sewing machines, pianos and old photographs. On her TikTok channel, @Chloeurbex, Chloe posts videos of the buildings sheaposs wandered through - showing corridors filled with cobwebs, rusty household appliances and old cars with weeds growing inside them. But while many of the buildings are clearly old and neglected, much of the furniture in them remains eerily intact and untouched - and Chloe reckons you can learn a lot about people who lived and worked in the buildings before they were abandoned. If it’s a house, anditems are left [behind] you can see what job they did , who lived there and sometimes who their family were and maybe even what pornography they were into, she explained. Over the years while sheaposs been exploring, Chloe admits sheaposs had plenty of surprises - both good and bad - but insists she never feels frightened by walking around the spooky buildings. Technically, Chloeaposs hobby is trespassing, and sheaposs even been pursued by the police on one of her ventures - but claims she was let go when cops realised she was just being nosy. One of her most viral videos on TikTok shows her adventure around an abandoned leisure centre, where she walked around a completely empty swimming pool, climbed through the soft play area and even made use of the water slides. Despite racking up hundreds of thousands of views on her videos, Chloe doesnapost reveal the addresses of the places sheaposs visited - and she explained why in one video. She said: The wrong people get hold of them and they donapost respect the places.

Suzy Cortez, , from Brazil, had booked the house for a few nights in January of this year - but after she met her host, Suzy claims he kicked her out and threw her luggage in the bin. Suzy says sheaposd booked the property while she was visiting family in the city, while she was having work done on her own flat. But now she feels sheaposs been the victim of persecution and discriminated against because sheaposs attractive. According to the model, her host complained about the clothes she was wearing - pointing in particular to a pair of her workout leggings - before he cancelled her booking. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here After kicking her out, Suzy claims the host accused her of breaking into the home before throwing out her belongings. She says things got so heated she was forced to call the police. “I was startled when the host entered the property I was in and took my belongings and threw them in the trash – he only came in because I suffer persecution for being too pretty,” Suzy said. The model contacted Airbnb after receiving an email from them saying her booking had been cancelled as they “could not support” the reservation.  In response, on  January, Suzy wrote: “So from the second day I started to receive complaints about my gym clothes, which by the way were leggings, the host simply said that I would have to leave the apartment. She added the incident was the biggest nightmare sheaposs ever lived through and she has been the victim of prejudice. I am extremely embarrassed and psychologically shaken. Where would a trip to see my parents turn into a horror movie, she said. In an email to Airbnb, she added: “I had to go out on the street, doing absolutely nothing and having all my belongings in a garbage bag. After complaining about her experience, Suzy claims her profile was taken down. “Even the police themselves thought it was absurd, it wasnapost for lack of contact with you because I called countless times to report the cancellation, the reasons that nothing was resolved, she explained. “I am now at total loss and psychologically shaken. Being me the victim of all this, why  Prejudice because Iaposm famous, or have been on the covers of Playboys all over the world ” After an investigation, Airbnb fully refunded the Playboy model for the cash sheaposd spent on the property, and also restored her profile on the site.

And it turns out you can do just that by thinking about the way you put your groceries away.As reported byDublin Live,Tessa Clarke, from the food-sharing app OLIO, has offered a few tips that will help shoppers reduce how much food they waste in a way thataposs also beneficial for the environment.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.Clarke has advised on how to store your food in a way that will allow for a few extra days of freshness, giving you time to enjoy perfectly tasty products that may have otherwise gone bad and ended up in the bin.Her big top tip is never to store milk in the fridge door - yes, really! Shoppers are instead advised to store dairy products at the back of the fridge where itaposs the coldest, so as to get the maximum shelf le. Although milk can be frozen, the bottle should only be three-quarters full so as to allow for expansion once itaposs inside the freezer. And when it comes to ensuring bread lasts for longer, shoppers are encouraged to buy whole loaves rather than sliced, wrapping these in reusable cotton bags which they should then store in an airtight kitchen container. Meanwhile, Clarke claims open avocados should be kept inside a Tupperware container with a slice of onion, with this measure stopping the avocado from turning brown. Bananas need to be wrapped up in tin foil or a beeswax wrap to preserve freshness, while berries should be washed in a water and vinegar solution before being placed in the fridge. Clarke continues to advise that tomatoes are stored on the kitchen countertop, not inside the fridge, while she claims that cake will retain its moistnessstored with a slice of bread placed on top of it. Shoppers are also advised to have a specic eat me fridge shelf for food that they know will go off, allowing you to focus your attention on products that need to be consumed first.Clarke adds thatyou know you wonapost get around to eating a product before it goes bad, you could always consider giving it away through the OLIO app, where half the food added is requested by other users in just  minutes or less.

It reads: “In time, this to shall pass”, but the artist should have written “in time, this too shall pass”. ‘To’, which the artist mistakenly wrote, is a preposition that can be used in a iety of ways, such as indicating a direction of movement or place of arrival. For example, ‘I’m going to bed’.  ‘To’ can also be used to indicate a relationship between words, like having something that belongs ‘to’ you. However ‘too’, which the artist should have written, is used as a synonym for ‘besides,’ ‘in addition,’ ‘also,’ or ‘as well’. So in the case of “in time, this tooshall pass”, ‘too’ would be the correct form of the word. ‘Too’ can also be used to show that something is excessive, likea grammar lesson is ‘too hard’ to understand.  Users in the comments quickly reacted to the tattoo nightmare, with one commenting “I would simply be: upset” and another replying with a tongue-in-cheek “I would be to”. Another user added: “Iaposm trying to resist the urge to chase this person down with my blue pencil and make editorial corrections.” Whilst some users were kinder about the artist’s handiwork, writing “the artwork and lettering is nice - shame about the spelling.” Others were unimpressed by not only the artist’s grammar skills, but their handwriting too, pointing out that one of the ‘I’s in the phrase had not been dotted. One user said: “Never mind the fact that the too is missing an o, that handwriting is atrocious”.

When you first walk into the home, youaposll be greeted by the kitchen, which features modern grey cabinet fronts but measures less than two metres in width. And although the fitted kitchen is the same slender breadth as the front exterior, the lounge area stretches three and a half metres wide. Upstairs, the bathroom and first bedroom both measure . metres wide, but following the same pattern as the ground floor, the second bedroom towards the back of the home is wider at . metres. The home is definitely a tighter squeeze than most terraced houses, but the £, price tag makes it a great investment opportunity when compared to the average house price in Greater Manchester, which is around £,.  Estate agents at Cowell  Norford have described the tiny home as perfect for a first-time buyer or investor. The property is located in the semi-rural location of Littleborough and sits close to open countryside, which is ideal for walkers and cyclists. Those looking to commute to Manchester are also in luck with the home, as it is also close to Littleborough village centre and railway station.Meanwhile, we also recently shared how a tiny flat with holes in the bedroom floor has hit the market for a staggering £,. The one-bed flat in Fitzrovia, Westminster, has grid-style flooring on the mezzanine level where the bed seems precariously placed, butyou can get past the unique sleeping space, the rest of the small apartment is decked out in trendy furnishings.In more unusual property news, a two-bed bungalow recently went on the market for £, - but there is a nasty surprise in the front garden.Buyers will have to put up with the huge electricity pylon that sits right in front of the living room.

Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. The -year-old shared a video of the hilarious moment on TikTok, where she was seen pushing the button and making the room descend into darkness before disco lights illuminate the cubicle and Bee Geesapos Staying Alive blares loudly. After a private boogie and another three presses of the button, she left to tell her family then posted the video on the video-sharing site, where itaposs racked up more than . million views. Abi, from New Haw, Surrey, said: Itaposs got to be the coolest toilet in Britain - until I decorate my own and put one in mine. Iaposve made a playlist for it and everything. Iaposve been inspired. I just saw a giant button that questioned aposwhataposs the worst that can happen apos, and thataposs like a red rag to a bull, so I thought Iaposd find out. As soon as I saw it I had to press it.  I saw a lot of comments on my video worried a siren would go off, but that didnapost even go through my head, so I feel I should have more self-preservation than I do have. It made me jump at first. The music coming on and the lights going out. It only lasted around  seconds so I had to press it more times because I wanted it to last longer. Perch in the Parkaposs managing director Alex Coombes says they paid around £ to kit out two unisex cubicles with the bespoke mini disco, and he claims the reaction has been worth every penny. He also revealed the team opted to use Staying Alive as it was the one that stuck out to staff when they were searching through a disco playlist.Their electrical team fitted the aposemergency buttonapos and a control  into the wall and wired it up to an amplier and two disco lights attached to the roof. Alex explained: The idea came from seeing an aposinstant partyapos button on TV, but we thought weaposd add some jeopardy and a surprise outcome to see who could resist it. Hardly anyone can. It was an idea that came about when things werenapost very fun. It gave us a chance to do something dferent and a bit insensible. People love it, so itaposs been a really positive thing. Itaposs definitely been worth the money. Freelance writer Abi even ed to the restaurant the next day to take another TikTok video and insisted she enjoys the food as much as the funky toilet. She said: Their burger was insane, but the toilet was also great. Iaposd petition that it should be in everyoneaposs bathroom.

But do you make as much effort to keep the interior looking lovely  If your seats are looking a little dirty and in need of some TLC, then donapost worry, one woman has got you covered.Joanne Dunston, from Warrington, has gone viral on Facebook after sharing her simple hack for getting aposgrubbyapos car seats looking good as new - and it only took her  minutes to do. To try the hack for yourself, youaposll need two common bathroom items - shaving foam and an old toothbrush. Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.The -year-old management accountant showed how her car seats were initially stained with rain, plaster dust and aposgeneral yuckapos. She decided to test out a hack sheaposd seen, taking a £ bottle of Gillette shaving foam and spraying it directly onto the car seats. This was then massaged in with her hands, before being given a gentle scrub with an old toothbrush and leaving it for  minutes.Joanne then used warm water and a clean microfibre cloth to remove the foam.To her delight, the mucky seats were transformed – looking good as new once again.She said: I’ve shocked myself to be honest, it’s turned out amazing. I squirted – what I now realise was a bit too much! – shaving foam on both driver and passenger seat, I rubbed it in with my hand first to fully cover the seats. I then went and got an old toothbrush and just gently went over the seats with it, effectively rubbing the foam into the seats. I then left it for  minutes, took a bowl of warm water and two clean microfibre cloths back out with me. I did have to take the excess foam off by hand, I had put that much on, and then I rinsed one of the cloths in the warm water, wring it out as much as possible and just wiped the foam off the seats. I kept rinsing the cloth as necessary, then just went over with the dry cloth.Joanne shared the easy tip on Facebook, writing: So, after reading the shaving foam tip and being embarrassed for months about my car seats, I decided to give it a go! WOW, thank you, thank you! So, this is a mix of rain, water spilt and plaster dust and general yuk! I had little knowledge of how to use shaving foam……until today, I got it everywhere! For anyone asking how I did this, I bought Gillette shaving foam from Asda £! Put a bit too much on, wiped it over the chair and then went over it gently with toothbrush . I left it for  mins and wiped it off with a damp microfibre cloth...job done! So easy it’s unbelievable!More than , people have liked the post, with thousands taking to the comments section vowing to try it for themselves.One person said: Amazing never thought of doing my car seats! Thanks for pics absolutely fab job well done. Very impressive! another replied. Someone  added: Wow itaposs a dferent colour and everything, I thought they look light grey no Donna sky blue wow incredible Iaposm trying this thank you.

Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Chloe, who is from Australia, shared a video in which she explained she was blonde for years before her boyfriend at the time convinced her to dye her hair brown. But after hating the way her brown locks looked, Chloe headed back to the hairdressers to get them to bleach her tresses back to blonde again - which is where everything went wrong.In the video, which was posted on her @chloejade account, the woman revealed: This was me a few years ago. White blonde, quite happy with my hair, and everything.Stupid me decided to get a boyfriend who convinced me to go chocolate brown. It was at this point in time I realised he was just trying to sabotage me [because of how bad it looked].I rushed into the hairdresser to get back to my desired colour. I told them the situation and they said it was fine. As I was sitting at the basin they said my colour had lted better than they thought it would, and there was way less breakage than they had assumed. They then said aposWeaposre going to send you home with your hair in a bun and a treatment [on it] as we donapost want to put too much heat on itapos, and said I should come back for a trim in a week. When I got home, I realised this was why. Chloe then shared pictures of her hair after the bleach, which was severely damaged and was much shorter than it had been before the dye job - as her hair had broken during the process. The woman added in the caption that the salon still made her pay for her hair disaster. And in the comments, people were quick to inform Chloe that the hairdresser should have known what would happen. One person said: That’s on the salon not telling you the truth, they should have left it for a month before trying to correct it. While another added: As a hairdresser, it makes me so mad to see this happen to people.

On our fourth walk together, and fth day of having the dog, she starts saying aposWhy donapost you just rehome him  No one would blame you, heaposs so much bigger than you expectedapos. No mother-in-law, I am not going to give up the dog we just got who is still settling in because you donapost think we can handle him. For what itaposs worth, he is well behaved for a -month-old. And regardless, we have had him for five days - thataposs no time for him to settle in, let alone do any real training. Snapping at her mother-in-law, the woman said she will not be giving up her dog and explained how she is well versed at looking after larger breeds. I suggested that maybe sheaposd like to rehome her dogs because she obviously canapost keep them under control, she said. She ended up storming off leaving her partner and mother-in-law to walk her dogs alone - but later messaged to apologise for her actions, admitting her reaction was childish.  However, this only encouraged her mother-in-law to reveal what she truly thinks about her - and her oversized dog is only the start. Relaying her mother-in-lawaposs message, the woman was told: You only want to hear what you want to hear. I want the best for you but you stomping off like a princess and leaving my son embarrassed and looking all over the park for you is just childish, he doesn’t deserve this. I know how much he bends over backwards to try to make you happy, as do I, maybe itaposs time to grow up and step up  I’m sorrythis is upsetting you, and no I’m not being nasty, it’s just that you have needed to be told some home truths for a while now. You are quite entitled at times and unappreciative of what you have - maybe itaposs time to look forward, pull your weight and get on with le.Unbeknown to the mother-in-law, her son cheated on her at the start of their relationship and she only found out when she happened to cross paths with the other woman four years later. She also discovered her partner has been complaining about her to his mum in recent weeks, saying she doesnapost do anything around the house and leaves all the cooking, cleaning and childcare to him. In response to her mother-in-lawaposs message, the woman vented:He works full time, makes dinner, and takes my daughter to her other parentaposs. I do literally everything  - cleaning, tidying, laundry, raising the child, as well as being in college and working on getting into university. But hey, sometimes I leave the dishes in the sink and that means I am lazy and entitled. Sorry I struggle to appreciate your son considering he lied to me for years. It is something we are actively working on to get past. Of course, she doesnapost have the full details of what happened because itaposs none of her business. Just the idea that she thought it was up to her to tell me this just.. wow. Every day is a struggle to get past this and try to deal with the fact that this other woman is still in his le. I really really try. While most users urged her to leave her cheating partner, others shared their amazement at how she has tolerated such a aposdysalapos family for so long. One user said: What  could you have done but leave  You were getting no back up from your partner which means one of two things. He’s scared and doesn’t want to upset mommy or he secretly wants you to rehome the dog but due to cheating also doesn’t want to upset you. Another added: She sounds horrible. I know this is a bit obvious but never leave her to look after him - she could do anything. Can you reduce contact with her  If thataposs not an option, can you not tell her that her son made a big mistake and youaposre working to get through it with him so she needs to butt out.

File image of a unormed pro-Russian separatist Image: Anadolu Agency via Getty ImagesByTim HanlonNews Reporter:,  Mar |comments Young and scared Russian soldiers are crying as they go into war where they are being asked to “ fire at everyone, even civilians”, claim reports.Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine has not appeared to have gone according to plan against stf resistance and major cities have yet to fall to Vladimir Putin ’s troops.The attack on its neighbour, with many Russian’s seeing Ukrainians as brothers, has been vilied around the world, and reported to have left some of Putin’s army unhappy. Russian troops have been bombarding ill-equipped Ukrainians, some of whom are making home-made weapons, and civilian areas have been hit by bombs. Looking at the Russian operation so far, theyaposre having tremendous problems with logistics and communications. The whole effort seems shambolic, Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military at Washingtonaposs Wilson Center, wrote in a tweet.  Morale appears to be low with Ukraine media reporting there was a mutiny on a Russian ship that refused to attack the Ukrainian port of Odessa. Before an all-out assault was to start, the Russians radioed Ukrainian defenders to say they would not attack and asked to be allowed to leave the bay unharmed.Former-Ukrainian diplomat Olexander Scherba, wrote on Twitter : Last night a large group of Russian warships was about to launch landing on Odesa beaches.They approached the coast. Russia was about to shell the beach. Ukraine was about to shoot back when they suddenly withdrew. Reports that marines from Crimea refused to attack Odessa. At the same time Russian troops have been hit harder than expected with images of military vehicles blown up and the bodies of soldiers killed - many of whom have been left where they died.  And voice recordings appear to show desperate frontline soldiers complaining about the state of the army and in tears about what they are being made to do.British intelligence company ShadowBreak Intl has been listening to mobile and radio messages sent by Russian soldiers and recorded the low morale, reported the Daily . In one exchange a senior commander makes an order to hit a town with artillery fire but his subordinate questions it saying that civilians need to be removed first and that was later accepted grudgingly. The senior commander later is heard to say: “We’ve been here for three days! When the hell is it going to be ready ”  Another conversation involves a soldier who appears to be in tears and saying “it’s slow, it’s slow”. ShadowBreak founder Samuel Cardillo said that he had received recordings from amateurs listening into the conversations. Itaposs basically like tapping into a police frequency in the US, said Mr Cardillo. Itaposs basically the Russians transmitting on analogue. So when they request air support, or any kind of support, you will hear the helicopter or the fighter planes. We were told we would be greeted with open arms, but they call us fascists, a Russian soldier reportedly texted his mum in a message that Serhiy Kyslytsia, Ukraineaposs envoy, read out loud at the UN. He also read out that the soldier said: The only thing I want right now is to kill myself.  Mum, Iaposm in Ukraine. This is a real war. Iaposm scared, weaposre firing at everyone, even civilians. Valentina Melnikova, a veteran Russian human rights activist, also said soldiersapos mothers groups were receiving calls from young men in fear of being called up for the invasion. Mr Cardillo continued: There were periods where we heard them [Russian soldiers] crying in combat, a period where they were insulting each other – obviously not a sign of great morale. There was an instance where they shot at each other, there was an instance where they had to transport dead bodies back to their forward operating bases. Many times you can hear them not at their highest level of happiness.

That means we must throw open our doors to Ukrainian refugeesVladimir Putin has chosen the path of war Image: Getty ImagesopinionByVoice of the Mirror:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |comments Today we salute the bravery of the Ukrainian people as they struggle to repel the biggest invasion of their country since .Their sacrices in the name of freedom are heartbreaking, humbling, but inspiring. And it is the duty of every civilised nation to do all we can to help them.The air raid sirens wailing over Kyiv  years ago warned against Nazi attacks, not Russian ones. ButVladimir Putin objects to being compared with brutal dictator Adolf Hitler, he has only himself to blame. Like Hitler, Putin’s word cannot be trusted. Like Hitler, he promised peace while all the while being intent on war.Like Hitler, Putin cares nothing forindependence and liberty as he attempts to recreate an empire.And like Hitler, he plans to subjugate a sovereign nation with all the force and brutality at his disposal. Just as we faced down Hitler, we must face up to another dictator determined to destroy the freedoms we hold so dear. And we must do it without sleepwalking into a Third World War.  Boris Johnson compared this invasion with that of Czechoslovakia in . This time there must be no appeasement. That occupation set off a chain of events that took six years of horrying war and  million deaths to resolve. Ukraine must regain its rightful independence sooner than that but, nevertheless, we must be prepared to be in this for the long haul. Now that Putin has chosen the path of war, he has to win it, and we dread to imagine the horrors that might unleash.  That means we must throw open our doors to Ukrainian refugees who appeal to us for a safe haven and might even want to stay here. We are told such a resettlement programme is being prepared. But, as always in Whitehall, the wheels are moving despairingly slowly. Ireland has waived the need for visas for Ukrainians. The Irish will get them to safety first and worry about the paperwork later. We should follow that example. Now it is incumbent on the rest of the world to isolate Russia as the pariah state it is. Even Putin’s traditional ally, China, has shown a certain ambivalence to the tyrant’s actions.  It abstained on the UN resolution to condemn Putin for the invasion – a promising result rather than a great one. President Xi of China is the one man who might persuade Putin to withdraw and he should make every effort do so. Meanwhile, the rest of the world must put a stranghold of sanctions around the Russian state. And NATO must stand firm and resolute.  The borders of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland are the NATO red line. Putin must be left under no illusion about the lethal consequences of crossing it. Andthe Russian people are as truly opposed to this war as they appear to be, there is only one course of action open to them: to topple the man who caused it.

The US model, from Calornia, met her retired lieutenant colonel boyfriend, from Texas, in February  at the Galaxy Fest sci-fi convention in Colorado.Despite their  year age dference, the pair immediately hit it off due to their shared interest incosplay, sci-fi and comic books.They soon began dating but not everyone in their lives were supportive of their new relationship at first. Kataposs mum shared her doubts of Robaposs intentions but has since taken a liking to him after the coupleaposs two years together.  The model told how the pair fell in love after we went out on our first date. For Rob it was my geeky personality and for me it was that he could make me laugh effortlessly - weaposre both naturally silly people, she added. My family was not so keen on me and Rob being together, especially at first. My mum said he was closer to her age and that he just wanted me because Iaposm young and eventually he will get tired of me. It was hurtful, but things have changed in the past two years and she seems okay with it now. They met recently and she even hugged him which was a big moment.  When Kat and Rob are affectionate with each other in public, strangers sometimes stare and whisper about the couple when they think they arenapost looking. And scepticism about their love isnapost just confined to the outside world. The couple have people online commenting on pictures of them together, calling their relationship disgusting and even telling Kat that she should leave Rob and try dating someone younger. Kat said there are distinct advantages to being with an older man that strangers simply do not understand. Notably, Rob is mature, emotionally stable and knows what he wants in le. He is also able to provide for the couple financially, allowing Kat to avoid spending her s living with her parents.  Kat said that Rob also always steals the show with his charm when they meet with friends or go out. There are lots of benefits to being in an age gap relationship. Rob has plenty of le experience, he knows what he wants, and is responsible, she said. Being with someone older often means that you are with someone both more emotionally and financially stable and can avoid living in your parentaposs basement. When we are out, I notice people staring and whispering about us. I certainly notice it more than Rob does. Online we always get comments about his age and people asking why Iaposm with an old man. Women often comment about it being disgusting. They say that aposhe just likes young womenapos and say that aposwhen I get tired of the old man I should try someone youngapos.  Age certainly doesnapost define the love we share. Rob has two kids from previous marriages and with him having sole custody over his six-year-old, it does affect our ability to go and do things as a couple. But I share an amazing love with both his six-year-old and eighteen-year-old so there are no issues there. Kat is eager to let the world know that age should not define any relationship and hopes to eventually marry Rob, despite not particularly believing in the institution itself. Some people are sceptical about being with someone a lot older or younger than themselves, but you might be missing out on the best thing in your le, she said.  A lot of the time you can find stability with a person that is more mature. Eventually we want to get married even though we both donapost believe in the institution of marriage. There are benefits to doing so and we both plan on being with each other for the rest of our lives, so why not.

The women have since filed a lawsuit against the hospital and opened up about the impact of the shocking revelation in an interview with Today. Jillaposs biological mum Kathryn Jones, who raised Tina, told the publication about the impact it has had on her as a parent, describing it assomebody took a hatchet to her heart. She recalled thinking that Tina was a beautul baby at birth and insisted she looked just like the man they thought was her biological dad, who left when she was two years old. The familiesapos heartbreaking discovery came in  when Tina took a DNA test to find out more about her granddad, Kathrynaposs father, who also left when she was a child. But she was confused by the results, which included a list of DNA relatives with names she did not recognise - including Brister.  Kathryn did not recognise the names either so Tina arrange for her to take a DNA test too and their results did not match. Tinaaposs daughter suggested that they had been switched at birth and so they began researching the names given by Ancestry. This led her to a woman who was born on the same day, lived nearby and resembled Kathryn in her appearance. I thought it looked just like my mother, Tina said.  Further digging led them to Jill, the woman in the picture, who Tina also asked to take a DNA test. The results came back as a match for her mum. Tina said: All I could think about was how I was going to tell my mum. I just thought sheaposs not going to be able to handle it. Thataposs what I thought about.Her mum Kathryn was heartbroken by the news, but said Tina will always be her daughter. It just devastated me. Totally devastated me, she said. I could not lose Tina, sheaposll always be my daughter. I have loved her from the second they laid her in my arms. Tina explained that Kathryn feared losing her but insisted she was not going to disappear after finding out about her biological roots.  She has now got to know the woman she was switched with and discovered they share a love for shopping, real estate and the colour purple. Her biological parents Joyce and John Brister, who raised Jill, have died. Jill said: Itaposs a hard thing to know what to do because there are no books to buy to get you through it. Tina and Jill were both born at Duncan Physicians and Surgeons Hospital in Oklahoma on May , .They are now suing Duncan Regional Hospital, which merged with the hospital, for recklessness and negligent inflection of emotional distress. Despite the merge in , Duncan Regional Hospital claims that it is not the same and is therefore not responsible for the birth swap. Kathryn told how one of the worst parts of the ordeal was learning that her grandchildren were not biologically hers either.  She said: It was like somebody had ripped out a part of my heart. I just couldnapost deal with it. Tina, the daughter she raised, added: Thereaposs so many people involved. Itaposs not just me and Jill. Itaposs two entire families.

But by the time I was on the case, the disease was spreading closer to home # in forests near Loch Carron, Ross and Cromarty.Phytophthora, ominously meaning #plant destroyer#, is a genus of fungus-like organisms containing around  known species with a worldwide distribution.The genus, which includes the pathogens that cause potato blight and sudden oak death, has been responsible for massive crop failures, economic loss and environmental damage.Phytophthora are called #fungus-like# since they behave like fungi but dfer from them, and from all animals and plants, in several key features of their reproduction and chemical makeup.This places them in an ill-defined group of misfits called protists, which also includes amoebae, kelp and slime moulds.Phytophthora pluvialis was discovered in Oregon USA in , where it resides in soil and watercourses, and mainly infects Douglas fir.Its recognition in Cornwall during  was the first identication of this particular Phytophthora species in Europe.Thought to have arrived here on imported live plants, its spores germinate in water and can be spread, for instance, on shoes, tyres and animal paws.The pathogen infects a iety of trees, including western hemlock, Douglas fir and several pine species, causing needle shedding, shoot dieback and lesions on the branches, trunks and roots of infected trees.Forestry and Land Scotland and its policy section Scottish Forestry took rapid action # surveillance to detect infected forests, restrictions on the movement of timber and trees, and asking the public to report suspicious tree lesions.But since the European climate is ideal for P pluvialis to thrive, and its favoured trees are commonly grown here, like so many other plant pathogens, it seems likely that this one is here to stay for the long term.Forestry and Land Scotland asks foresters and the public to be vigilant for signs of Phytophthora pluvialis.Anyone who thinks they might have spotted signs of the disease should report it using the online TreeAlert system on the on www.forestresearch.gov.uk website."},{"url":null,"title":"kilberry loop sportive announced","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowThe popular Kilberry Loop Sportive will take place on Saturday August  this year.Organised by Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle Club and local man John Hardie, the -mile open road event starts and finishes in Tarbert.Registered as an event with British Cycling, the fun, friendly Kilberry Loop Sportive is targeted at every level of cyclist.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a veg plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is key to successful growing and means you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and veg beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing direct into the ground at this time of year there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option. Not only does it provide a warm environment for germination, but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests. If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, that#s even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost filled seed trays then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost. If the seeds are big enough to handle, you can sow them inidually into cm pots. The quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds between five and  seeds per pot. For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can be planted outside, tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill. You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and # handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots # gently tease them apart. Drop inidual seedlings into a five-centimetre compost filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level. Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own veg, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes. These can be planted from mid-March, however planting times will y across the country according to temperature and risk of frost. Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags. You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, approximately cms deep and cms apart.Once stems are about cms tall, they will need earthing up by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered.

Avoid plantingthe ground is frozen or extremely waterlogged.Your planting hole should be no deeper than the roots, but at least three times the diameter of the root ball.It#s a good idea to soak bare-rooted trees for about  minutes before planting.Place the tree in the planting hole so the first flare of roots on the stem are level with the soil surface. If you plant the tree too deep, it can result in rot and disease.You may need to insert a stake for top heavy or larger trees. Refill the planting hole, firm gently and water in.Drought stress is common in newly-planted trees so make sure you keep watering throughout the growing season. The quantity required will y with soil type, but  to  litres per square metre – four to six watering cans – each week in dry weather will do the trick.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow lettuce seeds – both under cover and outside.If you start now, it will give you a continuous supply that can be harvested throughout the year.Sow in modules or fibre pots under cover to have lettuces ready to plant outside in four to six weeks.

million.As part of an enormous package of cuts aimed at saving money, the council plans to axe music tuition in all schools which would mean the end of the school band.In a support letter, Sir Paul describes the proposals to axe music tuition as #catastrophic# and urged the council to re-consider.He wrote: #I feel it would be disastrous for the area to lose this essential musical training, not only to the local people whose lives are enriched by music, but also for the tourism on which so much of the local economy depends.#Campbeltown and the surrounding district is famed throughout the world for its traditional music and it would be very unwise even to consider implementing measures which would effectively bring this reputation to an end.#He added: #I am lending my strongest support to the local people who are fighting to protect the teaching of music in their schools and I will urge the council to reconsider any plans they may have to implement these catastrophic and far reaching measures.#FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown#s coal situation is worsening and now merchants have only one week#s supply left.The local firm of D McNair and Son announced earlier this week that it

Why There have been many attempts by faithful people to explain unbearable tragedies with faith in a loving God. Few are convincing – at least at the time.For me, the love that people give to one another is God reflected in human goodness.Living by faith is not easy. Sometimes it means being assailed by doubts and I believe we must be honest about our questions.After all, did not Jesus say: #The truth will set you free.# When those most bitter and painful tragedies strike us down, faith can be a consolation – sometimes the only consolation – even as at the time it is tested to breaking point."},{"url":null,"title":"town causes to land co op cash","story":"Thanks to Co-op members choosing the supermarket#s own-branded products and services, over £ million has been raised for more than , causes since .Each year, members are encouraged to pick a local cause in their community that supports access to food, mental wellbeing support or opportunities for young people, helping to build stronger, more resilient communities across the UK.In Tarbert, Fèis an Tairbeirt, Tarbert Soccer Centre and Tarbert After School Care are to receive grants and, in Mid Argyll, Argyll and Bute Befrienders, Mid-Argyll Transport Volunteers and Mid Argyll Multiple Sclerosis Centre will benefit.#We know that this year is going to be another incredibly challenging year for local causes and communities,# said Rebecca Birkbeck, director of community and membership at the Co-op.#With the cost of living rising dramatically already this year, charities are likely to bear the brunt of people being more conscious about their spending.#At the Co-op, we work hard to bring people together to ‘co-operate for a fairer world’.

The scenes from Paddington to Windsor were impressive, especially the arrival at Windsor and the unforgettable journey to St George’s Chapel.To those people in Kintyre, so far from the television

The project team would like to highlight that the mocked-up photograph was produced to illustrate the scale and impact of a major flood event on Musselburgh, and is derived from the council’s new Scheme Hydraulic Model.It is understood that this specic location, by St Peter’s Kirk, has flooded on at least four occasions in recent memory: , ,  and , with the event of  being the smallest event. Alongside the mocked-up photograph that Mr Taylor describes as “fake news”, the project placed an image of actual flooding from  at this location. No photographs exist from the other events however, it has been determined that the event of August  was equivalent to the one-in--years flood event from today and that the flood waters that day would only have been approximately mm lower than shown in the mocked-up image.The project team would like to highlight that the scale of water that would flow down the River Esk and or inundate the town during these events is almost unimaginable to anyone that has not experienced such an event – this is not considered a “cataclysmic” flood scenario as described by Roger Crofts on February : Musselburgh has a very high level of flood risk today as it did in , and this will get worse in future years due to the impact of climate change. The scheme’s flood maps are equivalent to the flood risk mapping previously undertaken by SEPA and which is available at their website.Mr Taylor also stated that “four bridges will be demolished at a cost of £ million, which will effectively cut off one part of town from the other”. The project team would like to highlight that at no point has the council ever considered removing and not replacing existing structures, as the importance of connectivity within the town is clearly understood. The project team would like to highlight that at this point, no decision has yet been taken on the form and design of these replacement structures.The council are comfortable that the scheme already includes a suite of flood risk reduction measures that include natural, sustainable and catchment measures. This includes: a debris trap by Whitecraig as requested by Roger Crofts on a number of occasions modication to existing Victorian reservoirs in the South Esk catchment to hold flood waters away from Musselburgh and protection of the Musselburgh coastline to allow the sand to continue to build-up naturally.The project team are, however, clear that Musselburgh cannot be protected without new defences along the River Esk’s banks through the town and along the coastal foreshore. The design of the scheme is not yet started, therefore any rumours of m-high concrete walls are not considered a valid concern.The project team will be in The Brunton on March  to continue to consult the town before the outline design commences.

Males have a chestnut-brown back, light brown chest with black spots, and a prominent grey-blue head and tail, whilst females are unormly brown. Like most members of the falcon family, the kestrel is equipped with black eyes. The purpose of this is to reduce the amount of glare entering the bird’s eye and improves vision, especially in bright light.Kestrels are mostly distinguished by their typical hunting technique, hovering -m above the ground, either by flying into the wind and using its fanned tail and pointy wings to hold position, or by soaring using the lt caused by a ridge or a similar obstacle. The bird keeps its eyes constantly fixed on the ground and, when it eventually spots prey, it swoops down and kills using the side of the beak rather than using talons like hawks do.The kestrel’s hunting skills are enhanced by incredible eyesight. These birds can see ultraviolet colour that is invisible to the human eye! This means they can easily locate their prey by detecting a rodent’s urine trail, which shines brightly in ultraviolet.Apart from watching kestrels in the air, they can also be seen perched on a tree branch, fences, lampposts or wires.These birds mainly feed on field voles, which constitute most of their diet, but can also take mice, shrews, small birds and occasionally worms or large insects .Kestrels do not build nests but instead they lay eggs in natural cavities such as holes in trees or cracks in clfs. If you live in the countryside, a good way of encouraging kestrels to the area is to put up nest boxes for them. Each bird species has dferent requirements when it comes to nest boxes, so it is worth researching online as to what the right measurements should be. Feel free to get in touch with myself as well!With just a little bit of patience, kestrels can be easily spotted. Once you have learned their hover style, you will not mistake it for anything ! Another good tip for looking for kestrels is to remember that they are birds of habit –you saw them perched on a tree in the local park, try going there again at a similar time, there is a huge chance they will be around!In East Lothian, I have two favourite kestrel spots: one is in Musselburgh Lagoons and the other one at The Grove. I visit those places fairly frequently at dferent times of the day to give myself a greater chance of photographing the birds in dferent light, but it is worth remembering that birds are most active at dawn and dusk.So far, I have found kestrels surprisingly relaxed with my presence however, I would not feel confident to say whether all kestrels are like this orI have been lucky. The rule of the thumb is to remain respectful of an animal’s space and never to disturb them I always move slowly when taking steps towards an animal and never in a straight line, so it does not feel challenged.

As a result, some of the nation’s fish and chip shops are now struggling for survival.As they are not protected by the energy price cap, chip shops are now facing huge rises in energy costs. Some members of NFFF have reported electricity bills going up from £ to £, a month.The NFFF is urging the government to reconsider its planned  per cent increase on VAT in April, which is an added concern for the industry.The spiralling costs hitting fish and chip shops include a  per cent rise in the cost of cod since October,  per cent rise in the cost of haddock in the last year,  per cent rise in the cost of mushy peas, and  per cent rise in the cost of batter.Industry leaders now say that chip shops will have to raise prices to survive but many could be forced out of business.In , East Coast was crowned one of the UK’s  Best Fish  Chip Takeaways for the second year running – the only chippy in Edinburgh and the Lothians to make the list.The accolade followed an extensive search by trade publication Fry Magazine to find the chippies serving up the finest fish suppers amid the ongoing challenges of the Covid- pandemic.Mr Crolla runs the Musselburgh takeaway and restaurant with his we Katia, and his family have been serving the local community for nearly  years.He said: “By teaming up with the National Federation of Fish Friers we hope to do our bit by encouraging people to support their local fish and chip shop around Scotland during these extremely challenging times.“Our family has been proudly serving the local community with quality fish and chips for nearly  years, but the spiralling costs battering our industry are putting all that at risk.“We won’t compromise on quality, but these external factors will inevitably mean a rise in costs for us and our customers.”Andrew Crook, president of the NFFF, added: “We are in unprecedented times where we are seeing high levels of inflation, and food inflation is even higher.“Most of the supplies we use in the fish and chip industry have increased drastically in price and we are expecting this to continue for some considerable time.“Other products are simply not available, and we have seen suppliers move away from the sector.“Fish and chip shops like East Coast in Musselburgh do feel the effect of these increases more than most cuisines as our margins are much tighter. The price of fish is comparable to steak in supermarkets.“As a result of this, and our commitment to ensuring a high-quality, good-value product, we may regrettably be forced to review our prices to reflect the rising costs our industry is facing.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mothers-day-chocolate-gifts-can-buy-year-including-hotel-chocolat","story":"And theres plenty to choose from!

Musselburgh is one of  golf courses to have hosted the oldest golf championship in the world, which this year celebrates its own milestone with The th Open Championship being held at St Andrews in July.To mark the th anniversary of golf at Musselburgh, Musselburgh Old Course Golf Club– which later this month celebrates the th year of its re-founding in  – is hosting a series of events across , ending with a gala dinner in the town in September.This Saturday, members of MOCGC will contest the club’s th Anniversary Stroke-play Championship. On July , more than  golf clubs and foundations from across Scotland have been invited to participate in an -hole tournament on the Old Course.Sir John Foulis of Ravelston’s game  years ago was referenced in The Golf Book Of East Lothian, compiled and documented by John Kerr, M.A, F.R.S.E, F.S.A.Scot, the Minister of Dirleton, which was published in .Golf may have been played by royalty at Musselburgh even earlier than . Mary Queen of Scots was reported on her indictment in  to have played golf ‘at Seton’, most likely at Musselburgh, while her son King James VI was also reported to have played golf there.Musselburgh’s Old Course has left a “lasting legacy” on golf in many factors. The accepted diameter of a golf holewas the width of the piece of drainpipe used at Musselburgh to cut the holes. This was adopted by The Royal and Ancient Golf Club in  as the official measurement requirement for all golf holes, as they standardised the rules of golf.The Old Course is also regarded as the birthplace of competitive women’s golf. As early as , the local fishwives were reported to have indulged in golf on their days off. In , the club that later became Royal Musselburgh sponsored a women’s golf competition on New Year’s Day with prizes – a fishing basket and silk handkerchiefs.Perhaps the most famous of the many golfing families to have been based at Musselburgh were the Park family. Willie Park Senior, born in Wallyford, was the first winner of The Open in , and went on to win it a further three times. His brother Mungo won the first Open Championship played at Musselburgh in , while Willie Park Junior was a two-time winner, including in , the final year that Musselburgh hosted The Open.Steven Hill, captain of Musselburgh Old Course Golf Club, said the anniversary was “a momentous day” for everyone connected with the course, adding: “To be captain of our club in this historic year is a tremendous honour for me.“While our club only dates back  years, in that time we have helped to restore the Old Course to its former glory. The history of Musselburgh Links is precious – the members of our club recognise our role as protectors of this ancient course, and hold its traditions very dear to our hearts, including continuing to play hickory golf here.“We are immensely proud that Musselburgh is one of only  courses in the UK to have hosted The Open and it is fitting that, in the same year when The th Open Championship is played at St Andrews, our course can also celebrate a signicant milestone.“Most of our members grew up playing on the Old Course. In this anniversary year, we want to secure a lasting legacy for golf here by encouraging the next generation of local golfers to experience Musselburgh Links and become part of its future. We also welcome visitors from across the world to visit and join us in our celebrations.”Angela Howe, director at The RA World Golf Museum, said: “The Open has been played at some of the world’s most historic golf courses and Musselburgh is undoubtedly one of them. As one of the three prestigious venues, with Prestwick and St Andrews, which played host to the early days of The Open and the home course of the great Park family among others, it has a rich golfing heritage. It’s wonderful to see this remarkable milestone being celebrated in such fitting style throughout the year.”Michael Beamish, captain of the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, said: “The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers has written records stretching back more than  years. Originally based in Leith and, since , at Muirfield, the club grew and flourished during the period when Musselburgh Links was its home.“Musselburgh Links was the home of The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers from  until . In , The Honourable Company built a clubhouse in Golf Place at the west end of the Links and throughout this period both the town and the nine-hole course played a leading role in the development of the rapidly growing game of golf. Musselburgh and the Links have a long, important and distinguished history and deserve the title ‘The Cradle of Golf.’“The Honourable Company would like to congratulate the clubs at Musselburgh Links and the affiliates involved in managing and maintaining the course, enjoyleisure and East Lothian Council, for such a wonderful golfing legacy, and send very best wishes for the th anniversary celebrations.”John McMillan, Provost of East Lothian, said: “The Old Course has a very special place in both East Lothian and Scottish golfing history.

He has put Tommy Shelby on the wagon. Believe it, brother.Only an event of seismic proportions could have brought such a change in a character. Sure enough , as we catch up with everyone’s favourite back street razor gang turned criminal big shots, the worst has happened to Tommyand the rest of the family. Aunt Pol, played in glorious fashion by Helen McCrory, is no more.It was not a change anyone wanted to make, but in real le, a place crueller than any fiction, McCrory died last year. Her character deserved an exit fit for a Gypsy Queen. She got it.The deed done, the action shts forward four years. Tommy Shelby is in his usual striding mode, head down, meaning business, a black dogby his side. He’s a long way from Birmingham, though, in Miquelon Island, Newfoundland.Though prohibition is over Tommy has big plans for the ships that ran booze to America. To that end he is meeting Michael Gray, Polly’s son, who blames Tommy for his mother’s death and has sworn to have his revenge.Thus the stage is set for a final sub-Shakespearean showdown between the ambitious young prince, Michaeland Tommy’s king.But what of the other players who have strutted and fretted their hour upon the Peaky Blinders stage  Brother Arthur, sister Ada, Tommy’s we Lizzie, Johnny Dogs, and the rest  They too have been changed by Pol’s death, Arthur most of all. Poor Arthur, half man, half grenade. How can Tommy hope to conquer America without all the family by his side If this is the end for Peaky Blinders on television – there are plans for a movie though– then where better for the Sopranos of Small Heath to bow out than America  Only in America would mobsters like the mighty Jack Nelson, whose acquaintance we have yet to make but whose legend precedes him, mix with presidents.America suits Peaky Blinders in other ways. This has always been a show with cinematic ambition. Indeed, Knight premiered the first episodes, back in , at the Edinburgh Film Festival. From the slo-mo swagger of the central characters and the drop dead stylish clothes, to the modern music applied to a period setting, it was obvious this was a small screen drama with big ideas.While it has stumbled occasionallyPeaky Blinders has built an army of devoted followers. If this firing on all cylinders opener is a guide, this could be the best series yet."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-worlds-best-hope-lies-russian-people","story":"I well remember the confrontation between the USSR and the US when nuclear warfare was on the brink and both sides were pumping up the rhetoric, with US nuclear armed bombers heading towards Russia while the USSRs missiles were being primed in Cuba. False or misunderstood messages could have led to Armageddon and almost did, when a USSR submarine commander was wrongly advised that an attack on his country had commenced and only the bravery of the third officer required to arm a nuclear missile for firing, in refusing to do so, saved the day.Mr Eadies use of the word lunacy in relation to Mr Putin is pertinent andindeed he is deranged, dramatic reactions by the West are more likely to inflame rather than defuse the situation. Surely the best hope is that the worldwide sanctions on Russia will persuade the Russian people to take action to remove this despot who has made their country a pariah and isolated them from all political, commercial, social and sporting links with the outside world. Thousands have already demonstrated their rejection of Mr Putins actions on the streets of Russias cities, risking the fate of the , already arrested for doing so.In closing, as someone a decade older than JA Smith , and having been opposed to nuclear weapons all my le – I witnessed the horric effects of their use in Japan – I remain steadfastly against them as a so-called deterrent and find it sad that any satisfaction could be derived from thinking that in the worst possible scenario the retaliatory killing of millions of other innocents would occur.James Graham, Clydebank.WE SHOULD EXPAND NATOIN recent weeks Vladimir Putin seemed like a psychopath, but one in touch with reality who made rational calculations. I thought perhaps we could come to a compromise with him on Ukraine being made a permanently neutral country, infor ending the Russian invasion.His threats of war against Finland and Sweden using the same pretext , and his attempt to annex the whole of Ukraine, show he’s neither rational nor responding to perceived threats to Russia. Finland and Sweden have been neutral countries ever since the Second World War ended. Only Russian threats could change that.Within days, both countries had responded, rationally enough, by sending arms to the Ukrainians, becausehe wins in Ukraine, he’ll come for them next.Mr Putin’s demand that Nato leave all former Soviet bloc states or he’ll force them to can’t be dismissed as posturing any more. He believes he can reimpose Russian domination of these countries by war and threats of war.If he isn’t deterred or defeated he’ll invade all the neutral countries in Europe, then likely trigger World War Three by invading Nato members Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.Nato should rapidly admit all remaining neutral countries that want to join, and get US, British or French troops deployed in them as a deterrent. Ukraine obviously is an exception, asit joined we could be in World War Three right away, but the more support and arms it’s given the better. Leaving him with a pretext to attack neutral countries but no deterrent against doing so will mean more Ukraines.Duncan McFarlane, Carluke.BLAME THE FAILED POLITICIANSIN my letime the countries of the \"West\", actually the United States and Britain, have started more wars, invaded and bombed more countries than you can shake a stick at. They have overthrown more governments and installed more dictators than Vladimir Putin ever has.The justication for this is iniably the need to remove some madman or make the world \"safe for democracy\". I dont recall Allende in Chile as falling into the category of madman. Chile, however, has the geographical misfortune of being in the continent of America and therefore falls within the scope of the Monroe Doctrine, meaning the US feels entitles to a free hand to act in the interests of freedom and democracy business and rapacious capitalism, take your pick.Is this war Putins war or Russias war  This is up for debate what is not up for debate is that the tragedy unfolding in Ukraine could only arise in a world suffering from an absence of effective and meaningful institutions and mechanisms for conflict resolution and negotiation. In this vacuum figures such as George W Bush, Boris Johnson, President Putin, Donald Trump and Tony Blair strut the world stage. Mr Trump, the leader of the \"Free World\" for four years, actually tried to overthrow his countrys political and constitutional system, Mr Blair routinely lied to Parliament while Mr Johnson couldnt distinguish the truth from the Erskine Bridge. I would, to coin a phrase, go die in a ditchI felt I had any values, western or not, in common with someone like Mr Trump.Some of the recent letters in The Herald on the subject of nuclear weapons have, quite bluntly, been disgraceful. As for democracy, in this country it is something that ordinary men and women have fought for it, is not something that fair-minded politicians have gted. It is something that Mr Johnson with his attempt to prorogue Parliament and Mr Blair with his culture of spin have sought to undermine.It is a central part of Russian history that it has no tradition of elective politics or institutions based on this practice an eminent historian of the country has suggested this is why the revolutions of  and  failed. Expanding Nato and missile deployment wont assist progress in Russia. Building strong international institutions and repudiating politicians like Messrs Bush, Trump, Blair and Johnson might be a start.Brian Harvey, Hamilton.WE MUST NEVER GIVE UP HOPEWITH the despicable assault on Ukraine continuing I remember, as a young man with tears in my eyes, being restrained from travelling to Hungary in , as the Russian tanks blasted their way into Budapest.More than a decade later in  the same happened in Prague. However, in the late s the Soviet Empire began to disintegrate and by the s democratic freedoms ed.Therefore, as the madness of one man explodes over Ukraine, we must never give up hope in the ultimate goodness of mankind. As we salute the courage of Ukraine let us support its people, in every way possible, remembering there is more good in the world than evil and that hate is always the loser.Grant Frazer, Newtonmore.WE NEED THE UK UMBRELLATHE SNPs defence spokesman, Stewart McDonald, has boldly and righteously stated that previous armed forces cuts by the UK Government were a “mistake” and “short-sighted”. This from a member of the SNP that wants to get rid of Trident from Faslane and wants independence which could and more than likely would result in Scotland being outside Nato.Further, quite where Mr McDonald would grow the money tree to provide the necessary resources to fund Scotland’s defences and armed forces is anyone’s guess. If we ever needed convincing that the UK as a whole and as part of Nato can demonstrate strong defences it is now in the face of the most dangerous military action in Europe since the Second World War. Mr McDonald would do well to remember, that at this time, he can make such comments under the umbrella of UK security.Richard Allison, Edinburgh.FOLLOW THE EUS EXAMPLEWHAT a mean-spirited letter from Jane Lax , who grudges the Scottish Government giving humanitarian aid to Ukraine in this most desperate of times. I think that the vast majority of the compassionate, generous Scottish public will support the Scottish Governments aid package to Ukraine, and I would point out to Ms Lax, who contends that the First Minister is letting down people on our streets, that the Tory Government cut Universal Credit by £ per week, while the SNP Government is doubling the Scottish Child Payment, along with other measures to combat poverty.Nicola Sturgeon is also right to plead that anyone from Ukraine fleeing for their lives should be welcomed to the UK, and that \"the paperwork can be sorted out later on\". On top of its historic announcement that it is sending weapons to Ukraine as well as humanitarian aid, the EUs announcement that all its member countries will take in Ukranian refugees for up to three years without needing to apply for asylum is truly admirable, and should be emulated without delay by the UK Government.Ruth Marr, Stirling.Read more: Sturgeon is letting down her own people"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13527731.jpg?type=article-full","title":"interview-comic-actor-jack-docherty-takes-one-man-play-road","story":"IN many ways Jack Docherty is the quiet man of Scottish comedy. Even though he’s been at the heart of some of the most successful comedy shows of the past four decades – as a writer, performer and producer, we know very little about him.That’s why his new one-man play Nothing But comes as something of a surprise. Or does it There we are again. How much of the seemingly autobiographical nature of the play that made critics’ top ten lists at last year’s Edinburgh Fringe is really true “It’s a play about me putting on a show,” he says. “I’m trying to reconnect with a woman I had a one-night stand with in Edinburgh in the s. I find out via the internet that she’s coming to the festival again so I do this in the hope of bumping into her again.“It’s chasing a lost romance, but there’s another story about a lost connection in there.”If it’s not strictly autobiographical it certainly draws from the experience of le of anyone who is dancing around the big -.“Things like unrequited love, obsession over the years, how the Internet changed the world, fatherhood, distant fathers, orce, marrying the wrong person. You know, it’s all those kinds of topics.”Although the play is set in Edinburgh, the topics are universal. Jack will certainly see enough of Scotland as he heads off in March on a -date tourbefore taking the show into the Soho Theatre in London at the end of April.“The play did so well in Edinburgh that Karensaid why don’t we tour it “The Fringe experience last year was dferent. Instead of  in the Gilded Balloon Dining Room venue we could only have  and for ventilation we had the back door open so there was light flooding into a room that would normally be dark. I could see people!”Standing solo on a stage isn’t something that Jack has done often. His long-running successful role as Chief Commissioner Cameron Miekelson came without the rest of the Scot Squad for a solo show at the King’s Theatre in Glasgow a few years ago.“Miekelson is still a character – it was still a play rather than straight stand-up. It was an unusual moment. I would turn and wonder where Moraywas “Normally you would have a breather and someone  would be doing something, but suddenly it’s just you. But then of course you’re getting all the laughter and all the money,” he laughs.He adds that he’s been asked why the Chief isn’t going on tour.Clearly it would be a good earner but the idea of Nothing But and being himself, but not quite, excites him most.There is definitely a little more light and shade in Nothing But and that ability to turn an audience’s emotions is another challenge for the writer and performer in Jack.“There are a couple of serious bits that I haven’t tried before. That’s quite scary. Oh God, the audience have gone very quiet, and then you think, ‘Oh no, that’s a good thing. That’s good. They’re meant to be quiet. If they were laughing at this, we’d be in big trouble.’”Jack recalls seeing a master in the craft of being able to turn an audience’s emotions seemingly effortlessly. “I was a really young man I saw Jim Broadbent live.“He was riveting. You would be crying with laughter one moment and then in a moment, he’d be breaking your heart. It was amazing to experience.”Jack moved south when he was in his s. Along with writing partner Moray Hunter he remembers the days in Edinburgh typing out scripts, putting them in envelopes, sending them and then waiting for the response. “When I tell my kids that, they just can’t get their heads around it!”There was writing successes with Spitting Image, Alas Smith and Jones, The Lenny Henry Show, Vic Reeves’ Big Night Out. Four series of Absolutely for Channel  followed. A sketch show that can rightly be described as influential in its slightly surreal outlook.Jack decided not to take part when the rest of the cast brought Absolutely back for a Radio  revival a few years ago.“It just really wasn’t for me. I was happy for them to use the characters I had created for the TV series but I didn’t go down and see it being recorded… ‘What are they doing with my legacy !!.’ I’m joking of course but it shows the staying power of what we did back then. It was all quite innocent and childlike and it seems that, thanks to YouTube, another generation is enjoying it.”As he points out, Jack has spent two-thirds of his le in England, but thanks to his involvement in Scot Squad, plus ious specials, he has had even more excuses to head home.“That connection never goes of course. I’ve been in England so long and this is where my kids were brought up but I’ve never felt any less Scottish. Now that they’re grown-ups my we and I do discuss coming home.“My mother and sister are still in Edinburgh too. With the amount of work for Scot Squad I do feel like I live in both places sometimes and this tour is a great opportunity to see so much of the country.“I’ve never really done social media but an online tour video diary might be an idea this time. Even just to document it for myself. It’s anotherwee challenge. I like those.” In March, Jack brings Nothing But to the Beacon Arts Centre, Greenock, on Friday , Eastwood Park Theatre, Gfnock, on Saturday , Eastgate Theatre, Peebles, on Thursday , Tivoli Theatre, Aberdeen, on Friday , Perth Theatre on Saturday , and Oran Mor, Glasgow, on Tuesday  and Wednesday .For dates across Scotland in April, visit www.gildedballoon"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13528215.jpg?type=article-full","title":"pick-scotlands-unusual-museums","story":"Coal mining was an integral part of communities across Scotland for decades, but it is an industry now largely consigned to the history books.

In Burray, the mph zone on Westshore Road will be extended to take in the Bloomfield Road junction.The work on kerbs and crossings in Kirkwall will take place throughout March and into mid-April. These works have been identied and prioritised following discussions with the local Access Panel to help ensure that improvements are provided where they are needed most.Work will start, from Monday  February, on the crossing at the junction of Carters Park Road with Berstane Road, before moving onto the crossing along the top of Cromwell Drive, with crews moving onto the access into Logie Drive on Thursday and Friday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This stems from the  Harbours Act which states that any harbour may be open to all for the shipping of goods.“But in my view is this is so very dferent. Can you imagine Churchill complying with Victorian legislation and allowing a vessel owned by a hostile nation into the Flow “We have a proud maritime history in Orkney, and we should play our part and issue an immediate ban on all Russian vessels entering our harbours. This would be a peaceful but very effective act.”Councillor Sankey intends to liaise with OIC officers, his councillor colleagues and politicians early next week to see how this visit can be stopped. He says he can’t condone OIC services of any type assisting the vessel.“Whilst we may by law have to allow access, there’s no law that says our pilot boats and tugs should be used, and I’m deeply unhappy about our harbour assets helping a Russian ship under current circumstances,” adds Councillor Sankey.In a statement provided to The Orcadian on Saturday, Orkney Islands Council said the authority is an “extremely dficult position.”A spokeswoman said: ”We recognise the strength of feeling around this — feelings that we share —  but we are bound by our legal obligations to accept the vessel, until such a time as the UK Government tells us otherwise.“We have sought urgent advice from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, who have told us that the current sanctions do not cover this operation.”We continue dialogue both with elected representatives and Government departments on this situation as we seek to clary what possible further action can be taken.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We’ve spoken to Eddie and liaised with England’s physios and SC staff,” Sanderson said.“We’re all on the same page and we need to catch up post-Six Nations to understand how we can potentially manage it better.“But we’re struggling to see how we can at the moment, apart from it being too much too soon. vw,vw,px, px\"Sale boss Alex Sanderson, pictured, says Tuilagi must be managed carefully “You can look and delve into things and go down rabbit holes, but sometimes you can see ghosts which aren’t actually there. It’s important to understand that.“The reason why we want to sit down together is over concern for the player. It’s not over grey areas. I just want us to be on the same page.“There are email trails and phone calls. Everyone speaks to everyone. There are probably seven, eight or nine conversations going on at the same time. For me, it’s better just to get everyone in the same room.“There is only one Manu Tuilagi and loads of us coaches. This is about Manu and I want him to play for England like everyone  does.”Tuilagi’s value to England has never been more apparent than during the opening three rounds of this Six Nations when their midfield has made little impact, fly-half Marcus Smith emerging as the sole shining light.How the table looks after Round ! 👀#GuinnessSixNations pic LLHHkvYV— Guinness Six NationsFebruary , And while frustration grows as the injuries continue to accumulate – most notably for Tuilagi himself – Sanderson refuses to adopt a gloomy outlook.“When this happens, you have to reframe it in your own mind. What are the positives  What can I control ” he said.“The positives are that he’ll be back in a week or two, he’s in great form, he’s positive himself.“He’s probably in the shape of his le. He’s definitely got two or three years ahead of him, so this is just a little hurdle.Squad update… players convene for a three day camp.More details ⤵— England RugbyMarch , “When you reframe it like that, you start to look forward until the next year and half until the World Cup as opposed to looking back.”When askedTuilagi would be better served from an extended run in Sale’s team rather than being in the England camp, Sanderson said: “In terms of his ability to improve theof his career, yes.“And that’s only because the intensity of training and physicality of games are less in the Premiership than for internationals.“The physical and mental strain obviously increase in that environment. Neurologically and physically, it puts strain on you. That’s the only reason.“Everyone wants him to play.

My letter to Ministers 👇 pic RkDbHHWgru— Darren Jones MPMarch , Mr Jones, MP for Bristol North West, asked Mr Freeman whether he “considers this situation inappropriate given the current situation” and whether the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy “intends to intervene by engaging with the OneWeb board in its capacity as a major shareholder”.He also asked whether the department was “assisting” the firm to find “alternative rocket launch availability”.On Wednesday, Downing Street faced questions about whether the UK Government approved of the launch going ahead.The Prime Minister’s official spokesman told reporters: “It is absolutely right that questions about space co-operation with Russia are being raised following their invasion.“We are still monitoring that situation carefully in regards to OneWeb.“We are speaking to our partners and will set out next steps, but I don’t know any more than that at the moment.”Theres no negotiation on OneWeb: the UK Government is not selling its share.We are in touch with other shareholders to discuss next steps…— Kwasi KwartengMarch , Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng tweeted: “There’s no negotiation on OneWeb: the UK Government is not selling its share.“We are in touch with other shareholders to discuss next steps…”Pressed on how the launch could “credibly” go ahead given the launch involved “borrowing Putin’s rockets”, the No  official said: “I don’t want to pre-empt any further decisions.”The Prime Minister’s former chief aide Dominic Cummings is thought to have been influential in the UK’s decision to invest in OneWeb.With satellite internet services less simple to switch off than terrestrial signals, Mr Cummings suggested this week that situations such as that unfolding in Ukraine were behind the Government’s thinking when making the purchase, as it would allow broadband services to continue in conflict areas.Responding to businessman Elon Musk making his Starlink satellite service available to Ukraine following the Russian advance, Ms Cummings tweeted: “The capability to do this sort of thing was one of the reasons we discussed for doing OneWeb summer  – it could be a powerful new capability for UK.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

It’s a departure from what they’ve done the last few years.“The rough is thick off the fairways, but then what they’ve done is they’ve taken out a lot of these run-off areas off the greens where historically you’d miss a green and run off and you’d still have to chip off short grass, for example, and now that’s all been filled in with rough.“There’s just so many areas that there were run-offs and sort of tight areas, which I think lends itself to the better chippers of the golf ball, and that’s been sort of taken away this year.“I don’t quite understand why they’ve done that, but it’s definitely a dferent test than one in previous years.” vw,vw,px, px\"Rory McIlroy reacts to his tee shot on the ninth hole during the second round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational McIlroy’s victory at Bay Hill came  months after the death of tournament host Arnold Palmer, who traditionally sat beside the th green to congratulate the winner of the event.But the Northern Irishman was still presented with the red sweater given to the champion and was asked about its whereabouts in his pre-tournament press conference.“It’s in my wardrobe,” added McIlroy, who won the Tour Championship on the same day that Palmer died in September .“I have not broken it out since then. It’s a little scratchy. It wouldn’t be that comfortable on the skin, but it’s obviously very, very nice to have in the wardrobe.“I wish Arnold would have been around to be with me on the th green then. That would have been the icing on the cake.

While most children aged  to  will have mild diseasethey contract COVID-, some may experience symptoms which last longer than just a few days. Vaccination of children in this age group has been shown to help prevent the small number of hospitalisations and intensive care admissions that can occur in this age group. It has also been shown to help provide short-term protection against non-severe disease. Dr Jillian Johnston, Joint Interim Assistant Director in Health Protection at the PHA, said: “We know the COVID risk for young children is less than for older people, but we also know the vaccine is very safe, has already been used extensively around the world, and there is no evidence that it causes any long term issues. When you look at the risk of COVID- against the risk of the vaccine, it’s more beneficial for children to receive the vaccine. It not only boosts the child’s immunity against the risk of severe disease, but helps protect more vulnerable or older family members in advance of any potential future wave of COVID-.” A new specially-designed children’s formulation of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID- vaccine has been approved for this age group and it’s given at a lower dose compared with that used in iniduals aged  and above . Like all children’s vaccines, this approval was given following a robust review of data showing that it is safe and effective to use in this cohort. Clinical trials have shown that this vaccine was highly effective at preventing COVID- in children, protecting them and also reducing the chance that they transmit the virus to others, including family members who may be more susceptible to severe consequences of the infection. Dr Johnston continued by saying: “In Northern Ireland, childhood vaccination programmes have consistently achieved high coverage and we hope that parents will be supportive of this roll out and get their child vaccinated. Vaccination is the most important thing we can do to protect ourselves and our children against ill-health. Evenyour child has already had COVID-, it is still important to get them vaccinated, as being fully-vaccinated can offer them the best protection from the virus and severe disease.” From Wednesday  March  you can make an appointment for your child at a children’s vaccination clinic in your local Health and Social Care Trust using the online booking system at:covid-.hscni.net get-vaccinated. You may be able to attend without an appointment. Dr Johnston concluded: “COVID- has not gone away. Getting vaccinated provides the best protection for both the child and their family. Children will need two doses of the vaccine, usually  weeks apart, to get longer-lasting protection. If your child has tested positive for COVID-, you should normally wait  weeks from the test for your child to have their first or second vaccine.” For further information for parents on the COVID- vaccine for  to  year olds visitpha.site all-s Or to find out where your nearest COVID- vaccine clinic is, visitvaccinations.covid-.hscni.net location-search"},{"url":null,"title":"council agrees to overrule 15 age rating for new","story":" FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueBy Jonathan McCambridge, PAMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailChildren under the age of  who are accompanied by their parents will be able to watch the new Batman movie in Belfast after the city council overruled the age rating given to the movie.It means Belfast will be the only location in the UK where the movie, starring Robert Pattinson, will have a A rating.The Batman had originally been given a  rating by the British Board of Film Classication .My batphone has been ringing off the hook for these last two weeksArder CarsonMichael McAdam, managing director of the Movie House chain in Northern Ireland, had originally made the application after he said cinema staff had faced abuse from parents in recent years because younger teenagers were not permitted to watch films with a  classication.Read MoreThe Batman movie review: Robert Pattinson is The Darkest Knight yet in director Matt Reeves’ gruesome superhero horrorHe said a new A classication would allow parents to make the decision and accompany their children to the cinema.A proposal he took to the council’s Licensing Committee was narrowly defeated last month, but on Tuesday night the full council accepted a proposal from Sinn Fein councillor Arder Carson that the film should have a A rating.Mr Carson told the meeting: “My batphone has been ringing off the hook for these last two weeks with people asking me what in the sweet name of Gotham City is going on in that Licensing Committee.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ae .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fc-dbc--b-fcb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ae .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fc-dbc--b-fcb_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ae .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fc-dbc--b-fcb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ae .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fc-dbc--b-fcb_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Michael McAdam, managing director of Movie House Cinemas in Northern Ireland PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueMichael McAdam, managing director of Movie House Cinemas in Northern Ireland  “We all know the crux of the matter.

Photo: Justin FarrellyHugh O#ConnellMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailSinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald gave an extended interview to the Russian state-backed television news channel RT last year.The station, formerly known as Russia Today, has faced accusations of being a propaganda machine for Vladimir Putin’s regime. The EU said this week it was taking the unprecedented step of banning the channel along with another state-owned channel, Sputnik, from broadcast and satellite TV in member states, while Google banned both channels from YouTube.In the wake of the invasion of Ukraine, Sinn Féin said last night it no longer gives interviews to RT, which has described itself as an “autonomous” operation financed by the Russian Federation.Ms McDonald gave an -minute interview to RT on Going Underground with Afshin Rattansi on February  last year in which Ms McDonald was described as “the president of Ireland’s most popular party” and “the leader of Éire’s opposition”.Read MoreDUP demand Sinn Fein ‘step back’ from ‘pro-Putin propaganda’ in response to Chris Hazzard tweetThe interview touched primarily on issues related to Northern Ireland including recourse for victims of the Troubles, the Covid- crisis, Brexit and the Northern Ireland Protocol, a border poll and hospital waiting lists.At one point she hailed Rita O’Hare, a leading Sinn Féin fundraiser in the US, as “an extraordinary and outstanding woman” whom she encouraged Mr Rattansi to interview. Ms O’Hare is wanted in the UK as part of an investigation into the attempted murder of a British soldier. Ms McDonald also denied that Ireland was an “aircraft carrier” of the United States whose troops have landed in Shannon Airport and said Ireland was “militarily neutral”.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Responding to queries from the Irish Independent last night, a Sinn Féin spokesperson said: “This interview is over a year old and was exclusively about Irish affairs and matters pertaining to Ireland.

Craig Harkness, Ross Connolly and Darren Cassells on the wings were making super tackles when required, while Andrew Mullholand kept the opposition outside the circle.Bangor won a short corner, but Ballynahinch kept the ball out and go on the attack. Leslie Harrison found Alex Millar and he passed the ball to Hugo Melville who attacked up the right hand side before being stopped in his tracks.Before the end of the first quarter Bangor ed to the lsquoHinch circle and took the lead with a tap-in at the back post.With both sides now settled in, the second quarter was full of end to end action. Matthew Martin made a break through the Bangor defence and passed the ball to forward Jason Campbell who won a short corner. Bangor were able to stop the Hinch drag flick from the top of the circle.With Bangor on the front foot and looking to increase their lead they applied the pressure on lsquoHinch. They moved the ball around looking for an opening and went further in front with a shot which came off the back board.lsquoHinch kept the heads and created chances, but they couldnrsquot stop Bangor going - in front.In the third quarter Ballynahinch kept trying to get on the score sheet with Ashley Brown, Andrew Mulholland, Leslie Harrison and Alex Millar all working hard.Hinch started to creep up the pitch and Matthew Martin created a channel for the ball to be fired up to Jason Campbell, whose attempted pass to Michael Carney was unfortunately intercepted.Bangor were able to create several chances in the Hinch circle, only to be stopped by keeper Aaron Donnell, Ashley Brown and Andrew Mulholland. However, they added another goal to the scoreline with a well-placed shot.In the final quarter Hinch broke through the Bangor defence and Craig Harkness narrowly missed pulling a goal back.Bangor were on the attack for most of the closing stages and forced a series of short corners which were kept out as lsquoHinch put every player behind the ball.However, a well placed pass across the circle narrowly missing every Hinch stic and was deflected in at the back post.As Bangor continued to attack, a drag flick from the top of the circle was deflected over the crossbar by keeper Donnell and a number of late short corners and further attempts on goal were kept out by stout defending from Ashley Brown, Leslie Harrison, Matthew Martin and Alex Millar.Player of the match: Ashley Brown.The club wishes to thank the Primrose, Ballynahinch, for their continued sponsorship..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Bhoys batter Carryduff in goal feast at Ballyhornan  ","story":"CELTIC Bhoys breezed through the adverse weather conditions to remain in the hunt for the league title as they swept aside a depleted Carryduff outfit at Ballyhornan on Saturday.Hat-tricks apiece for Celtic marksmen Sean McMahon and Jordan McCoubrey helped the Hoops to an emphatic victory on a weekend when plenty of other fixtures suffered postponement as a result of Storm Eunice.The away side only travelled with a total of  players and so immediately were at a disadvantage as the hosts knew they could call upon their benchneeded.With this in mind, Celtic attacked the opposition from the outset with strike partners McCoubrey and McMahon linking up on numerous occasions within the opening minutes.It didnrsquot take long for the home side to find the back of the net after Barry Treacy lofted a pin-point pass on to the head of McMahon, who steered his effort past Carryduff lsquokeeper Conor Leggett.Although often pressed back into their own half, Carryduff were determined to make a go of it and knew they had to make the most of their seldom opportunities.Midfielder Ciaran Conway saw his free-kick glide gracefully into the arms of Celtic custodian Nathan Curran, before McMahon was again causing problems at the other end.This time he saw his headed effort ruled out for offside. This was a warning sign of things to come as just moments later McCoubrey managed to put the ball into the net courtesy of the outside of his right boot after a scramble in the box.Again, Carryduff showed their resilience and still relied on their counterattacks, the latest coming from captain Conway, although his misjudged pass denied team-mate David Quigley a chance at goal.The pressure would continue to mount on the Carryduff back line and soon it was - as McCoubrey registered his second of the match mdash albeit through an unorthodox but neat finish.Celtic defender Blaine Connolly saw his effort fantastically thwarted by Carryduff lsquokeeper Leggett, who pounced to the bottom right corner of his net with a strong outstretched arm to deny further punishment.The weather began to give its input into the game as temperatures ped bitterly and the wind began to blow harshly at intervals.Although this cannot be cited as the determining factor in this contest by any stretch of the imagination, it certainly played its part when Carryduffrsquos Emmet Curran saw his through ball carried beyond its intended target.Carryduff did manufacture a rare breakaway and it looked asstriker Jonathan Wilkinson would open the away sidersquos account when a pass from midfield left him with just lsquokeeper Curran to beat.However, an impressive last-ditch tackle from defender Gary Carberry allowed the Celtic number five to hook the ball to safety, thus further frustrating the opposition.Celticrsquos Shaun Megahey saw his left-footed effort saved before Carryduffrsquos Joseph McBrien swept up the loose ball and in the last notable action of the half, Conway witnessed his lowly struck effort palmed away from danger by the Hoopsrsquo number one.As the second half kicked off, the home side showed no signs of relenting as they pushed for more goals.Conaill Kerr saw his point-blank effort superbly saved from six yards by lsquokeeper Leggett, who, despite the score line, made numerous contributions to prevent his side conceding into double figures.This over-eagerness from the hosts would cost them as they were caught short at the back, leaving Raymond Grant unmarked  yards from goal.The striker quickly picked his spot and unleashed a lovely curled effort into the top right hand corner to get his side off the mark.Unfortunately for Carryduff, this was as good as it got as Celtic replied almost immediately with McMahon grabbing his second of the matchafter rounding the lsquokeeper for an easy tap in.Things went from bad to worse for the away team when Stephen Galbraith slipped a pass into the path of team-mate Conaill Kerr, who made no mistake with his finish in the one-on-one scenario.At this point Carryduff were aiming for damage limitation but Celtic smelt blood. McMahon completed his hat-trick with an eye-catching acrobatic effort before McCoubrey, tapped in his third of the day.Hoops defender Carberry picked up a yellow card after some unsavoury words with the official and captain Michael Rice was left red-faced after midfielder Curran knocked the ball between his legs, but the home outfit didnrsquot let that deter them from their onslaught.Carberry atoned for his booking in the form of a late header from a Galbraith corner delivery to round off the scoring at -.After the match, hat-trick hero Sean McMahon gave his thoughts on his sidersquos resounding victory.ldquoIt was a good performance, he said. ldquoWe knew they only had  players so we had a good chance of winning but you have to play the  minutes and make sure you get the victory at the end of the day.ldquoWersquove put pressure on the league leaders, itrsquos good to score three goals but the main thing is to get the three points.He added: ldquoI donrsquot usually score headers so thatrsquos my pick of the goals for me.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, B Connolly, R Fitzpatrick, G Carberry, M Rice , B Treacy, C McCartan, S McMahon, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.

The Gill brothers, Gareth and Kyle, were among the replacements.Ballynahinch used the conditions superbly to burst into a lead they would not surrender.Playing with the wind, they pinned the students back with excellent tactical kicking and after missing an early long range penalty they went for the corner following a UCC offence at the breakdown and Kyle McCall burst from the edge of the maul to score.A great kick and chase moments later led to another penalty and another maul try for McCall. Greg Hutleyrsquos superb conversion took Ballynahinch  points clear after  minutes.The second quarter yielded only a single UCC penalty. Ballynahinch were not quite as accurate as they had been earlier in the game and small errors and indiscipline allowed UCC plenty of possession. However, excellent defence and long clearing kicks meant that the Ballynahinch line was never threatened.The second half was a scrappy affair and Ballynahinch began to fall foul of the referee at the breakdown.UCC kicked a long range penalty to close the gap to six points and missed another moments later as Ballynahinch struggled to put phases together into the wind.

Ballynahinch piled on the pressure, carrying hard at the line and desperate UCC defence led to another penalty and a yellow card for their replacement prop.The game was now there for the taking and following another big scrum on the UCC line Ballynahinch tried to put Conor Rankin over on the blind side.Multiple phases later UCC looked to have weathered the storm when they stole the ball and kicked clear. A superb chase saw Ballynahinch caught in possession but Cairns made an excellent arcing run to scythe through the cover and head for the line.He was tackled just short but the supporting Hutley was on hand to barge over, taking a knock in the process.He recovered to slot the conversion, sending Ballynahinch  points clear going intothe last five minutes and they saw out the game in relative comfort.Celebrations lasted long into the night and Ballynahinch have now put daylight between themselves and UCC.Third from bottom UCD arrive at Ballymacarn Park on Saturday to take on a rejuvenated local outfit who now have a snf of avoiding the relegation play-off.

The design was rejected by the council.The campaign started last May when contractors turned up with equipment and portacabins and marked the trees for felling.Local resident Lily Devlin noticed the development and started the campaign, first rallying support via her Facebook page, and then starting an online petition.Speaking on behalf of the Save the Trees Campaign group, Cathie McKimm said: ldquoThe council got this wrong from the beginning.ldquoWe now have a situation where the council are applying for planning permission for a project they have already appointed contractors for and the project has increased by almost % in cost.ldquoIn bringing in experts to late at a huge cost to the ratepayer to fix the many mistakes theyrsquove made, including failing to include a drainage system in a flood risk area, the council are now having to contribute more than pound, to this scheme and growing, whereas before they were only contributing approximately pound, for the same scheme. ldquoGiven all the conflicts of interest that the council now have we do not believe they can assess this planning application objectively, and believe that the Department of Infrastructure needs to call it in and conduct a full investigation about how this has been handled.A council spokesman confirmed that a planning application for the project would follow regulations which apply to all councils throughout Northern Ireland in making its decision.He said: ldquoThe council will let matters follow due process, mindful of the procedures put in place by the Department for such planning applications.He also confirmed that the project, which was planned as a local tourism boost, had increased in costs.ldquoThe council has applied for and obtained funding of pound, towards the project. At the start of the regeneration scheme, the proposed costs were circa pound,, he said.ldquoHowever, with the passage of time, increased construction costs and refinement of the scheme , the costs were last estimated at circa pound, which was agreed by council in October .A DfI spokesperson confirmed it had initially considered making a preservation order on the trees.He added: ldquoHowever, on January  , the council confirmed that it had instead opted to submit a planning application. This was lodged on December  to the Planning Service of the council. The necessity of whether it is expedient to complete the process of making a TPO is on hold pending the outcome of the planning application..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Smell wind of change as lambs leap around fields  ","story":"IT is spring again in Lecale and new le abounds in the fields. Daffodils are peaking out of the ground, the weather is softening, and the feast of St Brigidrsquos Day , February , has passed.This can mean only one thing ndash lambs! In fact, lambs have been born in our practice since before Christmas. But the majority will be coming to a field near you over the next few weeks.Now, modern flocks have a lot of sheep in them. Indeed, there are about five million sheep in Ireland overall. Thatrsquos one for every man, woman and child.Our domestic sheepis descended from a primitive European ancestor, today found mainly in Corsica. In the past it was common for sheep to havejust one lamb. But today, thanks to better feeding, shelter and shepherding, it is possible for sheep to have twins, triplets and even quads!This abundance can come with problems though. Whata sheep doesnrsquot have enough milk to feed this many lambs  Well, farmers have come up with a number of solutions.The first is lsquopet lambsrsquo. These lambs are hand reared. They are fed with a bottle using condensed milk from commercial suppliers. Or the milk can be taken from another ewe who is producing a lot.As anyone with a baby will tell you, this solution is labour intensive and will keep the shepherd working around the clock. But they are dedicated, and they do it! It is not always sustainable in the long run. Another solution is fostering.Lamb fostering is where a ewe adopts the lamb from another ewe. The reasons for fostering can be manold. A lack of milk is one of the major reasons. The ewe may not want to take on another lamb, not recognising it as her own, but shepherds have adapted one of naturersquos many wonders to encourage it to happen.They use a technique called olfactory imprinting. Have you ever wondered how a ewe can recognise her own lamb in a flock of hundreds  One reason is that, just after birth, the ewe learns the smell of her newborn. This is what olfactory imprinting means.Shepherds can take advantage of this amazing process by rubbing some of the birthing fluid of the newborn lamb into the wool of the lamb to be fostered. The ewe will then accept the lamb as one of her own, and feed and care for it. The lives of many lambs are saved in this way.So when you next look at the fields of Lecale, check out the sheep and seeyou can tell them apart. Evenyou canrsquot, their mums can!.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ulster Aviation Society left ‘dismayed’ over council at Festival of Flight decision  ","story":"THE decision by Newry, Mourne and Down Council to cancel this summerrsquos international Festival of Flight in Newcastle was taken without consulting one of its key partners, it has emerged.Last weekrsquos decision to pull the plug on the event mdash which was last held in  mdash was taken in secret during a meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Tourist and Regeneration Committee.It is understood that no contact was made with the Ulster Aviation Society which has played a major role since the inaugural festival and described its disappointment at the cancellation decision.Regularly attracting in the region of , people to the resort in the summer, the flagship tourist event has been a major success for over a decade.Council officials say that due to the challenges in planning such a major festival, securing commitments from participants and with the uncertainty caused to date by the pandemic, organising this yearrsquos event would not be possible.Some councillors believe that given the local authorityrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parades in Downpatrick and Newry are set to go ahead next month and with the further easing of Covid regulations, some form of airshow could have been organised for Newcastle this summer.This week, Slieve Croob councillor Alan Lewis urging the council to confirm that next yearrsquos festival will go ahead.The Ulster Aviation Society said it was ldquodisappointed and dismayed about the cancellation of the airshow and the fact that the organisation had not been consulted.Society chairman Ray Burrows said it was ldquoastonishing that the event had been ldquoshot down in secret, with no reasonable explanation.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke has urged the local council to ldquograsp the opportunity and organise an alternative event, suggesting a large scale festival that incorporates and builds on the most popular elements of the Festival of Flight.He is keen to see an event showcasing the regionrsquos ldquooutstanding food and drink offering with Newcastle a designated venue for arts, culture and music events to create opportunities showcasing the entrepreneurial spirit and pioneering innovation of the district.Mr Burrows said while these were ldquoall excellent suggestions, he said as elements in addition to, or within, the Festival of Flight, surely not as a replacement for it.He continued: ldquoThat said, we would be pleased indeed to meet with the council or the mayor to discuss the matter. We want to help Newcastle demonstrate in a powerful, popular way how important our aviation future and heritage are to Northern Ireland.ldquoThatrsquos exactly what did in recent years, before Covid.ldquoWe [the UAS] had probably the most popular exhibition within the ground-based event and thousands of parents have brought their children for photographs in our Spitfire and our Alouette helicopter, at no charge.Mr Burrows suggested that unless the councilrsquos decision is reversed, or at least re-assessed, he expects there will be tremendous disappointment from the public.The international festival was cancelled in  because of bad weather and in  and last year because of the Covid- pandemic it was also grounded.Urging the local authority to confirm that it will be chocks away for next summerrsquos Festival of Flight, Cllr Lewis said that for the past two years, the organisation has been unable to deliver a tourism events programme due to the impact of Covid-.ldquoAlthough the possible impact of future Covid iants is dficult to predict, it is hoped that larger scale events can resume this summer. This will be a welcome boost to residents and the local trade and hospitality sectors, he continued.ldquoCouncil research indicates that almost poundm was generated in  for the district as a direct result of tourism events. Therefore, it is bitterly disappointing that this yearrsquos Festival of Flight will not be going ahead.Cllr Lewis said the income that it would have generated would be a welcome boost to traders in the town and benefit the collective tourism industry across South Down.He continued: ldquoWe must not underestimate the huge draw of this annual festival. I note that council officers have said that throughout this past  months they had continued to engage with key stakeholders including the RAF.ldquoIt was advised that due to challenges planning the festival, securing air assets and the uncertainty of the pandemic that it has not been possible to host the festival of flight this year.Cllr Lewis revealed that he has been contacted by many aviation enthusiasts who are bitterly disappointed that the festival wonrsquot go ahead.He added: ldquoI fail to see how the event couldnrsquot have at least been planned for later in the year, now that we know the majority of restrictions are to be lted. I am asking the council to alleviate fears by confirming that the Festival of Flight hasnrsquot be shelved. Every effort must be made to ensure this wonderful attraction be ed to Newcastle which has been its home for  years..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/12266445.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Self-interest led politicians promoting Brexit to reject the relationships that made the UK a successful global economy. The DUP got on the Brexit train knowing it could cost the Northern Ireland economy dear. They are now prepared to leave NI open to direct rule by this very Tory government who are failing so abysmally to take on Putin, who are responding to Ukraine’s humanitarian refugee crisis with empty words and red tape they prioritise keeping anti immigration rhetoric in place to appease right wing ERG supporters. So how do I stay proud of my country in the way the Ukrainian people can hold their heads high  We must not become a narrow minded, inward looking country. It is crucial that in May we do not elect in Northern Ireland parties that are only too happy to hand our futures to charlatans or who have tied their future to the success of Boris’s failed vision of an isolated lonely Britain.Dr Carol Greer, Belfast BT——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Prior to being in Lurgan, the organisation’s administrative base was located in Dublin and Belfast.The Royal Black moved out of Brownlow House in  to temporary premises in Loughgall, beside the Museum of Orange Heritage at Sloan’s House.Now, the institution is looking forward to taking up residence in their own purpose-built administrative centre.“The opening of our new headquarters will be a landmark day in the history of the Royal Black Institution,” said Rev Anderson.“This project has been one of the biggest and most important ever undertaken by the Imperial Grand Black Chapter of the British Commonwealth.“The need for our own headquarters was discussed and agreed in , we purchased the Loughgall building in , renovation work began in May , and I’m delighted to say we’re ready to cut the ribbon on Saturday, April .“It has been a long road to get to this point, and there have been many challenges along the way. “We had originally hoped to open the building in , so that the unveiling would form part of our celebrations for the centenary of Northern Ireland. However, the Covid pandemic wreaked havoc with our work schedule.

At one stage it was a public house known as the Rock Tavern. Afterwards, a temperance advocate, Cecilia Cope, turned it into a coffee house. A later inhabitant was Field Marshal Sir Gerald Templer, a senior British Army officer and former chief of the Imperial General Staff, who fought in both world wars.

Mr Beattie challenged Sir Jeffrey to answer a number of questions relating to his decision to agree to their discussion.“Who did he tell he was meeting me  Did his party know  Did his chairman know  Did his Westminster colleagues or first minister know  If nobody knew then why ”Jeffrey DonaldsonEdwin PootsDoug BeattieDUPFirst Minister  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most Popular motorists ‘engaged in anti-social behaviour’ in NI townOil prices NI: Why are home heating oil prices rising across Northern Ireland Where to drop off items in Northern Ireland to help refugees who are fleeing UkraineRuth Dudley Edwards: Little chance for power sharing when Sinn Fein laud IRARussia invasion of Ukraine: Sinn Fein ‘must step back from pro-Putin propaganda’ say DUP and UUPMost PopularBest inflatable hot tubs : blow-up spa hot tubs, from -person, to Laz-y-Spa Hot Tub, Intex and CleverspaBest pancake pans UK : from non-stick to cast iron, these pans will produce perfect pancakes every timeBest portable solar chargers for camping UK : keep your USB devices charged while backpacking and campingAir fryers UK : best ones for sale at Ninja, Currys and Amazon - and are they a healthier way to fry  best backpacking tents UK : lightweight, one-person tents ideal for hiking                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We’ve spoken to Eddie and liaised with England’s physios and SC staff,” Sanderson said.“We’re all on the same page and we need to catch up post-Six Nations to understand how we can potentially manage it better.“But we’re struggling to see how we can at the moment, apart from it being too much too soon. vw,vw,px, px\"Sale boss Alex Sanderson, pictured, says Tuilagi must be managed carefully “You can look and delve into things and go down rabbit holes, but sometimes you can see ghosts which aren’t actually there.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIt comes after a senior MP questioned whether OneWeb’s collaboration with the Russian space agency to launch new broadband satellites is appropriate given Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.The UK took a £ million share in the failed digital firm to rescue it from bankruptcy almost two years ago in a move that allowed it to continue its part in the race to beam internet access across the globe from satellites in low Earth orbit.Its exciting to see  of our satellites arrive in Kazakhstan ahead of our launch with @Arianespace next month 🛰️ https:t.co ohnDPxhM— OneWebFebruary , Friday’s planned launch of  satellites in Kazakhstan will use Russian rockets and be overseen by Russian space experts, according to Labour MP Darren Jones.The chairman of the Commons Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee has questioned whether the collaboration is “inappropriate” given Russia’s attack on its neighbour.Downing Street said it was “right” that questions were being raised about “space co-operation” with Moscow, but that the UK Government was “speaking to our partners” involved with the project before saying anything further.The taxpayer-funded investment in OneWeb in July  bought a “signicant equity stake” in the firm, as part of a consortium with India’s Bharti Global, after a bidding war.In a letter to science minister George Freeman on March , Mr Jones said the communications outfit was set to launch the satellites from the “Russian-owned Baikonur Cosmodrome on Russian Soyuz rockets in partnership with the Russian space agency Roscosmos”.According to reports, the launch is scheduled for .pm UK time on Friday.The British tax payer backed @OneWeb is due to launch satellites from the Russian-owned @C__Baikonur on Russian Soyuz rockets in partnership with the Russian Space Agency @roscosmos in Kazakhstan this week. My letter to Ministers 👇 pic RkDbHHWgru— Darren Jones MPMarch , Mr Jones, MP for Bristol North West, asked Mr Freeman whether he “considers this situation inappropriate given the current situation” and whether the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy “intends to intervene by engaging with the OneWeb board in its capacity as a major shareholder”.He also asked whether the department was “assisting” the firm to find “alternative rocket launch availability”.On Wednesday, Downing Street faced questions about whether the UK Government approved of the launch going ahead.The Prime Minister’s official spokesman told reporters: “It is absolutely right that questions about space co-operation with Russia are being raised following their invasion.“We are still monitoring that situation carefully in regards to OneWeb.“We are speaking to our partners and will set out next steps, but I don’t know any more than that at the moment.”Theres no negotiation on OneWeb: the UK Government is not selling its share.We are in touch with other shareholders to discuss next steps…— Kwasi KwartengMarch , Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng tweeted: “There’s no negotiation on OneWeb: the UK Government is not selling its share.“We are in touch with other shareholders to discuss next steps…”Pressed on how the launch could “credibly” go ahead given the launch involved “borrowing Putin’s rockets”, the No  official said: “I don’t want to pre-empt any further decisions.”The Prime Minister’s former chief aide Dominic Cummings is thought to have been influential in the UK’s decision to invest in OneWeb.With satellite internet services less simple to switch off than terrestrial signals, Mr Cummings suggested this week that situations such as that unfolding in Ukraine were behind the Government’s thinking when making the purchase, as it would allow broadband services to continue in conflict areas.Responding to businessman Elon Musk making his Starlink satellite service available to Ukraine following the Russian advance, Ms Cummings tweeted: “The capability to do this sort of thing was one of the reasons we discussed for doing OneWeb summer  – it could be a powerful new capability for UK.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Government  umonitoring u UK-linked space launch using Russian rockets article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

It’s a departure from what they’ve done the last few years.“The rough is thick off the fairways, but then what they’ve done is they’ve taken out a lot of these run-off areas off the greens where historically you’d miss a green and run off and you’d still have to chip off short grass, for example, and now that’s all been filled in with rough..remove“There’s just so many areas that there were run-offs and sort of tight areas, which I think lends itself to the better chippers of the golf ball, and that’s been sort of taken away this year.“I don’t quite understand why they’ve done that, but it’s definitely a dferent test than one in previous years.” vw,vw,px, px\"Rory McIlroy reacts to his tee shot on the ninth hole during the second round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational McIlroy’s victory at Bay Hill came  months after the death of tournament host Arnold Palmer, who traditionally sat beside the th green to congratulate the winner of the event.But the Northern Irishman was still presented with the red sweater given to the champion and was asked about its whereabouts in his pre-tournament press conference.“It’s in my wardrobe,” added McIlroy, who won the Tour Championship on the same day that Palmer died in September .“I have not broken it out since then.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_acabbabfaaaa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dbadacfdcce   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?164508961700","title":"  people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line ","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland. The campaign promoted the unique nature of le onboard, with % time-off providing the perfect work-le balance for people wanting to live and work onboard for either a one or two-week sht and then spend equal time off. The positions available are part of the Onboard Sales and Servicesteam, with vacancies for service assistants and chefs. With January being the traditional time of the year when many people look for a new career, Stena Line had hoped for a favourable response but even the most optimistic of predictions could not have expected it to be so over-subscribed. Stena Line has now undertaken the initial stage of the selection process and, for the first-time, is hosting two Open Days for prospective candidates on Monday th February, where they will get a chance to meet members of Stena Line’s crews. The Open Days are taking place in Belfast and Birkenhead with the latter being held onboard one of Stena Line’s newest ferries, Stena Edda, giving candidates a chance to get a first-hand taste of le onboard on the Irish Sea. Stephen Bryden, Stena Line’s Head of Onboard Sales and Services, commented on the success of the campaign: “I am astonished by the public’s response to the A Le Less Ordinary recruitment campaign. We have never received so many applications. It really goes to show how many people are attracted to a le at sea with a company like Stena Line. Now our HR team has the challenge of how to sort and interview so many applicants, but that is a nice challenge to have.

In a statement in the chamber, the Minister said the scheme injected at least pound.m into the economy, leading to an improved level of consumer confidence and increased levels of public spending. Today, the Department published a set of management information on the Scheme covering: number of residents issued with a cardnumber and percentage of cards activatedtotal spendnumber of transactions and spend by Local Government District andlocation and spend by postcode.The Minister said: “The High Street Scheme has been a huge success and achieved exactly what it set out to do. It brought shoppers back on to the High Street and has helped and supported our local retail, hospitality and service sectors start their journey of recovery from the devastating impact of the pandemic. “I am really pleased to announce that ,, people were issued with a Spend Local card, of which ,, – or .% – were activated. This is a tremendous achievement. The scheme was designed to provide an economic boost to the local economy and to this end pound.million has been injected into the economy. “This can be clearly seen from the fact that nearly .million customers visited our local shops, restaurants, bars, cafeacutes, cinemas, hairdressers across all parts of Northern Ireland during the letime of the Scheme and over .million new transactions were made using the Spend Local card. “Of course, we know that many of these customers will have spent more than the pound on their Spend Local card. So the figure – in real terms – will be greater.” The Minister told the Assembly that the early analysis showed the benefits of the Scheme were enjoyed in all parts of Northern Ireland. He said: “Over poundmillion was spent in Belfast, over poundmillion in Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon while over poundmillion was spent in each of the following local council areas – Newry, Mourne and Down Derry and Strabane Antrim and Newtownabbey Lisburn and Castlereagh and Ards and North Down. In Mid and East Antrim, the figure was over poundmillion. In Causeway Coast and Glens and in Mid Ulster, more than poundmillion was spent, while the figure for Fermanagh and Omagh was just over pound.million.” MLAs heard how the scale of the task of delivering the High Street Scheme was unprecedented as, in a matter of weeks, his Department implemented a process which manufactured, dispatched and delivered cards to close to .million people – each card unique to each applicant, including bespoke embossed cards for the visually impaired and blind. The Minister told MLAs: “The effort was worth it. I am sure that Members will have heard the same positive messages that I have heard from businesses, but it has also been confirmed by independent analysis.” According to an Ulster Bank Survey, retail sales in Northern Ireland rose in November  for the first time in four months. The banks Chief Economist Richard Ramsey said the High Street Scheme undoubtedly contributed to the pick-up in demand. Research in December  also showed an increase in shoppers on Northern Ireland’s high streets. The figures published by the Northern Ireland Retail Consortiumshowed a boost to the number of people going into shops or businesses in October continuing in November following the introduction of the High Street Scheme. In November, the number of shoppers in Northern Ireland reached their highest point so far compared to the pre-pandemic level. The Minister said: “The people from which I was most pleased to hear were the business owners who needed the scheme to help them cope with the impact of the pandemic. On a personal level, these iniduals – shopkeepers, barbers, newsagents, publicans, cafeacute owners, the list goes on – brought it home to me why this scheme was so important.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_faebdadcecee   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fbdbbbceab   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1622793694906.jpg--all_children_aged_5_to_11_can_now_get_the_covid_19_vaccine.jpg?162279369400","title":"all children aged  to  can now get the covid  vaccine ","story":"The Public Health Agencyis calling on the parents of  to  year olds to get their child vaccinated against COVID-. While most children aged  to  will have mild diseasethey contract COVID-, some may experience symptoms which last longer than just a few days. Vaccination of children in this age group has been shown to help prevent the small number of hospitalisations and intensive care admissions that can occur in this age group. It has also been shown to help provide short-term protection against non-severe disease. Dr Jillian Johnston, Joint Interim Assistant Director in Health Protection at the PHA, said: “We know the COVID risk for young children is less than for older people, but we also know the vaccine is very safe, has already been used extensively around the world, and there is no evidence that it causes any long term issues. When you look at the risk of COVID- against the risk of the vaccine, it’s more beneficial for children to receive the vaccine. It not only boosts the child’s immunity against the risk of severe disease, but helps protect more vulnerable or older family members in advance of any potential future wave of COVID-.” A new specially-designed children’s formulation of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID- vaccine has been approved for this age group and it’s given at a lower dose compared with that used in iniduals aged  and above . Like all children’s vaccines, this approval was given following a robust review of data showing that it is safe and effective to use in this cohort. Clinical trials have shown that this vaccine was highly effective at preventing COVID- in children, protecting them and also reducing the chance that they transmit the virus to others, including family members who may be more susceptible to severe consequences of the infection. Dr Johnston continued by saying: “In Northern Ireland, childhood vaccination programmes have consistently achieved high coverage and we hope that parents will be supportive of this roll out and get their child vaccinated. Vaccination is the most important thing we can do to protect ourselves and our children against ill-health. Evenyour child has already had COVID-, it is still important to get them vaccinated, as being fully-vaccinated can offer them the best protection from the virus and severe disease.” From Wednesday  March  you can make an appointment for your child at a children’s vaccination clinic in your local Health and Social Care Trust using the online booking system at:covid-.hscni.net get-vaccinated. You may be able to attend without an appointment. Dr Johnston concluded: “COVID- has not gone away. Getting vaccinated provides the best protection for both the child and their family. Children will need two doses of the vaccine, usually  weeks apart, to get longer-lasting protection. If your child has tested positive for COVID-, you should normally wait  weeks from the test for your child to have their first or second vaccine.” For further information for parents on the COVID- vaccine for  to  year olds visitpha.site all-s Or to find out where your nearest COVID- vaccine clinic is, visitvaccinations.covid-.hscni.net location-search  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_faebdadcecee   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fbdbbbceab   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
