The White House was later forced to issue a clarification.Another embarrassing foreign policy faux pas occurred in September 2021, when Biden appeared to forget the name of Australia\u0027s prime minister -- who was appearing via video link right beside him. While announcing a historic security deal between the UK, US and Australia, Biden told Britain\u0027s Boris Johnson, \u0027Thank you, Boris,\u0027 before turning to Australia\u0027s Scott Morrison and saying: \u0027And I want to thank that fella down under. Thank you very much pal.\u0027Biden has seemingly even struggled with names of people he speaks to more regularly. He gave a speech marking International Women\u0027s Day in March of last year, during which he was promoting two female officers to four-star generals.  Confusing Libya and Syria    \u0027I\u0027m hopeful that we can find an accommodation where we can save the lives of people in — for example, in — in Libya,\u0027 the president said, mentioning the north African country for the third time instead of Syria, in the Middle East.

He grabs the hand railing to catch his balance, but then loses his footing two additional times.During the third stumble, he falls to his knees. However, after brushing off his leg, he reaches the top of the plane and gives a salute before disappearing inside.White House Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre later told reporters that Biden was \u0027100 percent fine\u0027 and preparing for his trip in Atlanta. \u0027It\u0027s pretty windy outside. It\u0027s very windy. I almost fell coming up the steps myself,\u0027 she said.    Just one day earlier, during a press conference on March 18 (pictured), he referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as \u0027President Harris\u0027    Just one day earlier, Biden accidentally referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as \u0027President Harris.\u0027The gaffe occurred during a press conference on March 18, during which he lauded his administration for being close to meeting their goal of 100 million COVID-19 vaccine doses in his first 100 days in office.\u0027Now when President Harris and I took a virtual tour of a vaccination center in Arizona not long ago, one of the nurses on that, on that tour injecting people, giving vaccinations, said that each shot was like administering a dose of hope,\u0027 Biden said.Harris was standing behind Biden as the president carried on with his speech, but did not correct himself.Later that day, when the White House released the transcript of his speech, Harris\u0027s proper title was inserted with brackets.    On March 9, while making a speech, Biden seemed to forget the name of Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin (above)    In a speech on March 9, Biden seemed to fumble with his words and forget the name of his Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin.\u0027I want to thank Sec - the former general - I keep calling him \u0027General,\u0027\u0027 Biden said.\u0027My - the guy who runs that outfit over there. I want to make sure we thank the Secretary for all he\u0027s done to try to implement what we\u0027ve just talked about, and for recommending these two women for promotion.\u0027  The slip-occurred despite the fact that just a few minutes earlier, he had mentioned Austin\u0027s name in the speech without an issue.   On Election Day, in November, Biden introduced a crowd to his granddaughter, but referred to her as his son    During an Election Day speech in Philadelphia, Biden stumbled over his words and confused his granddaughter with his late son, Beau Biden. Biden told the crowd: \u0027I want to introduce you to two of my granddaughters...this is my son, Beau Biden who a lot of you helped elect to the Senate in Delaware.\u0027The commander-in-chief had meant to introduce the crowed to Natalie, Beau\u0027s daughter, but hadn\u0027t just mixed up the name but the person - he also put his arm around Finnegan Biden, Hunter\u0027s daughter.He finally corrected himself as he draped his arm around Natalie\u0027s shoulder and said: \u0027This is Natalie, this is Beau\u0027s daughter.\u0027  Beau Biden passed away in 2015 after a months-long battle with glioblastoma, one of the deadliest types of brain cancer. TOLD STATE SENATOR IN WHEELCHAIR TO STAND UP   In 2008, Biden told then-Missouri state senator Chuck Graham to stand up for the crowd at a rally, before realizing he was in a wheelchairNot all of Biden\u0027s gaffes occurred in the 2020s or even the 2010s. In fact, some happened in the early aughts.In September 2008, after Biden had been named former President Barack Obama\u0027s running mate, he attended a campaign rally in Missouri.It was there that he called on then-Missouri state senator Chuck Graham, who passed away last year. to stand up for the crowd.\u0027I\u0027m told Chuck Graham, state senator, is here. Stand up Chuck, let \u0027em see you,\u0027 Biden said.It was at that moment he realized Graham was in a wheelchair due to muscular dystrophy.\u0027Oh, God love you. What am I talking about.

Photograph: PA Proposals that would see non-Irish people forced to get an electronic visa waiver before crossing the border are not yet finalised as far as the Government is conerned, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said.Speaking following talks with Northern secretary Brandon Lewis in Dublin on Wednesday, Mr Coveney said the proposals were still in the legislative process in the UK and that Ireland would continue making representations on the issue.“I think it is important to say that this is not legislation that is finalised yet, there was a vote in the House of Commons last night but my understanding is this is likely to go back to the Lords and back to the Commons again,” he said.“What we have looked for here is an exemption for any non-Irish or British nationals who are resident in Ireland to be able to cross without having to get an ETA (Electronic Travel Authorisation), but as I say, that’s an ongoing conversation and as far as we’re concerned, that legislative process hasn’t concluded yet.”MPs at Westminster on Tuesday night voted to reinstate the requirement of a US-style visa waiver for non-Irish EU citizens crossing the Border as part of the proposed regime. The British government challenged an amendment introduced in the House of Lords, which would have exempted Northern Ireland from the legislation. Mr Coveney – who met Mr Lewis under the auspices of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference at Farmleigh House in Dublin – said on Tuesday night following the Commons’ vote that the Irish position had been “ignored”.He said that since the peace process was agreed, the relationship between North and South “has been based on uninterrupted travel opportunities and movement of people and we think that’s worth protecting”. “Northern Ireland, and the island of Ireland in terms of the relationships between North and South, is a very unusual construct and series of relationships and treaties and agreements,” he said, adding that it was “not for the first time we’ll be asking for special treatment to try to protect that relationship”. Mr Lewis said the decision to move ahead with the ETA legislation had nothing to do with reported concerns in the British government about whether Ukrainian refugees could cross into the UK. The plan had been in development for years and was “completely separate” to the Ukraine crisis, he said. The measure could affect as many as 645,000 non-Irish nationals living in the Republic - almost 13 per cent of the population, which will increase again with the arrival of Ukrainians fleeing the invasion by Russia. Sinn Féin reactionSpeaking in the Dáil, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said the proposal would create “a disgraceful situation” which undermined the Belfast Agreement and Common Travel Area. “It creates significant restrictions on freedom of movement across our island,” she said. Ms McDonald said she found it “wholly unacceptable” for a Polish person who lived and worked in Lifford, Co Donegal, would need papers to travel to Strabane, Co Tyrone, and that this was the reality “or so many people living in our Border region”. She urged the Taoiseach to intervene with British prime minister Boris Johnson and “to call this out”. Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath said the Government stood “foursquare behind the Common Travel Area and the open Border in all respects. We do not in any way support or endorse the decision that was taken in the House of Commons. We have serious concerns about the proposal for an electronic travel authorisation system. “We do not believe it is either practical or fair to seek to distinguish between EU citizens from another member state versus Irish citizens for example going over and across the Border.”The SDLP’s Lilian Seenoi-Barr, the only elected councillor in the North from a minority ethnic background, said Westminster’s Nationalities and Borders Bill will lead to more “racial profiling” and stigmatizing of minorities. “It is a racist bill,” she said. “It will strengthen the invisible hard border that already exists for non-Irish and non British citizens.”Ms Seenoi-Barr, a former asylum seeker from Kenya, added: “People like myself, who are black and brown, will be suspect communities. We will be asked to prove that we have the right to be on this island. How else can you tell if someone is Irish or British?” SDLP South Belfast MP Claire Hanna said the proposed legislation would be “hugely disruptive” for non-Irish or UK citizens living on the island, while damaging the North’s tourism industry. “This is a terrible piece of legislation overall, with a horrible approach to refugee and asylum issues,” she said, adding that it went “against the spirit” of the Common Travel Area. Troubles’ amnestyRegarding Westminster’s proposed amnesty for Troubles-era legacy crimes, mooted last year in the face of a backlash from victims groups and others, Mr Lewis said the move had not proceeded because the government wanted to consult with parties and civil society bodies in Northern Ireland. “We want to bring something forward that helps people of Northern Ireland get to the truth and get information,” he said, adding that he would not put a timeframe on that. Mr Coveney said the issue could not be forgotten “because the current status quo in terms of getting the truth and securing prosecutions and so on isn’t as it should be for many families and victims groups”. He said the Irish Government’s position was that the strictures of the Stormont House agreement on legacy cases was the agreed position. However, he added: “We also have accepted that if some want to move in a different direction, we’ll listen to those arguments and see if we can agree in places to move forward. We’re still very open to that engagement and partnership.”On comparisons drawn by British prime minister Boris Johnson between the Brexit vote and the Ukranian resistance to Russia’s invasion, Mr Coveney said Mr Johnson had clarified them and that his spokespeople had recognised “that’s not a good comparison to have in the same sentence”.A joint communique issued by the ministers after the meeting said they had discussed the development of the British-Irish relationship in the coming years, including “potential synergies” between the UK’s levelling up plan and Ireland’s National Development Plan. It noted “with regret” the developments at Stormont since it last met in December and reiterated commitments from both governments to the functioning of the political institutions established by the Belfast Agreement.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"i did not want our kids going into this drogheda landmark kierans deli shuts for good","story":"Kierans’ Deli, on West Street in Drogheda, Co Louth, has shut its doors for the last time. Photograph: Google Street ViewOne of the longest-established family businesses in Drogheda, Co Louth has closed its doors for the last time after 104 years and three generations in the same family.Niall Kierans, joint proprietor of Kierans’ Deli, on West Street, the main shopping thoroughfare, said the decision to close had been made before the Covid-19 pandemic hit.“It was a hard decision to make, it was not easy, and yet having said that, when we see where the economy is likely to go and knowing we are probably going to slip into recession again, I am not too sure any of us want to be facing another two or three years of the hardship that might bring.”“It is better to check out three years too early than three weeks too late,” he added.His children do not want to continue in the business. “It was never their thing. They want to pursue different careers. I see it happening in other businesses too, the kids do not want to go into it, they don’t see the quality of life in it that they want to have.“I would not want them in retail long ago I was quite clear on this, I did not want our kids going into this, I could see what was coming down the tracks. It was only heading in one direction. It is a sad day, but I think we made the right decision.”The landscape of retail has changed in the town, too. He said that prior to the Celtic Tiger’s “imploding”, two retail parks had been built along with two shopping centres, Lidl and Aldi arrived and there are also additional outlets of Tesco and Dunnes.“That alone has increased the retail footprint by 150 per cent but the population has not increased by the same amount.”‘It does not stack up’Customers expect the same high standards they are used to, but he said, they also want it “at a low price, and it does not stack up. You need to get better margins.”This, he added, is in addition to rising overheads and energy costs. “Our next electricity bill will be €5,000. All overheads are going to ratch up. Retail is tough and to survive in retail you have to be big or specialise – if you are neither you will struggle.”In relation to Covid, he said “the Government did all it could to keep small businesses in operation. The supports were excellent. We made this decision before Covid struck.”Mr Kierans believes the decision to close his family business will be replicated elsewhere. “We are facing what I describe as a retail demographic time bomb. Most of us are of a similar age and we are all going to drop dead or retire at the same time – very few of our kids want to follow on, and I think nationally and globally we will see a fair clean-out of family business in retail and hospitality.”Among the customers who made their last purchases today were Paula McDonnell, who has been going there since the 1960s. “I feel very sad. You never went in or went out without meeting somebody with a smile and were always well looked after. I think everybody feels the same. You got the genuine article, the human touch.”Kathleen Branigan (75), has been a customer since she married at 18 and moved to Drogheda. “It was the first deli I ever went into. Everyone in it was always civil to you. The food was always perfect. You go to supermarkets now and it is not the same. Here they always treated you with respect. You got the same treatment if you were spending €2 as if you were spending fortune. I will miss it shocking.”Also going in for the last time were Aisling Stafford and Andrew McMahon. Aisling said: “It has been a fixture in the town, you could not walk across West Street without putting your head in. Everyone who works around here goes in for their lunch. It will be a loss.”Debbie Donnelly has worked there for 33 years and said her parents met while working for the family. When Debbie started working in the kitchen she said when it was busy in the shop, “they would say ‘Come up and put on the white coat to serve’. I started in the white coat 33 years ago so I will finish in it today!”Mr Kierans also reflected on the future of town centres, saying that as a child in the 1970s he could see that people needed to be living above shops.“It is the model on the continent and it works. We have modelled ourselves on the UK and US where it does not work and we have decimated our town centres. We are ripping up green fields on the peripheries of towns to put in new houses and the owners have to have a car to commute into towns and yet it is proven people like to live centrally.“I think if people live downtown they will shop downtown. I think the future of our town centres will most likely be hospitality and leisure, the old model was solely retail and very little leisure.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"british and irish relationship should be based on equal respect says starmer","story":"Labour leader Keir Starmer speaks to the Labour Party Irish Society Annual St Patrick’s Day reception at the London Irish Centre.

You could feel it, you could see it, you could sense it when you were there.

Other speakers included Trade Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Frances O’Grady, Labour MP Conor McGinn, who chairs Westminster All-Party Parliamentary Group on the Irish in Britain and Adrian O’Neill, Ireland’s ambassador to Britain.Mr O’Neill said that this year’s St Patrick’s Day events in London had been conceived as a celebratory return to personal contact after two years of the coronavirus pandemic but they had been overshadowed by the war in Ukraine.“To some extent, we have to kind of dial it down a little bit or at least recognise that while we are enjoying this opportunity to meet in person and celebrate all the things that we really cherish, our democracy, our human rights, our independence, sovereignty, all of those core values that they are absolutely now being trampled on in Ukraine,” he said.“In Ireland, we’re working very, very closely with the UK, with the US with like-minded partners in the Security Council of the UN, within the EU, the Human Rights Council in Geneva, the International Criminal Court, using all the mechanisms at our disposal to isolate and increase pressure on Putin and his regime.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics a disappointing patrick s day for the taoiseach covid s resurgence","story":"Hugh catches up with Pat Leahy, fresh from his trip to Washington for Micheál Martin’s ill-fated St Patrick’s Day visit.

Photograph:  Christopher FurlongGettyThe mayors of Manchester and Liverpool will seek a post-Brexit “resetting” of ties with Ireland as they begin a two-day trip to Dublin on Monday.The visit by Labour mayors Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram comes at a time of poor relations between Ireland and Britain amid the ongoing EU-UK dispute over the Northern Ireland protocol.Speaking to The  ahead of the trip, they sought to draw a distinction between their cities in the northwest of England – which have strong social and economic connections to Ireland – and the UK government led by Conservative prime minister Boris Johnson.Mr Burnham said: “When people in Westminster speak, they don’t always speak for us. I can imagine how in Ireland some people might think that they do, or they might think, ‘What’s happened to the northwest, has it changed?’“Obviously, we’re coming over to say that we haven’t changed. We don’t want to see some of the nonsense in national politics disrupt our relationship with Ireland.”The pair are to meet President Michael D Higgins and, virtually, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar among other engagements, before they spend a third day in Belfast.They will be joined by 15 businesses and former Ireland and Manchester United footballer Denis Irwin, who will act as ambassador during the visit.Central Statistics Office figures show that Ireland’s imports from Britain fell by 13 per cent in 2021 – the first year of new checks on British goods post-Brexit – compared to 2020.‘Most important trading partner’Mr Burnham said that before the pandemic, Ireland was “up there with Germany” as Manchester’s “most important trading partner” in the EU. He said he wants to keep that tradition going, and pointed to new opportunities in the tech sector. Mr Rotheram highlighted the “green industrial revolution” and offshore wind power as an area of potential collaboration.There will also be a meeting with the mayors of Dublin and Belfast to sign a memorandum on co-operation in harnessing green energy from the Irish Sea.Both politicians are directly elected mayors whose visit to Ireland comes ahead of a Citizens’ Assembly that will soon be debating the merits of bringing in a directly elected mayor for Dublin.There are already plans for Limerick to have a directly elected mayor after the people there voted in favour of the idea in 2019.Mr Burnham said having directly elected mayors in Manchester and Liverpool had given both cities a “louder voice” than they previously had in a “very London-centric country”.He has powers in the areas of transport and housing but wants more control over both areas. According to Mr Burnham the UK was late to having directly elected mayors, but that Ireland is “probably an outlier” in not having such roles.Mr Rotheram said he would like more flexibility over how money provided by central government could be spent in the Liverpool region.Having a directly elected mayor, he added, allows a city to “get a bigger bang for our buck” as they can be more “responsive” and “nimble” than what “a national monolith, a great big machine, can do on our behalf”."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"\u0026lsquoEntertainment is such a good way to bring forth change,\u0026rsquo says play\u0026rsquos narratorPhenomenal success of Nigerian artists is bringing both opportunities and criticismAuthors are tackling topics from transgender rights to Islamic extremism, and picking up plenty of awardsTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"liz truss right now differences eu seem lot smaller","story":"She is Foreign Secretary at the time of a war in Europe, Iran on the verge of developing nuclear weapons and the UK charting its own course after 47 years of EU membership. It is, perhaps, therefore not unreasonable that Liz Truss has concluded that now is the busiest time for foreign policy since the 1980s. It also becomes quickly apparent that her experience of one seismic task is influencing her approach to another. While reiterating her determination to “fix” the Northern Ireland Protocol agreed as part of the UK’s exit deal with the EU, Ms Truss stated: “There is a difference between a negotiation between countries who respect the rule of law, respect basic principles like sovereignty and dealing with a rogue state like Russia. “I have frank conversations with all our partners, whether it’s the United States, whether it’s the EU, whether it’s Japan, whether it’s India. There are always going to be differences that we need to resolve. But those types of differences between friends and allies are different from the scale and the sheer belligerence and aggression and lying of Russia.The scale of the issue that we’re facing with Russia is so big, it’s so important, it’s so vital that we all stick together.” Not even the most ardent Brexiteers would take issue with her distinction between the EU and Vladimir Putin’s Russia. However, some may be less sanguine if it emerges that the Foreign Secretary’s comparison is the precursor to a climbdown from securing urgent changes to the protocol.Ms Truss sticks to the government line that Article 16 - the mechanism that the UK could trigger to override parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol - “remains on the table” as an option. But her rhetoric about the importance of harmonious relations with the EU appears a far cry even from Boris Johnson’s remarks just six weeks ago, when he said: “If our friends don’t show the requisite common sense then of course, we will trigger Article 16.” Senior Brexiteer MPs, including at least two members of the Cabinet, have been arguing that the UK must trigger Article 16 in order to break the logjam in talks and fix the problems the agreement is said to be causing to Northern Ireland businesses. Ms Truss still insists “that the Northern Ireland Protocol isn’t working to protect the BelfastGood Friday Agreement” and that the Government’s priority is to protect that deal. But she does not deny having shelved the idea of triggering Article 16 any time soon, because of the need for a united EU front in the face of Russian aggression. Earlier this month, The  revealed that Ms Truss wrote to Mr Johnson about putting Article 16 on hold because of the Ukraine crisis. She asked that the Government instead helped Northern Ireland businesses with an “economic stimulus” package, including tax cuts. Such a move could only take place with the backing of Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor. Amid internal discussions over the issue, Ms Truss will only say of the protocol: “I am working to fix it as a matter of urgency.”Ms Truss, 46, was promoted from her role as international trade secretary last September, replacing Dominic Raab as Foreign Secretary. Within weeks, she said, it was clear that Russia was going to dominate her time in the post. “By December last year, we had a very strong view that he was likely to invade,” she said.The “we” here includes a multitude of Russia experts and intelligence officials who have been working to get the Foreign Secretary up to speed with the Kremlin’s playbook, which some argue has changed very little since the Cold War.Among those who advised Ms Truss as she navigated meetings with Sergei Lavrov, her Russian opposite number, in the run-up to the invasion was Sir Tim Barrow, the Foreign Office’s political director, formerly the UK’s envoy to the EU.Sir Tim joined the Foreign Office in 1986, where he learnt Russian before being posted to Kyiv in 1989 and Moscow the following year. Ms Truss jokingly refers to Sir Tim as a “relic” when she later introduces him at Lancaster House, a 19th century building often used to host foreign dignitaries. Sir Tim, 58, and the Foreign Secretary were both at Lancaster House for an away day for the Foreign Office’s board on Thursday, when Ms Truss sat down for an interview with The   in a lavishly decorated ground floor room overlooking the  garden.“This is one of the many reasons why I think the UK has such an important role to play in this crisis,” Ms Truss said of figures such as Sir Tim.“We do have Russia experts, we do have Ukraine experts and we have people who were around at the end of the Cold War, who were doing things like supporting the Baltic governments in exile. And we’ve seen the playbook again, in Syria, in other conflicts Russia has been involved in, but we also saw it during the Cold War. And some of those techniques that were there then are there now.”As a more junior Cabinet minister under Theresa May, Ms Truss’ kitchen table in her South West Norfolk constituency was the subject of regular Instagram posts documenting family breakfasts and “pizza Thursdays”. She is seen as the Cabinet’s most enthusiastic adopter of social media.Today, her posts are dominated by pictures of the now Foreign Secretary standing behind lecterns and holding talks with world leaders and fellow foreign ministers. Her kitchen table, too, has become a hub of discussions about the finer details of foreign policy.“My elder daughter is actually studying the Cold War, so there are quite a lot of family discussions about what happened then and the parallels to what’s happening now,” said Ms Truss. She has two daughters with her husband Hugh O’Leary, the eldest of whom, Frances, is 16.The Ukraine crisis “is taking up my night and day”, she said, pointing out that it is difficult to switch off after conversations in which her Ukrainian counterpart telephones from Kyiv to press her for more sanctions and weapons.Ms Truss has played a leading role in the campaign for crippling sanctions against Moscow. She is now continuing to push Western countries to end all oil and gas imports from Russia. Along with Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, she has also been working to counter disinformation before it can take hold, setting up the Government Information Cell to dispel Kremlin falsehoods relating to the invasion of Ukraine.She said: “We’ve been exposing the plans to create a false flag around chemical weapons and I think this has been crucial in removing the aspect of surprise from what Putin is doing, and also convincing the international community that Putin is the aggressor.“He’s been unable to create a pretext for his invasion.”Ms Truss also revealed that she has set up a specialist negotiations unit to provide support to Ukraine “when the Russians are serious about negotiations”.She added: “I don’t believe they are serious at present and that’s why I’ve said we need to be tough to get peace. We need to double down on sanctions. We need to double down on the weapons that we’re sending Ukraine. But when there does come a time for negotiations, I want the UK to be a key part of making sure we support Ukraine to get a deal that works.”Ms Truss is convinced that a continuation - and in some cases escalation - of the current tactics being deployed by Ukraine and the West could bring Putin to the negotiating table.“Putin needs to be put under even more pressure”, she said - both “domestically through the economy and Russia being debilitated”, as well as by countries such as the UK continuing to supply lethal weapons to Ukraine.“With the supply of more weaponry to the Ukrainians, I think we could see his attempts to invade stall, she said. Over time, this will bear down on Putin’s ability to succeed and will ensure that he loses in Ukraine.“And at that point, we need to make sure that there isn’t a repeat of the Minsk process - that we actually end up in a situation where there is a genuine ceasefire, there’s a genuine withdrawal of troops from Ukraine, and there are real levers on Russia in the future to stop any future aggression.”The Minsk agreements were designed to secure a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia-backed separatists in the east of the country in 2014 and 2015, in a process brokered by Germany and France, then represented by Francois Hollande and Angela Merkel.“We should have been part of those negotiations,” said Ms Truss, who was environment secretary at the time of the talks, when David Cameron’s coalition was in power.“We should have done more to stop Putin in 2014. And we are essentially facing the situation we are in now because - and this is not just Britain - the entire West, the entire free world, didn’t do enough to stop Putin.”Lessons have been learned, she said, adding: “What we know is that Russia signed up to multiple agreements they simply don’t comply with. So there needs to be hard levers. Of course, sanctions are a hard lever.“Those sanctions should only come off with a full ceasefire and withdrawal, but also commitments that there will be no further aggression. And also, there’s the opportunity to have snapback sanctions if there is further aggression in future. That is a real lever that I think can be used. That wasn’t used in 2014.”Her remarks about the conditions for lifting the current sanctions appear to sketch out Britain’s blueprint for the “off ramp” that could be offered to Putin to end his invasion. They chime with remarks by Antony Blinken, her US counterpart, who has said that American sanctions against Russia are “not designed to be permanent” and could “go away” if Moscow changes its behaviour.Mr Blinken has said that, for US sanctions to be lifted, there must be a Russian withdrawal that is “in effect, irreversible” - so “Russia won\u0027t pick up and do exactly what it’s doing in a year or two years or three years”. When asked about Joe Biden’s remarks that Nato “would respond” if Putin uses chemical weapons in Ukraine, Ms Truss echoed he White House\u0027s message.“That would represent an escalation of this appalling conflict, she said. We’ve already seen abhorrent acts committed against civilians in Ukraine, but the use of chemical weapons would represent an escalation and there would be a response.”In the final months of Theresa May’s premiership, Ms Truss was seen as constantly “on manoeuvres” and attempting to flaunt her own potential leadership credentials. But as the Prime Minsiter’s position weakened in late 2021 and the first weeks of 2022 amid several scandals, she has shown dogged loyalty towards the Prime Minister. Ms Truss is careful not to criticise Mr Sunak\u0027s Spring Statement. But she does pinpoint “supply-side reforms”, such as tax cuts and deregulation, including an overhaul of childcare, as key to reducing the cost of living.“The Chancellor has committed that taxes are going to be cut, she said. That’s very, very important because ultimately, the way to get the cost of living down in the long-term is supply side reform, and it’s doing what we need to do to generate economic growth. And whether it’s on making childcare more affordable, which I’ve long been a champion of, whether it’s making housing more affordable, that is ultimately what will bring down the cost of living.”She defended Mr Johnson against claims that he likened the Ukrainian resistance against Putin to the UK’s decision to leave the EU. “I was sitting in the audience for that speech and I certainly don’t think that’s what he was doing. He was talking about the British people’s right to exercise their democratic freedom, as part of a general speech about freedom in which he also talked about people’s freedom once they had got the coronavirus vaccine.”Here, she segued into another reminder of the closeness with which Britain is working with the EU on the Western response to Putin’s invasion.“One of the points I would make about this crisis is we have worked very, very closely with the European Union, she said.“The EU are doing a lot of work to reduce their dependence on Russian gas, including sourcing liquid natural gas from the States and I support and applaud those efforts.“Of course, there are some areas with which we have differences with the EU. But fundamentally, we are all democratic nations, we all believe in freedom and the right of people to select their own governments and we are very much united in the fight.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest: The Russian people will decide Putin\u0026#39s \u0026#39fate\u0026#39, says Zahawi, as US insists it is not pushing for regime changeUkraine morning briefing: Five developments as MoD says northern battlefield remains largely staticUkraine ready to unleash new baguette-sized bombs with six-mile range on Russian troopsTfL\u0026#39s sexual harassment campaign is as bizarre as it is controllingMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dubai became last safe haven rich russians","story":"In the bathroom of Dubai’s Caviar Kaspia restaurant, a statuesque Russian blonde reapplies her make-up from her Gucci handbag and checks her diamonds in the mirror. Anastasia, as she introduces herself, is new in town, having moved to Dubai with her husband she describes simply as a “businessman”.Moscow is home, she says, but they have arrived in the desert emirate to see out the Ukraine war. The couple are staying in one of Dubai’s most exclusive addresses, the Bulgari residences, a man-made horseshoe-shaped island where annual rentals average around £300,000 a year.“There are so many Russians here that it feels like home,” she says, laughing, as she sweeps her perfect blonde locks away from her face.The United Arab Emirates (UAE) – of which Dubai is one of seven principalities – has been one of the few countries to adopt a neutral stance on Russian aggression and host couples like Anastasia and her husband. Even Roman Abramovich has been spotted looking at houses on Dubai’s Palm Jumeirah, a man-made island where five-bed apartments cost up to £8 million.Last month, the UAE abstained on a UN Security Council vote deploring the Kremlin’s invasion, and while it supported a later non-binding United Nations General Assembly vote calling on Russia to withdraw its forces, the country steadfastly refuses to pick a side. Predictably, Russians have since flocked to the desert kingdom.Back in the Caviar Kaspia, home of the “largest vodka selection in Dubai”, the clink of shot glasses rings out with the words “nazdorov’ye”: the Russian toast to good health.Upstairs, behind a sliding door, bottles of Champagne and vodka adorn the tables of a speakeasy style bar. Here, 125g of Almas caviar costs more than £5,000, while vodka starts at £300 a bottle. As western sanctions bite in Russia and queues for staples like sugar and buckwheat evoke memories of the USSR, here in Dubai, explains Anastasia, “life is good”.With even traditionally secretive banking boltholes like Switzerland – which in the Second World War was happy to remain neutral and receive looted Nazi gold – the Cayman Islands and Monaco co-operating with the seizure of Russian-owned assets, suddenly Dubai has become a safe port in the economic storm. Quite literally in the case of the oligarch superyachts that have been spotted coming into berth in recent weeks.The latest to enter the Gulf State’s waters is the 225ft Hermitage, owned by Russian metals magnate Anatoly Sedykh and worth an estimated £55m. Then there’s the £121m Madame Gu, belonging to “Putin’s favourite industrialist” billionaire Oleg Deripaska, who has recently been added to the list of UK-sanctioned oligarchs.Experts at VesselsValue, which analyses the maritime and aviation sectors, say other superyachts are en route to Dubai, including another belonging to Deripaska (a £44m vessel named Clio), and Sergei Galitsky’s £162m Quantum Blue, which comes equipped with a spa, gym, cinema and elevators.It is not just wealthy Russians fleeing to Dubai, but Ukrainians, too. This week a luxury yacht belonging to Ukrainian mining billionaire Kostyantin Zhevago, recently named in anti-oligarch laws introduced by the country’s president Volodymyr Zelensky, docked at the Bulgari yacht club. The yacht’s name, ‘Z’, has proven particularly unfortunate given that it has become the Kremlin’s symbol of war.While many western destinations have banned Russian air traffic, Dubai is still welcoming passengers. FlyDubai visits eight Russian locations, while Emirates ferries passengers from St Petersburg and Moscow to Dubai several times each day. A stream of private jets continues to alight on the desert runways. Last week it was reported that following Putin’s speech pledging a “self-cleansing” of Russian society, four hurriedly took off from Moscow en route to Dubai.The culture shock of leaving the Russian winter for the broiling heat is more than offset by the lifestyle awaiting new arrivals. Caviar Kaspia is one of a dozen high-end restaurants and nightclubs operated in Dubai by Russian company the Bulldozer Group. The city’s exclusive restaurants are booming with the new influx of trade and waiting lists are common.Another favoured haunt for the Russian elite is Nammos at the Four Seasons Hotel, and the Jumeirah Zabeel Saray beach resort where Sonia Plotnikova, daughter of Vladimir Plotnikov, an MP of Putin’s party, recently posted a photograph online. Russian models and influencers such as Lara Lepp and Alina Charova regularly share social media updates from glamorous Dubai locations. There are even fur coat boutiques in a city where temperatures reach 50C.Over the past decade or so, Russian money has increasingly washed up in Dubai. Even prior to the latest influx, there were around 100,000 Russian-speakers in the UAE. According to recent data compiled by the US-based Centre for Advanced Defence Studies, nearly 40 Russian citizens who are “politically exposed, sanctioned, or allegedly associated with illicit activity” own a total of 80 properties worth an estimated £240m across the UAE.One estate agent, who has worked in Dubai for the past 15 years, estimates demand from wealthy Russians has spiked by 250 per cent since the war. He says clients will pay in cash and happily fork out for rents of £10,000 a week.Aside from the Bulgari residences, where three-bedroom villas sell for £40m, Bluewaters is another man-made island which has become a favourite for the Russian elite. One recently-settled oligarch there is paying £165,000 rent per year on a sea-view family home, soon to be increased to £205,000 as agents capitalise on the surge in interest.Alan Kaye, a British estate agent based in Dubai, says enquiries from Russians are on the rise, with many choosing to “rent high-end property for a few months while they see what’s happening”.Indeed, this month the UAE was added to a ‘grey list’ of jurisdictions subject to extra monitoring by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The global finance crime watchdog insists the UAE had made a “high-level political commitment” to work with it on anti-money laundering and counter-finance terrorism measures, and some experts believe the scrutiny will deter the flow of Russian money. “There is an increasing focus by the US government on banks in Dubai and UAE”, says John Sandweg, former chief legal officer of the US Homeland Security Department. “The US will be very aggressive against any Dubai or UAE bank that acts as a safe haven for dirty Russian money or illicit funds linked to the Russian state.”  Nonetheless, The  understands a number of banks in Dubai and UAE have been marketing their services to wealthy Russians. In 2019 the UAE also introduced a ‘golden visa’ programme, granting long-term residency to wealthy investors.“The oligarchs like Dubai because the banks here are relaxed about accepting Russian money and don’t ask too many questions,” said one Dubai-based businessman on condition of anonymity. “It is very easy for the Russians to set up shop in Dubai.”  Other Russians are seeking to invest in cryptocurrencies in order to keep it away from the authorities. Dubai has rapidly established itself as a leading crypto hub and in recent weeks traders have reportedly been “deluged” with requests to liquidate billions of dollars in Bitcoin and other digital currencies.For those used to living in the shadow of Putin’s Russia, the controversies surrounding Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum may also be easier to stomach. Sheikh Mohammed has faced heavy criticism over last week’s mass sackings by Dubai-owned P\u0026ampO Ferries, while last October it was reported he would no longer be invited to the Royal box at Ascot after a judge ruled he hacked the phones of his ex-wife and a Tory peer acting as her lawyer. Last week following a lengthy legal battle, the High Court in London ruled the Sheikh had abused his former wife to an “exorbitant degree”. One of the Sheikh’s daughters, Princess Latifa, who has fled the country, has also previously accused her father of trying to hold her hostage.Should western countries seek to come for their assets, the new wave of Russian exiles may find an ally in Dubai’s legal system. In 2020, a senior judge in Dubai rejected an attempt from the ex-wife of Russian billionaire and Putin ally, Farkhad Akhmendov, to seize his £300m superyacht, ruling the £450m orce agreement which had previously been agreed in the British courts was in fact contrary to Sharia law. The couple eventually settled.As the new Russian exiles sip Champagne, no doubt they will be braced for similar turmoil. But for now the good times are rolling, and Dubai remains Moscow’s playground in the desert.Additional reporting by Melanie Swan, in Dubai, and Mark HollingsworthMore from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest: The Russian people will decide Putin\u0026#39s \u0026#39fate\u0026#39, says Zahawi, as US insists it is not pushing for regime changeUkraine morning briefing: Five developments as MoD says northern battlefield remains largely staticUkraine ready to unleash new baguette-sized bombs with six-mile range on Russian troopsTfL\u0026#39s sexual harassment campaign is as bizarre as it is controllingMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"progressive america slowly dying","story":"America is on the move. A rapid demographic change is underway, reshaping the nation’s economic, political and cultural contours. For as long as anyone can remember, America’s big business clusters were in the northeast, the midwest and California. New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles were the kinds of places where enterprising young Americans would go to make their way in the world.Not anymore. In just twelve months between July 2020 and July 2021, these four cities lost over 700,000 people. A very different phenomenon is playing out in conservative states, especially in the south. Almost 80 per cent of the population growth in 2021 happened in a mere ten counties. Five of the fastest growing counties were in Texas and two in Florida. The fastest of all was Maricopa county in Arizona, which is rapidly filling up with large numbers of Californian emigres.What do the growth states have in common? They favour freedom. From snow-capped Utah to swampy Florida, geography and climate are not the decisive factor state politics is. As free states thrive, radical progressives drive businesses away from their traditional hubs. Last year, Elon Musk moved Tesla\u0027s corporate HQ from California to Texas. Thousands of lower-profile businesses have made the same move. Whereas California has managed to combine European level taxation with third world level public service, free states like Texas, Tennessee and Florida do not have a state income tax at all. While in New York and Silicon Valley, permits are needed to do almost anything, states like Arizona and Utah have imposed radical red tape reduction plans.Contemporary America remains bitterly ided between these two tribes. Conservative America drives pick-up trucks, prefers its taxes low and its government small. Here the Oath of Allegiance is pledged daily, and American exceptionalism accepted as self-evident. Progressive America, on the other hand, drives a Prius rather than a pick-up and is far more likely to worry about climate change. This tribe has a fundamentally different conception of what America is, was and ought to be, and prefers to focus on intersectional identity above any kind of exceptionalism.Opinion formers in Britain, citing Biden’s win over Trump, often assume that America is moving inexorably towards a more progressive future. Yet a rather different picture is emerging.States aren’t just depopulating due to an exodus of enterprising people. Progressive America is literally dying deaths in Democrat cities and states have started to exceed births. Though birth rates have fallen across the board in the past decade, it has been most pronounced in places where folk have gone woke, perhaps losing interest in raising a family in the process. Women in conservative America on average marry significantly younger than they do in progressive states.As Chicagoans and Californians flood into Texas, Arizona and Tennessee in search of a better life, many conservatives fear that they will bring their progressive voting habits with them. A more optimistic scenario is that as the most entrepreneurial abandon progressive controlled areas in favour of free ones, they will merely reinforce the intensely inidualistic mindset that already exists there.What is certain is that two models of American identity are engaged in a fierce battle at a federal level. Because the US system allows interstate competition, here in Mississippi we are leading a campaign to abolish the state income tax. We  have written a new law on universal occupational licensing to make it easier for outsiders to come and work here.What if this kind of localism were normal in Britain? What sort of innovation could be unleashed? You would not have to kill time hoping for Boris Johnson to fix things any more than we are waiting on Joe Biden.Douglas Carswell is the President \u0026amp CEO of the Mississippi Center for Public Policy.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest: The Russian people will decide Putin\u0026#39s \u0026#39fate\u0026#39, says Zahawi, as US insists it is not pushing for regime changeUkraine morning briefing: Five developments as MoD says northern battlefield remains largely staticUkraine ready to unleash new baguette-sized bombs with six-mile range on Russian troopsTfL\u0026#39s sexual harassment campaign is as bizarre as it is controllingThe West cannot afford to be complacent about the Iranian threatMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sas commander accepted argentinas surrender falklands","story":"It was a foul evening, dark and bitterly cold, when Lieutenant Colonel Michael Rose first heard rumour a helicopter had gone down in the South Atlantic off the Falkland Islands.The then 42-year-old was aboard HMS Fearless, the command ship directing the British war in the Falklands, with Rose the commanding officer for all SAS operations. Despite the lack of information, Rose instinctively knew his men were on board. “I knew in my heart of hearts it was ours,” he recalls.About an hour later, Rose was stopped in a passageway on the ship by Julian Thompson, the commanding officer of 3 Commando Brigade, who broke the news that the Sea King helicopter that had gone down while transporting troops and equipment between two Navy ships was carrying members of two separate SAS squadrons.Ultimately, more than 20 troops were killed in the crash on May 19, 1982 – the worst single loss of life in the history of the elite regiment since its formation during the Second World War. The men either died on impact or drowned in the freezing ocean. Just nine survived.“He later said it was the only time he had seen me fall silent,” Rose recalls. “One’s heart just stops.”Back in Britain, an operation clicked into gear to send a military representative to tell all the families of the killed troops at precisely the same time, to prevent word leaking out first. The final widow was tracked down to a supermarket in Newcastle, where the awful news was delivered.The following evening, Rose gathered the survivors from both SAS squadrons below deck on HMS Intrepid to make the hardest speech of his life. Even more so given the rattle of anti-aircraft fire and explosions as the Argentinians launched aerial attacks on the British fleet.Six weeks after the invasion had started, the Falklands War was at a critical juncture, and Rose told his troops now was not the time to grieve.“The SAS was already deployed,” he says, “and we had been there since three weeks before the main landings and were scattered all over the place. You can’t stop at that point. The war just went on.”Rose has never previously given a newspaper interview about his role during the Falklands, and as Britain prepares to mark the 40th anniversary of the conflict, he insists he is only doing so because he is not bound by the normal code of silence the SAS usually applies to its operations. He says after the loss of the Sea King helicopter in 1982, the Ministry of Defence took the decision to break with established protocols and “tell the world what the SAS had been achieving to justify that terrible loss”.He is giving the interview ahead of a new documentary into the Falklands campaign which airs on Channel 4 tonight and features Rose alongside other senior commanders. In reflecting on the campaign in the documentary he is especially critical over the decision-making which led to the Argentine bombing of the Navy ships Sir Tristram and Sir Galahad (the deadliest day of the war). Rose describes the subsequent board of inquiry into the tragedy as a complete whitewash and claims the defence that the ships were deployed because of the need to open up a southern flank are untrue. He is also critical of some of the decision-making at Northwood headquarters which directed operations from the UK. We very nearly lost the war because of some extraordinary bad decisions that were taken by Northwood with regards to the land battle, he says.At 82 years old, Sir Michael Rose, who retired from the military in 1997 as a General, still looks every inch the Special Forces soldier. He sits ramrod straight, despite having recently broken a rib falling off a ladder, and regularly thumps the table in front of him for emphasis. We meet in a pub close to his home in Ledbury, Herefordshire – SAS country, where the regiment trains and where he still bumps into old comrades on country yomps who greet him with “Hello, boss”. “They are a very active bunch,” he reports of his fellow SAS retirees.His command of the elite unit gave him a ringside seat to the key geopolitical moments of the 1980s and 1990s. Rose was in a command room two doors down from the Iranian Embassy in London in 1980 when the SAS stormed the building, in front of the world’s media, to kill the gunmen who had taken 26 people hostage.His position also afforded him unique access to then prime minister Margaret Thatcher. Rose recalls her visiting Northern Ireland in August 1979, just a few months after she became PM, following the Warrenpoint ambush (the deadliest attack on British troops during the Troubles).A month or so after the success of the Iranian Embassy siege, Thatcher flew by helicopter to visit SAS barracks in Herefordshire, and he engineered an hour-long private meeting. Afterwards, his wife, Angela, and two young children were invited by the prime minister for tea at 10 Downing Street.The history of the SAS in the Falklands is not without controversy. Infamously, the regiment was involved in the botched Operation Mikado, a failed attempt to attack an Argentinian air base. Rose agrees it was “an utter disaster”, but insists he played no part in the operation as it was run separately from his chain of command.Similarly, an early assault on South Georgia involving the SAS failed due to appalling weather conditions, which resulted in the loss of two helicopters.But, as Rose is quick to point out, SAS troops were also involved in pivotal moments of the conflict. Most famous is the combined assault on Pebble Island, a daring raid that destroyed around a dozen Argentine aircraft.For Rose, the most important role the SAS provided was the “critical intelligence on which land battle was based”. One of his commandos, he says, spent 28 days hiding out on Mount Kent in wind, rain and snow, with just one resupply, to wire back constant updates of the enemy position.Key to their success were state-of-the-art portable satellite communication systems that Rose had personally borrowed from a contact in the US Special Forces. At the time, the only British Army satellite communication system was so large, it required a Land Rover to carry it.Aside from commanding and equipping his men, Rose also personally played a unique role in the conflict – by being the man to negotiate the Argentine surrender.He established a line of communications with the enemy through a captured Argentine air commodore, and secured an agreement to meet the military governor of the island, Mario Menendez, in Port Stanley.After a tense four hours of late-night negotiations with the governor, who Rose recalls as immaculately dressed in white gloves and an utterly “useless inidual”, the surrender was agreed. The following morning, he hoisted a Union flag borrowed from one of his SAS Squadrons as the first to fly over Port Stanley.“Punching the air is for football matches,” he says of the victory. “At the end of a war like that, you just feel very tired and relieved.”Certainly, the Falklands was not to be his last conflict. Later, he commanded UN forces during the war in Bosnia. And, in a bleak retelling of history, he notes the same tactics employed by the former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic during the siege of Sarajevo as are now being used by Vladimir Putin in Ukraine. “They are shelling cities almost as a fall-back position, but it is not going to win them the war,” he says.Putin, he believes, is “completely deranged”, but warns against Nato provocation by installing a no-fly zone or troops in Ukraine: “He needs to be very carefully handled.”In preparation of the 40th anniversary of the Falklands, Rose started unpacking some of the old boxes in his home. Among the various mementos was a box of tape recordings of the peace negotiations which had been taken from his satellite phone. He dug out an old tape recorder and listened to them all. “At one point, I can hear myself saying: ‘He’s agreed to surrender everything. The war is over,’” he says. “When I heard that again, the hairs came up on the back of my neck.”Even 40 years on, Rose is still coming to terms with its legacy. On Remembrance Sunday, he often visits the SAS memorial at the regiment’s headquarters in Hereford to honour those who died under his command. “It was something that could never have been avoided, but you just think of all the good guys you lost,” he says. “As simple as that.”Falklands War: The Untold Story is on Channel 4 tonight, 10pmMore from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest: The Russian people will decide Putin\u0026#39s \u0026#39fate\u0026#39, says Zahawi, as US insists it is not pushing for regime changeUkraine morning briefing: Five developments as MoD says northern battlefield remains largely staticUkraine ready to unleash new baguette-sized bombs with six-mile range on Russian troopsTfL\u0026#39s sexual harassment campaign is as bizarre as it is controllingMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sunday morning uk news briefing todays top headlines telegraph","story":"Welcome to your early morning news briefing from The  - a round-up of the top stories we are covering today.

But what sets this one apart is the sheer scale of the crisis hitting Brits. whose disposable incomes will see the sharpest fall since records began in . The millionaire Chancellor promised to help families with skyrocketing prices through a p fuel duty cut now, and a big rise in National Insurance thresholds in July.It’s £bn of tax cuts - but analysis shows it’s a drop in the ocean, as inflation soars close to % and the tax burden still rises overall between now and . The Resolution Foundation also slammed the Chancellor for giving £ out of every £ to the wealthier half, as there’s no new increase to benefits or cash help for energy bills. With UK inflation soaring to .% - its fastest rise in  years - millions of households will be worrying about their own finances. The  cost of living crisis is hitting energy prices, fuel and the cost of food, with the governmentaposs only solution so far to offer all households a £ loan to help pay off their energy bills - which must be paid back eventually. Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs Spring Statement saw him announce a cut in fuel duty, although this will cost the Treasury billions without putting cash back in familiesapos pockets. So how will the Spring Statement affect you The  huge big cost of living blows hitting you from next Friday What the fuel duty cut actually means - and whether weaposll see the dference in our pockets The Spring Statement  summaryaposs key announcements Everything you need to know about the National Insurance cut The UKaposs current inflation rate amid the Spring Statement - as Brits are left with crippling costsKeep up with live announcements from the Statement in the Mirroraposs live blogIf you need help with the cost of living crisis, weaposve put together a list of charities and schemes offering advice and grants to keep you and your family warm and fed this year. Boris Johnson said “it will continue to be tough, it will continue to be chippy, but we will get through it and we will look after people throughout”.But what do the charts from his own Treasury, watchdogs, and independent think tanks say  We’ve taken a look at  that highlight the enormity of the problems facing the economy... Inflation is rocketing to a -year high  Inflation is due to rocket to .% on average in   and could peak at nearly %. The Office for Budget Responsibility said the rise “will erode real incomes and consumption”, slashing GDP growth from a % forecast to .% this year. This graph highlights just how steeply inflation has climbedbeyond what experts thought it would hit five months ago , due to the Ukraine-Russia war. This will be the highest inflation in the history of the OBR, which was set up in .  This graph from the Office for Budget Responsibility shows the same inflation data but going back to . It shows inflation will peak above the .% it hit in  andto levels not seen since the early s. Disposable incomes will suffer the biggest drop since the s - at least  Brits’ household disposable incomes per person will fall .% in real terms in -, due to inflation outstripping wages. That is the biggest fall in a single year since records began in . And this is even after factoring in £ support for energy bills, the temporary cut in fuel duty and rise in National Insurance thresholds. The Office for Budget Responsibility said this help announced since October has offset around a third of the fall in living standards.  This Office for Budget Responsibility graph is an even starker way of portraying the same data. It shows disposable incomes only fell in real terms in nine years since the s - four of them since the Tories took power in . And the fall projected for - is by far the deepest, outstripping those in the s or the wake of the  financial crash. Wages are now £k lower than without the  crash  This shocking chart on wages from the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows the same problem in the starkest way yet. The experts warned wages are now £, lower than what they could have beenthe trend of - had continued. The financial crash of  still cases a long shadow over politics today. The national debt wasnapost cut by the Tories This chart from the Treasury explodes the myth that the Tories brought down ‘ Labour ’s debt’ from the financial crash with austerity.Net debt shot up due to the bank bailouts and other measures of , but has continued rising since and spiked again due to Covid. It is still predicted to be .% of the UK’s entire GDP in . And the cost of servicing that debt rockets as inflation rises. Since the last forecast, the cost of servicing the national debt has risen by more than £billion in - alone.  This chart shows the same data but with a longer timescale, showing how debt was more than double Britain’s GDP after the Second World War - but fell steadily as the decades rolled on. That falling of debt continued through the s and stayed low until the financial crash. It jumped, then climbed further under the Tories. Rishi Sunakaposs new apostax cutsapos do exist - but overall itaposs still a tax hike  Rishi Sunak boasted he’d become the tax-cutting Chancellor with cuts to National Insurance, fuel duty and a p income tax cut from April .But the IFS think tank has warned the tax burden will in fact be rising, not falling, overall because frozen thresholds will drag .million more people into paying income tax. In this chart, the Office for Budget Responsibility finds the Chancellor’s tax cuts barely make a dent in all the tax rises that have been announced in . The OBR found previously announced tax rises will add .% of GDP to the tax burden - already the highest in decades - by  . The freeze on fuel duty, change to National Insurance and p income tax cut in  will lower that tax burden by just .%.  This is a dferent way of looking at the same information on tax. In this chart, the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows how ‘Illusionist’ Rishi Sunak is in fact raising taxes on Brits - not cutting them. A median earner on £, will be £ worse off in   than   - a £k earner will be nearly £ worse off. Boris Johnson claimed the Chancellor had “cut taxes for working people by, I think, the biggest single amount for the last  years.” The IFS said this is technically true. But IFS Director Paul Johnson said: “He can now expect to raise more in tax as a share of national income by  than he expected last October. In fact, taxes are set to rise to their highest level as a fraction of national income since Clement Attlee was prime minister.”  This graph shows just how fast the tax burden has shot up to a record high since Covid. The OBR warns the tax burden overall will reach .% of GDP in - - the highest level since the late s. That’s up from % of GDP in -. It’s fuelled by rising National Insurance but also in frozen thresholds in income tax until .

Mr Johnson himself has insisted it is “simply incorrect” that he personally or directly asked for the advice to be reversed.But Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner has written to Tory MP William Wragg, chair of the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs committee, calling on him to use the body to investigate the circumstances surrounding the peerage.And she urged him to invite Mr Johnson himself to give evidence before the committee.  She wrote: “Given that Mr Lebedev is still a sitting member of the House of Lords, and the wider issues continue to be of concern in relation to any future appointments, it is in the British public’s interest to ensure that these allegations can be thoroughly investigated.” Dominic Cummings, Mr Johnson’s former top aide last week used a blog post to claim he had been in the room when Cabinet Office officials informed Mr Johnson about the concerns. I supported these concerns and said to the PM in his study explicitly that he should not go ahead, he wrote. He was very cross and as he does when cross he blustered nonsense. ‘This is just … You’re just … [pause] ANTI-RUSSIAN!’ Mr Cummings claimed two others who were in the room would back his version of events in court.

A survey for pollster Opinium found Mr Sunakaposs net approval rating had dropped four points to % and nearly seven in tenthink the Government should be doing more to tackle rising cost of living. The Government is facing a fierce backlash to Mr Sunakaposs Spring Statement, which did little to help families facing rising energy bills and sky-high inflation. Meanwhile, Labouraposs poll lead over the Conservatives rose to %, with Boris Johnsonaposs party on %. A flurry of reports on Sunday suggested the Chancellor was preparing another multi-billion pound bailout in the autumn, when energy bills are expected to rise again. Brits in some council tax bands are eligible for some money off their bill and a separate £ loan, with the cash to be clawed back the following year, was also announced by the Chancellor.Speaking on Sky News, Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said it would be irresponsible to say “job done” for Mr Sunak over the cost-of-living crisis.He told Sky’s Sophy Ridge On Sunday show: “I think he will continue to keep an eye on this, it’s only right. “It’s irresponsible for me to say ‘job done’ because energy prices are volatile, inflation remains high, so it would be absolutely irresponsible to say job done. “But I think £ billion, in one year, of help when you’ve just spent £ billion is the right thing to do.” The poll also found nearly three fthsthink the state of the UK economy will get worse in the next year. Almost halfexpect their personal finances to worsen, with just % thinking they will get better. James Crouch, Head of Policy  Public Affairs at Opinium said: The government’s decision to keep their powder dry for the Budget has been far from popular in the short term.Precious few think the measures announced in the Spring Statement will help the economy, or benefit them directly, while seven in ten think the government has failed to do enough to tackle the cost of living crisis.Once incredibly popular, Rishi Sunakaposs approval ratings are now in negative territory, demonstrating the impact of the economic situation on the government’s fortunes. Although it has yet to feed into an increased Labour lead, the Conservatives should be very worried by the poor response voters gave to the Spring Statement.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonLabour PartyNational Insurance Company Ltd.Conservative PartyEuropean UnionSpring StatementBritish economyThe economyPoliticsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But he said he had “always tried to be honest with people”, and said: “I can’t protect them from absolutely everything that we face.” Mr Sunak said he was “anxious” on behalf of the country and said he knew rising financial pressures were “the number one concern that people have right now”. Speaking on Beth Rigby Interviews on Sky News, he said: “Families are struggling with the rising cost of lots of things and that’s why in the spring statement I wanted to make sure that we demonstrated we were on people’s side, and we announced the tax plan that will deliver the biggest net cut taxes, net cut to personal taxes in two years, in quarter of a century taken together.” He said: “Where we can make a dference, we will, and I’m confident that the plan yesterday will do that.”  The Chancellor added: “I think what we’ve done is substantial. If you take together £ billion to help people with energy bills announced last month, the signicant tax cuts that we announced yesterday, they will all help. But of course they can’t mitigate all the dficulties that high inflation is causing. No chancellor could do that.”Earlier, Downing Street said ministers stood ready to provide further support to householdsrequired after Prime Minister Boris Johnson appeared to suggest more measures could be announced.Mr Johnson admitted it was “going to be tough” as households had to cope with rising prices and the cost-of-living squeeze. He said: “It will continue to be tough, continue to be choppy but we will get through it and we will look after people throughout.” Separately, he told LBC “as we go forward, we need to do more” and insisted the Government would “fix” the rising cost of living.Richard Hughes, chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility, said on Thursday that despite the measures announced by Mr Sunak, people still face an “unprecedented” fall in living standards.The Institute for Fiscal Studiessaid the Chancellor had failed to protect the country’s poorest households. But Mr Sunak insisted he had “protected those on the lowest incomes the most” in recent years.  Asked about figures from the Resolution Foundation think tank, which said . million Britons were set to fall below the poverty line next year, including , children, Mr Sunak told Beth Rigby Interviews: “Well, I mean, what we do know is the track record, because there’s lots of projections and speculation about the future, but the track record shows that over the last  years, since we’ve had Conservative governments in charge, the number of people living in poverty has actually declined by about . million people. “That includes , children from memory. So actually, that’s a record that I’m proud of. “Now, obviously, a lot of that happened before I was in post. But the actions I’ve taken over the past couple of years have ensured that we have protected those on the lowest incomes the most.” Told that it felt like the country was being “gaslighted” by his reassurances amid the rising costs and as inflation rose, he said: “I’m not denying for one second that inflation is dficult. Of course it’s dficult, and it’s most dficult for those on lower incomes.” The Chancellor, who has been tipped as a potential successor to the PM, also failed three times to rule out that he could launch a leadership bid in the future. He read a quote from Mr Johnson, who said in  that being prime minister “would be a great, great thing to have a crack at”,“the ball came loose from the back of the scrum”, and askedhe felt the same. Mr Sunak said: “I’m much more a cricket and football fan, so I don’t know what the appropriate analogy is. But as we’ve talked about at the moment, there’s a lot going on, there’s a big job to do and I’m fully focused on doing that job and trying to do it as well as I can.” Asked again, with a cricket analogy,he would be interested, he said: “At this point, I’m just trying to stay at the crease and keep in place and not get out.” Asked a third time, this time with a football comparison, he said: “We’re stretching these analogies too far.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyRichard HughesBoris JohnsonEnergy billsLiving standardsPrice risesPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

You can see his point, because they’re like wise Uncle Nigel, who’s a bit dull but always careful with money. “Always turn off lights when you’re not in the room”, says Nigel, “as we should only spend money on items that are essential, such as £billion on a track and trace system that doesn’t track anyone or trace anyone and has to be thrown away as it’s sodding useless.” Or they’re like Mrs Butterworth over the road, who says, “I’ve always been careful with money, dear. I freeze leftover mashed potato and gravy, and mix it with beetroot to make soup for a few pence that lasts three days. And when my pension comes, just like the Conservatives did, I put by £.million on a press conference room that I never use ’cos you have to be careful”. Anyone who’s started a business has had that awkward meeting with a bank manager when they say, “It’s vital to be careful with your outgoings, like the Conservatives. Soyou have £, to invest in your company, the most prudent way to spend it is on  rolls of posh wallpaper”. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter One careful use of taxpayers’ money by the Conservatives was when Liz Truss went to Australia using a private plane. Anyone who’s had to stretch money out until the end of the month knows that dilemma. Do you get the bus to the market where potatoes and fruit are cheaper  Or are you more careful, and hire a jet for half a million quid and whizz to Australia  If anyone understands the need to be careful with money, it’s Rishi Sunak’s family. Their estimated worth is over £million, making them richer than the Queen. Sothe Queen comes round, the Sunaks must say, “Oh no, we’ve got that awful woman from the rough estate visiting tonight. Make sure you hide the best crockery”. In one interview after the mini-Budget, the Chancellor claimed his family has noticed the increase in the cost of living. This week he might explain this further, saying: “Last year our weekly marble statue delivery from Ocado cost £,, but when we took our children to buy their marble statues for this school term, they’d gone up by over £! So we’re all suffering together.” When asked for something  he’d noticed had gone up in price, he said “crisps”.It is possible that the Sunak family would notice a p rise in a packet of crispsthey were buying eight million packets of crisps a day to build a ready salted palace. Or they order “truffle and vinegar’” flavour crisps, or “-carat diamond and onion”. Andany taxpayers’ money does go missing because someone hasn’t been careful, the Conservatives will announce: “Never mind, we’ll appoint someone to look into this and we know just the person.

Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi used an interview with Sky News on Sunday to underline it was “for the Russian people to decide how they are governed”.After meeting Ukrainian refugees in Poland, Mr Biden made comparisons between the invasion of Ukraine and the horrors of the Second World War. “For God’s sake this man cannot remain in power,” he said of the Russian president at the close of his speech.  He also made a direct appeal to the Russian people, saying: “If you’re able to listen – you, the Russian people, are not our enemy.” Following the speech, White House officials tried to argue that the US president intended meaning was that Putin “cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbours or the region”.“He was not discussing Putin’s power in Russia, or regime change,” one official said, before reports in the US suggested the remarks in question had not been scripted.Interviewed on Sunday, Mr Zahawi said it is “for the Russian people to decide how they are governed” but suggested they “would certainly do well” to have someone who “is democratic and understands their wishes”. “I think that’s up to the Russian people,” he told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday. “The Russian people, I think, are pretty fed up with what is happening in Ukraine, this illegal invasion, the destruction of their own livelihoods, their economy is collapsing around them and I think the Russian people will decide the fate of Putin and his cronies.” But he declined to criticise Mr Biden, unlike Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons Defence Committee, who said Mr Putin will now “spin this, dig in and fight harder”. AskedMr Biden was wrong to issue the call, Mr Zahawi replied: “No, what I’m saying to you is the White House has been very clear on this, the president gave a very powerful speech on this and I think both the United States and the United Kingdom agree that it’s up to the Russian people to decide who should be governing them.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CabinetWorld War Tobias EllwoodJoe BidenNadhim ZahawiVladimir PutinFitness\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Firms are struggling to honour contracts and may have to increase prices – or operate at a loss.The transport crisis is yet another blow to children who have already lost countless school days due to the pandemic. At Hammonds Coaches in Nottingham, which runs  buses, filling a tank has rocketed from £, to £, in just a month.Managing director Nick Hammond said: “We felt we were turning a corner after Covid.

Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter  “There’s very little wiggle room in that. It makes things very tight. We are running those contracts at , a loss at the moment, as the prices were set before fuel went up.” Nottinghamshire Council has stepped in and paid more to keep their contract with Hammonds. But other coach firms may have to shoulder the cost themselves – or break their school contracts.  Moran Milligan, of Milligans Coach Travel in Mauchline, Ayrshire, said they are tied into school contracts for five years. She said: “We’re worse off as we are having to subsidise these school contracts. We are held into them, so there’s nothing we can do.” She added that the Chancellor’s p-alitre fuel duty cut makes little dference and they will have to make school contracts more expensive. Geoff Barton, General Secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “It is vital pupils can get to and from school.”Shadow Schools Minister Stephen Morgan said the Tories must “match Labour’s ambition for children’s futures and put in place a proper recovery plan”. He said: “Children have already lost out due to the chaotic mismanagement of learning in the pandemic and face further challenges as a result of the Conservatives’ cost of living crisis. “The Chancellor has left businesses and families to fend for themselves, sitting idly by while children’s learning is put at risk of disruption once again.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyEducationSchoolsEnergy billsPoliticsSunday PeopleFuel poverty\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The pair spent four days – and three nights – grappling below the six-lane M road bridge over the River Exe, near Exeter, Devon. Suspended from the six-lane span, the pair had to grip and put pressure against the sides of the crack with every move. It meant squeezing their hands and feet into the crack thousands of times as it vibrated and flexed from lorries thundering past. The pair, from Sheffield, often wore ski goggles because of small debris falling through the crack.Bigger obstacles wedged between the concrete sections included an electric toothbrush charger and a stray car bumper. Tom, , said: “The bridge was actively contracting and expanding so it took a while to get used to it and not freak out.” Nights were on a portaledge suspended from the bridge. Toilet breaks involved bottles and bags. And a pal even brought them pizza – which they gratefully winched up.Peter, , said: “It was a tough and physically exhausting four days – like doing , pull-ups. But I think we are the only pair of climbers in the world who could have pulled it off as it’s a specialised niche style.” The pair have tackled iconic rock faces across the world and opted for the M challenge as Covid curtailed their travels.

And when he settled down with Kate, many thought she was one very lucky lady. But when one of the now-Duchessaposs friends put this point to her, she reportedly had a brilliant response.  During their university days at St Andrews, a friend told Kate how lucky she was to be going out with William.

They say Rishi Sunakaposs Spring Statement, with its p cut on fuel duty and National Insurance threshold increase, does not go far enough and the reality on the ground is stark.For people living in Oldham, Greater Manchester, where the number claiming Universal Credit has almost doubled in two years, day-to-day le is a struggle, reports the MEN. A trip to the town centre found a carer regularly surviving on one jacket potato a day, a pensioner whose food shop have soared from £ to £ and a mum who feels like a failure as she struggles to pay for school trips.Brits now face the biggest fall in income on record as inflation looks set to hit as much as %. In Oldham, a town with the second worst level of child poverty in the country, Julie Nuttall sits down clutching a polystyrene box. “This is our daily food,” she says, pointing down at her jacket potato. We might have a sandwich later, but this is our main meal.”It’s a hot March morning and the smell of baked potatoes fills the air. For Julie and her nephew Shaun, this food truck is a leline. It means they can afford to eat a proper meal today.“We’ve been walking aroundOldhamtrying to get the cheapest food we can,” the -year-old says. “We’re having child portions.”Like thousands of other families across Greater Manchester, Julie is facing the greatest uphill battle as the cost of living crisis cripples the country. A full-time carer for her disabled nephew, it’s a worry that keeps her up at night.“We do a lot of camping, we use an outside BBQ,” Julie, who lives in Hollins, said . “We’re going to have to make food on the BBQ just to cut back.“We’ve been given our bill for the next  months which has trebled in size. Weaposve switched the heating off now sowe get cold, we layer up. I know we have to pay and move on. But we have to cut back on usage and cut showers down. We have a disabled shower room which is going to make it dficult.  Weaposve had to cut back and prices are going back so we have to compensate somehow. Do you eat or heat  Thataposs the scenario. This time last year we were free. We could go into the community and come round here and not have to worry about what we had to eat. You go to bed and worry about what it will be like tomorrow. Barbara Szwandt stands outside a cafe with her daughter Janet. When asked about the cost of living crisis, a concerned look falls across her face.  The -year-old receives a pension but the money goes on rent and bills. Her financial situation once became so bleak, she was forced to beg people for warm clothes. Iaposve been struggling to get a coat and clothes,” she says. “Iaposve been going round askingpeople have clothes to spare. I donapost like begging and sometimes itaposs hard to do that. I had to get a coat instead of shopping. I have to ask my daughtershe has any shoes to spare.Barbara, who lives in Oldham, says she can only afford basic food including bread, milk and potatoes. Her total food shop used to come to around £. Now, she claims it costs around £. Itaposs hard when you get £ a fortnight on pension, then you have to pay rent,” she continues. It doesnapost go nowhere. Thereaposs nowhere for anyone to speak to anyone and see what help is available. Iaposve lost contact with younger age groups I have to rely on my daughter to do things for me. I canapost do a proper shop. “What I used to get cost me about £, now itaposs costing £. Itaposs basically just bread, milk and potatoes.”  Mum-of-four Janet Szwandt gently rocks her three-year-old in his pram. The -year-old cares for four children, including her autistic son TG. Money is so tight at the moment she can’t afford to pay for school trips – something that makes her feel like a “bad mum”. Itaposs horrible you feel like an emotional train wreck,” she says. “You get up and you donapost knowyouaposre going to have enough to survive the next week. Weaposve had to cut back on every day stuff like going to play centres. You canapost do anything because everything has gone up.  “Weaposve had to cut back on the monthly shop because we canapost afford to do it and it costs us a fortune. You have to budget what you need to spend to survive. Itaposs gone from £ a month to £. My daughter wants to go on school trips and I canapost afford to pay it. We canapost get the bus, we have to walk. Itaposs so silly we have to live like this. Itaposs even affecting the kids because they canapost understand why they canapost have essential things. They canapost have them because itaposs so dear. They canapost have pocket money. It just makes you feel bad as a mum because you canapost afford to give them what they want. You canapost make them happy. With UK inflation soaring to .% - its fastest rise in  years - millions of households will be worrying about their own finances. The  cost of living crisis is hitting energy prices, fuel and the cost of food, with the governmentaposs only solution so far to offer all households a £ loan to help pay off their energy bills - which must be paid back eventually. Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs Spring Statement saw him announce a cut in fuel duty, although this will cost the Treasury billions without putting cash back in familiesapos pockets.

Janet has also been forced to rely on food banks recently. I used food banks now and again and came off it because I was able to survive on monthly shops,” she added. “But Iaposve noticed the money I had left over, we donapost have anymore. We have nothing to fall back on anymore. Having a child with disability needs is so hard. Sometimes we put the heating on in one room and all sit in there. Even pensioners are struggling because I see how much my mum struggles as much as me. My son has never been out to a play centre and he’s autistic- I just can’t afford to do it. Terrance Ball, from Chadderton, claims Universal Credit due to being disabled. After paying his bills, he says he’s “lucky”he has £ leftover.Itaposs hard, itaposs very hard,” the -year-old says. “Iaposm having to rob Peter to pay Paul. Iaposm having to borrow money off friends. “Iaposm struggling Iaposm in financial dficulty I cannot afford and Iaposm a vulnerable adult. Iaposm having to cut back like on the essentials. Iaposm diabetic and insulin dependent. I canapost afford the food I need. I have to borrow off my friend. Itaposs really hard. Sometimes me and my we sit on the settee and we both cry.” Oldham currently has the highest proportion of the -plus population on Universal Credit in Greater Manchester, according to new figures. There are currently , people claiming the benefit in Oldham Town North, or %. Across Greater Manchester, , people were on Universal Credit in February – .% of people aged  and over across the area. The number has increased from , in February . The government donapost give a damn about us. Itaposs not fair. Iaposm not happy Iaposm content. But I would rather be happy, Terrance continued. We feel like weaposre just existing. We canapost go on a night out we canapost afford a holiday - not even for a few days. Weaposre having to look after ourselves and we have a little girl we need to look after. It feels like weaposre living in the s. I have PTSD and a lot of underlying illnesses I have to eat and I have to get my medication and itaposs hard to get them. After Iaposve paid my bills, Iaposm luckyIaposve got £ left over.  Michael Brown, also from Oldham, says he is “just about” coping with the dramatic price increases – although it is something that causes him stress. He said he’s noticed a rise in his fortnightly shop. My electric has gone up £ a month and my central heating works out at £,” he says. Iaposm just about coping with it. I call myself a stress head anyway, so I do worry about it. Itaposs going to get worse and worse. I used to spend £ on a fortnight worth of shopping in Iceland. “The last few times itaposs been £ for the exact same stuff. Itaposs p here and p there but it all adds up.  Mark Webster takes a break on a bench while the sun beats down on Oldham town centre. While he says his family is stable financially, he has found himself having to work overtime to keep it that way. “Itaposs a worry for me. A couple of weeks ago I got an email from my energy supplier. My bills are increasing by £, altogether, additional to what Iaposm paying. Itaposs incredulous,” the -year-old says. I knew it was coming, but I didnapost think it would be that large. I donapost think I can challenge it. Iaposm working overtime to pay for things. Luckily my we works as well, weaposre not as bad off as other people are. The only thing I can hope is that Labour get in next time. Weaposre frugal anyway, but I think what I am doing is working more to pay for things and having to work extra days to afford it. Iaposve got three children and one is going to university this year so we have that extra cost coming up. I worry about the cost of things over the next couple of years. I worry about how dficult itaposs going to be for them buying houses and I donapost know how theyaposre going to save up for a deposit. Thataposs why I encourage them to go to university and get a decent job.

Every year people around the world honour mothers and mother figures by sending cards and flowers, buying gts or simply showing appreciation for mums. In the UK the date of Mothering Sunday falls changes each year, but it always falls on a Sunday. This year it falls on Sunday, March , but this is dferent for ious countries around the world. For example, in Belarus, Bulgaria and Uzbekistan, Motheraposs Day fell earlier in the month, on March , meanwhile, Norway celebrates on on the second Sunday in February. So why does the date change every year, and why is it dferent from country to country   Why does Motheraposs Day date change every year   The reason the date of Motheraposs Day changes in the UK every year is because it has to do with Easter. Motheraposs Day falls on the fourth Sunday during Lent. The date changes because the date of Lent changes every year depending on the cycle ion the moon. That means that Easter Sunday can occur on any Sunday between March  and April , meaning Motheraposs Day changes with it. Why do we celebrate Motheraposs Day  Motheraposs Day is actually a Christian tradition stemming from the th century when Christians would visit their mother church on the fourth Sunday of Lent. Also known as Mothering Sunday, it has in recent years become more widely known as Motheraposs Day. Why is it on a dferent date in ious countries   Motheraposs Day is an international celebration and appreciation day of all mother figures. However, the date it actually falls on ies from country to country. In the US they launched a completely separate event in , devoted entirely to honouring their mothers. The holiday has no connection to religion, and is what the modern day Motheraposs Day celebration is based on. Anna Jarvis, dedicated community organiser and philanthropist, campaigned for a day in May to celebrate mums after her own died. The idea gained so much traction by  all US states observed the holiday. In  President Woodrow Wilson declared Mother’s Day a national holiday and a “public expression of love and reverence for the mothers of our country”. She later believed the day had become too focused on profit, and fought for it to become less commercialised. Anna said: “A printed card means nothing except you are too lazy to write to the woman who has done more for you than anyone in the world.” Many other countries have followed suit, deciding to celebrate on dferent days . For example, many celebrate on the second Sunday in May - including Finland, Greece, Iceland, India and Italy.

Natalie said: “When I saw the look on their faces, the sheer joy, I realised I’d done an amazing thing. “It meant the world to me to be able to do this for them, after what I’d been through myself. “We’ve become such good friends, so to know they are now a family because of what I did is heartwarming to see.”What a wonderful story - tell us your thoughts in the comment section  Natalie, , and husband Jack longed for children, but she suffered an ectopic pregnancy that resulted in miscarriage when she was . She lost a second baby at the age of .“Losing any child is devastating, but we never gave up, said Natalie. Then her dreams came true, when she had son Alfie in . “Having Alfie was the most precious thing imaginable for us,” she added. “He’s such a sweet, loving boy – I had never felt so happy.” Natalie, from Bath, Somerset, fell pregnant again in . It was a girl and Alfie helped picked her name – Sophie. They were blissful days. Natalie recalled: “We were so happy, we painted her nursery pink and got everything ready for her arrival. Alfie was so excited to meet his little sister. “The weekend I thought she might arrive, the same point that Alfie came along, I packed my bag, put the car seat in the car and made the pram ready.”  But heartbreak was to come as scans showed Sophie had stopped breathing. Natalie said: “The midwe couldn’t find a heartbeat. That was  weeks, four days into the pregnancy, the exact point when I’d given birth to Alfie. “Nothing prepares you for that moment, your future as a family ripped out of your hands. I was absolutely devastated. Scans showed the baby hadn’t suffered any distress. She simply stopped breathing and died.”Natalie was induced and delivered Sophie on March ,  – a date she will never forget. She said: “Holding her in my hands, tears streaming down my face, I didn’t know how I could carry on, but I swore to Sophie she’d never be forgotten. I posted a photo on Facebook of a pink balloon and a pink rose.I explained what happened, that our baby girl had passed away. That rose became a symbol of Sophie and whenever we want to remind people about her, when we have a family gathering, or it’s her birthday, we get a pink rose.” Get the stories you want straight to your inbox.toone of the Mirroraposs newslettersThe couple created a memory box with Sophie’s blanket and teddy, her hand and foot prints and a card from a nurse detailing the birth. Natalie added: “Alfie had been distraught and looking through that box helped him take this in. “We closed the door on Sophie’s room and, over the coming weeks, grieved our girl. But we were determined not to give up on our dream of completing the family we’d dreamed of for so long.” That dream became reality when Natalie found out she was pregnant just four months later. And baby Lily was born in March . Natalie said: “She weighed lbs oz, the same as Sophie had weighed, and I just hugged her so tight, thinking after so many years of heartache and pain, our dreams had finally been answered. “Holding Lily in my arms, with Alfie and Jack beside me, I felt so completely blessed.”Another le-changing event was to come – triggered when Natalie and Jack watched TV drama The Nest, starring Joanne Froggatt and Martin Compston as a couple who use a surrogate to carry their child. “It detailed the pain and anguish couples experienced not being able to have children,” said Natalie. “It made me think how wonderful it would be to help make that dream come true for someone .” She and Jack talked things through and decided it was right for the family. Natalie said: “Jack gave me a massive hug and said he’d fully support me, he understood how this would help me heal after losing Sophie and the other two babies.” Marketing manager Jack, , said: “After getting over the surprise, I really liked the idea. It’s such a lovely thing. Natalie is a very selfless, caring and naturally maternal person. “She gets personal satisfaction from caring for others and always puts others before herself.” After joining surrogacy group Missing Pieces on Facebook, Natalie met Andy, , an embroiderer from London, who had suffered two surrogacy miscarriages with his husband Gareth, , a professional dancer. “Instinct told us they would make lovely parents. They were full of le and love, and I knew this felt right,” Natalie said. She formed a firm friendship with Andy and, after several meetings, agreed to be a surrogate. Natalie said: “I told him all about Sophie, how I was doing this for her, and he completely got that.” The embryo – from Andy’s sperm and an egg from Gareth’s sister Rebecca, a mum of two – was implanted in March last year. Natalie’s friendship with Andy and Gareth blossomed. And at five months pregnant – and a healthy baby bump – she, Jack and Alfie attended the couple’s wedding in Bethnal Green, east London. Natalie said: “There were several references in the speeches to me and their baby. To be part of their lives and given so many compliments by their friends and family, couldn’t have been more perfect.” The pregnancy ran smoothly and little Bobby was born last November – after a rapid delivery. Natalie revealed: “My whole labour was  minutes, then a couple of pushes and he was out. “Andy and Gareth had to run to the delivery room – it was like something out of a film. But they got there just as Bobby cried for the first time. “I passed him over to Andy, who held him to his chest so they could have that initial skin-to-skin bonding. He was still attached to me by the umbilical cord, it was such a special moment. To me, it felt like holding a friend’s baby, then passing him back to his parents. He was with who he was always supposed to be with. “I couldn’t sleep that night because I was on top of the world. “Now, when Alfie and I go and open Sophie’s memory box, we tell her about Bobby, about what we did. “I know she’d be so proud. I just feel so incredibly blessed with my own family, but also having helped another couple create their own in her memory. Andy and Gareth send me updates and we have visited Bobby. We have a very special friendship. It took a lot of people to create Bobby – and now there is a lot of love to go around for him.” Overjoyed Andy said: “Natalie is amazing, she gave us the most special thing anyone can give you. “That moment in the delivery room was overwhelming. Our little baby was there and it was love at first sight. “Meeting this little person we’d hoped and prayed for. “I was expecting it all to be more medical, but with the five of us there, holding Bobby, it was actually very calm and special. “He is five months old now and full of smiles and giggles. I can barely put it into words, what Natalie has done for us. We will be forever grateful.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BabiesPregnancyMiscarriageSurrogacySunday Mirror,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Emma Cranston was savagely attacked by former partner George Arathoon, who forbade her to wear make-up, forced her to give up her job and manipulated her into thinking she couldnapost live without him. After eventually escaping the relationship, the mum-of-two has since retrained in psychotherapy and formed a friendship with TV therapist Robert Hisee. Emma, , was attacked by her ex-partner Arathoon in February . He was later handed a five-year prison sentence for the assault.Emma told the Manchester Evening News that she met George when he moved into her street in Cheshire in .“George was  years younger than me, but we became pals and it went from there. He was very charming and funny, and I felt I could tell him anything, Emma said. In  they moved in together, but the relationship quickly became volatile and violent. “Each time he managed to convince me it was my fault, he told me I was as bad as him, she said. “I started to think it was wrong to stand up for myself and I began to think I couldn’t live without him. I didn’t see my friends. I didn’t go anywhere without George. “I wasn’t allowed to wear make-up or fake tan or dress up nicely, and in the end, I just gave up. I suppose the fight just went out of me. It was easier to do as I was told.  “I had a good job in a call centre but he made me leave because there were other men there. I was living in a constant state of fear.” In February , George launched an attack that almost killed her. Emma explained: “We had been out for the evening, and I was driving us home. I turned the music up in the car and that was enough to make George flip.” George inflicted injuries so severe that Emma was air-lted to hospital. She suffered multiple broken ribs, and a punctured lung which resulted in blood collecting in between her chest wall and her lung. Doctors also found old healing fractures from earlier attacks. They told Emma she was at risk of a heart attack and was lucky to be alive. She needed surgery to fit metal plates and pins into her back and ribs and had three ribs completely rebuilt. But, despite her ordeal, Emma admits she still had reservations about speaking to the police.  On Valentine’s Day , she finally plucked up the courage to seek justice. George Arathoon was convicted in July  of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, inflicting grievous bodily harm and intimidation. He was jailed for five years at Chester Crown Court. A restraining order was also put in place to stop him from contacting Emma or her family. Emma has since thrown herself into helping other women, setting up a support group, ‘Love Doesn’t Hurt’, which reaches across the globe, with over half a million followers. And earlier this month, she teamed up with Robert Hisee, who will offer his therapies via the support group. Robert, ‘The Hypnotist Man,’ has worked with celebrities like Lauren Goodger, Dame Kelly Holmes, Tom Zanetti, Paul Gascoigne and Gemma Collins, using his own Unconscious Mind Therapy.Emma and Robert, , say they have the support of MPs and hope to be granted charitable status soon. Emma said: “I am so excited to be working with Robert, I have huge admiration for him. I signed up for one of his courses and I have never looked back. So many women I meet have psychological and physical damage and our programme focuses on recovery.” ‘Love Doesn’t Hurt’ offers abuse and trauma recovery using aposunconscious mind therapyapos which promises to help transform thoughts, feelings, emotions , habits and beliefs to help people get over domestic and emotional abuse. Robert said: “We want to create an environment where it is safe to talk and heal – and where they can all help each other too. People need that sort of encouragement and support. It’s about recovery and moving forwards. This is a place for traumatised people to access my expertise in a safe place.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Paul GascoigneKelly HolmesLauren GoodgerHospitalsLoveCourt caseCrown courtFake tanHeart attackHeart diseaseDomestic violenceTherapyHypnotism\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Joanne and Ed are urging the public to check their own dog leads after their #ActionArchie drive prompted a Europe-wide withdrawal of the one they bought and two others. The couple have called for an official product recall notice by Pets At Home which which can only happen when triggered by the US firm, Mission Pets. Ed, , from Dunmurry, who was walking Archie at the time of the road accident, said: “Archie was basically my wee son. That’s just how I feel. I don’t have children of my own, he was my wee man, my first dog and the best thing to walk into our home. Joanne and I adored him and we used to joke thatwe had to choose between one of us and the dog, it would be a close run thing. Now he’s gone and our home feels desolate. Our hearts are broken.” Joanne bought the KONG-branded lead from Pets At Home last Saturday.On Sunday the clip opened during a walk, releasing Archie but the couple were able to corral him in a driveway and put the lead back on. The following day while on another walk, the carabiner clip clicked open again but this time Archie stepped into the road before Ed could pull him to safety and the dog was hit by a van. Archie died on the roadside. Ed said: “We checked the lead well before our walk on Monday because it had unexpectedly opened the previous day and it seemed to be working fine. We trusted the KONG brand and we trusted Pets At Home would only sell guaranteed safe leads. But now we know there are no guarantees.  “To witness what happened to Archie in a matter of seconds from being full of le to death, has been an absolute trauma. I saw the whole thing play out, I heard the noise, I keep playing it over in my mind. Iaposm tortured by it. I feel guilty that he was killed while I was with him. Joanne feels guilty that we bought the lead. “We’re just devastated and angry and we want to warn other dog families not to assume as we did, that a trusted brand bought in good faith from a trusted shop cannot fail just when you need it most.” The couple contacted Pets At Home to tell them what happened while using the KONG Rope Dog Lead and were initially offered a refund of £..  Distraught, they turned to BelfastLive for help. Joanne said: “We were sick with shock, we needed to explain what had happened and we wanted to understand how Archie could possibly be dead when we’d spent his whole le making sure he was secure, safe and looked after. “With the help we got through to KONG and then the manufacturer of the lead in the USA, a company called Mission Pets.  “Thankfully they listened to us, they responded quickly and sales of the leads with this particular carabiner clasp were stopped immediately, and they were removed from all of the Pets At Home shops with immediate effect. The three companies now want our lead to do tests on it and try to ensure whatever happened, never happens again. It will go to Mission Pets for full testing. “Sadly though it is just too late for our wee man. We’re bereft, devastated to have lost Archie in this way. He was such a good boy, the heart of our family who was just starting what we’d hoped would be a long and healthy le. He only turned one a week ago. Now he’s dead and all we have left are his ashes in a cask.  “If we had not used that lead,that clip had not failed, we would have him here by our side safe and happy. Instead our home has been consumed by sorrow. It was horrendous for the driver too, he was in tears and he has our every sympathy. We hope heaposs OK. The only lucky thing is that Ed wasnapost hit by a car because he stepped out instinctively to get Archie.  A spokesperson for Pets At Home said: “We were devastated to hear about what happened to Archie and our hearts go out to Ms McPoland and Mr Hughes at this very dficult time. We take safety concerns of this nature very seriously and are removing from sale three Kong products that use this carabiner clip, including the Rope Dog Lead, whilst we work with Kong to understand what happened. We have been in contact with Ms McPoland to offer our condolences and will keep her updated with the outcome of our investigation.

A palace source said: “She’s battled stfness in her legs recently so the cart is perfect.”Days after the mph electric buggy turned up, the Queen treated her pet corgis to a lt around her private grounds. Aides sat the pooches next to her in the four-seat cart as they went for a brief spin around the castle.  The cart - dubbed the Queen Mobile - was ordered to help Her Majesty move around her home as she continues to struggle with mobility, aides say. A Windsor Castle source told the publication: “The cart arrived in the last fortnight. She and her aides have already used it. Last week she took the dogs out in it for a tour around the private grounds. The vehicle - which is said to put some regular cars to shame - was built by Danish firm Garia. The Courtesy model can reach a top speed of mph with a range of  miles before it needs to be recharged with a lithium battery.It comes equipped with weather enclosure doors - meaning the Queen wonapost risk a chill while nipping from one wing of the manor to another. It has a tablet-screen with maps and weather updates, a fridge should Her Majesty need a snack, and even Bluetooth speakers. A source told the Sun that staff agree the buggy is a great solution to the Queenaposs mobility issues. They added they hope it will help her to keep up with her engagements for as long as possible.  The Queen would prefer to walk to public appearances, but she is struggling at present, they said. The Queenaposs mind is still razor sharp and she has no plans to abdicate, they add. Despite her mobility issues, the Queen is hoping to attend the Duke of Edinburghaposs memorial service at Westminster Abbey in just a few days.  Large numbers of the royal family are set to gather next Tuesday, alongside Philipaposs friends, colleagues, representatives of organisations he supported and foreign royals to pay tribute to the -year-old duke who died in April last year. There are fears Her Majesty could miss the event in honour of her husband of more than  years after recent bouts of bad health.A statement read: “Members of the Royal Family will attend a Service of Thanksgiving for the le of HRH The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, at Westminster Abbey on Tuesday, th March.“The Service will give thanks for The Duke of Edinburgh’s dedication to family, Nation and Commonwealth and recognise the importance of his legacy in creating opportunities for young people, promoting environmental stewardship and conservation, and supporting the Armed Forces. “The Service will in particular pay tribute to The Duke of Edinburgh’s contribution to public le and steadfast support for the over  charitable organisations with which His Royal Highness was associated throughout his le.” The Queen has already this month missed the Commonwealth Day service, with the decision to cancel her appearance understood to be related to her comfort travelling the -mile journey from Windsor Castle to London.

Photos on the listing, which is set to go to auction on March , show that each room is incredibly run-down, with piles of rubbish strewn all over the place. One room shows a pack of Stella Artois on the bedside cabinet which,youaposre lucky, could end up coming with the auctioned property.  The house listing has been shared on social media with a lot of people commenting on its condition. However, estate agents Allsop has reassured potential buyers that the house will be cleared of all rubbish and unwanted items when the sale of the site is completed. With a large overgrown rear garden, the property is situated on the north west side of Maesdu Road, to the south west of its junction with Ffordd Las.  It comes complete with three bedrooms, one bathroom, two reception rooms and a very cluttered kitchen. Clutter inside shows stacks of paper piled up in one corner of the room, a dirty unmade bed and a mould-ridden toilet along with rubbish and bags strewn over the rear overgrown garden floor. Whoever takes on the property will need some serious elbow grease - and a strong stomach.  Allsop auctions say the property will be open for viewing every Monday and Wednesday before the auction. However, the company strongly encourages that all viewers wear a face mask and gloves when viewing the property.They also ask people not to visitthey are displaying symptoms of coronavirus.The three bed end terrace house is located overlooking the large Llandudno Rugby Field and stands only minutes away from the A.

Crowds were pictured lounging on beaches in Southsea, Portsmouth, Bournemouth and where.However, the Met Office has warned that conditions are set to change next week, with snow possible as temperatures drop to as low as -C.Todayaposs warm weather is expected to tail off tomorrow with predicted highs of C, although it will still be sunny.  A Met Office spokesman said: Although Monday will still see a good deal of dry and fine weather, increasing cloud will hinder high temperatures. The west will hold onto the warmest of the weather through the day. Coupled with this is the risk of a few showers across some central and southern areas of the UK. By Tuesday a cold air mass will attempt to push into the north of the UK and slowly sink southwards, although the exact way this occurs is still very uncertain.  However this happens, we are likely to see a change to a more unsettled and cooler weather picture from the middle of next week. Showers will be possible for much of the UK, although most frequent in the north and east, some of which are likely to be wintry in nature. Nighttime temperatures in the north could sink to –C in isolated rural areas. It comes after the UK enjoyed almost a week of warm and sunny weather.  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Met Office Chief Meteorologist Paul Gundersen said: “Although the UK has had a good deal of fine and settled March weather in recent days, a change is on the way from the middle of next week with colder air spreading down from the north and the increasing likelihood of rain for most areas. On the hills in the north, there’s a chance of this falling as snow, although we’ll gain more certainty on that in the coming days. “With the influence of some unsettled weather, we’ll be seeing a marked drop in temperatures for most with colder air arriving from the north. This will see maximum temperatures drop into single figures for many areas, and below freezing overnight.” UK Weather Forecast This evening: A clear night for many northern and western areas, with patchy rural frost. Breezier across southern England, while increasing amounts of low cloud likely to spread to some eastern and central areas of England, with patchy fog especially on hills. Sunday: Sunny for many northern and western parts, warm by afternoon. Parts of southern and central England and perhaps east Wales, cloudier especially during the morning, leading to a cooler day. Outlook for Monday to Wednesday: Remaining warm initially, but gradually turning more unsettled with showers and rain. These turning wintry in the north as colder conditions filter southwards. Light winds, patchy fog and frost overnight.

Snow will begin in the north on Wednesday and is expected to hit Scotland and the northern parts of England. Forecasters say around four inches is expected to lie in some areas.  The flurries will move to move into northern parts of England and could dump up to nine inches in the area, WX Charts says. In Wales, up to three inches will settle later in the week while Northern Ireland is not immune and will see some snow too. Large parts of the country will be hit by rain which will turn to sleet or snow as temperatures plummet. Tomorrow is set to be the last of the mini-heatwave, with temperatures hitting up to C at around pm. Met Office Chief Meteorologist Paul Gundersen told The Sun: “Although the UK has had a good deal of fine and settled March weather in recent days, a change is on the way from the middle of next week with colder air spreading down from the north and the increasing likelihood of rain for most areas. “On the hills in the north, there’s a chance of this falling as snow, although we’ll gain more certainty on that in the coming days. “With the influence of some unsettled weather, we’ll be seeing a marked drop in temperatures for most with colder air arriving from the north.The Mirror yesterday told of the coming cold snap, which will be shock to the system for those who had started to breakout their summer wardrobe.In some places there has been glorious temperatures of C and C highs, with seemingly endless sunshine. But a cold snap has been forecast by the BBC and WXCharts in Scotland, with snow expected for many areas. Flurries will arrive as early as Wednesday, but forecasters from The Met Office have said below average temperatures should come to an end later in April.BBC forecaster Darren Bett said: “There are some big changes in the weather pattern on the way but not just yet. Temperatures in rural areas will not be far away from freezing.  There maybe a few pockets of frost and fog to start the day across Scotland and Northern Ireland but away from Northern Isles there is set to be more sunshine for Scotland and Northern Ireland on Friday. Plenty of sunshine for England and Wales. Into next week though and this is where we see signicant changes not least because we are going to start to see a northerly wind moving down and that will really drop the temperatures, said Mr Bett. As the high recedes early next week we have got the chance of seeing some rain and then that northerly wind arrives it will be much colder by day and also by night.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Met OfficeHeatwaveSnowWeather\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Britain has enjoyed a recent string of warm and sunny days, giving us  hope that summer weather was here.In some places there has been glorious temperatures of C and C highs, with seemingly endless sunshine. But meteorologists say sunshine conditions will end this by Saturday or Sunday.People will get a taste of most of the seasons within the space of a few days, a Met Office forecaster has said, as above-average summery weather makes way for more wintry conditions.Clocks go forward overnight into Sunday, ushering in British Summer Time.  In Glasgow, the temperature is due to drop by half, from .C on Saturday to just C by Thursday. Hill snow is likely to affect some parts of Scotland on Tuesday night, and possibly across the Pennines and Welsh mountains by Wednesday, said forecaster Marco Petagna. He said: Weaposll get a taste of most of the seasons within the space of a few days. The UK was bathed in sunshine and blue skies again on Saturday, as a warm and dry spell continued. The mercury reached a high of .C in Porthmadog in Wales, and much of the country is likely to see temperatures in the mid to high teens again on Sunday.  Greater cloud cover across central and eastern England will mean temperatures are down a few degrees, Mr Petagna said. He added: But itaposs still pretty good for the time of year. The average at the end of March would usually only be C or C in the north and -C in the south. So itaposs still pretty good at the start of the week. He said there will be a more notable change from midweek, with Thursday looking likely to be a cold day for most with highs of between C and C. In the Met Officeaposs long-range forecast for the UK, which spans from March  to April , it expects showers to become more prominent, and even says some snow showers may hit northern areas. It reads: Becoming more unsettled to start the period, northern areas will see increasing amounts of cloud with a few showers. Breezy and feeling cooler than recently in the far north, with the potential for some snow showers at low levels. Temperatures near average in the south. Becoming less settled and colder thereafter, with a mixture of sunshine and showers for most, in addition to an increased likelihood of wintry hazards, particularly to the north. Nearer to the end of this period, temperatures are expected to gradually recover to average, though overnight frost remains possible during clearer spells. Showers or longer spells of rain look to become more frequent, with drier periods most likely to be short-lived.

This will increase to £ a year when the price rises again in OctoberHeating bills can be reduced Image: Getty Images iStockphotoByJames RodgerRegional Content EditorNeil ShawGraeme Murray:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar The worst vampire appliances which drain your energy and bank account have been highlighted as energy bills rise. A host of everyday costs are poised to go through the roof, with bill hikes on the horizon ahead of the Cost of Living Crisis. Utility bills will soar, but there are also rises in National Insurance, Council Tax water bills and other subscription services. Smart meter analyst Loop are now making households aware of eight appliances we use regularly which can drain your bank account.Steve Buckley, head of data science at Loop, told BirminghamLive : “Many people I speak to are really worried about their energy bills right now, and sadly the situation is not set to improve for some time yet.The reality is that the only way we can lower our energy bills right now is to reduce the amount of energy we use and the key to that is measuring our use.  If you measure it, you can control it. If you measure it, you can see the impact of changes you make. “Understanding whether your phantom load is low, medium or high is the first step towards reducing it and can lead to big savings. Our free app connects to your smart meter so you can benchmark against other households and track your usage and use the data to your advantage. You can easily identy the culprits draining your energy and adding pounds to your bills.” Energy-sucking devices, like electric towel rails or underfloor heating, could add a whopping £ a yearon energy bills from next week. This will increase to £ a year when the price rises again in October.  Utility bills are expected to spiral by % and will rise again in October with even more hikes predicted every three months.In his spring statement Chancellor Rishi Sunak hinted there could be more help on the way to pay for rising fuel bills. But Walesonline reports they can be reduced adjusting your thermostat and ensuring you have as much double glazing and insulation as you can.Before going bust last year, energy company Utilita created a guide to how much energy each appliance uses when on standby,Archie Lasseter, sustainability lead at Utilita, told The Sun : “Standby mode is a real energy drainer – some items use the same amount of energy as when they’re switched on. In each home, leaving just one TV on standby can waste up to £ of electricity a year. While £ a year may not seem much - turning a TV off would therefore save you £ month on your electricity bill. Moreyou have additional TVs, and more when the bills go up in April. A games console such as an XBox or Playstation will also use around  watts in standby - or £. a year each when not in use. A laptop will add £. a year to your billyou leave it sitting untouched but plugged in.Your Google Home or Alexa Smart speakers use almost as much power when in standby as when in use - £. a year on your bill for each speaker.A plug-in baby monitor will cost you £. a year when not being usedAnd even a phone charger left plugged in, when not charging, adds p a year to your bill. So overall,you have a couple of smart speakers, a laptop, a games console, more than one TV and a few other devices then you could be spending £ a year - or £ a month - just to leave them not-quite switched off. People with multiple devices, TVs, laptops and consoles will be spending signicantly more.  According to British Gas, up to % of British homesapos energy use could power vampire appliances - thataposs £ of the average energy bill capped at £, a year. Energy expert Rob Bohm says these devices add up to billions of pounds in wasted power every year. Bohm said: Theyaposre electrical appliances, chargers and lights all over your home, devices that suck power from the mains — constantly — even when you think theyaposre switched off.

Having previously donated his sperm for payment as a struggling student, he decided to go down this route once again, pulling in £which helped see the couple comfortably through to the end of the week.He didnapost see this as a big deal at the time but opted not to tell his we. Until recently, heaposd forgotten about it completely, until a conversation with friends prompted him to bring it up. His we was not happy at this casual revelation and was left distressed by the thought that her husband may well have unknown biological children out in the world. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.Taking to Reddit, the conflicted husband reveals he met his we in his final year of college, adding that they have now been married for six years.He wrote: We have our own children and everything is okay but a couple of years ago we went through a rough patch and I donated again to earn some money. I didnapost really tell her because I didnapost see it as a big deal and it wasnapost a lot of money. I got about £to tide us over for the week and we went on about our business. I forgot about it.However, the other week, they were chatting with friends who were experiencing fertility issues, and the topic of his previous donation cropped up, much to his weaposs surprise. The poster - who goes by the username u Spare-Ninja- - continued: My we was more shocked than I expected her to be. She looked visibly shaken but moved on quickly.When we got home she brought it up again and I explained the story and how I forgot about it over time and didnapost see it as a big deal. She got quite upset, saying I might have potential children that I donapost know about. I donapost have children I donapost know about because the only children I have are those Iaposve had with her, but she is insisting this is some form of betrayal. The unnamed man now feels quite guilty about the situation and wonders whether he should have just told his we at the time, realising that to her, this was a pretty big deal. One fellow Reddit user advised: As someone who conceived my children with donor sperm I do still feel you should have disclosed it. They aren’t your children but a lot of these kids grow up with a curiosity about where they came from. In fact, in my country, they have a legal right to their donor’s contact details once they turn  and donors need to sign a form acknowledging that before they can donate. No one is expecting you to be a parent but the chances of a kid popping up to say hi over the years aren’t zero and you should have prepared her for that possibility as a courtesy. Another wrote: At best you were inconsiderate, at worst you violated her trust... what  are you doing that she considers a big deal, that you arenapost sharing  I guarantee that sheaposs been rolling that thought around her head since.Do you have a sperm donation-related story to share  We pay for stories.

The woman, from the US, explained her friend invited her and her husband to South Padre Island in Texas and told her specically to bring one of her black dresses for aspecial eventthat would be taking place during the trip.When the woman was packing, she realised she didnapost fit into the black dress anymore so packed a white one instead, thinking the substitute would be close enough to the one her friend suggested. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. But when the day of the event arrived, her friend told her it was actually her wedding day - and was furious that sheaposd decided to wear white.In her post, the woman said: My best friend invited my husband and me to go on vacation with them at South Padre Island. She told me to bring the dress I wore to my last anniversary dinner for the special dinner event she planned during the vacation. I said sure.I also recently gave birth, and that dress is elegant black lace over a nude dress that is very classy but also form-fitting. When I tried it on when packing, I realised it wasn’t as flattering and my boobs had a hard time fitting. So instead, I packed a cute semi-formal white lace dress instead. I figured it was close enough.  I arrived at the event and found out it was a surprise wedding on the beach where she only invited like  guests. She hadn’t told me it was her wedding because of an inside joke, where I kept telling her and her partner to get married and said theyaposd just elope and next thing we know they are married. The woman said she was horried when she realised the mistake she had made, and things went from bad to worse when she was then told she was supposed to act as the maid of honour at the ceremony. She tried to tell her friend to get someone  to fill the role but she refused - and instead accused her of ruining the wedding. The woman added: She was horried, and so was I. I didn’t bring any other dress, plus there was no time to change buy a new dress. Also, surprise! I’m the maid of honour. I offered to either not be the maid of honour, or leave the wedding, but she rathered me not. Later she blamed me for ruining her wedding because I didn’t follow her instructions to wear a specic dress and didn’t tell her about changing my mind. I said I’m sorry her wedding was ruined but it wasn’t my fault and she should have told me it was her wedding, and at the time of packing, I didn’t find it appropriate to get her approval on my outfit. Commenters on the Reddit post admitted they were initially planning to tell the poster she was in the wrong, but after discovering that she didnapost even know thereaposd be a wedding. One person said: You didnapost know. It was close to the same style, I donapost see how you could have known not to wear white simply because someone asked you to wear a dress they liked on you before. While another added: You arenapost a mind reader so how could you know it was going to be a wedding. An apology would be nice.

The woman, whose name is Faith, managed to slide out the drawer after realising it had a little piece to push down, and was able to get a proper look at it. Noticing the compartment was looking rather grimy, Faith set about cleaning it using a simple yet effective combo of warm washing up liquid water, a toothbrush, and a cloth. After a lot of scrubbing, Faith was able to get her washing machine drawer sparkling once more, and many have been impressed by the satisfying results. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.Taking to the Facebook group Cleaning tips and tricks with before and after pictures of her drawer, an incredulous Faith wrote: How on earth did I not know this drawer came out !I’m not officially an adult and love cleaning haha! Thank you everyone for your cleaning tips and tricks.  Many other members were similarly amazed by the apparently little-known hack, having also had no idea whatsoever that the drawer could be removed and scrubbed separately in this way. One astounded woman wrote: They say you learn something every day. Well, today I learned this thank you. Another gasped: I not know of this trickery either! Offering help to those who werenapost sure how to get their own drawers to budge, ious members whoaposve tried this hack before advised to press down in the middle of the drawer, right where the fabric softener is poured, before giving it a gentle pull.

Veering off script and away from US foreign policy, the President finished a -minute address in Poland yesterday with “For God’s sake, this man [ Vladimir Putin ] cannot remain in power.Within minutes aides were trying to insist he was merely saying Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over regional neighbours, rather than advocating for regime change. The latter would be at complete odds with the US and NATOaposs stated policy throughout the month-long conflict and risk making an already paranoid President Putin even more dangerous.After the speech, which came at the end of three days of meetings in Europe, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: Thataposs not for Biden to decide. The president of Russia is elected by Russians. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletinhere That view was echoed by UK Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi who said the overthrow of Putin for his actions in Ukraine is up to the Russian people. Interviewed on Sunday, Mr Zahawi said it is for the Russian people to decide how they are governed but suggested they would certainly do well to have someone who is democratic and understands their wishes. He told Skyaposs Sophy Ridge: The Russian people, I think, are pretty fed up with what is happening in Ukraine, this illegal invasion, the destruction of their own livelihoods, their economy is collapsing around them and I think the Russian people will decide the fate of Putin and his cronies.  But he declined to criticise Mr Biden, unlike Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons Defence Committee, who said Mr Putin will now spin this, dig in and fight harder. AskedMr Biden was wrong to issue the call, Mr Zahawi replied: No, what Iaposm saying to you is the White House has been very clear on this, the President gave a very powerful speech on this and I think both the United States and the United Kingdom agree that itaposs up to the Russian people to decide who should be governing them.  Biden has previously called Putin a “butcher”, “pure thug”, “murderous dictator and, most signicantly, a war criminal. The last comment was at the time dismissed by aides as speaking from the heart but within days US policy changed and Secretary of State Antony Blinken also used the term. That incident led some observers to speculate that Bidenaposs Putin must go comments pre-empt a policy switch. But the rapid back-pedalling and global distancing suggest it was instead the latest example of the -year-old departing from his carefully crafted speeches and misspeaking as a result. President Bidenaposs words came as multiple rockets struck the city of Lviv near the Polish border in the west of Ukraine. He had earlier said: If youaposre able to listen - you, the Russian people, are not our enemy. His comments were condemned by diplomats and foreign policy experts. Richard Haas, a veteran diplomat and president of the Council on Foreign Relations, told the Washington Post: “There ought to be two priorities right now: ending the war on terms Ukraine can accept, and discouraging any escalation by Putin. And this comment was inconsistent with both of those goals.“It discourages Putin from any compromise essentially —you’ve got everything to lose, it frees him up. Why should he show any restraint  And it confirms his worst fears, which is that this is what the United States seeks. His ouster and systemic change.” He added that the comments were frustrating as Putin would jump on them and the USapos response to the conflict has so far been incredibly disciplined. David Rothkopf, a foreign-policy analyst and CEO of the Rothkopf Group, said the comments would act as a lightning rod but defended the President saying he wasnapost wrong. Biden, a self-confessed gaffe machine, has previously been criticised for calling Barack Obama “the first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy at the launch of his  campaign. He was then caught on camera whispering an expletive in Obamaaposs ear at a bill signing. He later drew the then-Presidentaposs ire when he broke rank announced his support for same-sex marriage before it became official policy.And during his own campaign he called Theresa May Margaret Thatcher.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Joe BidenVladimir PutinUkraineRussiaRussia Ukraine war\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Her millions of followers believe she had paranormal abilities including telepathy and could communicate with aliensBaba VangaByGraeme Murray:,  Mar |commentsA blind mystic who foresaw the Russian war in Ukraine predicted Putin would become aposLord of the Worldapos Baba Vanga apossawapos may natural disasters and warned about conflicts before they happened. She died in the mid s aged , but the Eastern European hinted at what we could expect in the future and became known as aposNostradamus of the Balkansapos.It has now been suggested she predicted Vladimir Putin and Russia will dominate the world. In a meeting with writer Valentin Sidorov, Vanga in , BirminghamLive reported she said: “All will thaw, asice, only one remain untouched - Vladimir’s glory, glory of Russia.Too much it is brought in a victim. Nobody can stop Russia. All will be removed by her from the way and not only will be kept, but also becomes the lord of the world. ” Before her death, Vanga predicted glorious future for Russia once more, the Daily Post reported.According to the clairvoyant, Russia will be the world’s only superpower. She also made a chilling prophecy about the use of nuclear weapons and World War . Blinded after being picked up by a freak tornado as a child, Baba Vanga - born Vangelia Gushterova - believed she had the ability to foresee the future. She reportedly made hundreds of predictions in her -year career. She shot to prominence after accurately predicting the sinking of the Kursk in . Her millions of followers believe she had paranormal abilities including telepathy and being able to communicate with aliens.  Her numerous predictions about world events and the state of humanity have become infamous, including claims she predicted the rise of ISIS and the fall of the Twin Towers.The Irish Mirror also told of her chilling predictions today and how some of them have come true.Specialists have since calculated that  per cent of her prophecies had happened - slightly less than the  per cent claimed by her followers. These are some of her other previous predictions: The Kursk nuclear submarine disaster In  the blind prophetess predicted that in August of , “Kursk will be covered with water and the whole world will weep over it.” Kursk was a Russian sub that Sank in the Barents Sea on August , , killing all aboard.  In  Baba Vanga said: “Horror, horror! The American brethren will fall after being attacked by the steel birds. The wolves will be howling in a bush, and innocent blood will be gushing.” On September , , planes hijacked by Islamic extremists hit the World Trade Center in New York, killing thousands of people. Europe will cease to exist According to Baba Vanga, the continent will cease to exist by , and all that would remain will be empty spaces and wasteland, nearly devoid of any form of le. Clearly not exactly right, but the UK did vote to leave the EU on June , , creating a lot of turmoil. She is reported to have said that chemical weapons would be used by extremists against Europe . Barack Obama will be the last president of the US Baba Vanga had predicted that the th US president would be an African American, but she had also added that he would be the last one. She claimed he would leave office at a time when the country would be in economic ruins, and there would be a huge ide between the northern and southern states – as was the case during the American Civil War.Baba also appeared to predict that the th president of the United States - who we now know to be Donald Trump - would be faced with a crisis which would “bring the country down”.Her chilling prediction states: “Everyone will put their hopes in him to end it, but the opposite will happen he will bring the country down and conflicts between north and south states will escalate.” Some speculate the references to “north and south” could mean North and South Korea. World War III Baba’s predictions have been revisited after another mystic, who apparently foretold Donald Trump’s presidency, claims to know the exact date World War  will start. Self-proclaimed ‘messenger of God’ Horacio Villegas believes nuclear war will break out on the th anniversary of the visitation of Our Lady of Fatima. The clairvoyant claims to have envisioned Trump would win the US election as far back as . He reportedly predicted the billionaire businessman would become the “illuminati king” who will “bring the world into WW ”. The  Boxing Day Tsunami “Cold regions will become warm ... and volcanoes will awaken. “A huge wave will cover a big coast covered with people and towns, and everything will disappear beneath the water. Everything will melt, just like ice.” China rises According to the prophetess, China will become a world power in . She’s probably out a few years here as China is already an economic and military powerhouse. We’ve also apparently got a change in the Earth’s orbit to look forward to some time before . A golden age A new energy source will be created and global hunger will start to be eradicated between  and . A manned spacecraft to Venus will be launched. From  to  the polar ice caps will melt, causing ocean levels to rise. Cloning of organs Baba Vanga’s predicted that body organs will be cloned by , and that would be the easiest method of treatment. Red and green Between  and  a classless, Communist society will thrive hand in hand with newly-restored nature. Mars attacks! A LOT happens from  to , including a Mars colony becoming a nuclear power and demanding independence from the earth, the establishment of an underwater city and the discovery of something “terrible” during the search for alien le. Some time between  and  we’ll crack time travel. Meanwhile, French guerrillas fight the Muslim authorities in France. The “secrets of the moon” will be unveiled. The end of the world By , everything on Earth will cease to exist. However, humans will be advanced enough to move to a new star system.

The US President blasted Putin as a dictator in a stirring speech at theRoyal Castle in Warsaw, Poland.It comes after years of claims that Putin is desperate to re-establish Russian control over former Soviet Union countries.Biden denounced the despot after speaking to Ukrainian refugees in the Polish capital today.When asked what he thought of Putin after the meeting, the President said: Heaposs a butcher.In his speech outside theRoyal Castle, Biden added: In this hour, let the words of Pope John Paul burn as brightly today - never, ever give up hope, never doubt, never tire, never become discouraged. Be not afraid. A dictator bent on rebuilding an empire will never erase a peopleaposs love for liberty.Brutality will never grind down their will to be free. Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia, for free people refused to live in a world of hopelessness and darkness.We will have a dferent future, a brighter future, rooted in democracy and principle, hope and light, of decency and dignity, of freedom and possibilities. For Godaposs sake, this man cannot remain in power.  The White House later claried that Biden was not discussing regime change in Moscow. Instead he was emphasising that Russia should not be allowed to control its neighbours, a US official said. Biden also addressed the Russian people in his speech today, saying aposyou are not our enemyapos while warning that the Kremlinaposs actions in Ukraine was aposnotof a great nationapos Biden added: Of all people, you the Russian people, as well as all people across Europe still have the memory of being in a similar situation in the s and s, the situation of World War Two, still fresh in the mind of many grandparents in the region.  After sharing accounts of the horrors of World War Two, he added: These are not memories of the past - not any more, itaposs exactly what the Russian army is doing in Ukraine right now. The US president said Moscowaposs troops have met their match with brave and stf Ukrainian resistance and have strengthened the resolve and unity of both the defending forces and the West. Russia wanted less of a Nato presence on his border but now he has a stronger presence, a larger presence, he said.  Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here Mr Biden said , Russians had left their country in a single month in a remarkable brain drain as Mr Putin, who he earlier called a butcher, had strangled democracy.Addressing the thousand-strong audience that included refugees who have fled the war, he told Ukrainians we stand with you - period as he defended the nationaposs president, Volodymyr Zelensky.Putin has the gall to say heaposs denazying Ukraine. Itaposs a lie, itaposs just cynical - he knows that, Mr Biden said. And itaposs also obscene. President Zelensky was democratically elected, heaposs Jewish, his fatheraposs family was wiped out in the Nazi holocaust and Putin has the audacity - like all autocrats before him - to believe that might will make right.

It comes two weeks after a previous Russian attack on Kharkivaposs Institute of Physics and Technology, which is home to a nuclear reactor core. A Ukrainian politician warned that the latest shelling risked a aposmajor environmental disasterapos.The State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine said: The continuation of its bombardment can lead to severe radiation consequences with contamination of nearby territories. Emine Dzheppar, Ukraineaposs first deputy minister of foreign affairs, added: The Russian aggressor fired rocket aposGradapos systems on the territory of the Kharkiv Institute, where the nuclear installation aposSource of Neutronsapos is located, in the active zone of which  fuel nuclear cells were loaded.The destruction of a nuclear facility and nuclear material storage facilities could lead to a major environmental disaster. Ukraine continues to gather evidence ofwar crimes to The Hague. The regulator previously accused Russia of committing an act of nuclear terrorism by bombing the research facility. In a statement the nuclear watchdog said: Prior to the Russian aggression, the Source of Neutrons was at the stage of physical start-up, during which the core was loaded with fresh nuclear fuel.  On February , , the unit was transferred to a deep subcritical state by the operational personnel of the Source of Neutrons. In a report on the state of the reactor, which is used in scientic research at the institute, the Inspectorate said critical buildings at the site had sustained damage during the attack but the reactor was in a deep subcritical state and completely de-energized. Video from the scene is understood to show huge flames at the centre, where the first development of a nuclear bomb was carried out in the USSR.  Ukraineaposs Centre for Strategic Communications and Information Security posted on Twitter: In Kharkiv, eyewitnesses report a fire in the building of Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology. The building contains equipment which,damaged, can lead to radioactive pollution of the environment. After it was first targeted, authorities said the institute is home to a nuclear research facility with  nuclear fuel cells. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here Before Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine, while Vladimir Putin ’s troops gathered on the border, Kharkiv was seen as one of the cities most at threat and it has withstood horric bombings and slaughter. The resistance of the city has typied the response from Ukrainians since Russia’s invasion on February  and residents have refused to surrender. Kharkiv Mayor Igor Terekhov said hundreds of buildings, many residential, had been destroyed. It is impossible to say that the worst days are behind us, we are constantly being bombed, he said. A witness in the city said she saw people on the roofs of apartment buildings dropping grenades or similar ordnance onto the streets as the resistance continues.

Karis Wilson was told her knee- black dress with lace trim over a long-sleeve white turtleneck reminded a female teacher of “lingerie” and made a male student teacher feel awkward, when she wore it to school.The -year-old was sent home and the encounter was so damaging she did notto school until her graduation at the end of the year.Her father Christopher Wilson initially complained about the incident on aFacebooklive video that went viral, with more than , views. He told the Daily Star : She wasnapost wearing it in a sexual manner. She wasnapost wearing it for attention. She normally wears track pants and a hoody. She had a snowboarding accident a month or two ago and couldnapost be active for a while. She had started going to the gym and feeling better about herself. Then one day she decided to wear a dress and feel good about herself, this is how they reacted. “She had lost more than a week of school and then she said ‘dad, I don’t know what to wear to school’. “She elaborated a little bit and said, ‘DadI wear just my track pants and hoodie,I wear something comfortable, am I conforming  “aposIf I wear something I feel pretty in, am I trying to rub it in their face ’”  Karis, a student at NorKam Secondary School in British Columbia, Canada, has now put the incident behind her and started her university education. Her dad told CBC News at the time:was told that it could possibly make the male student teacher feel awkward and it could makefeel awkward since it reminded her of a lingerie outfit. Itaposs actually a very modest outfit when you actually look at it... I think the initial comments were based on the fact that it had lace.” It was said in  that dad Christopher was told the teacher was a little bit old school after complaining to the principal.He said a teacher pulled Karis out of her class and escorted her to the principalaposs office on Tuesday. He claimed the principal later told him that she agreed the outfit was not inappropriate. Karisapos classmates staged a walkout the following day to show their support for her. At the time he added: There was a female who was singled out because what sheaposs wearing could make someone in a position of power over her feel uncomfortable. And the more you think of it, the more you say it, the more you understand that this is absurd.He initially complained about the incident in a live Facebook video that went viral, with more than , views.And now, speaking to the Daily Star in , Christopher said his daughter was confident thatshe could go back in time and change anything, she would do the same thing again.

They then happened to bump into each other on a night out and realised how much they clicked. The pair soon fell in love and married in February . They now have plans to start a family together in the future. Savanna’s family have been supportive, with her mum, who is just seven years older than Mark, even calling him her son. Love who you love and don’t be swayed by others, Savanna said. I am so grateful for the friends I lost to this relationship. At the end of the dayyour friends donapost support you no matter what, they aren’t friends worth having. “Both of our parents were completely fine [with our relationship].My mom calls him son and she’s only seven years older than Mark . He’s really close with my family and vice versa.” From the minute they met, Savanna says she felt dferent about Mark compared to other boyfriends and their relationship quickly grew. She said: “I actually wasn’t physically attracted to my previous boyfriends and wasn’t intimate with any of them. Donapost get me wrong, they are lovely, wonderful guys and I am still great friends with them but physically there was no attraction – despite other girls my age always liking them.“I guess with Mark what’s really incredible is having a physical attraction to him as well as the depth of conversation we can have. It feels like we are teammates as well as lovers, just constant support on both ends to be who we are and true to ourselves.” Although neither Mark nor Savanna had been in a relationship with an age gap before, they never felt it was an issue. She said: “Our relationship just moved from stage to stage naturally with no verbal confirmations. “Neither of us brought it up with the other. We didn’t really voice any concerns. I guess I had in the back of my mind that he may not think I am in the right stage of my le to be serious but we both gave it a shot and we found us both to be in the same stage and in agreement with where and how we were.” After they got together, Savanna introduced Mark to her family and luckily it went really well.But other relationships have suffered because she chose to be with him, including close friendships. She said: “His friends were fine and wonderful and a lot of them are actually some of my best friends now. “My friends in the main were great but I lost two of my best friends because they couldn’t understand that you can get along and be from dferent generations and I guess they had conservative small-minded views of relationships. “I have always deemed myself lucky to have lost them as I donapost believe friends are real friendsthey don’t support you regardless of their own view – we have dferent lives and should support each other regardless of our own opinions.” In late , they decided to get married. Savanna said: Neither one of us is overly romantic and he had been asking stating we should get married for about a month in late  and I just laughed it off every time. One day we were on our way to play lawn bowls with our friends and we were at our favourite cafe called the Tennyson Bistro in Napier, New Zealand, eating smoked salmon bagels and he just said aposPick a date and letaposs get marriedapos.  I laughed and said a random date and he agreed and four months later we were married. The pair had a small wedding with just their closest friends and family on  February , on the balcony of their home. Now, the couple have plans to expand their family at some point in the future. Savanna said: “We are both into the idea of having children but are in no rush. As always we have to plan and discuss everything we do so we have pencilled it in for four years. “For now, we want lots of adventures, travel and success. We have already moved across the country and then moved countries twice now and we would like to keep doing that – exploring and finding opportunities to grow together. Le should be an adventure and settling down doesn’t have to mean staying in one place.” The pair also post about their relationship on TikTok, where they have over , followers. While most of the comments they get are positive, the pair say they do get a few negative responses – but they don’t let it bother them. Savanna said: Itaposs wonderful because we [get] hundreds of messages from people who are in the same boat but donapost have our confidence, and say our TikTok makes them feel better about their relationship. We are helping people ignore the judgement.There are sort of generic comments which makes me think people don’t really think too deeply and repeat what they’ve seen on Facebook. Itaposs just things like “this is so wrong” and “He could be your dad!”I just sit there trying to mature and not comment back aposcould be your dad next time Sharonapos.

From Knapdale, they headed up the west coast, sailing to Lewis and Harris before arriving at their final destination, Iona.Covering almost , miles in the series, they visit places of worship, from pagan stones to an early Christian cave and a contemporary mosque and Sikh temple. The journey tests the pilgrims not just spiritually, but physically too.TV celeb and comedian Scarlett Moffatt, , said: #At school, I spent a lot of time just reading books and on my own and so that’s how I got into faith really. It just felt calming. There’s almost a stigma attached to sort of being religious.#Whenever I would tell my friends, they’d laugh and I’d be like, #why is that funny # I believe in God, there has to be something that started all this.#I would describe myself as Christian, but not a strict Christian. I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#. The -year-old explained: #I think pilgrimage is about clearing out your mental closet by physical exertion and by spiritual conversation with yourself or,you believe it, then conversation with your God.#I know I come across as all sort of flouncy and floppy and rather cavalier, but I am capable of existing in the real world.#However, I don’t think I’ve walked so far not wearing Cuban heels.#Pilgrimage: The Road to the Scottish Isles will be screened on BBC Two and iPlayer in the spring with three one-hour-long episodes, and is a CTVC production."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week march 11 2022","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Who am I  What am I  Where am I  How am I  – questions of identity and some of the questions I was left asking when I left a recent meeting.That meeting was part of a world-wide movement – a movement that calls the peoples of the world to pray.Similar questions of identity were raised when I was asked to write ‘a piece’ for this newspaper.

victory over the Aberdour seconds across in Fe.Taking advantage of the wind at Silversands, Kilmory pushed ahead with two well-taken quickfire goals from Alex Cunningham on  and  minutes to take an interval lead.There was no more scoring in the second half with both teams struggling a bit on the  sticky pitch.With Inveraray seniors# Mowi National Division match against Skye called off due to heavy rain # after the Aray lads had reached Fort William # Inveraray juniors had the option of a strong bench for their Mowi South Division Two match versus newly-formed Strachur-Dunoon.The match was reversed from the Winterton to Dunoon Stadium with the more experienced Inveraray side running out - winners.Experience aside, the Inveraray side still contained five players under  and one -year-old.A competitive and hard-fought game started at a good pace with Strachur-Dunoon showing good hitting and a willingness to chase down balls.Inveraray struggled for cohesion and had to wait until the th minute to find the breakthrough, Allan MacDonald scoring with a shot from distance.This settled the visitors and in the nd minute after some hard work by Ryan Pugh, the ball broke to Ewan Donnan, who struck from the angle to find the net.No sooner had the dust settled than Inveraray found themselves three ahead when Craig Taylor found space to put the ball past Dunoon keeper Nathan Ross.The second half was a closely-fought affair with both teams playing good, clean shinty.Inveraray had to step up a few gears to keep Strachur-Dunoon at bay, bringing on Colin Campbell, John MacKenzie and Allan Cameron to ensure composure throughout the team.Good second-half performances from all the Inveraray youngsters ensured the game was safe before Inveraray#s Allan Cameron finished the scoring in the th minute.This was the first competitive match for Strachur-Dunoon, and with a number of players missing # others having not met before the game # they showed plenty of determination, which bodes well for the future.Kyles Athletic#s away tie with Kilmallie in the Mowi Premiership was a Saturday morning postponement.The Kilmallie squad had already planned to attend the funeral of club chieftain Hugh #Shep# MacIntyre ahead of the game as the club paid their respects to one of their stalwarts.In Mowi South Division One, Kyles Athletic juniors drew -

They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter. All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.There are some fun options for kids to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o#clock flower.If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o#clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock # so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.You will need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types # bush and cordon. Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall, supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom. Expect the inevitable April showers but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn.It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors. Just watch out for frosts.Top three jobs this month:"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll boosts oban ahead of slockavullin final","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowA group of five young Mid Argyll rugby players were in action last weekend as part of Oban Lorne under-s in the semi final of the West Youth Shield.The result of the match on Sunday March  didn#t go their way, as opponents East Kilbride ran out  #  winners, but it was a good contest and close game until Oban players sustained a few injuries and East Kilbride scored a couple of breakaway tries.Oban Lorne and the Mid Argyll contingent # Rhys Coffield, Murray MacDonald, Vinnie Buckley, James Campbell and Sorley Self # have had a great season, winning their West under- development league, so there is plenty for the lads to be proud of.If anyone would like to enjoy some rugby this weekend, Mid Argyll under- boys will be playing on Saturday March  in the final of the West Youth Chairman#s Trophy against Kilmarnock RFC at Slockavullin.

Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

Also standing by was the steamer Brora, which was bund for Belfast.The conditions were so bad from the point of view of visibility that the leboat had to receive bearings from the Brora and other ships by means of the Aldis signal lamps while ships’ searchlights assisted them in getting into position. For a time the ships could only see each other on the radar screen.Coxswain Duncan Newlands, who knows this dreaded part of the estuary like the back of his hand, edged his leboat in astern of the coaster and proceeded to begin operations, but at .am came this dramatic message over the leboat’s radio: ‘Arrived alongside casualty at .hours got rope aboard and commenced towing at . hours.‘Rope now parted.

Baby young cod are not caught in prawn creels. The scientists at the Rural Affairs Committee meeting on March  said that there was zero evidence for creels to be included in the ban, and that the previous evidence cited on the Scottish Government website had now been removed.Our MSP represented to the creel fishermen in Campbeltown that she would:.    Seek a relaxation of the ban to enable the creel fishermen to continue to work as per the scientic evidence advice..    Seek compensation for the creel fishermen for almost three months loss of income.However, in the event she VOTED.    To keep the ban in place.    Against compensation.This is absolutely duplicitous.

We believe we must take positive action now to tackle these and other challenges by helping schools to work more effectively together.#By making these changes, we believe we will protect our schools, enhance the education of our pupils and build a stronger team of educators.#But this view is challenged by parent councils across the region – and they also question the process.The council is consulting on a #proposal in principle#, and this worries parent councils representing schools in Mid Argyll and Kintyre.In a joint statement, they said: #Parents and communities need to be clear that the proposal in principle does not carry any technical detail. This will only be worked out once the decision has been made to progress the model – all subject to change.#Not only can [the education authority] give us no evidence of this model working but it has not provided us with any risk assessments or proof that this will do no harm.#To make valid feedback, we have to hear both sides of the story.#The statement added that when the plan was first presented to the council#s community services committee in June , it was already clear that parents opposed school clusters.#It is extraordinary that the education authority has now spent time and money using a marketing company to #sell# the same model to parents rather than thinking it worthwhile to engage parents with possible alternative models for discussion,# the statement continued.Suggestions have recently been made that the issue should be make-or-break for candidates in May#s council elections.Islay community councillor Calum Murray, a former teacher, said: #My feeling is to nip this in the bud, that with the elections coming up very soon in May, we should ensure that not one councillor is re-elected that would support this measure.#"},{"url":null,"title":"pupils u13s in football action","story":"Campbeltown Pupils stravelled to Clydebank to play BSC Glasgowon Sunday March , looking to follow-up on their draw with Busby the previous week.After a promising start, the Pupils found themselves - down at half-time, through a combination of poor defending, and also some good play from the BSC attackers.The young Campbeltown team rallied in the second half, and with a much better all-round performance, capped off with goals from Ryan Johnston and Ben Cunningham.Finnart #s The young Pupils# second away game in a row saw them travel on Sunday to play league leaders Finnart.The first  minutes saw the Pupils put in one of their best performances of the season, competing in every position, and they were rewarded midway through the half with a brilliant -yard strike from Ryan Johnston that found the top corner.The pace and strength of the league leaders# attackers started to cause problems, however, and two quick-fire goals gave Finnart the lead.The crucial goal came with the last kick of the half, with slack defending from the Pupils allowing Finnart to go into the break - ahead.The second half was a very even affair.

Ruins, writes Green in this gripping travelogue cum history of Britain’s disappeared places, “are at once of their time, yet derailments of it, too, bringing the singularity – and fragility – of the present into stark focus”.Nowhere exemplies the illusion of permanence and the hopelessness of fighting back against the relentless march of timebetter than Dunwich, the Suffolk city that fell off a clf.Dunwich, which was once Suffolk’s main port with a fleet of its own on the North Sea, became a ruin “incrementally” from the Middle Ages to the th century, with the last of its  churches crashing into the sea “amid a waterfall of dead men’s bones” in . Knowing this, we read with the headshaking smugness of those afforded hindsight by long remove of bequests made to shore up another church that teetered on the clf edge  years earlier or to erect a statue in a place of worship that “would barely exist at all” by the time of the bequeather’s death.The American-born author Henry James was one of a “flock of writers, artists and poets” who travelled to Dunwich to wallow in its “power of sadness”. “It was a dreamy, gentle place to live or visit, its violent destruction kept at a safe remove,” writes Green. “They did not have to contend with entire neighbourhoods crashing into the sea, along with parish churches.”This need for distance helps explain why the two shadowlands in Green’s book that are located in Scotland – Skara Brae and St Kilda – evoke quite dferent emotions. The oldest of the abandoned places that Green explores, Skara Brae is at a comfortable remove of millennia from us. We can view its turfed remains, which conceal “the swaddling cloth of muck” that its Neolithic inhabitants smeared around their homes and the warren of passageways that connected them, with disinterested inquiry, just as we might potter around the ruins of Pompei largely untroubled by weeping for the fate of the long-gone settlement’s residents.St Kilda is a dferent matter. The evacuation of this Atlantic isle  miles west of North Uist on  August  is only just outside living memory, the last St Kildan having died in . There are photographs of the St Kildans, or Hirtans, as the Gaelic-speaking islanders might better be called, gathered in the bay in their finery. Their lives, though unlike ours, are sufficiently recognisable for it to be almost impossible to read Green’s account of their departure from a vertiginous lump of rock that had been inhabited for  years – before which they drowned their beloved dogs in the sea – without empathy.“HMS Harebell loomed on the horizon like a ghost rig. The corpses of some of the islanders’ dogs were bobbing in the water, pecked at and nibbled by the gulls. The islanders were stolid, reconciled to an uncertain future, standing in the freezing air, waiting.”Closer still in time is the drowning in  of the village of Capel Celyn in Wales to create a reservoir for the city of Liverpool. Village resident Eurgain Prysor Jones was nine when this bastion of Welsh language, culture and tradition was “turned into a frightening alien domain with lorries and machines incessantly digging up the earth and throwing up enormous clouds of dust” as the groundwork for the annihilating reservoir was laid. Who can read of the filling of that hated articial lake, when the roar of millions of gallons of water drowned out “the rousing tones of ‘Land of My Fathers’ in a monstrous, obliterative gush”, without a stirring of the soul Capel Celyn is not the only settlement in Shadowlands to have been erased by politicians rather than the forces of nature. The cluster of villages in the Stanford Training Area in Norfolk disappeared into a fenced-off military zone in , and the evictees were never allowed toto their homes. The deserted mediaeval village of Wharram Percy lost much of its population during the Black Death when “many thought they were soaking up the last glimmers of the universe’s existence”, but that was not what finished the village off. In , the landowner began to evict the remaining residents to make way for sheep, creating in Wharram Percy “a perfect microcosm of what happening nationwide”, as a kind of English Clearances took hold.Green is an historian, and Shadowlands is both meticulously researched and vividly imagined. The author has a novelist’s gt for bringing the past alive. When the king visits Wincha, the Sussex port that was moved at the end of the th century as the sea encroached, the reader is there among the “tumblers, jugglers and minstrels”, eyeballing the “apple-sized meatballs imprisoned in great mounds of jelly”.Just occasionally, Shadowlands slips into sounding a bit like a geography textbook, but overall, it is a thought-provoking and satisfying exploration of vanished places and the enduring forces that put them to the sword: war, pestilence and climate change. As the Russian army lays waste to Ukraine, making the fragility of the present horribly manest, it feels strangely prescient.“At St Kilda, I saw a vision of the sort of brutally self-sufficient society to which humanity might regress in the wake of environmental collapse, a third world war or some other, unforeseen catastrophe,” writes Green at the end of his splendid book. With small towns being erased in Ukraine even as I write, that apocalyptic vision begins to feel less like poetic conjecture and more like a real possibility."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-lucky-snps-incompetence-not-spread-beyond-running-ferries-running-independent-scotland","story":"The lack of proper records means that the taxpayer will probably never know the truth about the shenanigans which went on behind the scenes.

Are we living in the same dimension Bearing in mind the recent opinion polls that suggest the Tory vote is going backwards either Mr Ross cannot understand statistics and therefore shouldn’t be in politics, orhe can understand statistics that’s even more reason he shouldn’t be in politics. Perhaps he should concentrate on running up and down on the sidelines in as a minor official in football matches taking instructions from his boss in the middle of the big game mind you that’s what he does at Holyrood. Perhaps he is suffering from stress and needs a break from the rigours of being king of a very wee castle, poor soul.David J Crawford, Glasgow.rUK SHOULD BUILD ITS OWN NUCLEAR BASEDR Jonathan Eyal uses a misquote to attack Nicola Sturgeon on no-fly zones . She statedthat a no-fly zone should not be taken off the table, not that one should be instituted a dference in emphasis perhaps too subtle for Dr Eyal to follow.Defence Minister James Heappey has suggested a chemical attack would cross a “red line” but the West has allowed Russia to use these weaponswith impunity before, and any Nato reaction would also risk a nuclear confrontation. The real virtue signalling was the signing of the Budapest Memorandum where the UK and the USguaranteed Ukraine its sovereignty, but then reneged in .Dr Eyal also thinks an independent Scotland should host nuclear weapons on behalf of the former UK. Could I remind him that the submarines, missiles and warheads are entirely built, maintained and refitted outside Scotland  If an exceptional treaty obligation similar to the Budapest Memorandum was again signed by the former UK, then Scotland could find itself in the firing line, even though it had no dog in the fight. I suggest to Dr Eyal thatLondon wishes to maintain its status as a nuclear power, then it should be building a submarine base, warhead storage facility and loading jetty somewhere within its own territory.GR Weir, Ochiltree.BREXIT IN OPERATIONNOBODY should be surprised at the behaviour of the parent company of PO Ferries towards its UK employees .

Many welcomed this development as ITV, with nothing like the resources of BBC or Sky News, has a well-deserved reputation for exclusives and insightful reporting. It was the TV broadcaster which exposed the mock Downing Street press conference during the Christmas season and, later, the Partygate one last April on the eve of Prince Philips funeral.This is the biggest ITV News expansion in  years. It is pouring millions into the project with  new journalists, producers, camera operators and video operators. It is having new correspondents for Scotland and Wales, is producing more content outwith London, and has the base of a . million audience, the most popular commercial TV news service. It is impartial and independent and not so easily leaned on by the UK Conservative Government.The problem, so far, has been the fact that the one-hour bulletin has had very blatant padding. One obvious case is the weather which has now been dumbed down to a song and dance segment. The public wants a detailed analysis of UK weather. Gone is academically-qualied meteorologist Lucy Verasamy, replaced by rather Marmite presenter Alex Beresford, who chunters on, unnecessarily, about lambing, the Northern Lights or even the weather abroad.There is no need for padding. In Israel it could examine the Family Reunication Law, one of the most racist and discriminatory laws in the world affecting , Palestinians. Or it could highlight the draconian laws by Israel to steal Palestinian land, illegal under the Oslo Agreement .It could cover North Korea, which has stepped up launching parts of an ICBM, prohibited by the UN. It will soon have one which can reach the US.Then there is Iran, which regularly fires ballistic missiles as a warning to Israel, but only the one landing by the US Consulate in Iraqs Erbil got much coverage.Closer to home it could focus on the lorry tailbacks at Dover, now visible to space satellites, or the new EU entry exit system with biometric tests at the border soon. How about the UK desire to change the Northern Ireland Protocol or the devastating impact Brexit has had on Scotlands GDP An ITV News bulletin certainly does not need the current padding.John V Lloyd, Inverkeithing.WAR MAKES NET ZERO IMPOSSIBLENET zero  The Ukraine war changes everything.

Hull , destined for an Outer Hebrides route, has gone the same way.

He has also said that he believed he was a \"pawn\" in the Scottish Governments attempts to save the yard and while denying cronyism, that he got the contract due to his connections with previous SNP leader Alex Salmond.The SNP government favoured the yard, and not him personally, and wanted to make political capital, he has previously told the Herald.: Jim McColl: I was Scottish Government pawn in Ferguson Marine ferry fiascoSNP ministers have come under consistent criticism over the awarding of the ships contract after it emerged Ferguson Marine submitted the most expensive bid for the work out of six competing yards, but won through with the highest specication and quality.Mr McColl has doubled down on his criticism of ministers saying the acted in haste over the awarding of the ferries contract so it could be announced at their autumn conference in October .He said: “The audit report has revealed we were given the contract for political purposes.

The decision looks to have been made for political gain, not for the benefit of taxpayers or the island communities who desperately need these ferries.\"From what Mr McColl has said, there are serious questions for the First Minister to answer. On Thursday, she tried to say this scandal was all Derek Mackays fault but there is more and more evidence that she may have misled Parliament by making that claim.\"Were giving Nicola Sturgeon every chance to answer these shocking charges. There is no excuse for dodging responsibility and hiding from scrutiny. She must appear before the Scottish Parliament when we next sit on Tuesday to tell the public how and why their money was lost.\"During First Ministers Questions on Thursday,  Ms Sturgeon said she did \"not volunteer the information\" about who the inidual minister was that gave the green light for the contract.But she added: \"It is a matter of public record who the transport minister was at the time of the decision it is a matter of public record that it was Derek Mackay.\"And she went on to say: \"This Government operates by collective responsibility and I am ultimately responsible for all decisions that the Government takes. The buck stops with me.\"When tackled about throwing Mr Mackay under the bus she added: \" I did not intend to come here and do anything but accept full responsibility.\"Giving evidence to MSPs at Holyrood over two year ago, he said he was “stuck with” a cut-price contract for two ferries after it was announced prematurely by Nicola Sturgeon.The tycoon behind Ferguson Marine said the First Minister publicly put a price of £m on the pair of passenger ships while his firm were asking for £m.Mr McColl then alleged his firm was told by CMAL, the buyer of the two vessels - there was no more room for negotiation because the contract had been announced.He added that after she made the announcement in August  he was told “you’ll just have to accept it” and was left with no option but to agree to deliver the vessels at the lower price.In announcing that Mr McColls Ferguson Marine got the contract, the First Ministers said: \"This is an excellent result for Ferguson Marine Engineering Limited and I am delighted to name them as preferred tenderer for the contract to build two new ferries, the largest commercial vessels to be built on the Clyde since .\"This contract will see the -strong workforce retained and more staff taken on at the shipyard, underlining our commitment to creating the vital jobs needed to boost local economies and help stimulate growth across Scotland.\"The Scottish government is committed to supporting ferry users around Scotland by providing safe and reliable services, and this is the latest step to ensuring we have a fleet that continues to deliver for the communities that depend on it.\"But Mr McColl says he was “shafted” by the Government and called for a public inquiry into the ferry fiasco scandal, with witnesses placed “under oath”.Ministers carried out a takeover after Jim McColl-led Ferguson Marine went into administration in August,  following a dispute with CMAL over sprialling costs and \"unforeseen complexities\" over the ferries project.Ministers believe they were acting in the public interest in taking control of Ferguson Marine, as it saved the yard from closure, rescued more than  jobs and ensured that the two vessels under construction will be completed.: Ministers sink £m of taxpayers’ cash into Ferguson Marine despite ‘lack of due diligence’“Before we agreed the negotiation the First Minister had announced that we had been selected as preferred bidders and the price was £m,” Mr McColl said in evidence.“CMAL then came back to us and said ‘It’s been announced by the First Minister, you’ll just have to accept it’.”He added: “We were told that because it was publicly announced we were stuck with it.”As the row erupted, the Scottish Government said: “On  August , alongside Mr McColl and his senior management team, the First Minister confirmed that CMAL had selected Ferguson’s as the preferred bidder for the ferries contract.“The announcement was made in line with standard practice for procurement, and was not the announcement of the award of the contract, but confirmation of the preferred bidder.”During the weekend it emerged then Mr Mackay who would go on to oversee the nationalisation plan for the yard, was on holiday when the ferries contract was given the green light and it was Keith Brown, who is both deputy leader of the SNP and justice secretary in Ms Sturgeon’s cabinet, was asked to approve it in August . At that time he was cabinet secretary for infrastructure, investment and cities.The news of the contract win was given to SNP conference delegates on October , two months after the Ferguson Marine was declared the preferred bidder by the First Minister.Audit Scotland said last week that ministers awarded the CalMac ferries contract to Ferguson Marine despite \"severe misgivings\" of their ship owners and initial concerns about the yards inability to provide financial guarantees.The auditors probe revealed that the Scottish Government was unable to provide any documentary evidence explaining why the decision was made.It said that ministers sanctioned giving the contract to Ferguson Marine in  despite the yard being unable to provide “mandatory refund guarantees” for the financial risk to CMAL.It criticised a “multitude of failings” in the delivery Glen Sannox and Hull  which are now over five years late.Mr McColl said he had made it clear to government and CMAL that he could not provide the mandatory refund guarantee for the contract.He told the Sunday Times: “There’s no question in my mind that the decision to ignore that, and to overrule CMAL’s advice, was made by the first minister along with Derek Mackay.“The audit report makes clear that changes are still being made to the design, and hostility has continued between CMAL and the new management, so the cost will continue to increase.“I believe ferry  should be finished, but it will now cost more to finish  than replace it with a new ferry so there’s a strong argument for not continuing with it in its current form. I would make it watertight, launch it, and sell the hull.”Humza Yousaf, a former minister for transport and the islands, has said that the government took the decision to secure the yard to save hundreds of jobs.Ferguson Marine yard favourite for £million ferry contract http:t.co HhglSbtOUaAsked whether Ms Sturgeon would address the issue at Holyrood, he said: \"I have never once seen the first minister shy away from parliament.\"She of course took a signicant number of questions on Thursday [at First Ministers Questions], so what the parliament chooses to do and who it chooses to call is a matter for parliament.\"A spokesman for the Scottish government said it “operates under collective responsibility and remains focused on delivery of the ferries by Ferguson Marine”.He said its actions had helped to secure jobs at the last remaining commercial shipbuilder on the Clyde."},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

London North Eastern Railway topped the list with .% of its pre-pandemic numbers, followed be East Midlands Railwayand TfL Rail .Over the period eleven franchised operators ran less than % of the train distances it was covering pre-pandemic. One was ScotRail, which managed .%, while TfL Rail, which was the best performer, managed nearly two-and-a-half times its original distance.And of  UK regions, Scotland saw the steepest train passenger journey decline in  , with just .% of that seen before the pandemic hit. The south west of England topped the list with .%.Once a famous city-centre landmark with its striking arched windows and domed roof, it was shut down in October  although the former station building remained unused for many years afterwards.The station was part of proposals for re-opening as part of Crossrail Glasgow plans published back in .When the Argyle Line opened in , the station was never reopened and was replaced by the new Argyle Street station.That would require the resurrection of the mothballed Crossrail Glasgow scheme – the long-proposed £m development that would link rail networks to the north and south of the city and connect Glasgow’s Central and Queen Street stations.That appears to have been superceded by for a new metro system, which aims to better connect the . million people living in the Glasgow region, and hasabeen included in the Scottish Government’s Strategic Transport Projects Review , which sets out transport investment priorities for the next two decades.Last month when transport minister Jenny Gilruth was questioned about the lack of information regarding costs and a timeline, she confirmed that the new metro could cost as much as £ billion and take  years to complete.The blueprint involves a new public transport system running from Paisley Gilmour Street train station, through Glasgow Airport and on to Renfrew, Braehead and the Queen Elizabeth University Hospitalbefore reaching the city centre.There is no timescale yet and no date for the first phase connecting Glasgow Airport to Paisley Gilmour Street.Jane Ann Liston, secretary of Railfuture Scotland said: \"These stations are considered necessary to provide an attractive and environmentally-friendly alternative to road vehicles. Each of the locations has some specic feature as to why it needs a station, such as an attraction which brings in many people, a major employer or simply a large number of residents who need to travel. These stations would open up more of the country to non-road travel\".The updated list comes years after its first blueprint. Since then seven recommended by the think tank have been or are being re-opened: Leven, Inverness Airport, Cameron Bridge, Robroyston, Kintore, East Linton and Reston.\"\"The original justications for the stations on the list still stand but to them must now be added the imperativeness of attracting people back to trains in the wake of the pandemic, as the message that public transport is not safe still lingers in the public consciousness with the result that passenger numbers are still well below what they were prior to March .\"Second on the priority list is a new Grangemouth station, with the pressure group estimating it would be used by , people a year.Next comes a station for West Lothian’s Winchburgh, needed because of plans for  new homes.A station at Edinburgh’s Abbeyhill would serve the Scottish Parliament and tourist destinations including Holyrood Palace.And it believes there is a case for stations at Culloden and Bannockburn, which would serve the historic battlefield sites plus residential areas of ,.New stations to the list include on the Alloa-Dunfermline line: Cairneyhill, Clackmannan, Kincardine, Valleyfield and  Culross.On the Edinburgh South Sub the Railfuture have added Morningside, Gorgie, Cameron Toll, Newington and The Jewel.Other new proposed new stations include:Belmont , Inveralmond, Abernethy , Kirkliston , Newburghand  Abington ."},{"url":null,"title":"wordle-281-march-27-wordle-word-hints-todays-answer","story":"The aim of the game is to find a  letter word in only six attempts.The game uses the same rules as Scrabble, where only real words are allowed both in guesses and the result.If you get a letter in the right spot and form the correct word, the square turns green.Butthe guessed letter is in the word but not in the right spot, the square turns yellow.Letters that are wrong turn grey to help the process of elimination for the six tries.If you’re still trying to save your streak, then don’t scroll down yet, maybe some hints will send you on your way.Today’s word starts with the letter N and ends with the letter H.It has no vowels.It is a mythological creature, usually a young woman.What is today’s Wordle answer, Sunday, March  If you have given up on today’s game, then we can save you the misery.

After Easter — from April  — we will stop recommending that people who don’t have symptoms, should test for COVID.“This change will apply across the population — including in most workplaces and in early years centres, schools, universities and colleges.“Then, at the end of April, routine testing will end — even for people who have symptoms.“At that time, physical test sites will close — although some mobile testing units and capacity will be retained for possible future use.

The UK average is £.In response to recent concerns raised about the state of some social housing properties in the county, OIC previously explained that properties are run from a ring-fenced budget.The council has said it has to balance spending against rent rises and that, as the landlord for many people with income dficulties, it wants to keep rent as low as possible.The council have been approached for comment on the recent figures.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It requires huge determination because you leave yourself one on one at the back.“We’re willing to do that because we just don’t want to be in a low block defending against them.“You could play them mid-block and end up in a low block and not get out because they’re that good, and then it’s a slow death.“We’re not having that, we don’t want that. We want to try to affect the game.”"},{"url":null,"title":"england-boss-gareth-southgate-give-others-chance-ivory-coast   \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

I think that has been a strength for us. Players who come in perform well at the level and the team march on.“They need to feel that we’ve got the confidence in them to go into any game and we’re also at a stage of the season where their load is heavy and we’ve got to make sure we try and navigate that in the best way possible.”Southgate has already seen six players withdraw from the England squad and there are question marks over Emile Smith Rowe and John Stones, with the former absent against Switzerland and the latter pulling up in the warm-up. vw,vw,px, px\"Emile Smith Rowe has won two England caps “With John, he just felt a bit of tightness before the game,” he said. “We’re certain it’s not too serious.“It could be that he’s OK before Tuesday but we didn’t really have time before the game to assess properly so there was no point in taking a risk at that moment and we will find out a bit more .“Emile did some work with the fitness team today so there’s a chance he’ll do some of the training session . He is the only other one we have got any flags on.”Southgate hopes to have the pair available for England’s final scheduled friendly before the World Cup gets under way in November – and last match before finding out their group opponents in Friday’s draw. vw,vw,px, px\"England captain Harry Kane scores the match-winning penalty against Switzerland “I think the whole thing was a really worthwhile exercise for us and that’s why you want that quality of opposition,” he said of Switzerland as attention turns to the Ivorians’ arrival.“We could take lower level teams but you don’t learn anything and actually we want to be stretched, we need to be stretched. It puts your record at risk but that’s not important, really.“We’re trying to do well in tournaments and I think with the Nations League as we’ll have had more competitive games than any previous generation, so that means sometimes you come unstuck but I think in the long-term you are better for it.”That pursuit of progress saw Southgate reach a milestone on Saturday, with the debuts of Marc Guehi, Kyle Walker-Peters and Tyrick Mitchell meaning he has now used  players as England manager.💯🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 pic CWhApZvKS— EnglandMarch , “I’m not sure whether that’s a good or bad thing but we‘ve certainly never turned down an opportunity to give players a chance,” the Three Lions boss said.“I’ve tried to look at the future when we’ve made those types of decisions – players that there is time for and the investment might come short-term, mid-term or it might be in a few years’ time.“I thought Marc did exactly what I’ve seen him do. I watch him  play for Crystal Palace and sometimes he can go under the radar because he’s rarely out of position and he’s so calm, so you don’t see lunging tackles, perhaps eye-catching moments.“But he played with that discipline and assuredness. I thought he was excellent.“With Ben , a small error for the goal, just got caught off his shoulder, but to come in  minutes before the gameand be as composed as he was, the rest of his game was very, very good with and without the ball. I thought two were real positives.”A post shared by England football team Another positive against Switzerland was the performance of Jordan Pickford, who produced some important stops at a time when his place as England number one has been frequently questioned.“He’s always played well for us,” Southgate added. “He has a good focus with us, he has a very good relationship withMartyn Margetson, who I think does an excellent job with him.“He knows the structure around him, he knows clearly how we want him to play.“Look, there is competition for everybody’s position and that’s what we want. We don’t want people just sitting thinking confidently that there’s no competition. That doesn’t help a team.“I think the form of the other goalkeepers is important but he showed again today big saves in important moments.”"},{"url":null,"title":"uk-distances-bidens-plea-vladimir-putin-cannot-remain-power   \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

It’s unfair, unkind and just not workable because, you know, there are people out there who, you know, all parts of the NHS, but imagine you’re working with very clinically vulnerable patients – it would be devastating to you and to them to imagine that you might infect them with something that might kill them.“And the onus is on you to keep sourcing and paying for your own testing, because you want to do the right thing.

Their support helps to get projects off the ground which can make a big impact on the people of Ballymena – just like the Hospitality School.”Elsewhere, Ian Paisley MP, Chairman of The Gallaher Trust says he’s delighted with the success of the Hospitality School thus far and is speaking out to encourage other eligible organisations to apply for funding.“On behalf of The Gallaher Trust, we are so proud that the Hospitality School is achieving its purpose of developing skills and creating jobs for adults within the Ballymena community,” Ian commented.“Our mission at the Trust is to work alongside delivery partners that are aiming to make a real dference in peoples’ lives by creating jobs, developing skills and helping disadvantaged adults.“Delivery partner applications are now open and to be eligible, you must be a charity, a not-for-profit based organisation or a social enterprise, that can make an impact on the greater Ballymena area.“I would strongly urge any organisation that is eligible, to apply for funding today. We have seen from the likes of the Hospitality School, that it could make a massive dference to your project and ultimately the people of Ballymena, which is our clear purpose.”For more information about becoming a delivery partner, visit the Contact Us section of The Gallaher Trust’s website: https:thegallahertrust.org contact-us .

The broadband support package will be available to eligible jobseekers through the Department for Communities’ Adviser Discretion Fund, a grant fund available to help remove barriers to employment that prevent people moving towards and into employment Minister Hargey said: “Digital exclusion has been one of the inequalities thrown into sharper focus by the Covid- pandemic. “More than ever, employers are posting vacancies online, with many having moved to online interviewing and more positions requiring people to work from home. “Therefore, not having access to broadband can be a signicant barrier to searching for, or moving into, employment. “I am tackling this by providing free broadband support which will provide broadband for eligible jobseekers who do not currently have the service.” Support for broadband through the Adviser Discretion Fund is available for a period of six months. The Fund can provide a non-repayable grant of up to pound,, in a  month period, to remove barriers to employment. The Minister continued: “The success of the Adviser Discretion Fund in helping remove barriers to employment has already been seen throughout the year, particularly in the uptake of upfront childcare costs, which I made available last October. “I am delighted that we have already helped around  parents with average upfront childcare costs of approximately pound. “This additional scheme will help remove similar barriers to employment for those facing digital exclusion due to a lack of broadband service.”"},{"url":null,"title":"if he hadnt got covid hed be doing well he had a good few years ahead of him","story":"Tyrone’s All-Ireland victory in  was bittersweet for the Bell family, just months after super-fan Laurence passed away and his brother James at a Tyrone game.

Photo: Stock imageCiaran O#NeillMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA company which has been paid almost £m recently by Northern Ireland health trusts has received three public notices in the past year about being struck off.Connected Health provides home care workers for all five health trusts in Northern Ireland.New figures show the company has been paid £.m by the trusts in the last two financial years.However, the Sunday Independent has learned that in the past year, the company has received three compulsory strike-off notices from Companies House, which is the regulatory body responsible for the registration of businesses in the UK.All three notices were subsequently “discontinued”.According to Companies House, a business will receive a compulsory strike-off noticeCompanies House has “reasonable cause” to believe the company is not carrying on its business or is no longer in operation.The registrar may take this view for a number of reasons, such as, it has not received company documents that should have been sent to it, or letters the registrar has sent to a company’s registered office are ed undelivered.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Before striking a company off the register, Companies House is required to write two formal letters and send a notice to the company’s registered office to inquire whether it is still operating.If Companies House is satisfied that the business is not operating, it will publish a notice in the Gazette publication, which includes information on every company registered in the UK, stating their intention to strike the company off the register unless they are shown reason not to do so.If a company is struck off by Companies House, it is no longer allowed to trade and its assets become the property of the Crown.Connected Health, whose headquarters are in Belfast but which also has offices in the Republic and England, is made up of two separate companies, a holding company called Connected Health Limited and an operating company called Connected Health Domiciliary Care Limited.Compulsory strike-off notices in relation to Connected Health Limited were published in the Gazette on April , , and March , .Both strike-off actions were subsequently “discontinued” on May , , and March ,  respectively, according to the company’s details on the Companies House website.Another compulsory strike notice in connection with Connected Health Domiciliary Care Limited was published in the Gazette on March  this year but “discontinued” two days later.A Companies House spokesperson said they did not comment on the reasons for the issuing of strike-off notices to inidual businesses.However, a spokesperson for Connected Health, which was set up in  and describes itself as “one of the leading domiciliary care providers in Northern Ireland, Great Britain and the ROI”, said the strike-off notices it received were “computer generated, as per standard procedure, by Companies House because the financial accounts were technically overdue, despite an extension being granted by HMRC”.“The delays were due to finance department staffing pressures at Connected Health, including the long-term illness of our financial controller, multiple Covid-related isolations and the rapid growth in care staff to address the unprecedented healthcare crisis,” the spokesperson said.“Amid this perfect storm, our priority was managing payroll to ensure our carers were rewarded for their dedication and bravery in what was a very dficult period for frontline healthcare generally. “We did all this while maximising efforts to protect both our vulnerable clients and our committed staff at the height of the Covid- pandemic.“Once issued, the notices were rightfully retracted within a number of days.”The Connected Health spokesperson stressed that the company is in a “strong and robust financial position”. They said they were experiencing “signicant growth year-on-year” as they continue to provide “award-winning care to our partners in the Northern Ireland trusts, and also in Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland”.“For clarity, the total profit for Connected Health in Northern Ireland for the year to December  was £.m on a turnover of £.m, with total net assets of £.m,” the spokesperson added.“There are signicant growth plans for Connected Health in . We are creating , new jobs on the island of Ireland this year. Recruitment is progressing as planned, with  new care posts in Northern Ireland and another  in the Republic of Ireland.”The figures paid by the five health trusts to Connected Health in the last two years emerged recently following a question at the Northern Ireland Assembly by People Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll. He asked for details of the funding provided to the company by the Department of Health.In response, Health Minister Robin Swann said his department did not provide funding directly to Connected Health but that the five health trusts in Northern Ireland paid the company for the delivery of services in relation to domiciliary care.Mr Swann stated that the total amounts paid to Connected Health in the   financial year and the   financial year to date by each of the trusts were: Belfast Health and Social Care TrustSouth Eastern Health and Social Care TrustNorthern Health and Social Care TrustWestern Health and Social Care Trustand the Southern Health and Social Care Trust .Most ReadMark Sykes’ ‘no-brainer’ decision to play for Republic of Ireland as dad hits back at ‘bigot’ accusations with Belfast star in line to bridge  year gapDodgy east Belfast botox beautician must pay back £kAmazing space: £k Co Down home sure to attract the crowds to Killinchy RoadReids Shoes of Sandy Row goes up for sale for £, to mark the end of an eraSam McBrideOpinionWhy we all may be paying more for electricity thanks to Stormont failures and a little-known monopoly companyTop VideosPlayWalkthrough of Kincora boys# home in east Belfast PlayIrish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney evacuated from north Belfast event due to security alertPlayKincora abuse victim tells of his torment at the home Latest Northern IrelandTwo arrested as police probe security alert in BelfastOpposition option ‘on the table’ for SDLP after NI election – party leaderPO predicted £m cost to consult with staff ahead of surprise sackingsManand womanheld in connection with security alert at Simon Coveney peace event in BelfastWoman held and suspected gun seized by police probing Belfast security alertLatestEngland boss Gareth Southgate to give others a chance against Ivory CoastTwo arrested as police probe security alert in BelfastPolice hunting for prisoner on the run in underwear warn of changed appearanceIan Baraclough wants Northern Ireland’s all-action forwards to add composureZelensky demands more courage from the West in helping Ukraine fight,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We will go into a negotiation about what that government will actually do.

The world changes very quickly, Brexit has happened. It was six or seven years ago,” the leader explained.“I am not worried about polls. I think any objective analysis shows the SDLP has stabilised under my leadership and will grow again at this election.“I don’t frankly care what a poll says, I only care what an election says.”Mr Eastwood also said the cost-of-living crisis is the “most important issue” in the upcoming election, dismissing the idea the campaign will focus on the implications of the Northern Ireland Protocol.“When I speak to people and we have been knocking doors for months... people are telling me is they are absolutely petried about the rising cost of fuel and food, that they can#t even heat their homes. These are people out working every single day,” he added.“After that is the health service. A quarter of our population are languishing on a hospital waiting list.“I think they are the kind of issues people are most concerned about. People are telling us, and they are telling every pollster, the protocol is nowhere near their top issue.”Mr Eastwood also said discussion over the position of First Minister was part of a “phony sectarian row”, amid both main unionist parties previously unwilling to confirm whether they would support a Sinn Fein First Ministerthe republican party was to become the biggest at Stormont.“See this phony sectarian row about who is going to be top dog, it makes absolutely no dference,” the SDLP said.“If Sinn Fein win this election and the DUP come out second, we will have Sinn Fein and DUP joint First Ministers, just like the joint First Ministers have been for the past  years.”Related topicsSDLPColum EastwoodNorthern Ireland AssemblyMore On SDLP PremiumGail WalkerOpinionIf Stormont worked, the NI Protocol would be settled and we’d have the ‘best of both worlds’… this election will make no dference to real lives PremiumLucidTalk boss defends election polling as a sign of Northern Ireland becoming ‘a normal society’ PremiumMalachi O#DohertyOpinionSinn Fein’s mix of strategy and self-delusion is a recipe for confusionMotorists are warned to be alert after spate of hijackings across NIHolylands kne attack ‘comes as no surprise’Most ReadMark Sykes’ ‘no-brainer’ decision to play for Republic of Ireland as dad hits back at ‘bigot’ accusations with Belfast star in line to bridge  year gapDodgy east Belfast botox beautician must pay back £kAmazing space: £k Co Down home sure to attract the crowds to Killinchy RoadReids Shoes of Sandy Row goes up for sale for £, to mark the end of an eraSam McBrideOpinionWhy we all may be paying more for electricity thanks to Stormont failures and a little-known monopoly companyTop VideosPlayWalkthrough of Kincora boys# home in east Belfast PlayIrish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney evacuated from north Belfast event due to security alertPlayKincora abuse victim tells of his torment at the home Latest Northern IrelandOpposition option ‘on the table’ for SDLP after NI election – party leaderPO predicted £m cost to consult with staff ahead of surprise sackingsManand womanheld in connection with security alert at Simon Coveney peace event in BelfastWoman held and suspected gun seized by police probing Belfast security alertMurder of Arlene Arkinson under spotlight in BBC documentaryLatestIan Baraclough wants Northern Ireland’s all-action forwards to add composureZelensky demands more courage from the West in helping Ukraine fight, schoolchildren off due to Covid as more detail on free testing promisedStephen Kenny urges Republic of Ireland to carry momentum into Nations LeagueWales boss Robert Page insists the goals will come for Daniel James,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Faulkner and other Cabinet ministers address a mass rally of Vanguard supporters from the balcony of StormontMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailAt .pm, on March , , Northern Ireland’s House of Commons adjourned. It was never to meet again. Two days later the NI Temporary Provisions Act became law, introducing direct rule, ending  years of unionist government, bringing devolution to a stop and shutting down NI’s Parliament. It was the biggest crisis for unionism since the  Home Rule Bill.At lunchtime on March , Brian Faulkner, destined to be NI’s last Prime Minister, led his Cabinet onto the balcony to address the enormous crowdwhich had gathered in the grounds. He had only a loudspeaker.“People of Ulster, I am speaking to you still as Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. I want to say, not just on my own behalf, but on behalf of every one of my colleagues in the Government and the Parliamentary Party here at Stormont, that we understand absolutely the feelings which have persuaded you to come out to Parliament Buildings today… we share the resentment that you feel. We have tremendous power.“Our power is the power of our numbers our power is the justice of our cause our power is the responsibility of our conduct. Let us never play the game of the murderers of the IRA. Let us show the world that, so far as we are concerned, violence and intimidation are out. British we are and British we remain!”The previous day Faulkner had addressed an emergency meeting of the Ulster Unionist Council, informing it that his government had lost confidence in Edward Heath’s administration.By his own admission it was an angry meeting seething at what was regarded as a betrayal and surrender to unionism’s enemies. But he also warned them to shun violent responses and rely, instead, on the ‘Unionist veto’ which lay in the strength of their numbers.Exactly  years later, on Monday March , the present Assembly will be dissolved in preparation for an election on May . There are many within the unionist community who believe that, like its predecessor on March , , this institution will not meet again.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Political unionism is again seething with anger, believing that another Conservative government has betrayed it and rolled over to the demands of those who want Northern Ireland removed from the United Kingdom. Indeed, they would argue that the process of removal has been advanced by a protocol which traps Northern Ireland in some sort of constitutional halfway house between Great Britain, the Republic of Ireland and the European Union.When Brian Faulkner spoke of unionism relying on the strength of its numbers it was at a time when the combined pro-Union vote hovered around two-thirds of the overall vote.At the election for the first post-NI Parliament Assembly, in June , the pro-Union votewas %. In the  Assembly election that votehad reduced to .%.That election also saw unionism reduced to a minority within an NI Parliament and Assembly: and there is now a possibility, come May , that unionism won’t even have the numbers to qualy for the position of First Minister.And yet unionism remains as ided now as it was back in . The narrowing of the demographic gap between unionism and nationalism, along with an ongoing reluctance by successive British governments to be seen to be what might be described as pro-active on behalf of unionism, hasn’t pushed it in the direction of prioritising a coherent, collective, long-term strategy for survival.Even the thundering hammer-blows rained down on the DUP by Boris Johnson continue to be greeted with fairly mild responses from the party leadership.Speaking on Monday evening Jeffrey Donaldson acknowledged the problem: “It’s not a question of throwing the DUP under the bus. The Prime Minister threw Northern Ireland under the bus and the harm that this protocol has done to Northern Ireland is, I think, something the Prime Minister now recognises. But we need him to do something about it.”The problem, of course, is that Donaldson has been saying this since September last yearand Johnson has done nothing. He’ll continue to do nothing until May : and, in all likelihood, will do nothing after that, either.In March  Brian Faulkner and the UUP decided to risk the collapse of the NI Parliament rather than allow control of security to pass from the NI government to Westminster.A few days before Stormont was prorogued Faulkner had written to Edward Heath: ‘We wish to point out with a sense of the heavy responsibility involved that the imposition of this proposal, involving as it will the resignation of the Government of Northern Ireland as a whole, may have the gravest consequences, the full extent of which cannot now be foreseen.’We now know the primary consequence of the resignation and subsequent prorogation: the end of majority rule, the introduction of mandatory power-sharingand the sapping of unionist confidence that their future position within the United Kingdom was, to all intents and purposes, secure.What Faulkner did — although I fully understand why he had to do it — was hand over the political negotiating process to a British government which was determined to build an entirely dferent relationship with its Irish counterpart.In his biography, Memoirs of a Statesman , Faulkner hinted at regrets: “... when unionists of vision tried to stimulate new thinking and broaden the appeal of unionism in the s s I did not come out and support them. I did not think they were achieving anything useful...but we should have spent more time watering the roots of tolerance.“We did not take the initiative in reforming our society until events forced change on us. By  we were reacting to events rather than controlling them and one was always conscious of running very fast merely to make up lost ground.’Since then, a number of other unionist loyalist leaders have voiced fairly similar regrets. Sometimes about their own personal lack of foresight and sometimes about opportunities which unionism may have missed over the decades.Yet as Faulkner noted, there was always a sense that unionism was a few steps behind the thinking of others when it came to mapping out Northern Ireland’s post- future. Or, as former UUP leader Reg Empey put it, “every time unionism walks from the table it inevitably and iniably s to another table with a weaker hand”.In the early s a Minister of State based in the NIO told me: “The problem with unionism — and it’s a particular problem for those outside Northern Ireland who try to understand it — is that there are far too many ieties. They spend as much time complaining about their unionist rivals as they do complaining about their more specic political and constitutional opponents.”From until the collapse of Stormont in  the isions could mostly be controlled by the mantra — ‘United we stand. Divided we fall.’ But once the fall came there was nothing to hold unionism together and it splintered and continues to splinter.Faulkner and power-sharing were destroyed by the United Ulster Unionist Council in . Shortly afterwards the ious members of the UUUC — who couldn’t come up with an agreed alternative to the Sunningdale deal — turned on themselves.The UUP descended into civil war between -. The loyalist paramilitary groups, essential to the ‘selling’ of the Good Friday Agreement, have now withdrawn support for it. The DUP has had a horrible  months and is still beset with internal dficulties.A growing element of younger loyalism is pushing its anti-protocol campaigning towards prioritising the final collapse of the GFA institutions. And Jeffrey Donaldson and Jim Allisterhave laid down pre-election preconditions on both the protocol and the eventuality of a Sinn Fein First Minister.Change a few names and organisations and we could be talking about that period from March  to May  — when unionism and loyalism were struggling to find a route map from the crisis forced on them by widespread political societal instability and British governments which were determined to impose change upon them.But here’s the reality:the strategies and policies adopted by unionists didn’t work back then, why does anyone think terribly similar strategies and policies would work today: particularly when the constitutional crisis is worse now than then and the shadow of a border poll is hanging over every aspect of the coming election.A British state paper released in  had this assessment of the  Assembly election: ‘Mr Faulkner’s position is undoubtedly dficult. He will have less than half of the Protestant vote behind him, as Dr Paisley and others will no doubt vocerously remind him,and when he makes an effort to work the new system.“It was always to be anticipated that the Protestant vote would be fragmented… but the outcome has left the potential accepters weaker and the ‘wreckers’ stronger than expected.’Something very similar happened to David Trimble in , allowing his internal and external opponents to destroy him. Might the same thing be about to happen to Jeffrey Donaldson  Between  and  the DUP vote represented a majority of unionist votes cast — but even then, the party had to temper a lot of decisions and steer away from potential compromises and concessions. If the DUP doesn’t represent the majority of unionist votes cast and seats won in the Assembly on May  it will make it very dficult for Donaldson to reboot the executive.We seem to be on ‘the more things change, the more they stay the same’ territory for unionism. Again. But there is one dference. I was in that crowd in the grounds of Stormont on March , , a few months short of my th birthday.I recognised the scale of the shock: but I also recognised something , a new opportunity for unionism to do things dferently. My big fear today — and I’m very pessimistic, by the way, about a rebooted Assembly— is that unionism may have left it too late to do things dferently.Related topicsIRAAlliance PartyBoris JohnsonSir Jeffrey DonaldsonNorthern Ireland AssemblyUlster Unionist PartySinn FéinMore On IRA PremiumAllison MorrisOpinionQuashing of Soldier F decision is a rare good day for Bloody Sunday families and also signicant for historic prosecutionsUkrainian soldiers study IRA #Green Book# in preparation for guerrilla warfare against Russian forces PremiumNew IRA on its last legs, but dying wasp can still have a sting PremiumAllison MorrisOpinionDowngrading of danger welcome news, but violence remains a real possibility PremiumAidan McAnespie: Trial of former soldier could be last Troubles criminal caseMost ReadMark Sykes’ ‘no-brainer’ decision to play for Republic of Ireland as dad hits back at ‘bigot’ accusations with Belfast star in line to bridge  year gapDodgy east Belfast botox beautician must pay back £kAmazing space: £k Co Down home sure to attract the crowds to Killinchy RoadReids Shoes of Sandy Row goes up for sale for £, to mark the end of an eraSam McBrideOpinionWhy we all may be paying more for electricity thanks to Stormont failures and a little-known monopoly companyTop VideosPlayWalkthrough of Kincora boys# home in east Belfast PlayIrish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney evacuated from north Belfast event due to security alertPlayKincora abuse victim tells of his torment at the home Latest PoliticsGail WalkerOpinionIf Stormont worked, the NI Protocol would be settled and we’d have the ‘best of both worlds’… this election will make no dference to real livesLucidTalk boss defends election polling as a sign of Northern Ireland becoming ‘a normal society’Jon TongeOpinionBurnham and Rotheram united Manchester and Liverpool, so anything’s possible for BelfastViewpointOpinionNothing will be gained by scare tacticsMallon labels DUP ‘a party of irrational mood swings’LatestTwo arrested as police probe security alert in BelfastPolice hunting for prisoner on the run in underwear warn of changed appearanceIan Baraclough wants Northern Ireland’s all-action forwards to add composureZelensky demands more courage from the West in helping Ukraine fight, schoolchildren off due to Covid as more detail on free testing promised,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Ballynahinch scheme represents excellent value for money and should have been prioritised during the past two years.Mr Hazzard said more than poundbn of capital resources has been spent by the roads minister and her department during the letime of the current Assembly.ldquoIt is hugely disappointing that a small, yet strategically important scheme, such as the Ballynahinch bypass has been left on the shelf. In light of the economic impact of Covid- and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the commencement of this scheme would have been a welcome step towards improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of the local community, said the MP.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWe can only hope now that when the Executive is restored after Mayrsquos election, that the local community can have a minister in place who recognises the value of the Ballynahinch bypass and finally begins construction.Mr Casement said the bypass could help kick-start the economic regeneration of the town and provide the wider South Down tourism economy with a signicant boost. He said it was vital a start date for construction work is confirmed as soon as possible.A key member of Ballynahinchrsquos Regeneration Committee for many years alongside the late Vincent Fullam, Mr Casement has never given up the battle to secure a bypass, which was first mooted in the late s.ldquoThe bypass is included in a list of strategic projects and is effectively ready to proceed. There should be no more delays. The scheme should have been delivered years ago, he declared.ldquoWhile the primary focus of the bypass is on easing traffic congestion, there are many other benefits, including reduced town centre pollution.Mr Casement added: ldquoThe new road scheme will also dissuade drivers from using built-up housing areas and rural roads as unofficial bypasses and, most importantly, help kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre. We need to see work starting on the scheme now.A Department for Infrastructure spokesman said it was committed to delivering the bypass as part of a plan to aid economic recovery and community transformation, while addressing regional imbalance.He said that ldquofar from being left on the shelf, the scheme was being actively progressed much further by Ms Mallon than any other minister, with development work now substantively complete and statutory approvals finalised in July last year.ldquoThe next stage would involve commencing the procurement of a contractor but progression to procurement and construction is dependent upon the level of funding made available to the Department in future budgets, he explained.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos bid for the - budget included funds to deliver this scheme, however, the absence of an Executive means there is no agreed budget which means that delivery timescales remain uncertain.The spokesman added: ldquoThis is a priority for our Minister who remains frustrated that once again the absence of an Executive is negatively affecting both the people of Northern Ireland and our infrastructure..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Carryduff landowner helps the environment with trees  ","story":"CARRYDUFF landowner Rosanna Ballentine and her son Iain have received  trees to plant on their farm to help them enhance bioersity and create a habitat for wildle.The trees have been supplied from a partnership between Trees on the Land ndash a charity and not-for-profit project from the Green Economy Foundation ndash and SuperValu and Centra, part of the Musgrave Group.The project is part of a sustainability initiative from the retail brands which recently announced they will plant , trees across Northern Ireland over ten years.Mrs Ballentine welcomed the initiative and the assistance of SuperValu and Centra staff, along with central colleagues from Musgrave NI, who pulled on their wellies and visited the farm to help plant a mix of hawthorn, oak, birch, rowan and hazel trees.She said: ldquoWe are planting a new native hedgerow and a line of trees along the edge of an existing woodland to ide it from an adjoining agricultural grassland.

crowned Bobby Dalzell Cup champions after defeating local rivals Ardglass in the deciding penalty shoot-out at Meadowvale last Thursday.A goal on the stroke of half-time from Ardglass midfielder Stephen Deegan was cancelled out on  minutes by the close range effort of Celtic striker Jordan McCoubrey.The teams refused to be split in extra-time and following the shoot-out mdash which went well into the sudden death stages mdash Blaine Connolly converted the all-important spot kick to gt his Hoopsrsquo side the victory.A large crowd turned out in Drumaness for the St Patrickrsquos Day showpiece between the current first and second-placed sides in the Newcastle Leaguersquos Premier Division.Adding to the pressure of the occasion was the alternating weather conditions, with the teams contesting the final in periods of sunshine as well as wind and rain.Nevertheless, Celtic kicked off the affair with the blustery conditions heavily in favour of their opponents.It didnrsquot take long for the tone of the match to be set as Ardglass defender Caolain OrsquoShea launched a very physical tackle on Hoops striker Jay Gibney.Ardglass enjoyed early momentum with experienced defender Neil Teggart seeing his wind-assisted free kick from his own half trouble Celtic custodian Nathan Curran less than ten minutes in.Celtic remained calm and soon strung their passes together through clever one touch football with eventual man of the match winner Conor Doherty in the thick of these sequences.However, Ardglass remained a threat and came close when Teggart clipped a cross into the danger area, although striker Michael Magee glanced his header wide.Stand-in Celtic captain Shaun Megahey attempted to play a through ball to team-mate Gibney, but on this occasion the Ardglass defence timed the offside trap perfectly.Celtic did come close when Barry Treacyrsquos corner kick was fumbled by Ardglass lsquokeeper, Mark Armstrong, although Hoops defender Paul Brady couldnrsquot dispatch the ball quickly enough before the danger was cleared.OrsquoShea continued his earlier eagerness and picked up a yellow card for a mistimed tackle before his team-mate, Magee, was unfairly clattered at the other end of the pitch, although Teggartrsquos effort flew past the wrong side of the post.Teggart continued to be a problem from set pieces as his free-kick delivery whisked past the head of striker Magee and out of bounds.Moments later, Mageersquos misfortune continued when he was shown a yellow card for expressing his disagreement with referee, Barry Mullan.After initially allowing the match to flow freely, referee Mullan clamped down on his decisions with less than ten minutes to the end of the opening half.Celtic defender Gary Carberry was the latest to enter the book for a late challenge on Ardglass marksman Magee.Despite this hiccup, Celticrsquos Carberry kept himself in contention for the man of the match accolade after he proved pivotal in stopping potential goalscoring chances from the Ardglass opposition on numerous occasions.As the half-time whistle approached, Celtic arms were raised as they appealed for the red card to be shown to Ardglassrsquos OrsquoShea, who may have considered himself lucky to escape an early bath after he was second to the ball.Ardglass launched another attack and it looked asMagee would have a free route to goal. However, Celtic veteran Brady recovered valiantly to prove he still has plenty of miles left in his tank.With the last attack of the half, Ardglass were awarded a corner and they took full advantage of their opportunity. Midfielder, Stephen Deegan, climbed high above the rest to head his effort beyond the outstretched hand of Celtic lsquokeeper Curran to open the scoring.As the second half kicked off it was evident that both sides would refrain from going for broke. A lot of the following ten minutes contained attacks, although both sides lacked a killer instinct and the match was heavily contested in the middle of the pitch.This is where Conor Doherty earned his post-match award for his performance, as he often won the midfield battle.Goal-scorer Deegan picked up a yellow as the weather took yet another turn for the worse.Celtic joint-managers Jason Galbraith and Matthew McKenna made the first of their substitutions as the clock struck the hour mark with Sean McMahon entering the fray in place of Conaill Kerr.Ardglass opted to put  men behind the ball in order to frustrate the opposition and waited patiently for their opportunity to counter-attack.Ardglass made changes of their own in the form of Jordan Finnegan before Celtic made a second substitute with the talented Sean Ferris making his way onto the pitch.Ferris made an immediate impact, adding another string to Celticrsquos bow by spreading inviting passes into his forward line.With just  minutes left of the , these Celtic substitutions came to fruition after the ball found its way to McMahon, who lofted an inviting ball into the Ardglass box which was steered home by the boot of striker McCoubrey.Celtic continued to mix things up as Corey McCartan made his way onto the pitch and gave a good account of himself with his tireless work rate.Despite this period of succession for the Hoops, the remaining minutes of the  played out finely balanced.Ardglass never let their headsand should be commended for their effort as they cancelled out any further attack whilst continuously seeking the crucial next goal.As tempers flared, the final whistle sounded and both teams prepared for extra-time.The highlights of the first half of extra-time came in the form of Celticrsquos Treacy picking up a yellow card before team-mate Ferris crashed his left-footed effort off the crossbar.During the next interval, both of Ardglassrsquo Magee and Celticrsquos Ferris threatened but they couldnrsquot do enough to get the ball over the line and it would be penalties that would decide the final outcome.Amongst the numerous penalties which took place, both Celtic and Ardglass players were ordered to retake their spot kicks.Firstly, Celtic striker McCoubrey saw his effort denied by Armstrong before referee Mullan blew his whistle after adjudging the Ardglass custodian to be off his line as the penalty was taken.McCoubrey fired in the retake and it wouldnrsquot be long before Ardglass substitute Finnegan would go through a similar course of events after he missed his initial penalty but converted at the second time of asking.Eventually, as the penalties progressed well into sudden death, Celticrsquos Blaine Connolly remained calm and converted the deciding spot kick to send the Hoopsrsquo support into delirium as his side were crowned champions.Following the conclusion, man of the match Conor Doherty gave his thoughts on his sidersquos victory.ldquoI thought we were the better team in the first half but then they snuck a goal before half-time, he said.ldquoBut, even with the wind we started to press on, it was a long  minutes.ldquoIt was a hard hitting game but Irsquom just glad we got on the winning side of it.He added: ldquoAll the penalties were top class, it was a really good shootout.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey , B Connolly, P Brady, G Carberry, C

There are always more jobs to be carried out on the collection.However, using the images effectively, and in the way the Hudson and Newman families, and indeed all other donors, wished, requires wide knowledge of all the collections by experienced and qualied professional staff working with them on a daily basis.The photographic archive is recognised as one of the most important in Ireland and contains a wide range of images, including daguerrotypes, glass negative plates, lantern slides, black and white and colour film, transparencies as well as digital images.Understanding of all the processes involved in their making is essential to how they are cared for and used.Lesley Simpson is secretary of the Friends of Down County Museum and former Keeper of Collections at the museum..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Success at Downpatrick  ","story":"PRIOR to Sundayrsquos Randox Ulster National Handicap Chase meeting at Downpatrick Racecourse, manager Richard Lyttle stated that he was looking forward to welcoming racegoers back to the track for the first time in three years.They certainly turned up with car parks filled to capacity, packed enclosures and long tailbacks on the Ballydugan Road prior to the first race.The Randox Ulster National has been the local tracks major race of the year now for many years and the maximum  runners faced the starter for the three mile four furlong race that sees prize money paid right down to the first six past the post.A bit like the big Aintree race, there was plenty of fallers with two coming down at the very first fence and Envoi Pierji then unseating Donegal jockey Conor Orr, who had ridden Screaming Colours to success for Bill Durkan in the Midlands National at Uttoxeter the previous day.Later in the race there was more fallers at the regulation fence.With two fences to be taken the race involved four runners with the  winner Amaulino travelling like the winner under David McGrath.But this combination then faded, eventually finishing fourth for Co Armagh trainer Keith Watson.The eventual winner in the famous J P McManus Silks proved to be Spades Are Trumps, ridden by Cheltenham winning jockey Mark McDonagh, a lb claimer.Finishing second was Agent Born, ridden by Darragh OrsquoKeefe with Peaches and Cream third.Co Meath trainer Gavin Cromwell, who also had success at Cheltenham, saddled the winner and also the third past the post.

They were used as a commercial rabbit warren when John De Courcy arrived and built Dundrum Castle in .The lucrative trade in rabbit pelts continued for centuries afterwards. Rabbits are still common today, although the population was decimated by the myxomatosis disease in the s.The s was also when the National Trust began managing the habitat on behalf of its owners, the Hill family mdash commonly known as the Marquises of Downshire.The Hill family came to the area in the late th century but had lived in Ireland since the late s, when a young army officer named Moyses Hill, originally from Devon, was posted to Carrickfergus garrison in  to command forces sent by Elizabeth I to subdue the rebellious OrsquoNeill clan and colonise Ireland.Moyses ended up staying in Ireland and marrying the sister of a local clan chief. In , he was granted land at Cromlyn, an area which later took his surname and became known as Hillsborough. His descendants then acquired Murlough in  and began using Murlough Farm as their summer residence.They built Murlough House in , which still stands today at the end of Keel Point mdash at the northern end of the beach. While built to have a spectacular sea view, stormy weather kept breaking the windows, so trees were planted around the house in , and the woodland remains to this day.In , the th Marquis of Downshire, Arthur Hill, sold the surrounding land to the National Trust and then sold the house in . The area became Irelandrsquos first nature reserve in  and remains the most extensive dune heath in Ireland .But prior to being sold to the National Trust, Murlough House and the dunes were a hotbed of military activity ndash particularly during WWII. The house was a base for the US Armyrsquos st Armoured Division and the th Tank Destroyer Battalion.They built several firing ranges in the dunes, including, allegedly, a mortar range. Spare bombers and fighters were also hidden there as Murlough Farm had its own landing strip, called lsquo Satellite Landing Groundrsquo .Murlough beach itself was dotted with anti-aircraft and anti-invasion posts mdash whose rotting remnants are still visible today. They were dug-in when a full-scale German invasion was a threat in the early s.They were part of a counter-invasion strategy that centred on slowing or stopping the enemy at certain locations until other forces could be mustered and deployed. This involved constructing a so-called lsquocoastal crustrsquo along beaches and inland lsquostop-linesrsquo along rivers, canals and high ground.With Northern Ireland being prime invasion territory, a coastal crust was set up from Magilligan in the north-west to Newcastle in the south-east, alongside an inland stop-line along the route of the River Bann. Anti-aircraft landing posts, like those at Murlough, were important in preventing aircraft or boats from landing, but another type of defence was the centrepiece of this strategy: pillboxes.When events at Dunkirk in  sparked invasion panic, the Directorate of Fortications and Works at the War Office was created to construct defensive systems around the UKrsquos beaches. The Royal Engineers and civilian contractors erected over , pillboxes by in a matter of days ndash including on eight of Northern Irelandrsquos beaches.Such structures can still be seen at Magilligan, Portrush and Portstewart. County Down also has intact examples in Bangor, Donaghadee and on the Strangford shore between Comber and Newtownards. Beaches at Minerstown and Tyrella also had multiple pillboxes, as did Murlough. They were spaced to have interlocking arcs of fire, so invaders had little unchallenged space in which to land.One of these pillboxes is still visible in Newcastle, on the beach just below the outdoor swimming pool. The remnants of the other are still visible at the northern end of Murlough, next to the inlet that feeds Dundrum Bay. Yet all that is left are large slabs of reinforced concrete as this pillbox was supposedly destroyed in the early days of the Troubles to prevent it being used to attack the nearby Ballykinlar Army Camp.But these remains are now also under attack from erosion. They are gradually being absorbed by the sea. With this stretch of coastline losing five to ten metres of coastline a year, the remnants of the pillbox, originally built at an elevated height in the dunes, is even starting to be submerged at high tide.What was once a reflection of an indominable spirit is now an unassuming pile of rubble used only as a seat for resting walkers ndash most of whom are unaware of its history. Soon, it will be completely forgotten and the only reminder of this stretch of coastlinersquos rich military history will be the occasional washed-up ordnance.Ben Acheson spent seven years deployed to Afghanistan, including stints as Director of NATOrsquos political team and as Political Adviser to the EU Special Representative.

HELEN MCGURK talks to its creator, Jay OsmondBy Helen McGurkFriday, th March , : pm  \"       \"  Jay Osmond in Belfast for the launch of The Osmonds: A New Musical at the Grand Opera House“Our song Crazy Horses was banned in South Africa because they thought it was about drugs. I said, ‘Really  C’mon, we’re The Osmonds.” laughs Jay Osmond, flashing that famous toothsome megawatt Osmonds smile.The fourth youngest of the nine-strong Osmond family, sees the absurdity of the accusation because as everyone knows, the Mormon minstrels were a famously squeaky-clean band of brothers, eschewing rock and roll’s twin evils of drink and drugs, to produce wholesome, harmony-drenched pop tunes.Jay Osmond, , is in Belfast to talk about his upcoming show The Osmonds: A New Musical at the Grand Opera House.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

That’s why it’s so fast-paced.“It’s not a concert or a tribute band show, or even a juke box musical. I take people on a musical journey through what it was like from my point of view. It’s about the ups and downs, the highs and lows, the good times, the bad times. So much happens.”ALL THE HITS The musical features a chart-topping list of anthems including Love Me For A Reason, Let Me In, Puppy Love, One Bad Apple, Long Haired Lover From Liverpool, Paper Roses and many more, taking audiences back to relive the s, s and s.“It’s like a time machine. People say it makes them feel like  again,” he says. Jay was the drummer for the family quintet. He also shared lead vocals on the hard rock, musically ergent, Crazy Horses, which was about gas-guzzling cars, rather than narcotics. According to Jay, his father George, a World War II veteran, was the “backbone” of the group and he wishes he, and his mother Olive, were still alive to see the musical.“The hardest part of this show is how to portray my father. Mother was pretty easy because she was always positive and very upbeat.“My father was an army sergeant and he was a good disciplinarian, but he wasn’t abusive in any way. He was very strong and tender at the same time. My father was a great man. He’s been the most dficult one to cast for.”George Osmond instilled a firm set of values in his children - faith, family and career - in that order. “Whenever we were up against anything it was always in that priority system. And we had a voting system and a way of working out problems.”There are scenes in the musical which Jay still gets emotional watching. “A lot of people don’t know what we were up against as a family. There’s one scene where we have a family meeting - and without giving too much away, it’s really tough... you can hear a pin drop, it’s so quiet when the audience is listening.“You wouldn’t believe some of the obstacles we overcame as a family. It would have broken most families in a normal situation.” CLEAN-LIVING The Osmonds’ vocal harmonising is technically on the same level as the Beach Boys and the Beatles . Unfortunately, they weren’t take as seriously as those bands. Did their devout faith prevent them being a credible musical force “We were up against nightmare stuff. We were told even back in the s that we would never make it in rock n roll because we didn’t smoke or drink or take drugs,” says Jay. “But, my father said persistence and determination are the two keys that make success and that’s we did, we persisted and were determined. This musical shows how hard we worked.” His brothers Donny and Merrill have seen clips of the show and have given it their seal of approval. “I received an email the other day from Donny and he said ‘I am blown away - especially with the reviews’. He said ‘I knew you could to it’.“Then I got one about a month go from Merill saying ‘Proud of you, Jay’.“Five years ago when the producer came to me with the ideaI went to my brother Merrill and said I think this is really amazing, we have a great opportunity to tell our story, but he couldn’t because of a project he was working on, but he said ‘I know you can do it’.“At first I was a little depressed about it because I never thought I could do this on my own, I always had a brother to do things with me, but it’s amazing how it’s come out. “After five years of seeing it on paper, and then to see your le acted out on stage, how surreal that was to me, and still is.”The whole process, he says, has been a kind of “therapy” for him. “And thank goodness for my journals. My mother was adamant about us writing in journals.”It’s been a long road to get the musical from concept to stage, but Jay is clearly chuffed with the result. “I think of all the projects I have ever done, this is the one I am most pleased with,” he says, that signature Osmond smile lighting up the room.The Osmonds: A New Musical, opens at the Grand Opera House, on April .

Such dedication is a hallmark of the Northern Ireland football captain’s career and has led her to making history with her squad as they head to the Women’s Euro  finals. But ahead of Mother’s Day she also has an inspiring, important message for the next generation of female sporting stars - being both mother and top athlete is possible.Marissa said: “It’s so important for women in sport to know thatthey want to have kids it can happen. That women do believe it is possible to have kids and have a career in sport.”   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

On our team we have Sarah McFadden, and she has a wee girl Harper, . She came back and played an international match three months after she gave birth. “It’s raising the awareness and telling the stories that it is possible so we can inspire the next generation of women in sport.”Growing up in west Belfast in a time when an international women’s football side wasn’t even in existence, never mind a possibility, it’s little wonder the passionate player has become a role model for women in sport and for the next generation of female athletes.“I do take pride in inspiring the next generation of girls coming up,” said Marissa.“Football has given me so much in my journey, I love to show young girls that it’s a great sport to be in. But not just football but any sport – the le lessons you learn – you can’t put a price on it. “Football’s my passion and I just want to let young girls know that football is great for your mental and physical health. I don’t know where I would be without it.”However, despite great strides being made in sport the statistics show there is still work to do. A signicant gap between men and women taking part in sport still exists, with women less likely to have taken part in sport at least once within the last year, %, than men, %. Unfortunately, according to Sport NI figures this gap gets wider on our sidelines with women representing just .% of the overall sports coaching workforce in Northern Ireland and this dropping to just % for those who coach our World, Olympic or Paralympic medallists.To help close this gap Sport NI recently launched their Women In Sport Panel that sees women from dferent sporting backgrounds offering their expertise on how to overcome barriers and create more opportunities for women and girls at all levels of sport.Marissa believes that listening to women and funding in sport are key factors in closing the gap.“It’s so important to listen to women from all levels of sport to be able to improve experiences and see what we can do better. This  also gives visibility to women who are in sport, coaching, leadership, and governance levels. That is so very important for females to see these real-le scenarios and see that it’s possible to achieve these roles.”Marissa points to Angela Platt, Irish Football AssociationDirector of Women’s Football and Women In Sport Panel member, as an inspiring example.“It is very powerful to have a female in the director’s role and to have that role created for the first time, especially as football is still very male dominated,” she said.The Cltonville player coach, who is mum to Quinn, , seems to have found the enviable balance between family le and her job on the pitch. She’s quick to credit her supportive partner Paula and the recent funding from the IFA, sponsors, and the Department for Communitiesfor helping make that work – le balance happen.“In January we got fully funded to train professionally. So those who were working fulltime got put on secondment and are training up at Newforgefulltime,” she explained.It means that Marissa’s job as the IFA’s Girls’ Participation Officer has been put on hold until September, after the World Cup qualiers next month and the Euros in July. “That has been a massive gamechanger for me.”Not only is it allowing Marissa, and the rest of the women’s international team to concentrate on their game, but for the captain she’s getting precious time with her little boy.“I’m able to drop him off and pick him up at creche. We get home, make dinner and have normal family le. Whereas before we got the investment to go fulltime you were working in your day job and were out most evenings. My partner was doing an awful lot whereas now it’s nice to have that family time. “I’m fortunate to have a supportive partner there who understands what it means to play at this level. Obviously, we go away a lot so that can be tough. “But at the same time, I know that I do it for the love of the game – it’s my thing. For our Quinn, I just think it will be amazing for him to look back on. I know he’s only two now but at least I’ll have a great story to tell him. It’s better for him to believe he can do anything.“We as the women’s international team have made our dreams come true in what we have achieved. I think it’s important for him to see his mum achieve what we have achieved and hopefully that will inspire him when he’s older.”As Quinn chats away in the background Marissa reveals he’s already showing some promise with his feet.“Quinn loves football. We have footballs of all sizes and shapes here. He’s ‘mama football’ and we play away. He does associate football with me so when football is on TV, he’s ‘mama, mama.’”As for now Marissa is the first to admit she’s “living the dream”.She has the Euros to look forward to and the World Cup qualiers coming up against Austria, April , and England, April .“We’re solely focused on getting into that squad and getting the squad prepared for those big games. They’re two unbelievable sides and two massive games so we have to make sure we’re fully ready for it,” she added.“The momentum we’ve built here within the women’s game here is incredible. If you look back three years ago, we would have had maybe  people watching us play. Obviously off the back of our success and qualying for the Euros there are over , tickets sold for the England game at Windsor. “It’s really hard to believe. I definitely think it’ll be an emotional day when we’re there at Windsor with that many fans.“There’s a lot to look forward to.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

So, when you ask meI get itI didn’t get it we would not have set the ambition of changing the Protocol,” he said.Speaking just  hours before a loyalist paramilitary bomb scare forced Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney to abandon a speech in north Belfast and be whisked away by police to a secure location, Mr Burns condemned any moves to violently resist the Protocol.“This society has not thrived when threats of violence are used to achieve a political objective.”On the continued existence of the Protocol in its present form where more than  EU rules now govern Northern Ireland’s economic and commercial le, Mr Burns said: “I have to say that we cannot go on indefinitely and one of the things that everyone who is engaged with the European Commission and the EU member states on this has been clear - the Protocol is not currently commanding cross-community support here in Northern Ireland. “And when something is not broadly accepted by both traditions here it is rarely a good thing for Northern Ireland. A change there has to be and we have also been incredibly clear, the Secretary of Statehas made this clear, the PM has made this clear, Liz Truss has made it clear that we have been very concerned that the application of the Protocol was having a de-stabilising effect on the governance and the stability here in Northern Ireland, and there needs to be change.”The Minister of State said he knows that the EU’s chief negotiator on the Protocol Maros Sefcovic has been warned about this de-stabilisation during his visits to the Province.He denied that the Government’s eyes were off the Protocol ball now that it is dealing with the war in Ukraine and its consequences for European and global security. Mr Burns also insisted that the Government was still prepared to trigger Article  which could put a temporary stop to the Protocol and its outworkings.A close ally of Boris Johnson, the Minister said: “The Prime Minister wants the EU to undertand that we did not use Article  as an act of good faith to show we want to get a sustainable and lasting solution. I hope the EU are hearing us. The Prime Minister is very clear about this that there is nothing that is off the table.”Mr Burns defended the Northern Ireland Secretary’s plans for dealing with Legacy issues related to the Troubles including shting from investigations into the conflict from criminal inquiries into a truth recovery scheme.“You know the easiest thing to do on Legacy would be to do nothing and I actually think the Secretary of State and the Prime Minister deserve credit for seeking to enter this space and find a way to help this society especially for some of those most affected by the Troubles.”Reflecting on Legacy Mr Burns casts his mind back to August  and the Real IRA Omagh bomb massacre which occured during one of his visits to his relations.“I remember being in my grandma’s living room on the day of the Omagh bombing and finding out that one of my cousin’s children was in Omagh that day. There was this absolutely overwhelming sense of fear especially when all the lines to Omagh went down as we tried to get through.”He still sees most of his family the majority of whom are very comfortable with their Catholic cousin being a British minister arguing for the merits of the Union. Only two relations who are republicans have made it clear they do not wish to see him, Mr Burns said.“Let’s just say they are not paid up members of the Tory No Turning Back group,” he added.A past pupil of the Christian Brothers run Park Lodge Primary School on Belfast’s Antrim Road, he revealed that he once considered entering the priesthood.He cited the late Pope John Paul II alongside Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan as both his heroes and his reason to join the Tory Party even before he turned  because of their “defence of the values of inidual freedom” against the Soviet Union during the Cold War.Mr Burns came out as gay in his mid s and acknowledges that it was Tony Blair and New Labour who “turbo charged social change” to in turn liberalise attitudes towards gay people in the Conservative Party.He describes himself as having a “multi-facted identity. I am a Catholic, I am gay, I support the Union, I am a Conservative, I would still call myself a Thatcherite, I am Northern Irish, I am Irish, I am British.” More from the News Letter:Click here: Detectives call for information to help crack notorious murder case which saw Protestant minister beaten with nail-studded bats  years agoClick here: Protest at Belfast factory over ‘ludicrous nature of arms trade’ with equipment built by Thales being used by both Ukraine AND RussiaClick here: Plan unveiled for huge expansion of Co Antrim village bringing hundreds of new residentsClick here:Joe Biden tells St Patrick’s Day gathering: I may be Irish but I’m not stupid——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

It will still be available to support the small group for whom it is recommended for clinical reasons. The PCR home ordering service will remain available for the general public to support those for whom PCR is recommended.– Publicly accessible Covid- testing sites will close. Local health and social care trusts will continue to provide PCR testing to support clinical care.– Those with symptoms will be advised to use lateral flow devicesto test instead of booking a PCR.– Routine asymptomatic testing will continue to be advised for those living, working and visiting health and social care settings, including hospitals and care homes and other high risk settings.– Asymptomatic LFD testing for the wider population will cease. Access to free LFDs for this purpose will cease.– Routine asymptomatic workplace testing will cease.– Routine asymptomatic testing in most educational settingswill cease at the Easter break.– Asymptomatic testing in special schools will continue after Easter and will be kept under review. It may continue until the end of June.– Routine population contact tracing will be phased out between mid-April and the end of June.Chief Medical Officer Sir Michael McBride said: “We will continue throughout the transition phase to support and protect our most vulnerable.“After these changes are introduced from April , I would urge people to check on NI Directtesting remains recommended for them – for examplethey are eligible for new treatments.“In the coming weeks, the department will also be working to provide advice and support to those eligible for treatments. It is particularly important that those who are at higher risk of serious illness follow the guidance on getting tested.“The tools at our disposal to protect people who are at higher risk from Covid- have advanced considerably since the early days of the pandemic.“Alongside the vaccine and booster programme, new Covid- treatments continue to be used by patients in Northern Ireland and new treatments are in development.“As the amount of testing across society reduces, our behaviour and actions have an even more important role in preventing transmission and keeping others safe.“I urge everyone to continue to follow the public health guidance, including continuing to wear a face covering in enclosed settings like public transport and when visiting hospitals and care homes.”Robin SwannNorthern IrelandPCR  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularMothers Day : When is Mother’s Day  Why is the date dferent in the UK and why does it change every year WATCH: Crowd cheers for the destruction of the  Belfast Agreement at loyalist rallyUDA probe: PSNI welcome sentences handed down to father and son after drugs seizureIrish League football legend David Jeffrey ‘giving up the day job’Bryson dubs Simon Coveney a ‘meddling aggressor’ saying the Dublin government ‘swans around NI asthey own the place’Most PopularBest patio heaters UK : weatherproof electric heaters and coal firepits, from Made, Wayfair, ConranNI Running prodigy Emer McKee sets new world record at -yearsBest walking shoes for women UK : ladies’ hiking shoes from Merrell, Keen, Scarpa and OnRod Stewart tour : when tickets go on sale for extra UK dates - including London, Glasgow and BirminghamBest head torches UK : bright, reliable head torches for camping, hiking, and mountaineering                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

A plan to redevelop the venue into a ,-capacity stadium has been beset by delay and controversy.The contents of the letter provoked a backlash from other executive parties, including UUP MLA Mike Nesbitt who claimed Mr Lyons was acting prematurely in discounting support for the bid, and Sinn Fein’s John Finucane who said a “can do attitude” was needed.However, a Department for Economy spokesperson later told the News Letter that “departmental officials remain involved in the process,” and added: “The Minister fully supports our involvement in any bid, but, as Northern Ireland enters the pre-election period it will be for a new Executive to formally agree our participations.“While there are clearly obstacles in place at the moment, the Minister is confident these can be overcome.” Gordon LyonsNorthern IrelandIrelandDUPGAA  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularMothers Day : When is Mother’s Day  Why is the date dferent in the UK and why does it change every year WATCH: Crowd cheers for the destruction of the  Belfast Agreement at loyalist rallyUDA probe: PSNI welcome sentences handed down to father and son after drugs seizureIrish League football legend David Jeffrey ‘giving up the day job’Bryson dubs Simon Coveney a ‘meddling aggressor’ saying the Dublin government ‘swans around NI asthey own the place’Most PopularBest patio heaters UK : weatherproof electric heaters and coal firepits, from Made, Wayfair, ConranNI Running prodigy Emer McKee sets new world record at -yearsBest walking shoes for women UK : ladies’ hiking shoes from Merrell, Keen, Scarpa and OnRod Stewart tour : when tickets go on sale for extra UK dates - including London, Glasgow and BirminghamBest head torches UK : bright, reliable head torches for camping, hiking, and mountaineering                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMr Drakeford was speaking while defending the news that compulsory mask-wearing in shops and on public transport in Wales will end on Monday - despite cases rising due to a new iant of the virus.During a press conference this lunchtime, Mr Drakeford said that, while people will no longer be legally required to wear masks on public transport or in retail settings from Monday, the Welsh Governments ‘strong advice’ would be to continue to wear them.He also confirmed that from the same date, there will be no legal requirement to self-isolate after testing positive for the virus, and issued the same ‘strong advice’ that people should do it.He said to help with people continuing to isolate, the £ isolation payment for families on low incomes would remain in place until June and that free lateral flow testing for people who think they have symptoms will also remain available.When askednow was the right time to do this considering the increase in cases relating to the BA strain of covid – which Mr Drakeford called “more transmissible than the omicron iant” – the first minister responded that it had previously been planned to end all restrictions in this weeks review, but he and his cabinet felt they were unable to do so due to the increase in cases.He likened the move to other viruses including measles.“We have to manage it like we would other conditions,\" he said. \"If you have measles, you wouldn’t go to work with it. That’s not law, it’s what is right.”He also called on the public to be sensible and use what they have learnt over the past two years. Mr Drakeford said: “For a disease that is moving from being pandemic to endemic, the public response has to move as well.“Because the cases are higher than expected, we are not able to move beyond that place and that is why we have not fully removed the restrictions..remove“People are able to do the right thing from their experience of two years of the virus and our strong advice as well.”MORE NEWS:Mr Drakeford also highlighted how, unlike in Wales, it was never a legal requirement to self-isolate after a positive covid test in Scotland, and yet isolation levels were not reported to be lower compared to other nations.He also urged employers to not force their staff into workthey test positive after the self-isolation period ends.“No employer should put their staff in that position,\" he said. \"They shouldn’t do it for all the public health reasons, but they shouldn’t do it for their business either.”He continued: “If you force an employee to go in, all that will happen is more people will get infected and then the business will be infected and affected.”What are the changes From Monday, March , it will not be a legal requirement to wear masks on public transport and in retail settings, although it is still strongly advised.From the same date, it will not be a legal requirement to self-isolate after testing positive, but again it is strongly advised.The £ isolation payment for low-income families will continue until June. It is hoped that this will continue furtherit is needed and the funds from the UK government allow.Free lateral flow tests will be available in Wales until around June but it is hoped they will be available longer depending on UK government funding.You must still wear a mask in all health and social care settings unless exempt.Businesses must continue to carry out risk assessments and implement measures to prevent covid spreading as much as possible.Bosses should not force employees who have tested positive for covid to go into work.Teachers, staff and secondary school pupils should wear continue to wear masks for the rest of the term.The next review will take place on Thursday, April . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

It requires huge determination because you leave yourself one on one at the back.“We’re willing to do that because we just don’t want to be in a low block defending against them.“You could play them mid-block and end up in a low block and not get out because they’re that good, and then it’s a slow death.“We’re not having that, we don’t want that.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityA year that the Three Lions hope to end in glory at the Lusail Stadium on December  got under way with a testing - comeback win against Switzerland at Wembley on Saturday evening.Breel Embolo opened the scoring for the side ranked th in the world and England rode their luck at times before Luke Shaw equalised and skipper Harry Kane converted a match-winning penalty.Southgate mixed callow players with experienced internationals in the Wembley friendly and plans to switch things around as preparations for Qatar continue against Ivory Coast on Tuesday.A winning start to a big year for the #ThreeLions 👊 pic aQWpTfWD— EnglandMarch , “We’ll make changes,” the England boss said. “We think that’s the right thing to do.“We want to keep all of the squad involved. I think that has been a strength for us. Players who come in perform well at the level and the team march on.“They need to feel that we’ve got the confidence in them to go into any game and we’re also at a stage of the season where their load is heavy and we’ve got to make sure we try and navigate that in the best way possible.”Southgate has already seen six players withdraw from the England squad and there are question marks over Emile Smith Rowe and John Stones, with the former absent against Switzerland and the latter pulling up in the warm-up. vw,vw,px, px\"Emile Smith Rowe has won two England caps “With John, he just felt a bit of tightness before the game,” he said. “We’re certain it’s not too serious.“It could be that he’s OK before Tuesday but we didn’t really have time before the game to assess properly so there was no point in taking a risk at that moment and we will find out a bit more .“Emile did some work with the fitness team today so there’s a chance he’ll do some of the training session . He is the only other one we have got any flags on.”.removeSouthgate hopes to have the pair available for England’s final scheduled friendly before the World Cup gets under way in November – and last match before finding out their group opponents in Friday’s draw. vw,vw,px, px\"England captain Harry Kane scores the match-winning penalty against Switzerland “I think the whole thing was a really worthwhile exercise for us and that’s why you want that quality of opposition,” he said of Switzerland as attention turns to the Ivorians’ arrival.“We could take lower level teams but you don’t learn anything and actually we want to be stretched, we need to be stretched. It puts your record at risk but that’s not important, really.“We’re trying to do well in tournaments and I think with the Nations League as we’ll have had more competitive games than any previous generation, so that means sometimes you come unstuck but I think in the long-term you are better for it.”That pursuit of progress saw Southgate reach a milestone on Saturday, with the debuts of Marc Guehi, Kyle Walker-Peters and Tyrick Mitchell meaning he has now used  players as England manager.💯🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 pic CWhApZvKS— EnglandMarch , “I’m not sure whether that’s a good or bad thing but we‘ve certainly never turned down an opportunity to give players a chance,” the Three Lions boss said.“I’ve tried to look at the future when we’ve made those types of decisions – players that there is time for and the investment might come short-term, mid-term or it might be in a few years’ time.“I thought Marc did exactly what I’ve seen him do. I watch him  play for Crystal Palace and sometimes he can go under the radar because he’s rarely out of position and he’s so calm, so you don’t see lunging tackles, perhaps eye-catching moments.“But he played with that discipline and assuredness. I thought he was excellent.“With Ben , a small error for the goal, just got caught off his shoulder, but to come in  minutes before the gameand be as composed as he was, the rest of his game was very, very good with and without the ball. I thought two were real positives.”Another positive against Switzerland was the performance of Jordan Pickford, who produced some important stops at a time when his place as England number one has been frequently questioned.“He’s always played well for us,” Southgate added. “He has a good focus with us, he has a very good relationship withMartyn Margetson, who I think does an excellent job with him.“He knows the structure around him, he knows clearly how we want him to play.“Look, there is competition for everybody’s position and that’s what we want. We don’t want people just sitting thinking confidently that there’s no competition. That doesn’t help a team.“I think the form of the other goalkeepers is important but he showed again today big saves in important moments.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: England boss Gareth Southgate to give others a chance against Ivory Coast article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityEducation Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said whether to overthrow Mr Putin for his invasion of Ukraine is “up to the Russian people” after the US President’s apparently unscripted call caused the White House to scramble to row back on the remark.In a highly-charged speech in Warsaw, Mr Biden appealed to Russian people directly, with comparisons between the invasion of Ukraine and the horrors of the Second World War.“For God’s sake this man cannot remain in power,” he said of the Russian president at the close of his speech. He earlier described Mr Putin as a “butcher”.As multiple rockets struck the city of Lviv near the Polish border in the west of Ukraine, Mr Biden pleaded: “If you’re able to listen – you, the Russian people, are not our enemy.”But a White House official tried to argue that the US president’s point was that the Russian leader “cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbours or the region”.“He was not discussing Putin’s power in Russia, or regime change,” the official said, before reports in the US suggested the remarks in question had not been written in advance.Richard Haass, a veteran US diplomat who is president of the Council on Foreign Relations think tank, said Mr Biden’s remarks made “a dangerous situation more dangerous” when the strategy should be focused on de-escalation.Interviewed on Sunday, Mr Zahawi said it is “for the Russian people to decide how they are governed” but suggested they “would certainly do well” to have someone who “is democratic and understands their wishes”.“That’s up to the Russian people and it is only the Russian people that can make that decision, I suspect most of them are pretty fed up with Putin and his cronies and the illegal war,” he told the BBC’s Sunday Morning show..remove vw,vw,px, px\"US president Joe Biden delivers a speech at the Royal Castle in Warsaw But he declined to criticise Mr Biden, unlike Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons Defence Committee, who said Mr Putin will now “spin this, dig in and fight harder”.AskedMr Biden was wrong to issue the call, Mr Zahawi told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: “No, what I’m saying to you is the White House has been very clear on this, the president gave a very powerful speech on this and I think both the United States and the United Kingdom agree that it’s up to the Russian people to decide who should be governing them.”The Education Secretary backed his Cabinet colleague Liz Truss in saying sanctions on oligarchs, banks and businesses could be ltedMr Putin ends the war and commits to “no further aggression”.With the Kremlin’s troops struggling, the Foreign Secretary’s comments will be seen as a possible incentive for Mr Putin to cut his losses and broker a deal with Ukraine.She told the Sunday : “Those sanctions should only come off with a full ceasefire and withdrawal, but also commitments that there will be no further aggression.“And also, there’s the opportunity to have snapback sanctionsthere is further aggression in future. That is a real lever that I think can be used.”Moscow has given an indication it could scale back its offensive to focus on what it claimed was the “main goal, liberation of Donbas”, the region bordering Russia in the east of Ukraine.But Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky warned he would not give up territory in peace talks as he noted that his troops have delivered “powerful blows” to invading forces.AskedMoscow was changing strategy to focus on the Donbas region, Mr Zahawi said that the Russian military is having “real problems” on the ground as the Ukrainians have “fought like lions”.The latest intelligence update from the Ministry of Defence said that the Kremlin’s forces “appear to be concentrating their effort to attempt the encirclement of Ukrainian forces” in the east of the country.“The battlefield across northern Ukraine remains largely static with local Ukrainian counterattacks hampering Russian attempts to reorganise their forces,” it added..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: UK distances from Biden us plea that Vladimir Putin  ucannot remain in power u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Removing free access to lateral flow tests at this point feels irresponsible.“It will make tracking and controlling Covid almost impossible. There is a lot of anxiety from school leaders about what could happen once tests are unavailable.”Ending free coronavirus testing for healthcare workers is “a disaster”, according to one health expert.Danny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College London, said it is “unfair, unkind and just not workable” to expect NHS staff to pay for their own tests.Asked how serious the risk is to the NHS of ending free testing for healthcare workers, he told Times Radio: “It’s a disaster. It’s unfair, unkind and just not workable because, you know, there are people out there who, you know, all parts of the NHS, but imagine you’re working with very clinically vulnerable patients – it would be devastating to you and to them to imagine that you might infect them with something that might kill them.“And the onus is on you to keep sourcing and paying for your own testing, because you want to do the right thing.

The Fund can provide a non-repayable grant of up to pound,, in a  month period, to remove barriers to employment. The Minister continued: “The success of the Adviser Discretion Fund in helping remove barriers to employment has already been seen throughout the year, particularly in the uptake of upfront childcare costs, which I made available last October. “I am delighted that we have already helped around  parents with average upfront childcare costs of approximately pound. “This additional scheme will help remove similar barriers to employment for those facing digital exclusion due to a lack of broadband service.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:    n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_abdbccfacaba   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fbdaebfe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
