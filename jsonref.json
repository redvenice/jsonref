This year this children in year 7 shall be included and will get their jab from health teams visiting secondary schools, DHSC said.All frontline health and social care workers will also be urged to get their free vaccine. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u0027We have outlined in our flu vaccine plans that those eligible under at risk groups – including diabetes - are to receive a flu vaccine as a priority, and we have secured additional flu vaccines for those who need them.\u0027This is the biggest flu vaccine programme in UK history and healthcare staff will work to vaccinate more than 30 million people, millions more than received it last year. Additional guidance will be provided to GPs and pharmacists on how to access them in September.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/11/21/4D24763100000578-5832217-image-a-41_1528747434431.jpg","title":"Coronavirus spread AIR buses say Chinese scientists","story":"Share this article A total of 68 passengers rode the bus for an hour and forty minutes to attend a Buddhist worship event.Twenty-four passengers tested positive for Covid-19, with 18 of them suffering \u0027moderate illness\u0027. The other six either had mild sickness or were asymptomatic.Passengers sat closest to the original patient were not more likely to get the disease than those at the opposite end of the bus.This suggests the air con played a role in picking up the viral particles and recycling them elsewhere through vents on the bus.Writing in the paper, the authors said: \u0027The investigations suggest that, in closed environments with air recirculation, SARS-CoV-2 is a highly transmissible pathogen. \u0027Our finding of potential airborne transmission has important public health significance, and future efforts at prevention and control should consider the potential for airborne spread of COVID-19.\u0027The outbreak comes on the back of warnings by British experts that so-called split AC units need to be either turned off or used with the windows open. Dr. Shaun Fitzgerald, a fellow at the Royal Academy of Engineering, said that opening a window while having the air conditioning turned on may be the best way to reduce the risk.\u0027The recommended strategy now, if you have one of these split units, is to throw the window open and sacrifice your desire for a cold or cooler environment,’ Fitzgerald told the Telegraph.‘If there is a modicum of wind it will move the air around. If you can’t open a window turn the unit off.’The Chartered Institution of Building Service Engineers warns on its website: \u0027Air conditioning units that do not have a ‘dedicated source of outside air supply into a room… could be responsible for recirculating and spreading airborne viral particles into the path of socially distanced users.\u0027 Researchers in April blamed the air conditioning unit for the spread of coronavirus among at least nine other diners who were eating in a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, in January.A research paper which appeared in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases investigated the incident at the eatery in January, where a family had arrived from Wuhan - the city where the Covid-19 pandemic began.Researchers say one member of that family had an asymptomatic case, and barely two weeks later, the patient along with nine others, including members of their family, as well as two other groups on nearby tables in the restaurant, had all become ill with the virus.The affected tables in the windowless venue were around three feet away from each other as the authors claim the most likely cause of this outbreak was droplet transmission.However, they say that droplets only remain in the air for a short time and only travel short distances.Therefore, they concluded, the air conditioner was likely to have spread the virus further between the affected tables. "},{"url":null,"title":"Londons Covid fiasco Helpline says NO home test kit drive available nearest BRADFORD","story":"\u0027Three out of the four times I was told they didn’t even have any home testing kits to send me. ‘I ended up hiring a car and just turning up to the Twickenham testing centre to see if I could chance it.‘It was completely empty and despite being told four times that I couldn’t get a test, I was tested straight away without an appointment or a wait.’ The story was the same with others complaining they were unable to get a test after ringing the helpline.Joanna North wrote online: ‘I tried to get a test in London last week.‘No postal tests available and nearest testing availability was Bradford.’Dan Allison added today: ‘Just called the coronavirus 119 number to book a test for my wife.‘Apparently no test available to send or walk ins.

Two of the suites will be ready to use in the next two months, earlier than expected. AstraZeneca will pay Oxford Biomedica £50m under the deal.AstraZeneca, which is developing the vaccine with researchers at Oxford University, said its global manufacturing capacity was close to 3bn doses.News of the deal came as AstraZeneca announced on Monday night that it had begun late-stage trials of the vaccine in the US, where it plans to enrol 30,000 adults, as part of a global programme to test the product on 50,000 people.AstraZeneca, along with US company Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech which are also developing a coronavirus vaccine, have said they could have data by October to secure approval from US regulators for emergency use of their respective products.Last week, scientists raised hopes that trials of the Oxford vaccine could have gathered enough data to show whether it works and is safe by the end of the year, before being submitted to UK regulators for approval.Britain’s other big drugmaker, GlaxoSmithKline, is also developing a coronavirus vaccine in partnership with France’s Sanofi Pasteur that is due to go into human testing this month. The UK government has bought millions of doses of both vaccines, along with the one from BioNTech and Pfizer, and another one developed by France’s Valneva.Last month, Russia approved a controversial Covid-19 vaccine – Sputnik V – for widespread use after less than two months of human testing. It said it would push ahead with large-scale manufacture, even though the World Health Organization said the vaccine should not be produced until it had completed phase 3 trials. Those final trials, involving 40,000 people, began last Wednesday. Doctors and teachers will be among the first to be offered the jab on a voluntary basis starting this month while the shot will be mandatory for military personnel.China has several potential coronavirus vaccines in late-stage testing and has been giving one of them to health workers and border officials under “emergency use” since July, according to a senior health official."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/183a6370afcf5d9966c8abba58b6f099397f477f/0_68_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46677d94f95e285c681f271d64eb2fea","title":"first day of ocado ms deliveries marred by cancellations","story":"Ocado blames a ‘surge in demand’ for delivery difficulties with Marks \u0026amp Spencer ordersOcado is facing criticism from delivery customers over last-minute order cancellations as the online grocer admitted it was struggling to cope on the first day of its new service with Marks \u0026amp Spencer.The company blamed a “surge in demand” for what it said was a “small number of cancellations” as it kicked off the partnership with M\u0026ampS, which ends nearly 20 years of delivering Waitrose groceries.Numerous shoppers said on social media that their orders had been cancelled within hours of the expected delivery despite having been booked for weeks. Some said they could not get a new delivery slot for nearly a week and others mentioned a high number of substituted items. Others said they were planning to switch to Waitrose.Another said: “Big day but you’ve cancelled my order that has been booked for 4 weeks! Long time customer who now can’t get a delivery until Sunday ... shocking service!”“My order was cancelled last night too! Really annoying – I think it’s the first cancellation in 15 years ... and on the first day of M\u0026ampS too. I’ll be going to Waitrose to do my shopping now,” another said.A spokesperson for Ocado said: “The M\u0026ampS launch has been incredibly popular. We have seen a surge in demand for M\u0026ampS products in the run-up to launch which has impacted a very small number of orders today. The vast majority of customers are unaffected and will be delivered as normal.”It offered those with missed deliveries a £30 voucher and “sincere apologies” for having to wait.The problems will be embarrassing for Ocado’s chief executive Tim Steiner, who gave a bullish interview over the weekend suggesting that Waitrose would struggle to cope with selling online once the two companies parted ways. Until Tuesday, the supermarket sold about 4,000 different product lines to Ocado but also ran its own Waitrose delivery service.Waitrose, part of the John Lewis Partnership, has almost trebled online sales through Waitrose to £1bn after building a new distribution centre and picking groceries from more stores.

Beyond that, the reduced stamp duty rates are due to end in March, and we’re likely to see a bottleneck of transactions build up in the run-up unless the government opts for an extension.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e6d482bca3fc535cbf4ce96c4ef6d6b9684ec31/0_68_953_572/master/953.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0be043bb6e75a07094a11b994598a2f9","title":"pebble pods and bubble domes six amazing places to wake up in northern ireland","story":"From quirky glampsites to boutique hotels with amazing views, discover the most enticing places to stay in Northern IrelandPebble Pods, Strangford, County DownA relatively new entry to the Northern Ireland glamping scene, but one of the most remarkable, this private location on the shores of Strangford Lough takes pod camping to a new level – and with only three two-person pods, you’ll never find it overcrowded.The glass-and-timber Pebble Pods resemble Hobbit holes, and have a host of amenities, but let’s focus on the most important: a private hot tub, thermal sauna, firepit and barbecue area, providing for year-round luxuriating by the cool waters of one of NI’s most gorgeous loughs.If you’re an active person, there are free bikes and even kayaks to help you explore the area. If you’re feeling more laid back, you can just hit the tub and let the world scurry on by.Lough Erne Resort, County FermanaghIf you’re after absolute luxury, why not go the whole hog? The sprawling, castellated Lough Erne Resort, housed on its own 243-hectare (600-acre) peninsula between the reedy shores of Lower Lough Erne and Castle Hume Lough, just outside Enniskillen, really is the last word in refinement.Starting your day with a choice between the resort’s two world-class golf courses sounds like our kind of dilemma: the Faldo course has been represented globally by local son Rory McIlroy, who holds the course record.For those who don’t have the golf bug, take heart: with an incredible Thai spa, world-class restaurants and access to the 40-mile-long splendour of Lough Erne, you’ll be fine.If it’s good enough to host the not-unpicky G8 summit (as it did in 2013), Lough Erne Resort is sure to satisfy your own exacting standards …And those who are after quality local food won’t need to look further than the resort’s Catalina restaurant, where guests can dine in luxury after a long day of exploring.Larchfield Estate, Lisburn, County AntrimIt’s fair to say Myrtle has been around for a while, seen a few tight squeezes, and is always ready with a warm welcome for her guests. Don’t worry, she’s not an over-friendly local – Myrtle is a lovingly-restored 1952 Saurer Swiss Army truck that now serves as one of Northern Ireland’s most inspiring glamping options at the gorgeous Larchfield Estate.The accommodation is suitably cosy and stylish, equipped with a log-burning stove, sun deck and a sauna housed in its own wooden pod with bucolic views of the surrounding greenery. Rise and shine after a night with Myrtle and set off to explore the 243-hectare (600-acre) estate. Mission accomplished.Killeavy Castle Estate, County ArmaghA gothic flight of fantasy built in 1836, Killeavy Castle is both grand and cosy: it features imposing medieval-style doors and turrets, yet the restored pile makes room for just four luxurious bedrooms within its castellated walls. Wake to the view from any of its 52 windows and you’ll feel like landed gentry.Elsewhere on the estate, the original mill, gatehouse and coach house have all been converted into stylish accommodation. There’s also a high-end spa, all on 142 hectares (350 acres) in the shadow of Slieve Gullion, the tallest mountain in County Armagh.Famed for its locally sourced food, Killeavy Castle Estate provides everything from sublime seven-course tasting menus to a famously good fry-up for breakfast.That’s your morning plans sorted.Palace Street Apartments, Derry-LondonderryPass through the famed city walls at the ornate Bishop’s Gate, then hang a sneaky left, and you’ll find yourself in a barely car-width street lined on one side by the kind of Victorian red brick you’d expect to see in an adaptation of Dickens.It’s also the very fitting home of the Palace Street Apartments, a lovingly restored, three-unit, self-catering gem. Step outside in the morning and you’ll find all of Derry-Londonderry at your feet. Within the confines of the old walled city, you’re only a stroll away from the historic Guildhall (as well-known for its political history as for its appearance in Derry Girls), St Columba’s Cathedral, where the original keys of the city are held, and the Diamond war memorial.That said, dark wood, oiled leather, antique furniture and deep beds come as standard in each apartment, making going outside an optional extra.Finn Lough, County FermanaghA lot has been written about the bubble domes at the eco-conscious Finn Lough resort in Fermanagh, but nothing can prepare you for the experience of waking snug and cosy in a luxury bed, and opening your eyes to see the dawn sky straight above you.These transparent domes offer uninterrupted views of the surrounding nature alongside high-end creature comforts: four-poster beds, ensuite bathrooms, and coffee machines to ease you into the morning the right way.Once you’ve recovered from the majesty of the morning there are woodland trails to explore, on foot or cycle, and a lake to linger by. There’s also a top-tier spa for those who aim simply to “sleep well, be pampered” – and who can blame them, when your bed is this spectacular?Come on over to Northern IrelandPlan your visit to Northern Ireland with everything you need to know about things to do, where to stay and more at irelandnorthern-irelandGet advice about travelling to Northern Ireland, including the latest information on Covid-19 restrictions at nidirect.gov.ukcoronavirus"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/345c28211f4ca1ea57842a60109e9d76c3d87992/0_116_6242_3745/master/6242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b59877834e5319eb717de6309ac0365b","title":"surf cycle or hike go wild on northern irelands adventure coast","story":"Where can you hike along a world-heritage coastline, ride an Atlantic wave, then cycle around a puffin colony, all within a few miles of each other? The answer is along Northern Ireland’s Causeway CoastWhether you like to explore on foot, by bike or by water, Northern Ireland’s Causeway Coast could be the most scenic part of the UK you’ve never visited. Yet its natural attractions and ersity of landscapes make it perfect for anyone with an adventurous heart.Here we pick a few of Northern Ireland’s outdoor highlights, though the full range of opportunities extend far beyond what’s mentioned here. The best advice? Book a week and discover the possibilities for yourself.Explore by footAt the tip of Northern Ireland lies its most famous attraction – the Unesco world heritage site of the Giant’s Causeway. And there’s no better way to reach it than on foot, by following an eight-mile section of the Causeway Coast Way. Begin at picturesque Ballintoy Harbour, which Game of Thrones fans will recognise as a setting for the Iron Islands. Then head west along the signed coast path, passing sandy beaches, rock arches and a ruined clifftop castle before finishing at the Giant’s Causeway. The 40,000 interlocking basalt columns provide a fitting finale to one of the best walks in Northern Ireland.For something completely different, head to nearby Glenariff Forest Park. Set within the celebrated Glens of Antrim, the scenery here transports you to another world. Expect numerous waterfalls, wooden walkways deep within river gorges, and long-distance views along chiselled glacial escarpments. Signed hiking circuits of different lengths mean there’s a route for walkers of all abilities.Explore by bikeIf two wheels are your thing, Rathlin Island offers an outing that will remain etched in your memory for years to come. Lying six miles off the coast, the trip begins with a ferry ride from Ballycastle marina. You’ll need to bring your own bike due to Covid-19 restrictions, but the island can be explored in a few hours. The highlight is the eight-mile return trip to its western tip. Here the land ends in sheer cliffs that are home to both a lighthouse and Northern Ireland’s largest breeding seabird colony. There’s no better way to break your ride than descending to the RSPB viewing platform and, if you’re here at the right time of year – between April and August – watching the antics of hundreds of thousands of nesting birds. Regardless of when you visit, the views remain breathtaking all year round, and the sensual assault of sound and smell makes the trip back to the harbour feel positively peaceful.For a longer journey, back on the mainland try the signed cycle route between the Giant’s Causeway and Benone. This 22-mile trip can be completed in either direction, and follows a mixture of public roads and traffic-free paths. The ride takes you through the coastal towns of Portrush, Portstewart and Castlerock, with numerous opportunities to explore sandy beaches or stop for refreshments along the way.Explore by waterAnother great option is to leave the land altogether, and explore the unique coastline from the sea. This is a shore littered with caves, arches, tunnels and cliffs, and the only way to appreciate them fully is from the water.Sea kayaking is a great option, with several local companies providing all the equipment and guidance you need to begin weaving silently between the headlands. Choose from a half-day or full-day excursion, with incredible coastal scenery interspersed by a snack or lunch in some tucked-away cove along the way.If you’d prefer to embrace the waves then there’s the chance to try surfing instead – the neighbouring towns of Portrush and Portstewart are the twin meccas for local surfers. Hire a wetsuit and surfboard from the back of the beach, book into a lesson, then hit the waves. Whether you’re a beginner or a pro, you’re guaranteed a great time, with watery thrills and spills all part of the fun.Novices and experts are also welcomed by the local sailing centres. Take a lesson or join a skippered yacht for a longer adventure, spending anything from an hour to a whole weekend on the water. With the emphasis on guests doing as much of the sailing as possible, it won’t be long before you know your jib from your gybe.Something differentOf course the activities mentioned here just scrape the surface of what’s available, and with a little imagination almost anything is possible. How about a catch-and-sea boat trip, where you start by going sea fishing, then return to watch a professional chef prepare your bounty, garnished by other local delicacies?Or a horse ride, featuring a gentle hack through the glens or an adrenaline-filled canter across the beach? Organised scuba ing, coasteering it’s all here, with countless options to suit all ages and abilities.So what’s keeping you away? The Causeway Coast is a goldmine of activities and opportunities, its charms are just waiting to be discovered.Due to Covid-19 restrictions, the mini-bus tour, bird sanctuary and bike hire are not currently available, for more information visit: rathlincommunity.orghomeCome on over to Northern IrelandPlan your visit to Northern Ireland with everything you need to know about things to do, where to stay and more at irelandnorthern-irelandGet advice about travelling to Northern Ireland, including the latest information on Covid-19 restrictions at nidirect.gov.ukcoronavirus"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63be55e24be6b8e39bc607ee6338c04a70fc1fa9/0_110_3624_2175/master/3624.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68a967ef9f3f9872cd8a8191bed8a7b7","title":"no 10 lobby groups democracy policy exchange","story":"Thinktanks such as Policy Exchange are working to shift power away from state institutions – into the prime minister’s officeTo accumulate power, a government with authoritarian tendencies must first destroy power. It must reduce rival centres of power – the judiciary, the civil service, academia, broadcasters, local government, civil society – to satellites of its own authority, controlled from the centre, deprived of independent action. But it must do this while claiming to act in the people’s name.So it needs an apparatus of justification: arguments that can be fed through a sympathetic press and manufactured into outrage against its rivals. This is where the intellectual work of such a government is focused.The institute, and the other lobby groups Fisher founded, honed the arguments that would be used to strip down the state, curtail public welfare and public protection, and restrict and undermine other forms of social cohesion, releasing the ultra-rich from the constraints of democracy. Unsurprisingly, some of the richest people on Earth poured cash into his project.His groups translated Hayek’s ideas, seen by many as repulsive, into a new political common sense – producing the reframings and justifications on which Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan built their revolutions.Others began to copy this model. Madsen Pirie, the founder of the Adam Smith Institute, describes in his autobiography how, using funds from 20 of the UK’s biggest companies, he helped to chart the course that Thatcher took. Every Saturday, while she was in opposition, staff from the Adam Smith Institute and the Institute of Economic Affairs sat down for lunch with Conservative party researchers, and leader writers and columnists from the Times and , to plot out her rise to power. They “planned strategy for the week ahead”, and would “co-ordinate our activities to make us more effective collectively”. Pirie describes how he devised many of the policies that defined Thatcherism.And elsewhere too, not least in the testimony of the Brexit campaign whistleblower Shahmir Sanni, there is evidence that these lobby groups coordinate their work, creating the impression that people in different places are spontaneously coming to the same conclusions. Several of them work from the same offices, in 55 and 57 Tufton Street, Westminster.The lobby group that Boris Johnson’s government uses most is Policy Exchange. While it claims to be a neutral educational charity, it was founded in 2002 by the Conservative MPs Francis Maude and Archie Norman, and Nick Boles, who later also became a Tory MP. Its first chairman was Michael Gove. Its proposals and personnel have been adopted by the Conservative party ever since.Policy Exchange has played an important role in shifting power away from rival institutions and into the prime minister’s office. For several years it has been building a case for curtailing the judiciary. It provided the ammunition for the government’s current attack on judicial review, which enables citizens to sue the government to uphold the law. This was the process transparency campaigner Gina Miller used: in 2016 to oblige Theresa May to seek parliamentary approval for triggering the Brexit process and, last year, to overturn Boris Johnson’s suspension of parliament.Policy Exchange calls such rulings “judicial overreach”. It claims they threaten the sovereignty of parliament and the separation of powers between government and judiciary. To my mind they do the opposite. The law is not whatever Boris Johnson says it is: it is legislation passed by parliament and interpreted by the courts. Both the Miller cases returned powers to parliament that prime ministers had seized. The government has now appointed a former Conservative minister, Lord Faulks, to examine judicial review, along the lines suggested by Policy Exchange.This lobby group has called for the prime minister’s office to have greater powers “to develop and direct policy change” through the civil service, and to appoint leaders of public bodies whose “culture and values” align with government’s aims. It has led the public attacks on what it calls the “chilling effects” of leftwing views in academia. Its recent report on academic freedom was brilliantly eviscerated in the  by Jonathan Portes, who found it riddled with basic statistical errors and mistaken assumptions. What purports to be a campaign for intellectual freedom looks more like a McCarthyite attempt to suppress left-leaning ideas. It’s an effective weapon in the government’s gathering culture war.Policy Exchange’s proposals for changing the planning system, which involve a massive removal of power from local authorities, have been adopted wholesale by the government. One of the authors of this scheme, Jack Airey, has moved from the thinktank to Downing Street, as a special adviser.Last year, Policy Exchange published a polemic that claimed Extinction Rebellion is led by dangerous extremists. As usual, it was widely covered by the media. Less discussed was the report that the lobby group has received funding from the power company Drax, the trade association Energy UK, and the gas companies E.ON and Cadent, whose fossil-fuel investments are threatened by environmental activism. These are among the few funders whose identities we know. Policy Exchange is listed by Who Funds You? as among the UK’s most opaque thinktanks. It might seem remarkable that without having to reveal its funders, while promoting shifts that could harm civil society, Policy Exchange remains a registered charity.By such means, political life is steadily undermined, until little remains but authority and obedience to the prime minister. Without strong civic institutions, society loses its power. From the point of view of global capital, that’s mission accomplished. To resist the government’s machinations, first we must understand them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/745a81fff64bde334b32f762ff6eecaee9b4893b/0_144_5568_3340/master/5568.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=745433ffd6c5cf2e257f934cb74cd5db","title":"decision due very soon on delaying gcses and a levels","story":"Schools minister says issue is complicated due to time needed for marking and university admission timetableThe government will decide “very soon” whether to delay next year’s GCSEs and A-levels to give students more time to prepare, a minister has confirmed.As children started to return to classrooms across England and Wales on Tuesday, the schools minister, Nick Gibb, said the government would decide “as soon as we can” whether to push back the date from May.Labour has called for the exams to be delayed by at least a month because students have missed so much teaching. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, is expected to be pressed on the matter in the Commons later on Tuesday.Gibb said the issue of delaying exams was complicated by the time needed for marking as well as the pressure it would place on the university admissions process.“The issues are not simple,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “We have to take into account the other nations in the UK which also use the GCSEs and A-levels in their term dates you have to take into account the time for marking, making sure results are delivered on a certain date for university admissions and so on.Pushed on whether a decision would be made by October, Gibb added: “It will be very soon because we know schools need to know the answer to this question and we have been working on it since mid-June.”Gibb insisted that classrooms were “very safe” environments for children. He said any pupil showing coronavirus symptoms would be asked to return home and advised to take a test, when they would be “given priority”.It emerged last week that schools and further education colleges would receive “an initial supply” of just 10 Covid-19 testing kits each.Asked why the government had not set up a rapid testing system for schools, Gibb said health officials would swing into action and trace the contacts of any pupil who tests positive and mobile testing units could be brought in if required. “We will take swift action in any school where there are positive tests,” he said.“Whenever a pupil or member of staff show symptoms, they will be asked to return home and then to take a test. They will be given priority in the testing regime – we have capacity for 300,000 tests a day,” he said.Gibb said there was an onus on parents to get their children tested if they showed symptoms. He added: “If a school is concerned that the parents are unable to get to a testing centre, every school has been sent a small number of home-testing kits that can be used for those families.”Gibb repeated Boris Johnson’s pledge that schools would be the last institutions to close in areas where local restrictions are in place. He said the government had acquired more than 100,000 computers for disadvantaged pupils in areas affected by a local lockdown.“The important thing is for all young people to return to school where they can be taught directly by their teachers to help them catch up and over the course of this week I’m confident we will see schools open and pupils returning,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d07e407c0d24d6a5b7a0f999049affdc1e344d23/0_112_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eed9b1ad69473661345ee07472a8d321","title":"joy tears and coronavirus controls children return to school across england covid","story":"Pupils, parents and teachers adjust to new normal for education in the age of CovidAs many children in England go back to school for the first time in months, we talked to parents around the country about their expectations, anxieties, and how they hope to navigate their way through the new normal in the age of the pandemic.There were a few tears, one or two lips being bitten nervously and some of the younger children clutched firmly on to their parents’ hands as they were marched up to the school gates. But most of the 840 pupils returning to Bishop Road primary school after their very extended break had a spring in their step.In their bright purple jumpers and cardigans, they greeted friends they had not seen for months joyfully they excitedly began to tell teachers about their adventures in lockdown some demanded parents take a picture to record the occasion.Then they started to get used to the differences – the one-way routes, the hand-washing regimes, the subtle changes to playtime.“It’s great to see them back,” said Jon Martin, who was dropping off Bowen, six, and Nia, nine. “My daughter barely slept last night, she couldn’t wait to get back in. My son didn’t grumble as we got out of the door so that’s a win too.“Trying to do home learning has been really hard and they’ve missed out on the social side. We’re all desperate to get back to some sort of normal.”Sara Kelly-Smith, a single parent, was escorting Mia, seven, back to school. “It’s been a bit of a nightmare,” said Kelly-Smith, who has been trying to juggle her beauty business with childcare. “There’s only so many bike rides you can do.”Most were happy with the safety regime the school had put in place, with only a handful turning up in masks. “I’m sure they’ll do it well,” said Kate Macleod, who was dropping off her seven-year-old daughter, Jessie. “More than anything, I don’t want their lives, their education, their futures to be affected any more than they have to be. They’ve missed learning, friends, socialisation.”It felt familiar – but there were differences.Pupils and parents faced a web of lines and arrows painted on to playgrounds to follow to make sure they got to the right place at the right time.Day one involved a staggered drop-off. Years one, three and five were asked to arrive from 8.30 – 8.45am, years two, four and six from 9.15-9.30am. If sibling drop-off times differed adults needed to go through the process twice. To help, the school had posted a series of videos online explaining the procedures.The school made it clear all children were expected to attend unless they were self-isolating because of coronavirus symptoms or a positive test result, or if they had been advised not to attend by a health professional because of an underlying condition.Pupils were remaining with their class throughout the day and were not mixing with other classes for break or lunch. Events such as assemblies will happen remotely.The school followed government guidance in not requiring staff or children to wear face coverings. But it says any person choosing to wear a mask at school will not be prevented from doing so.There were new desk layouts, “enhanced” cleaning and, where it was safe, windows and doors were kept open to increase ventilation. It helped that day one turned out to be bright and warm.In corridors, a “keep to the left” rule has been introduced, with clear markings on the floor.Pupils were asked to bring in packed lunches and snacks. Children who are eligible for free school meals and were previously receiving vouchers are being provided with a packed lunch.There will be up to three classes on a playground at any one time but each class will be allocated their own playground space.Children will be encouraged to avoid games that involve substantial physical contact and are not allowed to bring in equipment such as footballs and table tennis bats.Nor were they allowed to bring pencil cases, toys, balls or games. They were also not to bring in sweets, cakes or other items on their birthdays.Joe Emissah, the deputy head, said the school was delighted to be welcoming pupils back. “We are fantastically pleased that we are all going to be back in school doing the things that we love – sharing stories, reading books, hearing about all the things everybody’s been getting up to and getting started with our learning.”Most pupils and their adults seemed to be coping with the rule changes admirably.Robert Jones, who walked Arthur, five, up to the school gates, said his son was excited to meet up with his classmates. “We’re glad everyone is getting on with it,” he said.Mohammed Ibrahim, who dropped off Mayadea, six, said: “It’s been almost five months – we really need to go back. Of course, we’re still concerned about coronavirus but we’ve got to do our best to stay safe and get on with it.” SMThough many schools in the North of England had taken an inset day on Tuesday, all pupils were welcomed back at staggered times by Chesham primary school in Bury, Greater Manchester.Despite initial concerns over safety, most parents at the school’s gates were keen to see their children off into their new social bubbles.“I think we were getting to the stage of them needing something else – they’re excited to get back,” said Kristie Harkness, who was waiting with her daughters Kenzie, eight, and Harper, four.Throughout the lockdown, Harkness and her husband, Brett, had been trying to teach the girls at home – although Brett clarified that he “wouldn’t call it homeschooling” and that much of it had involved creating things like Egyptian tombs out of cardboard.The family were ready to get back to normal – with Kenzie aching to see her best friend, Emma, and Harper wanting to get stuck in with painting.For Kelly Ralph, a retail worker, and Rebecca Dewhurst, a social worker, school offered some much-needed routine for their children following the summer holidays.“They’re not apprehensive about going into school,” said Ralph, who has two children: Noah, four, and Gracie, 10. “I think we’ve managed to keep some of that normality in our house because I’ve been at work the whole time – so it doesn’t feel that different.”Dewhurst added that she felt the government’s changing policies on schools reopening had been confusing. “No one knows what the impact of it will be until after it’s happened so how can they really know it’s safe.”Still, she had instructed her sons, Bartle, four, and Starson, six, on how to keep as safe as possible at school. “I’ve been very vocal about Covid and its implications for people and society with them. They know how to socially distance, they know all about hand washing.” But for parents in the high-risk category for developing severe Covid symptoms, the decision to send their children back was something of a catch-22.Bailey, who has Crohn’s disease, arthritis and asthma, has been shielding since March. The thought of Alfi, six, passing Covid on to her is something that frightens them both.“He’s become so anxious that he shouts at people in the street for not wearing masks and tells them to get away from me,” said Bailey, adding that there was little advice from the government over high-risk parents sending children to school.But the school had instilled some confidence where the government had not, Bailey felt. In the event of a child or staff member having suspected Covid symptoms, Alfi will be allowed to learn at home again. “There’s a digital learning plan set up for him already,” she added. AWAt the entrance of Charles Dickens primary school in Southwark, Angel McCall was the only parent who wore a face mask. As she cradled her nine-year-old son’s head in her latex-gloved hands, she admitted that she found sending him back “very, very nerve-racking”.“I see there are not many people wearing masks, either,” she said. “So I’m thinking: am I the only one? Are we not worrying any more?” Her son was not wearing a mask but he admitted he was nervous too.“All I can tell him is be sensible and wash his hands and don’t touch anything,” McCall said, but she added that she did not think it would be easy for children to observe physical distancing rules.“He hasn’t seen any of his friends since March,” McCall said, explaining that she had kept him at home and not mixed with other families since the government-mandated lockdown began.Close by stood Ifeanyi Kamalu, waiting with his seven-year-old daughter for her turn to enter school – his four-year-old had already gone in. He had mixed feelings about returning his children to school.“As much as I know that the coronavirus is still out there, they have been out of school for about six months so I kind of feel that they should be back at school to continue learning – as much as all of us are scared of the virus,” he said.Kamalu was sceptical about the ability of the school to contain any outbreak. “I know that parents are bringing children from various homes … what if those kids have it? You have a huge window for passing the virus around. Here they are not necessarily observing the 2-metre rules or the face coverings.“I wish I could homeschool them, but I haven’t got the resources.”Not all parents were anxious. “It’s good to be back, let’s just say,” Tatjana Pisarski said. She was reassured by the school’s efforts to institute a regime of hygiene and precautions to keep pupils safe.“The school sent a little video to show what to expect inside, what we can’t see from the outside, all the washing basins and routines … it sounds really good.”High on the fence, a sign informed parents of the staggered times in which their children would be allowed inside: reception and year six first, at 8.15am, followed at 15 minute intervals by pupils from years four and five. “Follow the lines join the queue please keep your distance,” a sign instructed.As Marina Harrington queued to hand her son over to staff she said: “I can’t wait … Freedom work life.” Then, peering at her son, who had screwed up his face and stepped away, she added: “I love him dearly …” Harrington’s husband, Mark, cut in: “I love him enough to let him go, I think that’s the thing.”Marina Harrington said life with three children at home had been stressful. She explained she and her husband had been waking at 5am each day – before their children – to get in a couple of hours of work, then taking on homeschooling responsibilities when their children got up.Asked if they were concerned that their son had fallen behind in his studies during lockdown, Mark Harrington laughed: “He’s nine … that’s people who worry too much.” DG"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4abb1c9404c138f01b1d8487a2fbca34d0db915d/10_438_3897_2338/master/3897.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=946e981937bf8cd7cd45a10efdd21764","title":"teachers and parents in england tell us about returning to school coronavirus","story":"We’d like to hear from teachers and parents about how they felt returning to school amid the coronavirus pandemicWith new measures including hand-washing routines, ‘bubble’ student groups, and even coronavirus behavioural codes, the majority of pupils in England returned to school today for the start of the new academic year.The reopening of schools follows months of contestation over protective measures, with some headteachers warning they felt forced to choose between pupil safety and financial stability.We’d like to hear from teachers and parents in England about their experience of the first day back.You can get in touch by filling in the form below or via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056.

It comes in ivory and “sky captain” grey. Last month the label dressed model Halima Aden in a custom-made burkini for Sports Illustrated.After the fashion industry has been criticized for its lack of ersity and racism, following the Black Lives Matter protests, the Hilfiger hijab could suggest major fashion brands are stepping forward with inclusive practices. But Hassanah El-Yacoubi, founder of modest fashion brand PFH, says that it also shows market changes rather than cultural ones.“It’s more indicative of an ever-growing Muslim consumer culture that is lucrative and thriving more than ever now,” El-Yacoubi said.The Islamic fashion industry is estimated to be worth $88bn by 2025, according to Grand View Research. “I think the timing reflects the need to address a growing desire in the market by consumers – especially millennials and Generation Z – for greater inclusivity from the brands they support,” said Arthur Zaczkiewicz, the executive editor of fashion industry publication Women’s Wear Daily.Research has shown that a younger tranche of consumers are less concerned with “fitting in” and more with making choices that reflect their own values.After years of being “othered” by mainstream fashion, the perception of modest fashion is altering. “I believe we are experiencing a permanent cultural shift instead of a fleeting style that’s in vogue temporarily,” said El-Yacoubi.Zaczkiewicz said: “It’s important to understand that modest fashion is not a trend. It’s how people live.”Yet most observers believe the Hilfiger hijab is only a small step towards a wider acceptance of Muslim dressing.“No matter how mainstream or celebrated modest fashion has become, the reality remains that Islamophobia and anti-Muslim sentiments have been at an all-time high in the US,” said El-Yacoubi.“Since modest fashion is generally perceived to be a phenomenon spearheaded by hijab-donning women, they usually bear the brunt of such beliefs,” said El-Yacoubi.Muslim clothing continues to be a political lightning rod and a sartorial subtext for Islamophobic rhetoric.In July, the German state of Baden-Württemberg banned burqas and niqabs in schools. It followed similar bans in Sri Lanka and Denmark. Other countries that have banned Muslim dress include Latvia, Austria, Bulgaria and Belgium.Last year the French sporting goods label Decathlon dropped plans to sell a sports hijab after politicians’ reaction exposed religious tensions there, again focused on Muslim women’s attire.Still, the launch of the hijab follows on from Hilfiger’s promises to be more inclusive. Last month its parent company PVH announced a program to increase opportunities for people of color people at the company.

She did not expect it to transform into an aching meditation on isolation and loneliness.The Chilean film-maker told the  she was initially toying with genre and form. In early scenes, she makes you question whether you’re even watching a documentary because of the heightened noir aesthetic – venetian blinds and high contrast lighting.The film, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January, follows the octogenarian Sergio Chamy who is hired by a private eye, Rómulo Aitken, to snoop around a nursing home. Gradually, life chips away at the Pink Panther playfulness of the premise, and the film settles into a sombre look at ageing and desperately hanging on to human connection.That journey, which for Alberdi is the accumulation of 300 hours of footage, flies by breathlessly in a 90-minute film. It began with a search for her lead. She landed at Detective Aitken’s office. He’s a former federal police investigator turned middle-aged private eye who had already handled four cases in nursing homes.As a documentary film-maker, Alberdi felt a connection to Aitken’s trade. He waits until he can find proof, just as she waits until the right scene appears before her camera. “I always say my budgets are to pay the crew to wait until the things that we are waiting for happen,” Alberdi said.They waited at Aitken’s office until the right case came along: a client wanted her mother watched to make sure she was being treated well inside a long-term care facility. These cases, Alberdi explained, are common, driven by the guilt of offspring who leave their parents in such institutions. The nursing home private eye, Alberdi said, is akin to the nanny cam.Aitken’s regular mole suffered a hip injury. He had to hire a new one. That led to a hilarious casting … erm … hiring process. We see various seniors in the interview chair responding to the help wanted ad. They’re baffled anyone would want to hire someone over 80. But they jump at the opportunity to break their moldy routines and be mentally stimulated with a new gig. The irony that entering a nursing home would be stimulating was not lost on Alberdi.When it came to that casting process, the documentary director did not take an impartial stance. “I fell in love with Sergio,” she said, explaining that she convinced Aitken to hire the soft-spoken and gentle 83-year-old widower. Chamy couldn’t navigate the camera on an iPhone, which would be deemed an essential skill in nursing home spycraft. The way he fumbles with tech in not so subtle ways lends the film much of its humour. But Alberdi felt he had the right disposition to be the film’s anchor, while embedded for months as the new resident in the senior home.She already had a crew on scene before Chamy’s arrival. The staff were told that her crew was making a documentary about daily life in a nursing home. That turns out to be closer to what the film became, since Chamy soon grew tired of spying. Despite all the deception, the film ended up being far more honest than intended.“Our heart was not in the case,” Alberdi said, explaining how her crew followed Chamy’s lead. Though he found his “target”, made contact and regularly checked in on her wellbeing, his undercover dispatches to Aitken grew less frequent. The gentle spy grew resentful of his boss and the covert job. Instead, Chamy befriended other residents and turned his attention to them. And the documentary became about the long-term care home’s social dynamic.Early scenes show the predominantly female residents watching the cameras suspiciously, reminding each other that those boom mics are listening in on their conversations, as if they too had secret agendas. But eventually they ignore the crew’s presence and carry on, often fawning over Chamy, who was one of only a handful of men in that home.Alberdi explained that the gender breakdown in this particular nursing home is not common in Chile. Men are usually dumped in homes, while women are kept with the children or grandchildren they raised. However, this particular home goes back decades, with a clientele largely made up of women who never married, had children or found their independence with careers.Alberdi pegged the home as a portrait of a patriarchal generation. “Your life makes sense if you get married,” Alberdi said, describing the sentiment that led to many of these women arriving at the home in their 50s, deposited there as though they did not belong in society.In that way, The Mole Agent feels disquietingly similar to Alberdi’s 2016 documentary, The Grown-Ups. That film is a compassionate portrait of young adults with Down’s syndrome who desperately want independence and resent being infantilized. Both films, for Alberdi, are about people that society refuses to integrate. They’re kept isolated because they are deemed too dependent – or rather, too much work.In The Mole Agent, Alberdi homes in on the micro-society the women and the nurses build for themselves, and how Chamy navigates that. In scenes that alternate between humour and heartbreak, he brings them conversation and comfort. He helps them cope, and when needed, stand on their own two feet. He keeps the home’s resident kleptomaniac in check, returning stolen necklaces to their owners with a gentle nod of disapproval towards the amusing culprit. And, if only for a short while, he entertains the amorous eyes of women like Berta.“I would consider giving God my virginity through my future husband,” says the simultaneously pious and randy Berta, who’s been in the home for 25 years. Alberdi’s film is particularly attentive to how Catholicism, patriarchy and female sexuality can thrive at once in this environment. That one line from Berta nails it all.The sadness that throbs throughout the film swells near the end, when the women in the home pour their heart out to Chamy about missing their families and being left behind. With that emotional finale, Alberdi expected her film to inspire a conversation in Chile about the loneliness and depression experienced by seniors. But Covid-19 did that instead.The pandemic forced long-term care facilities across the globe into intensive lockdowns. The ageing population, who are the most vulnerable to the virus, are now no longer able to receive visitors. Their isolation intensified. But the world started paying attention.“I read the newspaper on Saturday and there were pages speaking of depression in old people,” said Alberdi.She sees a silver lining in the current situation. She rarely witnessed a visit or a call from family to residents during her months at the nursing home. But now, during the pandemic, Alberdi said she’s noticed that people are regularly checking in on their parents or grandparents in senior homes.Seniors, who she couldn’t trust to handle iPhone cameras, are now jumping on Zoom calls with their grandchildren."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ceb97a0f289760ef7ed39311da6d1cc5bec8e8ad/0_163_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29ddcd0306f78c4e934701c6f172fb81","title":"kitchen tips for more taste and less waste","story":"Kitchen hacks abound on the internet, but not enough consider flavour or reducing food waste. We asked cooks for a few practical ideas• Do you have a culinary dilemma? Email feast@theWhat are the best hacks for optimising speed and flavour, and minimising waste?Jess, GlasgowIf you’ve ever fallen down a rabbit hole watching YouTube or Instagram, you’ll know there’s a big, bad world of kitchen hacks (otherwise known as tips) lurking in the depths of the internet. While some will waste your time and ingredients (hello, melted gummy bear jelly), others can make you a more efficient cook.Ingredient prep is a good place to start, something in which Ixta Belfrage, recipe developer for Yotam Ottolenghi and co-author of the new Ottolenghi Flavour (out in September), is well-versed. To remove garlic skins, Belfrage usually crushes the cloves with the flat of a knife, but, when faced with a lot to do, she turns to the microwave: “Put in a whole bulb for about five seconds and the skin will come off really easily,” she says. She then blitzes it with onion in a food processor and cooks: “People fry onion and then add garlic, but I fry them at the same time, starting on a low flame, which saves time.” This sentiment is echoed by Amy and Emily Chung, AKA the Rangoon Sisters, who fry in bulk, then freeze in portions, for future curries, stews, quiches and focaccia toppings.Peeling ginger with a teaspoon is another nifty trick to have in your arsenal, and one adopted by food writer Rosie Birkett. The author of The Joyful Home Cook also notes the importance of tools, from investing in a decent peeler to making full use of the slicing blade on your food processor – simple, maybe, but shredded salads and coleslaws will never be easier.Your freezer is a great ally in the quest to reduce waste, too. Ravinder Bhogal, chef and author of the just-published Jikoni: Proudly Inauthentic Recipes from an Immigrant Kitchen, stashes broccoli and cauliflower stems for gratins and pasta bakes, and buys fresh curry leaves in bulk to freeze: “This preserves their beautiful, fragrant flavour – never bother with dried they taste of nothing.”Lockdown taught us that having sauces thatcan elevate a multitude of dishes – roast veg, salads, meat, fish and for Birkett, that usually means romesco: “You don’t need to use almonds I didn’t have enough, so I substituted them with pumpkin seeds.” She toasts the nuts and seeds in a frying pan with whole garlic cloves, then whizzes in a food processor with jarred roasted red peppers, smoked paprika, cayenne, olive oil, salt, vinegar and a splash of the juice from the pepper jar.Finally, Belfrage has an amazing hack with a Chinese egg custard made in the microwave. “I saw it done by a New York chef over lockdown, and it’s ridiculously easy, – just water, egg and salt. Whisk, cover with a plate, pop in the microwave and the result is an incredibly silky-smooth egg custard.” Just add soy sauce and chopped spring onions.

He has been in enforced quarantine since flying to London from France on 24 August, a situation that has six days to run under the government’s Covid-19 rules, but signed his contract last week and will be expected to slot into a new-look backline.Napoli had also been interested in Gabriel, a 22-year-old Brazil under-20 international who enjoyed a breakthrough season in Ligue 1 last season, and Manchester United and Manchester City both kept across developments. But Arsenal were always in pole position and Gabriel, who is left-footed and previously spent time on loan at Troyes and Dinamo Zagreb, will join the returning loanee William Saliba among Arteta’s defensive ranks.The signing was revealed through the club’s YouTube channel, during a programme in which David Luiz and Willian made a video call with their compatriot. Speaking on Arsenal’s website the technical director, Edu, said: “We are delighted to have signed Gabriel. He is a player we have been studying for a while and he was in demand from many clubs, so we are proud to have agreed and completed this transfer with Lille and the player. Gabriel is a player of high quality and Mikel and his coaches are looking forward to integrating him into the club.”That sentiment was echoed by Arteta. “We welcome Gabriel to Arsenal,” he said. “He has many qualities which will make us stronger as a defensive unit and as a team. He has proved with Lille that he is a defender with many outstanding attributes and we are looking forward to watching him grow as an Arsenal player.”It is the second piece of major business Arsenal have completed in this transfer window, Willian signing last month after leaving Chelsea. More transfers are inevitable in what could be a frantic final few weeks of the transfer window. They are expected to announce soon that Dani Ceballos will spend another season on loan from Real Madrid after negotiations between the clubs concluded successfully.Arteta would like to strengthen his midfield and attack further but players will have to depart if more significant fees are to be paid, with an already expensive summer also likely to include the confirmation of a new contract for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, the club captain. Matteo Guendouzi and Lucas Torreira can depart if the deals are right, and Rob Holding and Sokratis Papastathopoulos find their prospects of regular football remote after the arrivals of Gabriel and Saliba. Despite appearing close to joining Wolves last week, Ainsley Maitland-Niles is likely to stay at the club after an impressive Community Shield display against Liverpool and a call-up to the England squad."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0abbe75c7c98a6cc1807ee958d8f4ffe206bd63/0_34_2732_1638/master/2732.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d845ad535bd8cc68cf96ee14885f8e1f 1240w","title":"gotta quiz em all the guardians pokemon quiz","story":"With a new TV series set to start in the UK, how much do you know about the world of Pokémon?A new chapter begins for Pokémon in the UK on Tuesday as the animated series Pokémon Journeys starts on the Freeview channel POP.Ash and Pikachu have been on our screens since the 1990s, and the Pokémon franchise includes not just the anime, but video games, trading cards, lots and lots of toys and even a live action movie.

So that was part of it.”Participants in the “Covid on Mind” study, which will be anonymous, will keep a dream log and undertake a “daily mind-wandering task” over a period of two weeks.But first, they will be asked to complete a wellbeing questionnaire that examines their mental state, and “concerns related to coronavirus specifically” to give the researchers “some measure of how people are doing, how concerned they are about the virus, and changes related to the virus in their everyday lives”.The cross-disciplinary project involves cognitive neuroscientists, psychologists and sleep and dream researchers, many of whom study how dreams reflect people’s mental states while awake. “We have people on the team who’ve done a lot of work on emotion and dreams … the pandemic seems to be an ideal opportunity to study that,” says Widnt.She says there is already a body of research that suggests “negatively toned” dreams are associated with issues like anxiety and depression, and wonders, “Could changes in dreams be a marker to help identify people with mental health issues?”“We’re not interested in interpreting the dreams in any sense,” she explains. “This is really a quite different approach that tries to get objective numbers … It’s really about quantifying changes in emotion, and relating them to measures of waking thought and emotion.”Other researchers will be investigating the number of social interactions people report, both in their dreams and mind-wandering tasks. “Dreaming has been proposed to have a possibly evolutionary function in fine-tuning social skills,” she says. “We know that many of our interactions have gone virtual … does that have an impact on how people dream?”“Dream bizarreness”, which Windt describes as “a technical word for all of the different ways in which dreams can be weird”, will also be a focus for Melbourne-based PhD student Manuela Kirberg.In order to quantify how bizarre, social, positive or negative a dream is, independent raters read through dream reports and score them using established criteria. They rate the occurrence of “emotion terms” and “social content”. Any comments that do not form part of a dream’s description – for instance the dreamer’s own interpretation – are discarded, and raters talk to each other to ensure there is “sufficient agreement” in how they are scoring the dreams. “You need a lot of patience and sticktoitiveness to do that scoring, as well as training,” Windt says. “A lot of dreams are pretty mundane.”The researchers are currently recruiting volunteers for the study – and anyone over the age of 18 who lives in the UK, Australia or Finland can participate. The study will be open for up to 12 months. The resulting dataset will feature well over 1,000 dreams and daydreams.Windt is particularly curious about the dreams and mind-wandering of people in lockdown. “It’s obviously horrible what’s happening in Melbourne,” she says. But, “I do think it is a particularly interesting period to get people involved … How do their dreams relate to the changing outer circumstance?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c7068aa2c5e10da2ce25c04df6b4c2f66bea1b4/0_0_2126_1417/master/2126.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c85cf053a9c2632e4b9303ff1fb639d5 960w","title":"who are europe dreamers podcast","story":"Across Europe, millions of young people live in undocumented limbo, in fear of deportation from the countries they grew up in because of hostile migration policies. Now, inspired by their US counterparts, they are fighting for recognition and residencyThe US Dreamers – young people who arrived in the country as children – have spent the past 20 years focused on their fight for the legal right to live, study and work there. In 2012 they secured an intervention from the then president, Barack Obama, who paved the way for their legal status with the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) programme. In Europe, populist politicians and the rightwing press still fuel the perception that the undocumented population is a faceless mass of opportunists. It is not well understood that the majority of people without papers are young people, many of whom arrived in Europe as small children, and some were even born there. Now, inspired by their US counterparts, they are fighting for recognition and residency.

Charlotte interviewed Ijeoma Moore who at 15 was put in a detention centre and narrowly avoided deportation three times. A decade on, Moore is still not a UK citizen.

Johnson’s government is reluctant to cede any control over state aid policy, boasting during last year’s election campaign that one benefit of Brexit would be that the government could intervene more readily to help struggling UK businesses.The prime minister’s spokesman underlined that message on Tuesday, saying: “We’ll set out further detail of our domestic regime in due course. After the transition period, the UK will have its own regime of subsidy control, and will not be subject to the EU’s state aid regime. We have been very clear about that throughout.”He added: “The UK’s future subsidy arrangements are a matter for the British people and parliament, not the European Union.”Brussels regards state aid constraints as a key aspect of ensuring a level playing field, so that UK businesses cannot unfairly undercut their EU counterparts.With an EU council expected to be held in October to finalise any free trade agreement, time is running short.During last year’s fraught negotiations over the EU withdrawal agreement formalising the UK’s exit terms, Johnson made significant last-minute concessions – effectively allowing a border in the Irish Sea – to get his “oven-ready” deal done.But he is under pressure from Brexit-backing Conservative MPs not to make fresh compromises now – and even to repudiate some aspects of the withdrawal agreement.One potential solution to the negotiating impasse that has previously been mooted is a series of separate deals on different issues – financial services, fisheries and so on.But a senior UK official close to talks has previously revealed that the EU is not keen on a “Switzerland-style suite of agreements”, in reference to the 100-plus bilateral deals the country has with Brussels, as it “would be too complicated to manage for them”.The EU is also keen to have an overarching deal on governance and dispute resolution.France’s EU affairs minister, Clément Beaune, said that no deal was a risk, but blamed the British government for the impasse. “Things are not advancing because the UK would like to have its cake and eat it: to leave the European Union and have access to the European market,” he said.Speaking on French radio, he said the EU would not compromise on linking market access to respect for its rules on health and the environment. The EU has said the UK can only have tariff-free, quota-free access to the European market if it agrees to respect European standards on environment, workers’ rights and state aid for companies.EU officials dismissed reports Barnier was refusing to discuss British proposals on a future fisheries treaty.“The UK has not presented new legal texts in the area of fisheries,” a spokesman for Barnier said. “We have been engaging constructively and in good faith. Michel Barnier said at the end of the last round of negotiations that we have shown flexibility by taking note of prime minister Johnson’s three red lines and working on them. We have not seen, however, a reciprocal effort on the UK’s side regarding European priorities. We are now waiting for the UK to present concrete and constructive proposals.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8185d1b9d189c5da2d46b13d798a01545b1ea17e/0_0_5212_3126/master/5212.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=a4c91897b9439d2fd6eda7c8e12f5b98","title":"global heating played part in american mastodon extinction say scientists","story":"Shift led to local extinctions and could have important implications for species todayGenetic ersity could shrink as animals venture into new territories because of global heating leaving them vulnerable to extinction, scientists have warned after tracking the impact of climate change on the American mastodon.Huge, hairy and with a pair of fearsome tusks, mastodons resembled stocky, hirsute elephants. The earliest fossils of American mastodons date to about 3.5-4m years ago with the creatures commonly found in wooded and swampy areas where they browsed on trees and shrubs. But by 11,000 years ago they were extinct – probably, experts say, because of a combination of climate change and human hunting.Now researchers say an analysis of ancient mitochondrial DNA has shed new light on the impact of global heating and cooling on the beasts.“As the temperature warmed, they followed expanding forest and swampy niches as they moved north,” said Prof Hendrik Poinar, co-author of the research from McMaster University in Canada.But their fortunes reversed with the climate. “As the climate changed, cooling again, they became restricted in the north and couldn’t ultimately handle the environmental change and went locally extinct,” he said.Crucially, the team found genetic ersity was lower among the animals that moved north. With species including moose and beavers moving northwards today as a result of global heating, the team says the finding is important as it suggests such species could become less resilient to further pressures. .“While it might not have been too big a problem for American mastodons it might not bode well for extant species if the same patterns are true and they trade their southern populations and ranges for new ones in the north,” said Emil Karpinski, another author of the research from McMaster University.Writing in the journal Nature Communications, Poinar and colleagues report how they analysed ancient mitochondrial DNA extracted from the remains of 35 American mastodons from across North America.By comparing the mitochondrial genomes, the team discovered the animals fell into five main clusters, while one formed a sixth on its own. Two of the five main clusters largely encompassed mastodons from Alaska and Yukon. Mastodons from one of these clusters were dated to an interglacial period ning 130,000 to 80,000 years ago. However mastodons in the other cluster were far older, suggesting they were part of separate migrations during an earlier interglacial periods.The team says the results suggest mastodons moved north in small numbers on multiple occasions as ice sheets retreated, but died out in the region when the climate cooled and the ice returned– a theory backed up by reduced genetic ersity in these two groups.Such migrations, the team adds, may have been a widespread phenomenon, affecting other animals in North America at the time such as the western camel.“Similar processes presumably occurred in Eurasia, with warm-adapted species such as hippopotamuses and hyenas episodically expanding their ranges northward during earlier interglaciations into previously ice-dominated areas like the British Isles and Scandinavia,” they write.Prof Love Dalén, from the Centre for Palaeogenetics in Sweden who was not involved in the work, welcomed the research. “This is an amazing study that uses ancient DNA to travel back in time to the last time that the Earth was in a period of global warming, over a hundred thousand years ago,” he said.Dalén said the finding that the northern mastodons were unable to return south when the climate turned cold also holds a lesson. “This is important since it implies that when climate change causes a species’ range to shrink, this is characterised by the extinction of populations at the range margin rather than populations migrating into more favourable habitats.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e27f754b139f4f234b72d7a7e6c4f3f0dc5bb330/0_559_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2424be8e890a64527e2bccf818425bfc","title":"marcus rashford takes aim at child food poverty with new taskforce","story":"Manchester United forward outlines plans to build on free school meals victory in letter to MPsThree months after he forced a government U-turn on summer holiday school meal vouchers, Marcus Rashford has set his sights on a bigger target: the end of child food poverty in Britain.After MPs scrambled to line up behind the charismatic young Manchester United footballer and political activist, it is now the turn of the food industry.In a letter to MPs released on Tuesday morning, Rashford unveiled a “child food poverty taskforce” he has formed with brands including Aldi, Tesco, Deliveroo and Kellogg’s, set out three major new policy goals, and issued a rallying cry for long-lasting change.“Food poverty is contributing to social unrest,” he wrote, reflecting on a series of recent meetings with families in need of the same support he counted on as a child. He described “watching a young boy keeping it together whilst his mother sobbed alongside him, feeling like he has to step up to protect his family and alleviate some of that worry. He was nine years old.”“I know that feeling,” he wrote. “I remember the sound of my mum crying herself to sleep to this day, having worked a 14-hour shift, unsure how she was going to make ends meet. That was my reality.”The ambitious plan that Rashford sets out calls on the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to fund the implementation of three key policy recommendations from the national food strategy, a government-commissioned report highlighting huge economic and health inequalities, which will be aggravated by the coronavirus crisis. The proposals are backed by Aldi, Co-op, Deliveroo, Iceland, Kellogg’s, Sainsbury’s, Tesco, Waitrose, and the charities FareShare and the Food Foundation.“Mothers and fathers are raising respectful, eloquent young men and women, who, in reality, are part of a system that will not allow them the opportunity to win and succeed,” Rashford wrote. “Add school closures, redundancies and furloughs into the equation and we have an issue that could negatively impact generations to come. It all starts with stability around access to food.”While the food strategy – written by Leon founder Henry Dimbleby – was commissioned by the government, ministers have not yet said they will act on its recommendations. The three points highlighted by Rashford are the expansion of free school meals to every child whose family is on universal credit, an expansion of holiday provision to all children on free school meals, and a significant boost to the value of Healthy Start vouchers for families with young children.The footballer, who is working in partnership with FareShare and the Food Foundation, said in his letter that the progress made by his previous victory on free school meals “was only ever going to support this issue in the short-term”. And he said a recent visit to the Evelyn Community Store in Deptford, south-east London had redoubled his commitment to the cause.“I spoke to a mother recently who, along with her two young sons, is currently living off three slices of bread a day – soaking them in hot water and adding sugar, hoping that the porridge consistency might better sustain the hunger of her one-year old child,” he wrote. “This is the true reality of England in 2020.”Rashford is understood to have devoted much of his brief off-season to his work on food poverty – visiting food banks, working to create his new coalition with the food industry, and calling his co-workers on the project for updates as often as four times a day.Shortly after his visit to the Evelyn Community Store, he convened a Zoom call with supermarket leaders to agree the taskforce plan. As well as backing the national food strategy goals, members of the group agreed to use their social media platforms to share the stories of some of those facing food poverty to raise public awareness of the issue.One of those on the call told the : “He’s formidable. This is obviously the right thing to do, but I think for some people, it doesn’t hurt that you don’t want to get on the wrong side of Marcus Rashford.”Henry Dimbleby said that the three recommendations endorsed in Rashford’s letter were chosen because “we need pace, and we need it to be deliverable – these are things which exist and which we can ramp up”.“To be well-nourished is the foundation of opportunity,” he added. “Any government serious about levelling up will ensure the most disadvantaged children have access to food.” He pointed to growing evidence of a new crisis in food poverty for young people brought about by coronavirus, with the number of people using food banks doubling in just a few months and the vast majority of new users being young people with dependent children.Natasha Ricketts, a volunteer at the Evelyn Community Store – which is supplied with food by FareShare– described Rashford as “an absolutely lovely guy. It’s massive, for a young guy to take on such a big task. He’s very humble, very down-to-earth, and it wasn’t that long ago that he was one of those kids himself.”Dimbleby agreed that Rashford had a vital role. “Having people whose own lived experiences inform their work lead the way is just so important,” he said. “Behind the scenes he’s doing all sorts of things he’s not even talking about.”Ricketts warned that it was not yet clear whether politicians and business would commit to following his lead in the long term. “But if not, they will have to answer why,” she said. “And that is the power of his voice.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8c729eb083e6652aa940a8ba776918201fbfe15/0_172_5256_3152/master/5256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=576714337bc7c4cd8ea9310d8f32e835","title":"social workers lack time resources to do job","story":"Sign up for our online event: what’s it like to be a social worker in 2020? When Megan Evans* qualified as a children’s social worker three years ago, she was in denial about how stressful the job would be. Evans works in Wales with up to 35 children and families at any one time, a caseload she often finds overwhelming. “It’s frustrating. I can’t help the people I want to help,” she says. “I know it’s a massive cliche but that’s why I came into this role. I feel like I’m just treading water.”When asked what would make the difference, a reduction in workload and options for flexible working were the most common suggestions. “Social workers need to be given caseloads that are manageable,” one respondent adds. “Streamlining of paperwork and not having to complete forms for the sake of it,” another says.While the coronavirus pandemic has brought challenges for  social workers – not least because many haven’t been able to see the people they work with in person – lockdown has actually improved Evans’s worklife balance. She finds it easier to switch the computer off at 5pm while working remotely, but has realised how much she relied on the support of her team.In Scotland, Bridget Wilson* has been a social worker for seven years. She works with women who are at risk of offending, after moving from a community care team that assisted people with learning and physical disabilities. During the pandemic, much of Wilson’s work had to pause. Her team has just restarted their group work sessions, which have been well attended. “That rarely happens because the people we work with often have such chaotic, difficult lives,” she adds. “They were all very keen to be back. It was wonderful. I felt like I was doing my job again.”Allen says that chimes with BASW’s research. “We certainly think that supporting managers is really crucial,” she adds. “Enabling social workers to act with autonomy and being able to make decisions as professionals – managers can either facilitate that or they can get in the way of it.”Evans is unsure about whether she’ll stay in frontline social work – it’s not something she thinks she’ll have the energy for in five years. But she’s proud of the impact she’s able to have. “The best days are still really sad and really difficult. But I hope I’m making a difference to at least some children’s lives.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0aa7b9d9e2a0509d9ad2898553519fcc9ef890b5/138_0_3233_1939/master/3233.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f13bfd831d3abba378c1214394f36ff","title":"england v pakistan third twenty20 live","story":"7th over: Pakistan 54-2 (Haider 24, Hafeez 7) Curran’s deliveries range in speed from 69mph to 85mph (well, there was one slow ball).

Babar takes three balls to get off the mark, and then Fakhar very nearly chops his first ball into his stumps only for it to bounce wide of leg, and gets a leading edge to the second, which floats wide of the bowler. “If it really is dry (for Manchester) then we can expect to see wickets falling only when the batsmen make their own mistakes, rather than being winkled out,” suggests John Starbuck. “Not much of a prospect for the bowlers, so any successes ought to be worth double.”The players are out! Saqib Mahmood has the ball in his hands. Let’s rock!Here’s confirmation of Pakistan’s team changes:Word is that Haider Ali is red hot, and I’m particularly looking forward to getting my first glimpse of him. There are already a few profiles of him online - here’s a handy link and telling quote:Babar Azam admits that he too would have chosen to bowl. Pakistan make three changes, with Haider Ali, a big-hitting 19-year-old debutant, the wicketkeeper Sarfaraz Ahmed and Wahab Riaz coming in. “It looks a little bit drier than the first game that we played but it still looks good,” declares Eoin Morgan, who picks an unchanged side. “There is no hiding place in T20 cricket, it can be brutal.”After three Tests and two T20s, one rained out, Pakistan go into the last match of their tour in search of a first win, while Babar Azam – officially the world’s top-ranked T20 batsman, mind you – comes to terms with being described as “a lost cow” by Shoaib Akhtar in the wake of the record-bending defeat to England on Sunday. “He is out there, not knowing what to do,” blasted Akhtar of his compatriot’s captaincy in that game, which may well fire up the 25-year-old, unless of course he’s ignored it completely as the wild flailings of an ex-player desperate to drive traffic to his YouTube channel. England meanwhile have the first game of a new series against Australia to look forward to on Friday and will look to go into it without a hangover either literal (it’s Dawid Malan’s 33rd birthday on Thursday, after all) or metaphorical. The birthday boy, who averages 54.60 across his 12 international ODI innings so far, is one of the players hoping to cement his place in the team with a big knock tonight.

It sits alongside the smaller, fitness-focused Galaxy Watch Active 2 and works with any brand of Android with access to the Google Play Store as well as an iPhone running iOS 9 or newer.The Watch 3 takes the design of 2018’s Galaxy Watch – there was no number two – and slims down its stainless steel body in all dimensions while adding a larger screen. The result is a thin, attractive traditional-looking circular watch that’s only 11.1mm thick and 53.8g in weight.The 1.4in screen is large, crisp and bright. It copes well with low and bright light, adjusting brightness accordingly, including a super-bright outdoors mode that comes on automatically. You can set the screen to be on all the time with a large array of attractive watch faces available, most of which are customisable. There are thousands more in the Galaxy Store, too.The rotating bezel around the screen acts as a jog controller for navigating the interface. Two buttons take care of back and apps functions. Press and hold the top apps button to activate Samsung Pay and the bottom back button to activate Bixby or your choice of app. Double press the bottom button to see recently used apps.The Watch 3 is water resistant to 50 metres, the screen is covered in scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass DX and the straps are standard 20mm or 22mm bands with quick-release pins. It ships with a high-quality leather strap that is much more supple and nicer than those that come with most watches.Samsung has used the same in-house Exynos 9110 processor in all of its recent smartwatches to great effect, including Watch 3. It has slightly more RAM at 1GB and double the storage at 8GB compared with the Watch Active 2 but performs very similarly.The interface is slick, snappy and lag-free. Screens and widgets whizz by as fast as you can turn the bezel. It is very close to the performance you get out of Apple Watch and far, far better than any Wear OS watch.Samsung uses its own operating system on its smartwatches called Tizen, here in its latest form with One UI 2.0. The firm offers software updates for its smartwatches for extended periods, which has resulted in watches four years old or more receiving updates recently and bodes well for the Watch 3.Tizen is based around a rotary interface, taking full advantage of that rotating bezel and circular screen, but it can also be swiped and tapped with fingers on the screen.It operates exactly the same as the Galaxy Watch Active 2 with minor improvements and slicker animations. Notifications appear as tiles to the left of the watch face and can be tapped to expand, actioned or replied to from your wrist. Widgets for various things are to the right.Swipe down from the top for quick settings or press the apps button for a list of apps. There are only a handful of good third-party apps, but they include Strava and some other fitness tracking apps, plus Spotify with offline music downloads and playback.The Watch 3 has Samsung Pay for contactless payments, which works well if a little clunkier than Google Pay, but UK bank support is limited. I use a Curve card, which is supported by Samsung Pay, to bind my unsupported bank cards and use them through it. Samsung recently launched its own version of the Curve card called Samsung Pay Card, too.Bixby is Samsung’s smart voice assistant. It works fine for simple tasks such as setting timers and other bits but can be a bit slow to activate and understand what you have said. It is more reliable than the previous version but is still the least polished bit of the Watch 3.Samsung Health has the same comprehensive health and fitness tracking features as it does on the Watch Active 2. It is one of the most complete suites of general health and fitness related monitoring on a smartwatch, including sleep tracking with blood oxygenation, stress and heart health, rivalling that from Apple and far better than Wear OS or rivals.Running tracking has new dynamics analysis, giving you a breakdown of your form, including asymmetry, foot contact time, flight time, regularity, vertical motion and stiffness. I’m not sure they will convince hard-core runners but it’s an interesting feature to have. Vo2 Max – a fairly common measure of cardiorespiratory fitness – matched my long-term readings from various Garmin devices on first run, which bodes well.The one negative is that it’s difficult to see when the watch has a GPS lock when preparing for a run, as it just tells you to set off. That resulted in it missing out on 200 metres of a run compared with a Garmin Fenix 6 Pro Solar.The Watch 3 has the hardware to perform an electrocardiogram (ECG) and to monitor blood pressure but it has yet to be activated in the UK pending regulatory approval, which was recently granted in the US.For comparison, the Galaxy Watch Active 2 has an RRP of £269, the Fossil Gen 5 costs £279, the Fitbit Versa 2 costs £199.99 and the Apple Watch Series 5 costs £399.The Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 is the best smartwatch for Android by some margin, taking the crown from the already excellent Watch Active 2.It combines a slim, light and attractive traditional watch design with the excellent rotating bezel controller, a slick software experience, solid battery life and a bright, crisp and gorgeous always-on screen.Its health-tracking features are up there with the best. Notification handling on Android is good. There is an enormous selection of watch faces and while third-party apps are slim on the ground, they do include some key ones such as Spotify and Strava.Samsung offers long-term software support, the watch is repairable and the battery can be replaced if needed. But the Watch 3 isn’t perfect. Bixby still isn’t great, Samsung Pay support is limited in the UK and while it has the hardware to support them, the ECG or blood pressure functions are still pending approval.I also wouldn’t wholly recommend using one with an iPhone as there are significant limitations compared with an Apple Watch of a similar price.It is relatively expensive but if you want a great smartwatch for your Android phone, the Galaxy Watch 3 is it. If you want something cheaper, the Watch Active 2 is almost as good.Pros: slim and attractive traditional watch design, big and bright screen, bezel control, slick performance, solid battery life, excellent fitness and health tracking, 50-metre water resistance, standard 20mm22mm straps, long software support, battery can be replaced, cross platform.Cons: few UK banks support Samsung Pay, Bixby is weak, cannot display animated images in smart camera notifications, limited functionality with an iPhone, cannot use ECGblood pressure yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d66caeb2ee3e7ccf76b5bc728aeadcb1af07e4a/0_19_5123_3073/master/5123.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=992a516aefc05294bbb18bd4d577d1b3","title":"tesla aims to raise 5bn in its biggest issue of new stock in a decade","story":"The move comes a day after the company completed a 5-for-1 stock split, which sparked a share price rise that propelled co-founder Elon Musk past Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg to become the world’s third-richest person.The investor-pleasing stock split, the first since Tesla’s flotation in 2010, pushed Musk’s paper fortune to more than $115bn, making him one of only four “centibillionaires” in the world. The 49-year-old joins the Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos, the Microsoft co-founder, Bill Gates, and Zuckerberg as the only people who have a net worth of more than $100bn. The Facebook founder joined the centibillionaire club just last month.Tesla gave few details about how it planned to use the $5bn, but in a stock market filing it said: “We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to further strengthen our balance sheet, as well as for general corporate purposes.”Musk, who is in Germany as part of a multistop European trip that has included a visit to the UK, has used Tesla’s share price as a cheap means of raising money to continue to fund its expansion plans instead of tapping debt markets.The company has a number of capital intensive projects in train, including the construction of its first European manufacturing and battery centre in Germany and a new factory in Texas, while another production facility recently came online in China.The stellar share performance over the last year reflects an improving financial performance. Last summer Tesla’s shares tumbled after the company reported a $400m second-quarter loss following a $700m loss in the first three months of the year, despite record car sales. Investors questioned the future of Tesla, which had lost more than a dozen executives over the previous year. But since then it has recovered and in July it reported a profit for the fourth quarter in a row.“Now in a clear position of strength and out of the red ink, Musk and his red cape are raising enough capital to get the balance sheet and capital structure to further firm up its growing cash position and slowly get out of its debt situation,” said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush. “This is a smart move at the right time for Musk \u0026amp Co after the parabolic rally in shares and with the appetite strong among investors.”Musk is in line to receive a record $55.8bn (£40bn), the largest corporate pay deal ever stuck between a chief executive and a company’s board, if he can continue to drive Tesla’s performance.Musk also has a habit of getting into hot water. Last year he was sued for $190m in defamation damages over derogatory tweets about British caver Vernon Unsworth, who was helping to rescue 13 people trapped in a Thai cave. A jury found the tweets did not reach a legal standard for defamation, and Musk was not found liable for damages.A decision to smoke cannabis on a live web show two years ago resulted in Tesla’s share price falling and the departure of two of its executives. The same year the US Securities and Exchange Commission fined Musk and Tesla $20m over his tweets that he planned to take the company private at a substantial premium, which caused the stock price to surge."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b308079c51d14f1b1930f8fc44e25b56031ab2e/843_932_2919_1751/master/2919.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d67fbf79cb5e8152e5a03d95dcac15f1","title":"suv conquered america climate change emissions","story":"Exclusive new emissions analysis shows how much more dangerous for the climate SUVs are than smaller vehicles, and how embedded they have become in our livesby  Oliver Milman in New YorkThey are the hulking cars that have conquered the world. Spreading from the heartlands of the US to a new generation of eager buyers in China to dominate even the twisting, narrow streets of Europe, the sports utility vehicle, or SUV, has bludgeoned its way to automobile supremacy with a heady mix of convenience and marketing muscle.The rise of the SUV as the world’s pre-eminent car has been so rapid that the consequences of this new status – the altered patterns of urban life, air quality, pedestrian safety, where to park the things – are still coming into focus.But it’s increasingly clear that SUVs’ most profound impact is playing out within the climate crisis, where their surging popularity is producing a vast new source of planet-cooking emissions.Last year, the International Energy Agency made a finding that stunned even its own researchers. SUVs were the second largest cause of the global rise in carbon dioxide emissions over the past decade, eclipsing all shipping, aviation, heavy industry and even trucks, usually the only vehicles to loom larger than them on the road.Each year, SUVs belch out 700 megatonnes of CO2, about the entire output of the UK and Netherlands combined. If all SUV drivers banded together to form their own country, it would rank as the seventh largest emitter in the world.Climate activists may hurl themselves in the path of new oil pipelines and ladle enough guilt on to flying that flygskam, or “flight shame”, has spread from Sweden around the world but a mammoth, and growing, cause of the climate crisis has crept up almost unnoticed around us.“The global rise of SUVs is challenging efforts to reduce emissions,” Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA, admitted.Combining the weight of an adult rhinoceros and the aerodynamics of a refrigerator, SUVs require more energy to move around than smaller cars and therefore emit more CO2, overshadowing the car industry’s climate gains from fuel efficiency improvements and the nascent electric vehicle market.Emissions analysis commissioned by the  illustrate, for the first time in detail, how much worse for the climate SUVs are than smaller vehicles, and how they have helped transform our cities.“To avert the worst of the climate catastrophe, the transport sector needs to be completely decarbonized,” said Sebastian Castellanos, a researcher at the New Urban Mobility Alliance who calculated the emissions. “With the explosion in SUV sales, we are moving even farther away from our goal of decarbonizing the sector.”This global phenomenon has its roots and impetus in the US, where in the 1980s the car industry carved out a new category called the “sport-utility vehicle”, a sort of mash-up between a truck, a minivan and the traditional American family car. After successfully lobbying lawmakers to class these vehicles as light trucks rather than cars, binding SUVs to less stringent fuel efficiency standards, the industry set about slotting them into almost every arena of American life.Once a workhorse that lugged tools around or was used for bumpy off-road driving, the SUV morphed into the default option for families puttering around suburbia and even for people in the cores of densely populated cities. The look and cost of SUVs stretched to suit all tastes – the 1984 Jeep Cherokee, a boxy, spartan offering considered the first SUV, has spawned successors ranging from the compact Kia Sportage to the sporty Mercedes ML.The industry found that American drivers enjoy the lofty seating position of SUVs, as well as the capacity and the comforting feel of security their bulk provides, even if half of all journeys taken in the US are mundane trips of under three miles to run errands rather than high-octane adventures in the Rocky Mountains. For many Americans, SUVs invoke alluring qualities of fortitude and independence.“Pretty much everyone wants one now,” said Stephanie Brinley, principal automotive analyst at IHS Markit. “The family car is now a utility vehicle and not a sedan. Millennials like them, baby boomers like them. Americans like to take all of their stuff with them and automakers figured this out.”Marketing for SUVs is now so broad it no longer seems jarring to see ads of a beefy car-truck zooming around urban streets to take its occupant to a yoga class or to grab a coffee. Ford was so thrilled with its recent relaunch of the Bronco, a model infamous for being driven by OJ Simpson as he was chased by a phalanx of police cars in 1994, that it rolled out an eight-part podcast series in celebration.“Car companies looked at things that people value, such as macho-ness, ruggedness and protection of the family, and leveraged that,” said Harvey Miller, professor and director of the Center for Urban and Regional Analysis at Ohio State University. “These SUVs are named after mountains and other places you’ll never go to. They created a market that pushes our buttons.”As Bloomberg’s Nat Bullard noted in a recent tweet: “We don’t buy cars here. We buy big cars built on truck bodies, and we buy trucks and drive them like cars.” The US is now indisputably an SUV nation, a transformation that has had profound consequences for American cities as well as the global climate.To Miller, SUVs are a monument to a broader American failure that has seen pedestrians and cyclists forsaken for endless miles of road building, with non-car users forced to push what he calls “beg buttons” to pause traffic to enter roads that should be egalitarian public spaces. SUVs, according to Miller, not only bring a stew of pollution and an element of fear to those attempting to traverse roads on foot or bike, they are fundamentally inefficient. “You are taking a 200lb package, a human, and wrapping it in a 6,000lb shipping container,” he said. “For some reason we think that is a good way to move through a city. If Amazon used that rationale it would be out of business in a week.”Alarm has also been raised over the safety of SUVs, given that during accidents their elevated stature tends to strike pedestrians and cyclists on the upper torso and then crushes them under the wheels. “They are killing machines,” said Miller. “They cause a lot of damage to the global climate, to air quality and to the people they hit. SUVs are terrible for cities and neighborhoods, they serve no purpose there. You don’t need them to run to the store to buy a gallon of milk.”Taming SUV emissions will largely come down to fuel efficiency improvements and a significant shift to electric versions. Firms including Nissan, General Motors and, of course, Tesla have started to roll out electric SUVs, nudging the driving range up to 300 miles without a charge. But the challenge is steep – today, only about one in every 100 vehicles sold in the US is electric, recharging stations are still sparse and the price of oil – and therefore gasoline at the pump – has recently plummeted to record lows.A deeper-rooted reform would involve a reimagining of US towns and cities as places largely without cars, a previously unthinkable scenario before the pandemic emptied streets and saw outdoor diners, skateboarders and strolling couples take their place on the reclaimed tarmac. The crisis of 2020 has given Americans a glimpse of a different sort of urban life, one more readily associated with Amsterdam or Venice, although there is little sign the clamor for SUVs is weakening.“Most Americans can’t imagine anything else other than highways and crappy public transit. It’s all they’ve ever seen,” said Miller. “Now that SUVs are here they are difficult to unwind but if we want sustainable, healthy cities we have to do it.”“The dominance of SUVs is only going to stretch,” said Brinley. “We will just see them as the norm.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5f55e2faacd9260feda7f68db8ce8cbe3373ba6/0_0_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84cd9ceadf6c6adb200ba6269e7f47f8","title":"french adapt to new coronavirus law on workplace face masks","story":"Face coverings now mandatory ‘in all shared and enclosed spaces’ as Covid-19 infections rise in FranceIt had not – really not – been a pleasant experience. Queuing for their banh mi and bibimbap, sushi or Thai salad outside the fast-food takeaways of the Rue Saint-Lazare, young office workers in central Paris spoke with one voice.“I thought I wasn’t going to last an hour, it was so uncomfortable,” said Egé, gesturing at her blue surgical mask. “Hot, sweaty, the smell of your own breath … Just very unpleasant. But you get used to it. In any case, we have no choice.”The new French law requiring almost all employees to wear face masks in the workplace was reportedly so difficult to draft that it was finally published just before 9pm on Monday night, less than 12 hours before it came into force.With coronavirus infections surging to an average of more than 5,000 new cases a day and evidence showing the workplace is the biggest source of transmission, the law made masks mandatory “in all shared and enclosed spaces” from Tuesday morning.“The only exception for office workers is if you happen to be alone in a room – or you’re lucky enough to have your own enclosed office,” said Jean-Philippe, who works alongside Egé in the Paris headquarters of a mobile navigation app developer.In areas where the virus is most active, such as the greater Paris region, workers may remove their face coverings for short periods – but only when there is an approved ventilation system, and no more than one employee for every 4 sq metres of office space.Anne-Laure, an accountant at the head offices of the BHV-Galeries Lafayette retail group on the Rue du Châteaudun, said that, like many employers, hers was now encouraging staff to work from home two days a week.“That way, no more than half the workforce is in the office at any one time and it should all be a bit more bearable,” she said. “You have to adapt, don’t you? My top tip: a cotton mask is way easier. I tried a surgical one, but only for half an hour. Horrible.”Face masks covering the nose, mouth and chin were made obligatory in all public areas – indoors and outdoors – throughout the French capital and surrounding region last Friday, meaning a quick mask-free breather on the street is also now banned.“You can take it off to drink or eat, though,” said Martin, a cybersecurity technician, sitting down in front of a plate of steak-frites on the terrace of the brasserie on the Rue Taitbout and tearing off his mask with visible relief.“Look, I used to be a policeman. I think rules are there to be obeyed. But I also think I’m going to be eating out a bit more than I used to for the next few months. I know it’s for the common good, but wearing this all day long is not easy.”Laurent Pietraszewski, France’s junior minister in charge of health and safety at work, said on Monday that companies – and employees – would be allowed a few days’ grace to ensure the new rules are adhered to. Thereafter, they should expect the inspectors to be checking on them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a55a5fa1cae8ebe05d272c119cf0e2645a92ea5d/280_0_1940_1166/master/1940.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b85c00a87b0d6dea201d4959567aba73","title":"music mogul akon going ahead with futuristic akon city in senegal","story":"US-Senegalese star says smart city will be built in mould of fictional nation WakandaThe US-Senegalese music mogul Akon has said he is pressing ahead with lofty plans to create a futuristic Pan-African smart city in Senegal next year, built in the mould of Wakanda - the fictional, technologically advanced African nation depicted in the Marvel blockbuster Black Panther.The 2,000-acre, surrealist, solar-powered “Akon City”, backed by the Senegalese government and funded by unnamed investors, was first announced by Akon in 2018.On Monday, Akon, whose real name is Aliaune Thiam, announced alongside Senegal’s minister for tourism, Alioune Sarr, that he had laid the first stone for the city in Mbodiene, a coastal village 62 miles from the capital Dakar.The plans depict gleaming skyscrapers, shopping malls, music studios and eco-friendly tourist resorts. They envisage that “Akoin”, a cryptocurrency founded by the R\u0026ampB star, would be the central currency. Akon City is not the first major development announced by the singer for Africa. Previous plans and grand promises have attracted criticism on the continent and questions around transparency. Sarr hailed Akon’s launch for coming at a time when private investment in the west African country is scarce and badly needed, following the economic pain wrought by the coronavirus outbreak.Akon said the city would provide opportunities for Senegalese people and an alternative home for African Americans facing racial discrimination. Few details of the project have been made public. Investors for the estimated $6bn scheme could not be named after signing non-disclosure agreements, but a third of the funding has been secured, Akon said. The singer has in the past dodged questions about how his cryptocurrency will be viable in the planned city, saying he would leave it to “the geeks” to work out.According to the US-based consulting and engineering firm KE International, it has been contracted to create the city, which “will define a new paradigm in design and architecture for Africa”.Plans are being considered to franchise the project to other countries in Africa, replicating smart-cities, such as the Mwale Medical and Technological City scheme in Kenya. The singer, born in the US to Senegalese parents and who grew up in Senegal, has been evangelical on the potential of African countries to redevelop and reduce dependency on western countries.In 2014, he announced “Light up Africa”, a charity initiative in partnership with the World Bank and governments to subsidise solar power and provide electricity to 600 million people in rural communities, more than half of the continent’s then population. The project claims to have helped more than 32 million people in 25 countries to gain access to basic electricity through solar energy.Questions around Akon’s operations in Africa grew when in 2015 he claimed to have manipulated African leaders. “In Africa, you’ve gotta manipulate them. You have to,” he told an Africa Day celebration at Coca-Cola, describing challenges in persuading African leaders to part-fund the projects.In 2018, he said his Akoin currency, which relies on smartphone use, would become a “stable currency alternative throughout Africa”. Yet it has faced questions around its access in low income countries where data is expensive. Only a third of people in Senegal use a smartphone, according to the Pew Research Centre.Michael Kimani, the chairman of the Blockchain Association of Kenya, dismissed the Akoin plans as “pie-in-the-sky” since it would need widespread usage across Africa to work.Work on the city is scheduled to start early next year, with completion of the first phase set for 2023. The plans say the town will initially cover 55 hectares (135 acres) but grow to 500 hectares by the end of the decade, with plans for artificial islands and a marina that can accommodate cruise ships.Sarr said he hoped the project would give the lie to “Cassandras … who always view new projects as pipe dreams” and vowed to help make sure it was completed on schedule."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59701dd07b1fd37b4ad866672875f165d1e0ae82/0_347_6302_3783/master/6302.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=017d12b6de33d31179f8374708a9fda3","title":"wanted thick skinned maverick director general to head up world trade organization","story":"As Roberto Azevêdo steps down early, eight candidates step up for poisoned chalice of being WTO director generalWanted: someone to step in and turn around a big and failing multilateral organisation.

Plus a good dollop of luck.The job description for director general of the World Trade Organization did not quite go like that, but none of the eight people who have put themselves forward to succeed Brazil’s Roberto Azevêdo are in any doubt as to the extent of the challenge.Ground down by seven years in the role, Azevêdo quit the WTO on Friday a year early and has moved seamlessly to a job on the board of the US soft drinks company Pepsi. The first phase of the struggle to replace him ends on 7 September by which time it is thought the eight candidates – including the former UK international trade secretary Liam Fox – will have had enough time to make their pitches and the selection process begins. Over the next two months the intention is to whittle the eight down to five and then two before the lucky – or perhaps unlucky – winner is announced.The WTO’s problem is simple: it has two functions – to negotiate global trade deals among its 164 members and to act as the arbiter of trade disputes – but has struggled to do either in recent years.The eight candidates to be the next director-general of the World Trade Organization are:Amina Mohamed:\u0026nbspthe Kenyan candidate knows her way round Geneva and is a former chair of the WTO’s general council. Currently cabinet minister for sports heritage and culture, Mohamed was Kenya’s foreign minister between 2013 and 2018.\u0026nbspChances:\u0026nbspjoint frontrunner.Jesús Seade Kuri:\u0026nbspMexico’s choice has a long career in trade negotiations stretching back to the days of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the forerunner to the WTO. More recently, he was involved in the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement between Mexico, Canada and the US.\u0026nbspChances:\u0026nbspShould make the first cut.Mohammad Maziad\u0026nbspal-Tuwaijri:\u0026nbspRiyadh’s pick for the job is a former Saudi air force pilot who worked in banking for JP Morgan and HSBC but currently advises the Saudi royal family on international and domestic economic policy.\u0026nbspChances:\u0026nbspWill struggle to make the first cut.Yoo Myung-hee:\u0026nbspSouth Korea’s trade minister is a veteran of trade negotiations and took charge of WTO affairs for her country when it was set up in 1995. More recently, she has been responsible for negotiating free trade agreements, including the one with the UK.\u0026nbspChances:\u0026nbsppotential dark horse.Liam Fox:\u0026nbspthe Brexit-supporting MP was made international trade secretary by Theresa May in 2016 but was ousted by Boris Johnson in his 2019 reshuffle. The former defence secretary twice ran unsuccessfully to be leader of the Conservative party and was chosen as Britain’s nominee in preference to the former EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson.\u0026nbspChances:\u0026nbspslim.Abdel-Hamid Mamdouh:\u0026nbspThe ultimate trade insider, Mamdouh’s experience of trade talks stretches back to the mid-1980s when he was the Egyptian negotiator at the Gatt. He later became an official at the WTO and ran the services ision. Holder of both Egyptian and Swiss nationality.\u0026nbspChances:\u0026nbspoutsider.Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala:\u0026nbspNigeria’s candidate spent 25 years at the World Bank, eventually rising to number two in the Washington-based organisation. Okonjo-Iweala was a strong voice against corruption during her two terms as her country’s finance minister and was also foreign minister.\u0026nbspChances:\u0026nbspjoint favourite despite no trade background.Tudor\u0026nbspUlianovschi:\u0026nbspThe youngest of the WTO hopefuls, at 37, Ulianovschi was a diplomat before briefly becoming Moldova’s foreign minister between 2018 and 2019. He gained experience of how Geneva works during his time as Moldova’s representative at the WTO.\u0026nbspChances:\u0026nbsprank outsider.\u0026nbspLarry ElliottNext November, it will be 20 years since the WTO launched the Doha development round, with the avowed aims of extending free trade to new areas such as services and expanding the benefits to the least developed countries. Officially, the intention is still to complete the Doha round but in reality the members gave up on the idea years ago.Under Azevêdo, the WTO has tended to focus on plurilateral deals, essentially coalitions of the willing where small groups of countries try to cut deals in areas, such as e-commerce, where there is some prospect of finding agreement.Finding common ground for anything more than a limited agenda of liberalisation has proved impossible. The US, backed by the EU, says China, now the world’s second-biggest economy, should no longer get special treatment for its trade. Beijing says it should because its per capita incomes are much lower than those in the west.This argument has been rumbling away for years. The issue that has brought the WTO’s problems to a head involves the seemingly arcane question of how to settle trade disputes. Under the WTO’s rules any argument between member states over alleged unfair practices are decided by a panel, with the losing side having the right to appeal.The rulings made by the WTO’s appellate body have become controversial. The US, and other countries, are unhappy about the tendency of the judges to make rulings that make trade law rather than simply interpret the existing rules. So upset has Washington become over what it sees as an infringement of its sovereignty that it has blocked the appointment of new judges to the disputes panel, depriving it of a quorum.Add in a collapse of global trade caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and the increasingly tense trade relationship between the US and China and all the ingredients are in place for a perfect storm. The atmosphere in Geneva has become so poisonous that it proved impossible for members even to agree which of Azevêdo’s four deputies should act as temporary WTO head while a new director general was chosen. As a result, all four are jointly in charge.Richard Kozul-Wright, the director of the globalisation isions at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, said: “The WTO has seen a huge haemorrhaging of trust on all sides. It doesn’t need a technocrat. It needs someone who can restore a bit of faith in the institution. That’s what’s needed.” The candidate who ticks the right boxes, Kozul-Wright says, is Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, a former Nigerian finance minister with a reputation as a skilled political operator and fighter against corruption. Her strongest rival is the Kenyan trade expert Amina Mohamed, who has worked at the WTO. Either would be the first African and the first woman to hold the post.The chances of one of the two getting the job are relatively good, but is likely to have as much to do with global politics as with their suitability. Mexico’s candidate will probably be ruled out because a Latin American has just held the post. Fox is supported by the US, which according to one Geneva insider might be the kiss of death. The Moldovan, Saudi Arabian and Egyptian candidates lack an obvious power base. That leaves the South Korean trade minister, Yoo Myung-hee, who would be a good compromise candidate were it not for her country’s fraught relations with two big neighbours: China and Japan.Every candidate has said the WTO needs reform if it is to survive, but according to Kozul-Wright that might not be sufficient. The hostility towards China exists across the US political spectrum and will not disappear if Joe Biden defeats Donald Trump in November. Most trade, he says, takes place within three blocks – east Asia, North America and western Europe, and involves big corporations struggling to secure and maintain intellectual property rights.When it was created a quarter of a century ago, the WTO pledged to raise living standards, ensure full employment and ensure there was enough effective demand to facilitate open trade in goods and services. “No one thinks it has anywhere lived up to its claims,” Kozul-Wright said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/587704b94b3f0fa2dd863e1a1b565c7efb428d99/0_91_4121_2474/master/4121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20db4436d9545e14ee123855e8ad88a9","title":"coronavirus live news who says states cant pretend pandemic is over french cases rise 50 in august","story":"Cuban authorities launched a strict 15-day lockdown of Havana on Tuesday in order to stamp out the low level but persistent spread of coronavirus in the capital. Aggressive anti-virus measures, including closing down air travel, have virtually eliminated Covid-19 in Cuba with the exception of the capital, where cases have increased from a handful a day to dozens daily over the last month.Starting Tuesday, Havana is under a 7pm to 5am curfew. Most stores are barred from selling to shoppers from outside the immediate neighbourhood to prevent people from moving around the city. Gas stations cannot sell gas to privately owned vehicles, another measure meant to reduce mobility. Police stationed on every road leaving Havana are charged with stopping everyone who doesn’t have a special travel permit, meant to be issued only in extraordinary circumstances. Some provinces that have had no new cases for weeks have detected them in recent days, often linked to travellers from Havana. The start of the school year is also indefinitely delayed in Havana, even as schools open in the rest of Cuba.Madrid’s city council has announced that the capital’s 3,800 parks and green spaces will be closed from 10pm until 6am in a move to halt the spread of the virus. The measure will come into force immediately. Police in Madrid are also cracking down on botellones, or street drinking parties, which can facilitate the spread of the virus. The Madrid region has accounted for about a third of the 96,000 infections recorded in Spain over the past two weeks.Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador defended his handling of the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic on Tuesday, arguing in a major speech that the economy has fared better than some of its peers.López Obrador has resisted pressure to borrow to support the economy or bail out companies on the brink of collapse, while picking fights with some businesses.“We have faced the pandemic and we are going to get out of the economic crisis without taking on additional external debt and without allocating public money to immoral bailouts,” he said. López Obrador has forecast that the economy will follow a V-shaped trajectory, meaning a sharp slump followed by an equally sharp recovery. “Fortunately this is happening, the worst is over and now we are recovering. Lost jobs are already recovering, production is slowly returning to normal and we are already beginning to grow,” he said. The French health ministry has reported 4,982 new confirmed coronavirus cases, up on the 3,082 reported on Monday, but below the highs of nearly 7,400 seen last week. The number of people who have died from Covid-19 infections increased by 26 to 30,661, and the cumulative number of cases now totals 286,007. Colombia’s lockdown has been lifted, with highways and domestic airports across the South American nation opening for the first time since coronavirus restrictions were announced over five months ago.The lockdown, like others across Latin America, was among the longest in the world. Leaders across the planet’s most unequal region shut their economies down in late March, in some cases when only a handful of cases had been confirmed. At the time, many were watching the collapse of health infrastructure in Italy and Spain.On Tuesday many Colombians celebrated their regained freedom while calling on each other to continue to follow health guidelines, which include wearing a mask in public and maintaining social distancing where possible.“The lockdown is over!” one person wrote on Twitter, echoing thesentiments of many others on the platform. “God be with us for thisnext stage.”Another cautioned: “Quarantine is over but not the pandemic … please we must take care of one another.”President Ivan Duque offered similar warnings in a televised addresson Monday night, ahead of loosening restrictions. “We must be clearthat the virus has not gone away, not here nor anywhere in the world, and for that reason we can’t let our guard down,” Duque said.Though restrictions have been loosened, Colombia continues to berattled by the coronavirus. The country has confirmed 615,168 cases of Covid-19, while the confirmed death total will likely pass the grimmilestone of 20,000 by Wednesday night.Some restrictions, such as the closure of gyms and places of worship,will continue in cities where the infection rate is high, includingBogotá, the capital, which has borne the brunt of Colombia’s outbreak. Others, such as second city Medellín, will see restaurants reopen.Greek authorities have delayed the reopening of schools by a week to 14 September because of a surge in Covid-19 infections, the government has said. The rise in coronavirus cases in recent weeks has forced Greek authorities to gradually reimpose restrictions to curb the spread of Covid-19, during the peak tourism season. The capital Athens and many popular islands have been affected. Government spokesman Stelios Petsas said the extension was necessary for families to return to big cities from summer vacations and spend some time at home before children get back to class.“We urge all parents to return with the children to their homes in the coming days and to make sure they stay safe ... until lessons resume,” Petsas said. Mask wearing will be mandatory in all indoor spaces of schools across the country. Greece has reported 207 new Covid-19 infections since Monday, raising the total number to 10,524. It has recorded a total of 271 Covid-related deaths, including five since Monday.Amazon owned Whole Foods Market, has opened its first delivery-only store in Brooklyn, New York, as the e-commerce giant looks to take greater advantage of a coronavirus-induced surge in online grocery shopping. Amazon said it had hired hundreds of employees to work at the new store, which will deliver to customers only in the Brooklyn area. Afraid to step out of home during the pandemic, people are using their phones and computers to order bread, milk, vegetables and daily household essentials. This has boosted online business of retailers such as Walmart Inc and Target Corp. Grocery delivery is one of the fastest-growing businesses at Amazon, with online sales tripling in the second quarter this year. The company bought Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.7 billion.In the US, public tours of the White House, halted nearly six months ago because of the coronavirus outbreak, are to resume later this month with new health and safety policies in place.Tours will begin again on 12 September, for two days a week instead of five, and for just a few hours a day, the first lady’s office has announced. The number of visitors will also be capped. In order to ensure the safety and health of all visitors, there have been new policies implemented that align with the guidance issued by federal, state, and local officials, the White House said.All guests over the age of two will be required to wear a face covering and practice social distancing. Social distancing dots will be placed on the ground to guide guests during check-in, and hand sanitizer will be available in multiple locations.National Park Service workers, US Secret Service officers and staff from the White House visitors office along the tour route will wear face coverings and gloves, and encourage social distancing while interacting with guests.Hungary has resealed its borders, implementing measures even stricter than those at the height of the pandemic in spring. For at least the month of September, the country is closed to almost everyone except Hungarian citizens and residents, and even they must quarantine on arrival. Previously, Hungary had a series of travel corridors with “green” EU countries, and the country’s tourism sector had begun to pick up in recent weeks. Hungary has done better than many European countries at controlling the virus, with a total of just 6,257 cases as of Tuesday. However, new daily cases have risen from just a handful each day earlier in August to more than 100 a day over the past week. Announcing the move over the weekend, prime minister Viktor Orbán said a second coronavirus wave is “knocking on the door” and that preventing it calls for “serious measures”. On Monday, the country made an exception for citizens of three other central European countries providing they have a negative coronavirus test. Citizens of all other countries cannot enter even if they have negative tests and are prepared to quarantine.The move drew criticism from Brussels, where politicians have been moving away from blanket border closures towards more targeted travel bans combined with contact tracing. Some saw it as the latest in a series of attempts by Orbán to blame foreigners or migrants for Hungary’s troubles. “Maybe Mr Orban should consider if he wants to be a member of the EU. If you are a member of a team, you play by the rules,” Dutch MEP Sophie in’ t Veld told Euronews.A person on a poorly ventilated Chinese bus infected nearly two dozen other passengers with coronavirus even though many weren’t sitting close by, according to research that offers fresh evidence the disease can spread in the air.Health authorities had initially discounted the possibility that simply breathing could send infectious micro-droplets into the air, but did a U-turn as experts piled on pressure and evidence mounted.The article published Tuesday in JAMA Internal Medicine explores the threat of airborne infection by taking a close look at passengers who made a 50-minute trip to a Buddhist event in the eastern Chinese city of Ningbo aboard two buses in January before face masks became routine against the virus.Researchers believe a passenger, whose gender was not identified, was likely patient zero because the person had been in contact with people from Wuhan, the city where the contagion emerged late last year.The scientists managed to map out where the other passengers sat, and also test them for the virus, with 23 of 68 passengers subsequently confirmed as infected on the same bus.What is notable is that the sickness infected people in the front and back of the bus, outside the perimeter of 1-2 metres that authorities and experts say infectious droplets can travel.On top of that, the sick passenger was not yet showing symptoms of the disease, such as a cough, when the group made their trip to a religious event.Researchers also noted the airconditioning simply recirculated the air inside the bus, which likely contributed to spreading of the virus.Hello, I am running the ’s live feed bringing you the latest news and comment on coronavirus from around the globe.

Fears within the travel industry are growing that Britain will reimpose a quarantine for people travelling from Portugal, as coronavirus cases in the country fluctuate. Reuters reports:It has been less than two weeks since Britain, Portugal’s leading source of tourism, lifted a 14-day self-isolation rule for travellers arriving from Portugal.Last Thursday, health authorities reported 401 new infections, the highest since early July. Cases have since dropped, with 231 on Tuesday, bringing the total to 58,243.British ambassador Chris Sainty said on Monday the embassy has been working closely with Portuguese authorities to understand the situation but “things can change quickly”. He tweeted:British media reports said the number of daily cases in Portugal meant it may be forced back on to the quarantine list. A spokesman for the prime minister, Boris Johnson, declined to comment.Eliderico Viegas president of Algarve’s AHETA hotel association said he was worried about the prospect of a new quarantine.

But Williamson received very little criticism from Conservatives in the chamber, despite the fact that his U-turn over A level grades last month created abysmal headlines for the government.That’s all from me for today.Our coronavirus coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. It’s here.The government has published its latest daily coronavirus death toll for the UK. A further three deaths have been recorded.According to this chart, there have now been 41,504 UK coronavirus deaths, but this only counts people who have died within 28 days of testing positive. There are more than 10,000 more deaths that have been attributed to coronavirus, according to the ONS or other bodies, but are not included in this figure because the people who died were never tested.Today’s dashboard also shows that 1,295 more people have tested positive. Daily case numbers have now been increasing significantly since early July. As my colleague Nicola Davis explains here, this increase is partly, but not wholly, explained by the fact that testing is increasing too.In the Commons Bob Blackman, a Conservative, asks if the government is considering extending the school day for half an hour to allow pupils to catch up with the schooling they’ve missed.Williamson says that longer school hours, or even schooling at weekends, could benefit the children who need most help. But he implies that he will not be recommending this across the board. He says the government has a catch-up fund. But it will be for inidual schools to decide what they do, he says.Robert Halfon, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons education committee, says his committee published a report in July saying next year’s exams should be delayed.He says all pupils in school should be benchmarked, to help the decision as to whether exams should be delayed.Williamson says the government will be doing this to identify the “learning gaps” that children have.Williamson is responding to Green.He says he is pleased Labour wants children back in school. He says Green’s predecessor, Rebecca Long-Bailey, was “more ambivalent” about this.He says the government has already delivered a £1bn Covid catch-up fund. This will be spent on interventions that deliver results, he says.As for delaying next year’s exams, he says he said earlier this year that he would be asking Ofqual to look at this. Labour has not made a submission to Ofqual on this matter, he says. So he says he welcomes the fact that Labour is now backing his position on this.Kate Green, the shadow education secretary, is responding to Williamson now. She says there has been a “summer of chaos, incompetence and confusion that has caused enormous stress” to parents, pupils and teachers.She says Labour wants pupils in schools.She says Williamson was right to allow teacher-assessed grades to apply.But this approach still creates problems, she says.She asks Williamson to clarify when he was warned about the problems with the system.How many pupils missed a place at their first choice university?And how many universities are losing students because they are now going somewhere else?Turning to school reopening, Green asks when schools will start to get the support they need to help pupils catch up.She says she was glad to read that the government is considering delaying exams next summer. (See 9.48am.) But will plans for this be in place by the end of this month?Williamson is now speaking about school opening.He says pupils and parents should be assured they are returning to a safe environment.He says whole-year groups will be kept separate. In addition, other measures are in place to protect health. And schools are being issued with PPE equipment, in case a pupil develops symptoms when they are on the premises.Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, is making a statement to MPs.He starts by addressing the exam results situation.He says Ofqual put in place a system for allocated grades “that was believed to be fair and robust”. But too many of the results were unfair, he says. And that is why the rules were changed, and students were allowed to keep the grades assessed by their teachers.Williamson repeats his apology to students. He says he is “deeply sorry” for what they went through.He says some students will still be unhappy with their grades. And for some student, such as those who are home educated, there was not enough evidence available to allow them to have a grade. For this group, exams will be available.He says universities have agreed to give places to students who have got their grades where possible. Where that is not possible, they will offered alternative courses or allowed to defer for a year.He says Sally Collier, who was head of Ofqual, has decided that the next stage of the process should be overseen by someone else. He says he wishes her well.Downing Street has released a further extract from what Boris Johnson told the cabinet at the start of their meeting this morning. He defended the various government policy changes announced over recent weeks and months (or “U-turns”, as they are normally called by the media) on the grounds that the government had to respond to changing circumstances. Overall, the government had not been “blown off course”, he claimed. He said:In the last few months we’ve been sailing into the teeth of a gale, no question.And I am no great nautical expert but sometimes it is necessary to tack here and there in response to the facts as they change, in response to the wind’s change, but we have been going steadily in the direction, in the course we set out, and we have not been blown off that course.And that is thanks to you, to the government, but it is overwhelming with thanks to the British people and the way they have come together, the way the whole country has come together to defeat the virus, so thank you all for everything that you have done.And of course I think there is still going to be some turbulence ahead, and of course things are still going to be difficult on the economic front, and of course we still need to get this disease absolutely out of our systems, but I am absolutely confident that, if we continue in the way that we have, that there will be calmer days, brighter days and calmer seas ahead of us.Last week we published a list of 11 coronavirus U-turns. Some of them could be justified on the grounds that the government was responding to changing circumstances (for example, the UK scientific advice on face coverings has changed over recent months) but many of these decisions (eg, school meal vouchers, the A-level algorithm) were simply cases of the government admitting that its initial decisions were wrong.These figures undermine Boris Johnson’s claim earlier (see 11.20am) that “people are going back to the office in huge numbers”.Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary who now chairs the Commons health committee, asks if the government intends to roll out regular weekly testing for NHS staff.Hancock says he wants to deploy testing as widely as possible, following clinical advice.Hancock is responding to Ashworth.He says he “bows to no one” in his enthusiasm for mass testing. He says he pushed his neck out when he set the 100,000 tests per day target. Now the government needs to increase testing again, he says.But he says he will only use tests that have been validated. Saliva tests are still being worked on, he says.Turning to local testing, he says local lockdowns are working. And the government does publish the data used to justify them, he says.He says councils are required to seek consensus with local elected officials, including MPs, before announcing local lockdowns. But he says in some cases it is not possible to reach a consensus.On vaccines, he says MPs are at one in their “abhorrence” at the anti-vax movement. He says a vaccine will only be rolled out when it has been approved by regulators.Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, is responding to Hancock.He says the government’s test and trace system is now yet “world-beating”, as Boris Johnson promised. (See 3.26pm.)He says Hancock now seems to support mass testing. When will weekly testing by introduced for all frontline NHS workers?He asks when a rapid test will be introduced, and who will be able to get it first? And will a saliva test be rolled out?He asks why Hancock ignored local council leaders, but followed the advice of the Tory MP Sir Graham Brady, chair of the backbench Conservative 1922 Committee, when he agreed to lift some restrictions in the north-west.And he asks why Hancock thinks restructuring Public Health England now will help.Ashworth ends by saying that the UK has suffered by the highest per capita death rate from coronavirus of any developed country in the world.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is now making a statement to MPs about coronavirus.He says the number of deaths is now very low. The latest daily death toll recorded just two deaths, he says.But he says that in France and Spain the number of cases is increasing “exponentially”. And he says hospital cases are going up too.He says the government must remain vigilant. He summarises the steps it is taking.It will be reminding people what they can do to stop the spread of the virus. An advertising campaign will remind people to wash their hands, cover their faces in certain places and socially distance. And people who are ill should get a test, he says.He says testing and contact tracing continues. Some 60m tests have been carried out, he says.He says the government is looking at new technology to improve testing.More financial support is being made available, from today, for people who need to self-isolate, he says.And he says that work is continuing on a vaccine. And he says the government will bring forward plans so that, when a vaccine does become available, a wider range of medical personnel are allowed to vaccinate people.During a wide-ranging statement on the Scottish government’s programme for 2020-21, that includes a commitment to youth training, the expansion of digital access for poorer households, green investment and a review of adult social care to examine options for the creation a National Care Service investment, Nicola Sturgeon said that, if she was governing an independent country and not having to deal with the “self-sabotage” of Brexit, she could contemplate even more far-reaching plans, including “a migration system that welcomes talent at all levels and supports people to make Scotland their home” and a universal basic income.She pledged that, by next spring, her government would publish a draft bill “setting out the proposed terms and timing of an independence referendum”, as well as the proposed question that people will be asked in that referendum. She added that at next May’s Holyrood elections – in which the SNP are already predicted to win a majority – “we will make the case for Scotland to become an independent country, and seek a clear endorsement of Scotland’s right to choose our own future”.In a move welcomed by children’s campaigners, Sturgeon announced what she described as “one of the most ambitious pieces of legislation in the 20 year history of devolution”: the full and direct incorporation into Scots law of the United Nations convention on the rights of the child. She said:This will mean public authorities - including the Scottish government - will be required by law to act in ways compatible with the convention’s requirements to recognise, respect and be accountable for the rights of children in what we do.Sturgeon said that committing to the vision of a National Care Service would match the postwar National Health Service, and insisted that investment in youth training would ensure that COVID will not be the defining experience for this current generation of young people.Here is the full quote from Matt Hancock in the Commons earlier when he claimed that England’s test-and-trace system was now “in the top tranche” internationally. Hancock was responding to a question from the Conservative MP Jack Lopresti, who wanted to know how the country was doing by international standards. Hancock replied:Well, of course, we learn the lessons and I talk to my international counterparts including in Germany and South Korea. Actually, compared to international systems ... we are now absolutely in the top tranche and we’re constantly looking all around the world to how we can improve the operation of test and trace.In May Boris Johnson promised that a “world-beating” test-and-trace system would be up and running by 1 June. A national system did launch in England before the start of June, but in its early days it was widely criticised and, as this Twitter thread explains, in some respects it is still performing badly.

File photograph: The At least 55 cases of Covid-19 in August have been linked to some form of sporting activity, the Department of Health has said.The Health Protection Surveillance Centre, which monitors outbreaks of the virus, says those who have been infected have had 365 close contacts, with each case generating an average of 6.6 close contacts.Public health officials last night ruled out any immediate lifting of the ban on spectators at sporting events, which was imposed in mid-August. Acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said the focus for now was on making the reopening of schools work over the next few weeks, after which other measures would be examined.The GAA, which believes the measure will force spectators indoors to more risky environments, has asked officials to present the underlying evidence.Although no meeting has taken place between the GAA and the National Public Health Emergency Team, Dr Glynn said he was happy to meet all sporting bodies.Meanwhile, Cabinet is expected today to sign off on a plan to supply free flu vaccines to more than two million people.However, the delivery to Ireland of flu jabs is being delayed due to problems relating to Covid-19.Doses for 1.4 million adults will be made available from mid-September. For the first time, a mass vaccination of 600,000 children is planned, but this will not start until mid- to late October, it is understood. This is close to the recommended timeline of within two weeks of the annual flu season.With new figures showing Ireland’s incidence of Covid-19 higher than in Sweden, the UK, Germany and 14 other European countries, Dr Glynn defended public health emergency team’s response in recent months.With 30.6 cases per 100,000 population over the last fortnight, the incidence of the disease in Ireland is up to 12 times higher than it was two months ago, according to figures from the European Centre for Disease Control.However, Dr Glynn denied that public health officials had “taken their eye off the ball” and put the surge down to an “explosive” and “unusual” growth in clusters with “significant knock-on effects”.He admitted there were “some delays” in testing large clusters in Co Kildare but said these issue were being addressed and “lessons have been learned”. Ireland was “there with the best countries in Europe with testing”, he insisted.Businesses in Co Kildare yesterday welcomed the Government’s decision to lift restrictions imposed on the county last month following a steep rise in cases, initially linked to outbreaks in local meat processing plants.‘Apparent stabilisation’The decision was made despite Kildare still having the highest incidence of any county in the Republic, although the trend is downwards.A further 53 confirmed cases of Covid-19 were reported by public health emergency team on Monday evening, and no new deaths. Dublin accounted for 25 of the new cases and Limerick for 11.Dr Glynn said it was too early to read anything into the improvement seen in recent days but added that he was heartened by the “apparent stabilisation” in numbers.Any review of the green list of countries from which travellers do not have to quarantine on arriving in Ireland, is a matter for Government, he said.The public health emergency team has undertaken an internal review of its operations, according to Dr Glynn, and its role would be reviewed externally as part of the Government’s planned framework for tackling the disease.The US yesterday surpassed six million cases of Covid-19, including one million new infections in the past month.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Meat and dairy industries produce food for export but pollution at home, experts argueNorth\u0026rsquos Department of Health reports 49 new cases of Covid-19 on TuesdayManagement said infection had been picked up outside of primary schoolMichele Hallahan initially wanted to remain anonymousJudge hears case requires presence of 15 people but courtroom capacity assessed at 10Educate Together schools to be built on Rosyln Park College campus in SandymountControversial plans for \u0026lsquoschool profiling\u0026rsquo in calculated grades process to be dropped, Minister for Education confirmsCourt action has been brought by 17-year-old student from outside DublinAzzam Raguragui was stabbed five times at park in Dundrum, south Dublin, last yearUrsula von der Leyen requested gender balance in nominees to replace Phil HoganMark Crawford denies murdering Patrick O\u0026rsquoConnor in row over payment for cocaineLocal residents have said there has been an increase in positive coronavirus testsSimon Coveney, Mairead McGuinness and Frances Fitzgerald are in the race to succeed Phil Hogan in EuropeHeavy rain expected on Tuesday night and WednesdayCar failed to remain at crash site on Dublin\u0026rsquos North Wall Quay, garda\u0026iacute sayCoverings should cover the wearer\u0026rsquos nose and go under their chinThose who have been infected have had 365 close contacts, according to health watchdogBowel, cervical and breast checks way behind due to Covid-19 restrictionsSchool reopening has been \u0026lsquoa joyous occasion\u0026rsquo says Cork national school principalStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4343925.1598981488!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"a further 217 covid 19 cases reported in the highest daily figure since may","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPublic health officials admit there are some delays around testing. Photograph: iStockA further 217 Covid-19 cases have been reported in the State, and no further deaths, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) has confirmed.The number of cases recorded on Tuesday is the highest daily reported figure since May, according to acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn.There is now a total of 29,025 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Ireland. Validation of data resulted in the denotification of three cases, and the figure of 29,025 cases reflects this.There has been a total of 1,777 Covid-19-related deaths in Ireland.There are 103 cases in Dublin 25 in Kildare 17 in Limerick 17 in Tipperary seven in Waterford seven in Wicklow, six in Clare, five in Louth and the remaining 30 are located in Carlow, Cavan, Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kilkenny, Meath, Monaghan, Offaly, Roscommon, Westmeath and Wexford.Dr Glynn said the five-day moving average remained relatively stable at 115 cases per day. “However, this is still a substantial number of cases and I urge everyone to double down on their efforts now - wash hands regularly, physically distance from others, wear face coverings where appropriate, avoid crowded areas, know the symptoms, isolate and contact your GP if you have any concerns.” Of the 217 people confirmed on Tuesday to have coronavirus, 103 are men and 113 are women, while 70 per cent are under 45 years of age.A total of 51 per cent are confirmed to be associated with outbreaks or are close contacts of a confirmed case, while 19 cases have been identified as community transmission.The North’s Department of Health (DoH) reported 49 new cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday, bringing the total number of cases identified in Northern Ireland since the start of the pandemic to 7,294. No further deaths were reported, leaving the number of coronavirus-related fatalities recorded by the Department at 560. The greatest number of cases in the last seven days was in Belfast, where 140 cases were identified, followed by 93 in the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon council area. Earlier, the chairman of NPHET’s Irish Epidemiological Modelling Advisory Group defended regional restrictions on movement, saying they are an important line of defence against Covid-19.With 30.6 cases per 100,000 population over the last fortnight, the incidence of the disease in Ireland is up to 12 times higher than it was two months ago, according to figures from the European Centre for Disease Control.Businesses in Co Kildare welcomed the Government’s decision to lift restrictions imposed on the county last month following a steep rise in cases, initially linked to outbreaks in local meat processing plants.“You couldn’t draw a radius around a meat factory and say all the cases are here,” Prof Glynn told RTÉ’s radio’s Morning Ireland. Often county boundaries were the right boundaries to use for a local lockdown in order to ensure the virus did not spread widely in the community, he said.A regional lockdown was “the third or fourth thing one does” added Prof Nolan. It was entirely possible that there would be clusters that didn’t keep within a county. “You can’t expect what the geography will be.”Class in isolationA primary school class in south Armagh has been advised to self-isolate for 14 days after a pupil tested positive for coronavirus. Jonesborough Primary School informed parents in a letter on Monday that a pupil in the Primary 23 class had Covid-19. The school said details had been passed on to the North’s Public Health Agency (PHA), which would make direct contact with the parents of any other children who may have been in close contact with the affected pupil. The principal, Donal Keenan, told parents the classroom has been closed and will undergo an enhanced clean in the coming days. All other areas around the school remain unaffected. He said ensuring safety was his “absolute priority” and he appreciated the concerns of parents, pupils and the wider community and wished to reassure them “every precaution” has been taken. Cases in wardIt follows the confirmation last week that 10 patients in a haematology ward at Craigavon Area Hospital had tested positive for coronavirus, as well as eleven members of staff on the ward and in the hospital’s emergency department. On Tuesday the majority of pupils in the North returned to school, following a phased return which saw some pupils back in the classroom last week. Measures which have been put in place include social distancing and the creation of class “bubbles” to keep pupils separate, and it is “strongly recommended” that post-primary pupils and teachers should wear face coverings in corridors and communal areas. The North’s education minister, Peter Weir, told the BBC that while the situation would be monitored closely, it was “a good day for education and for all young people that we are able to get a third of a million children back into school.” While the priority would be to keep schools open, he said, there were “bound to be some bumps in the road” and there would be cases of coronavirus in schools. “Undoubtedly there’s likely to be some level of interruption in terms of education, but across the board I think we want to ensure that schools remain open,” he said. The North’s health minister, chief medical officer and chief scientific officer have all warned of the potential damage to children’s development and futures if they do not return to school.

The remainder will be either reduced (17 per cent) or increased (4 per cent).At a press conference at Government Buildings, Minister for Education Norma Foley said this move was the fairest and most appropriate way to calculate students’ grades.She said teachers estimated grades will be the “core” of students results.However, she said results will be standardised - or adjusted - to ensure students are treated fairly.\u0026nbspShe insisted disadvantaged students will not be impacted upon unfairly.Overall, the results are “stronger” than previous years.Ms Foley said this was acceptable on the basis of the situation facing this year’s Leaving Cert class.On the Government decision to drop so-called “school profiling”, Ms Foley said she had sought Cabinet approval to do so to help ensure students from disadvantaged backgrounds were not treated unfairly.“Taking out the school-by-school historical data from the standardisation process removes any risk that a Leaving Certificate student’s results can be impacted by the performance of Leaving Certificate classes in his or her school in previous years,” she said.“Your school will not determine the results that you get through standardisation this year.”Ms Foley added: “I am pleased that we have taken the time to get this right, and learned from others, and listened to the concerns of students.”Overall, the calculated grade results are set to be more generous than previous Leaving Cert results, according to new details released by the Department of Education.In all, about 60,000 Leaving Cert students are set to receive their calculated grade results at 9am on Monday next.They are based on a combination of teachers’ estimated marks for students and a standardisation process - which adjusts grades up or down - aimed at ensuring students are treated fairly.Government officials are hopeful that key differences with its approach will avoid the chaos and controversy witnessed in the UK when students’ calculated grades were released.In contrast to the UK, officials say the Irish system places a “very strong” emphasis on teachers’ grades rather than the standardisation process.They say the fact that the teachers’ grades in Ireland were based on per centage marks rather than grades means our system is more accurate.It also allows for strong students under lower performing schools to be recognised and contained safeguards to prevent any negative effects against disadvantaged schools.InflationThe move to allow more generous grades this year, however, is set to lead to grade inflation, which will impact negatively on up to 20,000 students who have applied for college this year on the basis of results in previous years.Officials say the release of an additional 1,000 higher education places this year is aimed at ensuring more students get their first choice and taking some of the heat out of the CAO points race.In addition, plans to include controversial “school profiling” in the calculated grades process - which took account of an inidual school’s track record in recent years - has been removed from the process.This step was taken after examining the UK’s experience, where disadvantaged students were more likely to be penalised with downgrades.A breakdown of the new calculated grades results now shows the proportion of downgrades for students in disadvantaged or Deis schools is smaller (13.6 per cent) compared to other schools (16.8 per cent).In addition,the proportion of upgrades in disadvantaged schools is slightly higher (5 per cent) compared to other schools (3.7 per cent).On the question of whether to use teachers’ estimated marks only without adjusting grades, officials say this would have posed equity issues on the basis that some teachers gave “over-optimistic” grades, while others “underestimated”.This, they say, would have resulted in some students unfairly receiving a higher or lower mark.The standardisation process, say officials, has prevented or lessened the chance of awarding “unrealistically high grades”.Officials say such uncontrolled jumps inmarks would mean that CAO points would rise very significantly, which would disadvantaged students in schools where teachers did not over-estimated their students’ marks.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4343801.1598979436!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"class sent home from dublin school after positive covid 19 test","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUnder HSE guidelines schools are not required to contact parents if there has been a confirmed Covid-19 case. Photograph: iStockA class has been sent home from a Dublin primary school following a confirmed case of coronavirus in recent days.In correspondence sent to parents the school stated “there has been a positive Covid-19 case with a pupil in your class”. The school is located in the south west of Dublin.The coronavirus case had been “contracted outside of school,” and sending the class of the pupil home was a “precautionary measure,” the school said.The pupils in the affected class were directed to remain at home and restrict their movements for 14 days, and public health officials would be making contact with parents in the next 48 hours, the email said.Parents were advised if children who had been in the class began to show symptoms of coronavirus they should contact a GP.The email to parents said siblings of any pupils in the affected class “may still come to school unless symptomatic or otherwise directed by public health.”In another email to parents, the school said it “continues its enhanced cleaning and the particular classroom has been deep cleaned”.Under HSE guidelines schools are not required to contact parents if there has been a confirmed case, with public health teams to inform the “close contacts” of the pupil or staff member of their need to self-isolate while awaiting testing.The correspondence from the school said it was informing all parents about the confirmed case “in keeping with our policy of open communication”.“Whilst we are informing parents of this first event, we will not be informing of each inidual further cases unless instructed by public health to do so,” the school said.The school told parents it was “inevitable” that cases of the virus would occur in schools, as they reopened across the country in recent days. Family members of a child with suspected Covid-19 symptoms have to self-isolate while the child is awaiting a test. However, this requirement would not extend to other children in the class sent home from the school, unless they begin to display symptoms. GuidelinesUnder current HSE guidelines all pupils in a class will not automatically be referred for testing if there is a confirmed coronavirus case.The number of students in a class deemed “close contacts” of pupils who test positive for Covid-19 and referred for testing will be “variable” to each classroom and school, HSE guidance states. In primary schools, where students are ided into smaller groups called “pods,” it is likely the other students in a pod would be deemed “close contacts” of a case. However, students in other pods in the classroom would not be, and as such would not be referred for testing. Pupils in the class sent home from the south-west Dublin primary school will only be referred for testing if they are deemed “close contacts” of the positive case by public health teams. The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) is understood to be considering introducing new, less invasive tests for children, as more cases and clusters are expected in schools in the coming weeks.The alternative tests would see swabs being taken from inside the cheek and nostril. It is understood the matter is still under discussion and it would be a number of weeks before NPHET make a decision on it.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4344002.1598978107!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"woman who won dream mayo cottage in a raffle is named","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Michele Hallahan, winner of the raffled cottage, pictured as she picked up the keys.

They wanted to do something significant after surviving Covid-19 earlier this year.They initially thought the raffle might yield about\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp€250,000 but just short of €1 million was raised with the money set to be used to fund educational bursaries for frontline healthcare support staff.Their decision to raise money for frontline healthcare workers, excluding doctor and nurses, sprang from a combination of their own recent experience of the virus, seeing friends and family around them affected by cancer, and a lifelong belief that support staff in hospitals do not get the recognition they deserve.“I am definitely going to keep it, it is my dream home,” Ms Hallahan said. “I lived in the US for 20 years and always dreamed that I would own a cottage like this close to the Atlantic but this has come like a bolt out of the blue,” she continued.She expressed the hope that she would be able to travel from her Dublin home to the cottage a couple of times a month and would also be able to stay there for extended periods. “Like most people now I am working remotely so I will be able to do my job from anywhere,” she said.Her siblings can also look forward to getting keys to the new cottage and will be able to use it as a holiday home, as will her friends.“It is just so brilliant, not only have I won but so much money was raised for charity and it is great so to see the health workers getting the recognition they deserve.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4343711.1598973289!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"explainer three scenarios in race to be ireland s next european commissioner","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has requested Ireland nominate a man and a woman for commissioner. Photograph: Olivier HosletReutersDiscussions are continuing between the party leaders today on the potential Irish nominee to the European Commission to replace Phil Hogan. With three names circulating, there are three potential scenarios.Scenario 1: The Government ignores the request from commission president Ursula von der Leyen to nominate a man and a woman and just forwards – as is its right under the European treaties – one name. It is likely to be Simon Coveney. But this would be received with some displeasure in Brussels and could affect the portfolio allocated to the new commissioner. While there has been extensive contact back and forth between Brussels and Dublin on the issue, Government sources acknowledge there will be no guarantee of a particular portfolio for any nominee. They also concede that the chances of retaining the trade job are slim. So in this scenario, there is a danger that Mr Coveney becomes commissioner alright, but in a job of little importance. That is the outcome sources say he wants to avoid at all costs.Scenario 2: The Government nominates Mr Coveney and Mairead McGuinness. Once there are two names sent to Brussels, the Government loses control of the eventual outcome. Dr von der Leyen is understood to rate McGuinness highly, but she is less favoured by Fine Gael ministers, who believe the job should go to one of them. They also say that the request for two names has no basis in the treaties, and that the commissison is already – at 14 to 12 – pretty well gender balanced. Ms McGuinness has also not served in the senior positions that Mr Coveney has, and so has less of a claim on a big portfolio. It would be a significant rebuff to a member state not to pick its foreign minister and former deputy foreign minister, but that is what some in Government fear would happen. From Mr Coveney’s point of view, this would be a political humiliation that he may not be prepared to risk.Scenario 3: The Government nominates Mr Coveney and Frances Fitzgerald. The former tánaiste and justice minister Fitzgerald confirmed her interest in the post yesterday. As a first-term MEP (she was elected to the European Parliament last year) she has less experience of Brussels than Ms McGuinness, but she is closer to Fine Gael ministers than her colleague and may be a more acceptable pick for them. But some people think she is a “decoy runner” – a credible nominee but unlikely to be chosen ahead of Mr Coveney by Dr von der Leyen. That still leaves the question of which portfolio the Irish nominee would be allocated.

Flexitarians – those who only occasionally eat meat and fish – probably do all three in the same week. But, positive as those purchasing decisions can be, there’s a risk of them masking a larger environmental impact: exports.Ireland exports about 90 per cent of its dairy and beef and half its pig meat. In 2019, dairy exports earned the country €4.9 billion, beef exports were worth €2.24 billion and pig meat exports €514 million.The figures are impressive. But the economic weight of those exports – mainly to the UK, the Netherlands, France and China – means Irish consumer influence on the environmental and animal welfare implications of their food may be limited.“People eating better food don’t tend to think about what is being exported,” says Dr Benjamin Ruddell, a food, energy and water expert at Northern Arizona University. He is one of a team of scientists working on the Fewsion Project, which studies the ways food, energy and water interact and move along supply chains.What Ruddell sees are “two global markets that are bifurcating, creating a disconnect between domestic consumers and their country’s agricultural systems”.On one track, says Ruddell, are the major agri-centres such as North America and Europe, where demand for more environmentally friendly foods is rising. On another are the lower-income, higher population growth, food importers, such as Africa and the Middle East, which are looking for the cheap dairy, meat and grain produced by those “agri-centres”.In the Irish context, according to Dr Michael Williams from the Centre for the Environment at Trinity College Dublin, that means “we are exporting cheap meat and dairy and living with the pollution that causes, especially from reactive nitrogen.” Nitrogen pollution, he adds, risks “human toxicity from nitrates in water supply, greenhouse gas emissions, ammonia in the air and eutrophication of lakes and rivers”.Williams agrees with sentiments in a June 2020 report from the US-based Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy called Milking the Planet. The report describes large-scale dairying in the US, Europe, New Zealand and India as “an extractive model of production” that is “heating up the planet and hollowing rural communities”.“Yes. High-volume dairy and livestock farms in Ireland can be compared to extractive industries like mining or oil production,” Williams says. Nor is it easy for Irish farmers to get out, he notes. “Europe is looking at boosting plant protein production, but there’s no real support for that here.”Race to the bottomMilking the Planet author Shefali Sharma describes the “mass production, export-dependent model” of dairy as a race to the bottom that damages rural communities and the environment. As dairy and meat processors get bigger and more powerful, Sharma says, they tend to drive prices below cost of production. The financial gap is typically filled, to some extent, by subsidies.“It’s a perverse system where we pay farms below cost and then use taxpayer money to bail them out,” she says. The result for farmers and communities can include high stress levels and indebtedness, Sharma believes.Asked its view of global food disconnects, Bord Bia said: “Irish meat and dairy processors supply both domestic and export markets.”It rejected concerns about intensive farming’s downsides for the environment and animal welfare, adding: “Irish beef and dairy production remains centred around the family farm.”Pippa Hackett, Minister of State with responsibility for land use and bioersity, is less sanguine, pointing first to Ireland’s inability to feed itself. Citing figures from 2017 as an example, she says Ireland imported more than 72,000 tonnes of potatoes, 47,000 tonnes of onions, 62,000 tonnes of apples, 23,000 tonnes of cabbage and 15,000 tonnes of lettuce – all food that could be grown in Ireland. Although dairy farming is economically viable, the sector needs to deal with a range of issues including environmental damage and animal welfare concerns, she adds.For Williams, one way forward would be to follow the EU’s lead and boost support for plant protein farming. Growing peas and beans has a dual benefit, he says. It offers Irish consumers and food producers a local source of high-quality plant protein, and provides “a natural nitrogen boost to soils”, reducing the need for synthetic fertiliser, one of the main sources of nitrate water pollution.Another useful action would be to cap synthetic nitrogen fertiliser use, says Dr Elaine McGoff, a natural environment and water expert with An Taisce.“EPA data shows dairy cow numbers have increased by 32 per cent since 2011, with fertiliser imports increasing by 38 per cent in a similar time period. Synthetic nitrogen fertiliser is a keystone of intensive dairy.” Without it, she adds, farmers find it hard to grow enough rye grass to feed expanding numbers.Broad implicationsCapping synthetic fertiliser use could have broad implications. On the production side, McGoff notes, it would help reduce the number of animals fed per hectare. That would help lower slurry volumes and the amount of ammonia gas – a nitrogen-based compound – released during slurry spreading. At the same time, it could encourage more precise nitrogen fertiliser use and reduce the nitrogen leaching into water supplies.Ahead of any caps, however, McGoff says she would like to see an analysis of the correlation between water quality, nitrate pollution and dairy farms, particularly those granted nitrogen derogations allowing them go beyond standard limits.“Until recently the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has not been able to access the necessary data from the Department of Agriculture to scientifically assess the link between nitrogen pollution and derogation farms,” she says.In its reply to the same question the department said it signed an agreement with the EPA in November 2019 to provide “a framework for enhanced co-operation” between it and the EPA, enabling “both organisations to evaluate agriculture impact on the environment”.Two maps provides indication of the links between dairy farming and nitrate pollution, while a recent US study has detailed significant human health risks from excessive levels of nitrates in drinking water.The EPA’s most recent water quality in Ireland report shows the highest concentration of inland water sites with nitrate levels of 8mg-25mg of nitrate per litre are in the south, east and southeast of the country. A map produced by the Irish Farmers’ Association, shows the greatest concentration of dairy cows in 2019 was in the same regions.DEPARTMENT REJECTS ‘EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRY’ LABELAlmost 18,000 farm families in Ireland are involved in production of high-quality consumer products and ingredients sold in 180 countries, according to the Department of Agriculture.Ireland’s maritime climate favours a grass-based system of production where forage, particularly pasture, “extends approximately 90 per cent of our utilised agricultural area and is the largest component of the Irish cow diet”, it points out.Typically grass forage accounts for 96 per cent of the diet on a fresh matter basis and 82 per cent of dry matter intake. Within the cows’ forage diet, grazed pasture is the dominant component and on average contributed 74-77 per cent to the average annual cow fresh matter diet.“Our capacity to grow grass has underpinned the development of our dairy and beef sectors, and allows for the production of a product where demand is largely driven by the quality appeal of the food produced here, with its low environmental footprint, its grass-based system of production and strict traceability and welfare criteria,” it added.This is not to say agriculture is off the hook when it comes to the environment, but rather that the sector is in a reasonable starting position, the department argues."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Activists calls on public to boycott scheme backed by Beijing due to lack of trustPeople

have contracted coronavirus. Photograph: Aaron ChownPA WireThe UK has recorded the highest number of new coronavirus cases since June 12th, with government figures reporting 1,522 positive cases.The number of new cases, which cover the 24 hours to 9am on August 27th, were up 474 on the previous day.The average number of cases confirmed in the past seven days stood at 1,155, the highest rolling average recorded since June 22nd.Both the daily case number and the seven-day rolling average are both higher than on 23 March , the day national lockdowns were announced (967 daily cases and 730 cases on a seven-dayrolling average).To date, there have been 57,200 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, according to figures from the UK’s three statistical bodies the Office for National Statistics, National Records of Scotland and Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency.On Tuesday the government reported 1,184 lab confirmed cases, which was up from Monday’s total of 853. The new figures mark the sixth day in a row that the seven-day average has increased.However, hospitalisations as a result of the virus remain low: just 767 people were in hospital due to Covid on August 25th, the lowest number of coronavirus patients since March 27th, the first day for which the government’s dashboard has data.The latest track and trace figures for the week to August 19th show 6,115 new people tested positive for Covid-19, an 8 per cent decrease on positive tests in the previous week. However, this weekly data is not as up-to-date as the figures for confirmed cases.Plymouth clustersClusters of new cases have been reported in Plymouth in recent days.Health officials have said that as many as 30 teenagers who took a holiday to the Greek island of Zante may have contracted coronavirus.At least 11 of a group of 18- and 19-year-olds in Plymouth have tested positive for Covid-19 and some had been for a night out in the Devon city since their return from their holiday.The council’s public health director, Ruth Harrell, said her team was working alongside the national systems to contact and trace the young people thought to have been affected.Many of the teenagers who tested positive showed no symptoms or very minor symptoms such as a sore throat after returning from the Greek island, which is not currently subject to UK quarantine rules.Plymouth city council said a further separate outbreak in a factory had been confirmed earlier this week.Ms Harrell added: “We are in contact with all the pubs and bars across the city to remind them of their frontline role in stopping the spread of this virus. They need to help us to protect the city. But it also needs everyone to help too.” – Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4332116.1597668041!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"inside joe biden s race of a lifetime to be us president","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden: Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesIt was late afternoon on February 2nd, the eve of the Iowa caucuses. We were jammed into a high-school gymnasium in Des Moines, the state capital, for Joe Biden’s closing rally.No one thought he would win the primary season’s talismanic opening contest the following day. Nor was he expected to come close to beating Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermonter, in New Hampshire the next week. Though he was still ahead in the national polls, the 77-year-old former vice-president was treated as yesterday’s news.A crowd of several hundred was waiting unexpectantly. Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"charlie hebdo republishes notorious mohammed caricatures eve","story":"Charlie Hebdo has republished a series of controversial cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed on the eve of the trial of the alleged accomplices in the attack.The drawings sparked fury in the Muslim world and prompted Islamist brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi to kill 12 people, including some of France\u0027s most celebrated cartoonists, at the satirical weekly\u0027s offices in Paris on January 7, 2015.In an editorial, director Laurent Riss Sourisseau, one of the few survivors of the attack, wrote: We will never lie down. We will never give up.The only reason not to republish them would, he added,  stem from political or journalistic cowardice.Rare are those who, five years later, dare oppose the demands that are still so pressing from religions in general, and some in particular, he wrote.The assailants were killed in the wake of the massacre but 14 people go on trial in Paris on Wednesday over the attack and two others on a policewoman and four people in a  Jewish supermarket that took place over the two following days.The cover of the latest Charlie Hebdo issue features a dozen cartoons first published by the Danish daily Jyllands-Posten in 2005 - and then reprinted by Charlie Hebdo in 2006 - which triggered fury across the Muslim world.Centre-page on the cover is a cartoon of the prophet penned by Jean Cabut, known as Cabu, who died in the massacre. The front-page reads: All of this, just for that.Its editorial team insisted that it was essential to republish the cartoons as the trial opens.We have often been asked since January 2015 to print other caricatures of Mohammed, it said.We have always refused to do so, not because it is prohibited - the law allows us to do so - but because there was a need for a good reason to do it, a reason which has meaning and which brings something to the debate.The French Council of the Muslim Faith wrote on Twitter: The freedom to caricature and the freedom to dislike them are enshrined and nothing justifies violence. It advised Muslims to simply ignore them.The paper\u0027s caustic satire and anti-clericalism has seen it hailed a champion of free speech for many in France.The massacre united the country in grief with the slogan #JeSuisCharlie (I Am Charlie) going viral.However, a recent poll suggested that half the French now support the “right to criticise a religious belief, symbol or dogma”. Most opponents were under 25.In a world that calls itself secular, a France that describes itself as less and less religious, blasphemy has paradoxically become a major taboo, Anastasia Colosimo, a professor of political theology at the Sciences Po university in Paris, told AFP.Anti-clericalism or atheism is increasingly seen as offensive. It is no longer fashionable.Wednesday\u0027s trial will see more than 140 witnesses heard over 49 days in a case seen by victims and families as a legal landmark over Kalashnikov killings that shocked France and the world. It will be filmed for state archives.French anti-terror prosecutor Jean-François Ricard said the trial was of “double interest”, namely “to approach the truth” and to grant victims “a moment of expression” over the first weeks of the trial - “a first”.Eleven of the accused were swiftly arrested but three vanished in Syria and will be tried in absentia.Among them is Hayat Boumedienne, 25-year old wife of Amedy Coulibaly - the Jewish supermarket and policewoman killer - who is believed to have encouraged his attack and was reportedly spotted in Iraq last winter.Most of the accused are charged with association with a terrorist group but two, Mohamed Belhoucine and Ali Riza Polat, are accused of complicity, which carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Mr Polat, 35, a French citizen of Turkish origin, will be in court. Prosecutors say he procured the guns used by the three killers.   After the Charlie massacre, France went on to suffer a string of deadly attacks, notably on November 13, 2015 when 130 people died and hundreds more were wounded in shootings and bombings in an around Paris, notably at the Bataclan concert hall.On Monday, Gérald Darminin, the French interior minister, said that there were currently 8,000 people on a terror watchlist in France and that the terror threat remains “extremely high”, notably from Sunni extremists.At least half a dozen plots have been foiled this year, say authorities.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"german far right seizes moment coronavirus fatigue sets","story":"Scenes of angry protestors attempting to storm the Reichstag this weekend have left Germany in a degree of shock, and raised questions over whether a growing mood of discontent over coronavirus restrictions is being exploited by the far-Right.The protests which brought 38,000 people onto the streets of Berlin at the weekend were billed as a peaceful demonstration against the coronavirus policy of Angela Merkel’s government. But it was the images of a few hundred violent protestors attempting to force their way into the German parliament that came to encapsulate the day.They were carrying the flags of the “Reich Citizens” — a far-Right movement that refuses to accept the fall of the pre-war German Empire — and according to disturbing reports on Monday, at least one was armed with a handgun.It is hard to overstate the symbolism of an attack on the Reichstag — which went up in flames at the start of Nazi rule in 1933, stood abandoned by the Berlin Wall during the Cold War ision of Germany, and rose phoenix-like to become the seat of the Bundestag after reunification.“Reich flags and a far-Right rabble in front of the German Bundestag are an unbearable attack on the heart of our democracy. We will never accept that, ” Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German president, said in the wake of the weekend\u0027s events.But that left unanswered questions about how a protest that was supposed to bring together a coalition of anti-vaxxers, coronavirus sceptics and conspiracy theorists ended up culminating in a far-Right attack on the Reichstag.Michael Ballweg, the organiser of the demonstration, immediately distanced himself from what happened. “They have nothing to do with our movement,” he said of the protestors on the Reichstag steps.Mr Ballweg, who heads an initiative called Lateral Thinking and has been known to invite the audiences at his speeches to meditate, is typical of the eccentrics who have dominated the anti-virus protests in Germany until now.Largely unknown before the pandemic, he has been catapulted to national fame by his campaign against the government response and says he is planning to run for mayor of his native Stuttgart.A rival group calling itself Resistance 2020, founded by an Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) doctor who posted a video questioning the risk posed by the virus on his YouTube channel, says it is planning to become a political party.Adherents have taken to carrying pendants fashioned from aluminium foil in reference to the tin foil hats of conspiracy theorists. But it appears the reference is not entirely ironic. A message being circulated ahead of Saturday’s demonstration read: “Please wrap your cell phone in aluminum foil 100km from Berlin. Switching it off is not enough!”But there is more to the protests than harmless eccentrics. As Spiegel magazine put it this week: “It would not be accurate to describe this event as purely far-Right. But nor would it be accurate not to mention the fact that the crowds were interspersed with people who, with their flags, T-shirts and tattoos, were clearly recognizable as far-Right.”Or, as Wolfgang Schäuble, the Speaker of the German parliament, put it: “Anyone who takes part in a demonstration should ask himself who he is marching alongside”.What happened in the run-up to Saturday’s protest is that the German far-Right began openly to adopt the movement as their own. The Identitarian Movement called for protests. So did the National Democratic Party (NPD) and The Third Way, both regarded by their critics as neo-Nazi, though they reject the label.So did Björn Höcke, one of the most influential leaders of the far-Right Alternative for Germany party (AfD), and a man German television has compared to Hitler.“Corona is over. And corona will not come back either,” Mr Höcke declared in an interview with German television last week. The AfD has had a hard time of it this year. It has seen its support evaporate as voters flock back to the established parties in times of crisis, falling to fourth place in the polls on 11 per cent, a far cry from the 18 per cent it reached two years ago, while popular backing for Mrs Merkel, the party’s bete noire, has returned to the heights she enjoyed before the migrant crisis.But there are signs that may be shifting. A poll last week found public approval for the government has dropped to 49 per cent in recent days, from a high of over 60 per cent in April, while the number dissatisfied with its performance has climbed to 42 per cent.Jens Spahn, the health minister, who is widely considered in political circles to have had a good crisis, was abused and spat on by protestors in the western city of Bergisch Gladbach at the weekend. Mrs Merkel has lost the support of Bild, Germany’s biggest-selling newspaper, which recently accused her of “scare tactics” and a coronavirus policy it says is “damaging the country”.“What if we get the impression that the measures taken to contain the virus did more damage than the virus itself? There are people who have these thoughts, and they are allowed to,” Jan Josef Liefers, a popular television actor, said at the weekend.It is against this backdrop that Mr Höcke and his colleagues have identified an opportunity in the protest movement, and an emboldened far-Right seized its moment on the steps of the Reichstag.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"iconic italian glacier could vanish within 15 years due global","story":"One of Italy\u0027s most celebrated glaciers is likely to disappear within 15 years because of global warming, scientists have warned.The rate at which the Marmolada glacier in the Dolomites is melting has accelerated in the last three years, according to researchers at Padua University.During the First World War the glacier, located on Mt Marmolada, formed part of the frontline between Italian and Austro-Hungarian forces, with soldiers building trenches, artillery positions and shelters amid the rock and ice.A decade ago, it was losing five hectares of ice each year, but that has now increased to nine hectares a year, according to the scientists.“In the last 70 years, it has lost more than 80 per cent of its volume, from 95 million cubic metres of ice in 1954 to 14 million cubic metres now,” said Aldino Bondesan, a glaciologist and professor of geomorphology at Padua University.“Its disappearance approaches ever closer. It may have no more than 15 years of life left.”If the glacier continues to lose nine hectares a year, “that could lead to the disappearance of most of the glacier by 2031, said Prof Mauro Varotto, another glaciologist. Glaciers in the Alps have shrunk by about half since 1900, according to the European Environment Agency.Scientists say that if nothing is done to reduce the world’s CO2 emissions, the Alps could be free of permanent ice by the end of the century.In early August, there was alarm at the other end of the Italian Alps when experts warned that a chunk of glacier the size of a cathedral was in danger of breaking off.The valley beneath the Planpincieux glacier, on the border with France, had to be evacuated as a heatwave threatened its stability.The glacier lies at an altitude of 2,800 metres in the Ferret Valley, part of the Mont Blanc massif.Dozens of locals and tourists were evacuated and police set up roadblocks to prevent anyone else from entering the scenic valley.Last summer, Iceland held a symbolic ‘funeral’ to mark the disappearance of the country’s first glacier lost to climate change.Campaigners gathered and a bronze plaque was mounted on a rock in a ceremony held on a mountain once covered by the Okjökull glacier in western Iceland.The campaigners said that all of Iceland’s glaciers are expected to vanish within 200 years unless global warming can be halted.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons september 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter -

Fines have always been the last resort for headteachers, but it is a last resort, a tool they have to make sure young people are attending school.”Acknowledging that some parents will be concerned about Covid-19, he said that they should speak to the school’s headteacher who can explain about the safety and hygiene measures they have in place to keep children safe.Schools will have their own approaches to attendance. Many schools will be phoning up parents to make sure they are attending,” Mr Gibb said.“I’ve heard of headteachers organising a walking bus to talk to families who are concerned and to encourage them to come into school.”The Department for Education said it expected all pupils to return, and that parents would only be fined for their children’s non-attendance as a “last resort”.The National Association of Headteachers has called for an amnesty on fining parents to be put in place for the whole of this term, suggesting its members would be refusing to impose the £120 penalties.YouGov’s poll of over 650 parents of school age children in England and Wales found that the majority (53 per cent) of mothers and fathers were not at all seriously considering keeping children at home, while a further six per cent were unsure.Almost half (48 per cent) of parents think it would be unfair to fine those who don’t send their children to school because of the pandemic, while 39 per cent say it is justified.The YouGov survey also found that just over a third (36 per cent) of parents are opposed to secondary school children wearing masks in schools, with 47 per cent saying they are in favour.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavrus cases soar northern towns","story":"NewsCoronavirus cases soar in northern towns as pleas to stay in lockdown ignoredCoronavirus local lockdown restrictions are expected to be lted in Trafford, Stockport and Bolton on Wednesday even though council leaders want the special measures to continue amid a spike in infectionsShareCommentsByAlice RichardsonSeamus McDonnellChris Kitching:,  SEP Updated:,  SEP Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video shadow-education-secretary-says-labour-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

Cllr Andrew Western claimed Traffordaposs pleas for the restrictions to be extended were completely ignored and the Government decided to overrule the council despite the townaposs infection rate being three times higher than the national average.Bolton has entered the Covid- red alert level with a % increase in cases, and asked the Government to keep the town in a local lockdown in a bid to halt a sudden, concerning and unpredicted spike, the Manchester Evening News reported.Traffordaposs seven-day rate was . cases per , people as of last Friday, but hospital admissions for coronavirus were down. The rate almost doubled from  cases despite a decrease in the number of people being tested, Mr Western confirmed. Mr Western said he has sent a letter to Health Secretary Matt Hancock asking him to clary the Governmentaposs position and plan of action regarding the restrictions in Trafford. He said the council said last week it wanted local restrictions on household gatherings to be extended for at least two more weeks. His letter states: I am very disappointed to say that our representations to national government were completely ignored.Mr Western wrote on Twitter : I have today written to @MattHancock regarding the decision to overrule @TraffordCouncil on local restrictions and calling for an urgent action plan setting out how the Government will move forward given our increased rates of infection and % of positive tests.We need to understand how the Government will move forward given the current situation and the obvious political interference that has driven us to this position. It really should not have come to this. Better communication, decision making, and engagement with local government and this was entirely avoidable. Earlier, he said: “We have heard absolutely nothing [from central government]. I lead a council with a population of , people but government couldn’t be bothered to pick up the phone to tell me we were being overruled, let alone explain why.” The Government announced last Friday that Trafford would be released from Greater Manchester-wide lockdown restrictions from Wednesday. The restrictions prohibit residents from meeting with other households indoors or in private gardens. From the coronavirus to Brexit, this is an era of great change and uncertainty.

But the -year-old England player well remembers his familyaposs own struggles as his mother would work  hours shts to put food on the table. Her young son would hear his devoted mum, Melanie, cry herself to sleep because she still didnapost have enough money to feed her growing boys. In an open letter to MPs, Rashford says: That was my reality and thankfully I had the talent to kick a ball around to pull us all out of that situation. Many can’t find that way out and aren’t being offered a helping hand to do so.” He has now written an open letter to MPs and is launching a task force with clear aims to help feed more than two million of Englandaposs children who are often forced to go without.In an emotional video, posted on Twitter this morning, Rashford outlines his own experiences of using meal vouchers and has outlined the help he now needs from MPs.His taskforce is made up of some of the UKaposs biggest supermarkets, businesses and charities, including Aldi, Asda, Co-op, Deliveroo, FareShare, Food Foundation, Iceland, Kelloggaposs, Lidl, Sainsburyaposs, Tesco and Waitrose. The managing director of Iceland Richard Walker talked of ‘Dickensian’ levels of poverty in the UK and added: Nothing is more important than the future of our youth. Rashfordaposs powerful letter not only talks about his own experiences dealing with child poverty but also highlights those he has met over the summer who are battling to keep their families afloat. But he has stressed while the extension of the school meals voucher in July made a huge dference to struggling families this summer, it was not enough. Rashford says: As summer and the voucher scheme comes to an end and we face increased unemployment, we have to work towards implementing a sustainable long-term framework to protect children most at risk from food poverty. It was clear to me that the voucher scheme extension was only ever going to support this issue in the short-term and speaking to families directly has just reinforced that thinking. Heartbreaking stories of how desperate parents were going to extreme s to put food in their childrenaposs tummies spurred the footballer on to launch his task force.  One mum was forced to feed her young family on just three pieces of bread every day and was finding increasingly harrowing ways to make it stretch. Rashford said: I spoke to a mother recently who, along with her two young sons, is currently living off three slices of bread a day – soaking them in hot water and adding sugar, hoping that the porridge consistency might better sustain the hunger of her one-year-old child. “I spoke to a family who were sleeping on one mattress on the floor – the reason being, just like any good parent would, they had had no choice but to sell every valuable they owned to put food on the table for their children. All of this, a result of unforeseen circumstances that are entirely out of their control, such as redundancy and illness. This is the true reality of England in .And he warned as rising levels of unemployment, caused by the coronavirus pandemic, led to more poverty the situtation had now become critical and action needed to be taken as soon as possible. Rashford said: Within two days of sitting with these families, I could better understand how food poverty is contributing to social unrest. Watching a young boy keeping it together whilst his mother sobbed alongside him, feeling like he has to step up to protect his family and alleviate some of that worry. He was nine years old. The striker is determined his taskforce will be a voice for the more than four million children who are currently experiencing food poverty. Rashford has three clear aims and is calling for the government to find funds to pay for the changes without delay.He wants three policy recommendations by the National Food Strategy to be funded, which include expanding free school meals to every child living in a home on Universal Credit, which would reach a further .million young people.Rashford and the taskforce also want holiday food and activities expanded so all youngsters on free school meals can benefit, which would be an extra .million children.  Finally he wants to see the Healthy Start vouchers, which are for children under four and pregnant women, increased from £. to £. a week and given to anyone on Universal Credit. Schools minister Nick Gibb has said Rashford is right to draw the nationaposs attention to child food poverty and insisted that he would be delighted to meet with the footballer. He added: “We are looking at all the policy suggestions that he has put forward in his letter to make sure that they do deliver on our shared objective, which is alleviating the kind of poverty that he talks about.” Rashford said: “Just to see the smiles on their faces and to see how much it’s helped them, you know, made me happy. It was good to see the parents laughing and smiling. “We had to think about the best way to do it, to think about how these families can eat long term and not have any issues. I feel like at times people think they are being looked down onthey ask for help, and I think in this generation that is something that should change. You should feel freeyou want to ask for help for anything,” he said. “Hold your head up high andyou need help go and get help.  We wanted to do it the best way we could, introduce the best people into our group, and seeusing them [we] can push it even more. Food entrepreneur Henry Dimbleby, who is leading the National Food Strategy review, has said school meals are a “fantastic way” to get children eating well at school. He added: “The alternative to a school lunch is a packed lunch and only % of packed lunches have the nutritional value of a school meal. If you look at packed lunches as children get less affluent, those packed lunches have increasingly low nutritional value.” Members of the taskforce have also pledged to spend the next six weeks using their s to share stories of those affected by child food insecurity in the UK. Rashford was himself one of five children and following his summer school meals voucher campaign in the summer, opened up about how his mum, Melanie, asked Manchester United to take him on before his th birthday. Speaking to the  BBC, Rashford said: My mum was a single parent, she had five kids all living in the same house. The programme that I started at  years old, youaposre supposed to start it at  years old.It basically gives you accommodation closer to the training facilities and a new school and she worked that hard to push it forward because she knew that was a step I needed to take. I needed to be eating the right food as I was growing, I needed to be close to my team-mates, my new school and my new school friends. The talented player described how Melanie would do her full weekly shop in Pound World, where each item was less than a pound, and would ration food supplies to last over seven days. He added: That was the reason I ended up going at a younger age to the others, it was to help my mum with her situation and also get me out of the situation we were in. So there is always a big element of sacrice to get to the top level and thataposs the one we had to make. In an open letter to MPs in the summer, he said: My story to get here is all-too-familiar for families in England: my mum worked full-time, earning minimum wage to make sure we always had a good evening meal on the table.

Tracy and AJ, from Bellshill, Lanarkshire, Scotland, were terried their daughter would not survive when she was diagnosed with Covid- just three weeks after her birth.Peyton Maguire weighed just lbs when she was born two months premature in March, the Daily Record reports. However, the tot, now five-months-old, bounced back from coronavirus and has become a symbol of hope for Scotland and the world.Tracy has now revealed how AJ was forced to self-isolate at home as his daughter fought for her le.  He feared the last time he would see Peyton was through a Facetime call from the hospital. But she fought back, beat the virus and is now a happy, healthy five-month-old. Tracy, , still has no idea how her newborn baby contracted the virus but she is grateful to staff at Wishaw General for saving her little girl. She said: “She is doing amazing. She weighs over lb now.” But when the couple learned their precious little girl had contracted the virus their world collapsed.  Tracy said: “It was so new we just didn’t know what was going to happen. “As a premature baby she had to have blood tests every week to make sure there was nothing underlying. She had a snfle so they thought they would check everything was ok. They took swabs and they came back positive. “It was horrible for me but it was worse for my husband because he couldn’t be there with her.” Because Peyton had Covid both Tracy and AJ had to self isolate. Tracy was allowed to isolate with Peyton but AJ had to stay at home.  Tracy said: “I could see she was OK and physically hold her but he was completely locked down in the house. That was the hardest bit. “We both had lots of support but AJ couldn’t have any physical support. “Afterwards he said to me ‘I thought you were going to Facetime me from the hospital and that would be the last time I saw her’. That was really hard for him. “He had only been able to spend one hour with her a day since she was born because of lockdown and then he never saw her for another five days.  “I will never forget the look on his face when she finally came home and he got to hold her for the first time.” Because AJ was in isolation he never got to enjoy the proud dad moment of driving his baby girl home from hospital, instead that honour went to Tracy’s dad. When they drew up at the house Tracy struggled to unclip the car seat and finally AJ told his we to lt Peyton out and give her to him. Tracy remembered: “He just left us at the car and went away into the house with her. He was taking his baby home. “For a good hour he just sat holding her, smelling her, making these memories. “In hospital he couldn’t even feel her skin next to his face. That was all restricted, for good reason, but all these lovely memories had to be delayed for a wee while.” But to look at her ow you would never realise what a traumatic start she had to le.  Tracy said: “She is now at the point where she is finding her voice and she likes to talk and shout at us and have a couple of laughs. “She is beginning to look less like a baby and more like a wee girl. “For us just getting to this point , seeing her growing, is incredible.” Peyton was  weeks old before her grandparents got to hold her and they had to isolate for two weeks before they were able to. Tracy’s dad even had to take two weeks unpaid leave from work to allow him to spend time with her. Tracy said: “I worried she would be strange around other people because she was born during lockdown and we couldn’t see anybody. But we have aways Facetimed so she got used to the voices evenshe couldn’t meet people. And she definitely recognises voices.” Little Peyton seems to bear out the recent evidence that young children were unlikely to suffer really serious effects of the virus.

Boseman’s parting gt was empowering youngsters like mine, yours and millions around the world to follow his example and to be the change that they want to see. It was in proving to the film industry that a black movie that didn’t just focus on black pain and suffering could shatter box office records and appeal to all audiences.Boseman had been inspired to seek out positive black roles having seen too few previously. He went on to play the music legend James Brown, the first black American in baseball’s major league, Jackie Robinson,  and Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American US supreme court justice. Then of course, came the Marvel superhero Black Panther. In the s when I grew up, Huggy Bear from Starsky  Hutch summed up the negative attitude of TV and film towards black characters. If they were not portrayed as gangsters or pimps they were seemingly directed to endear themselves to audiences by making them laugh. Boseman exuded dignity and authority in and out of character, inspiring a generation of kids to triumph through adversity.

Jade Miller discovered she was pregnant via a blood test after she was rushed to Royal Preston Hospital in agonising pain on August . Jade was immediately wheeled into the surgery theatre where her fallopian tube was removed along with her child. Doctors told the -year-old, from Preston, Lancashire, that she might not have survived had she called an ambulance later on that day. Have you had a similar experience during the pandemic  Email webnews@mirror  The experience of discovering she was pregnant before losing the child has been a deeply traumatic one for Jade, made worse by the fact she endured it alone. Under legislation brought in under the pandemic patient support has been severely restricted, meaning thousands of women across the UK have suffered miscarriages without a friendly face beside them. Now Jade, a GPaposs receptionist and Instagram influencer, is calling on the government to change the policy so women have proper support.  She told : I called an ambulance because I thought I was going to pass out and didnapost think I could make it to the car.  I was then told my husband couldnapost come with me because of coronavirus restrictions. At the hospital I had a blood test and found out I was pregnant but that it was ectopic and had ruptured. I had to go straight to emergency surgery within half an hour of finding this out.  Finding all these things out was extremely traumatic by itself, without being alone. I wasnapost allowed to see anyone following the operation. Jade, who is mum to an -month-old boy, lost a litre of blood due to her tube rupturing.  Because endometriosis had already damaged one of her fallopian tubes, she may now not be able to carry another baby to term. While she was receiving one piece of devastating news after another her husband Patrick, , was waiting at home unclear of what was going on. Jade said: I had to call him before the emergency surgery to say I was pregnant, had lost the baby and was going into surgery.  I went into hospital at .am and he didnapost hear from me until pm. He is traumatised. He thought I was going to die. Jade has launched a petition calling for a change in the governmentaposs policy so that women who risk losing their unborn child can be accompanied into hospital.  In the week since she has been inundated with messages from women who have been through similarly traumatic experiences. Jade added: When someone tells you your baby has died you need someoneaposs hand to hold. It is a very alien environment. To have to be told that your baby has died, alone and without that support, is devastating.

Does that impress you with the lesaving power of something as simple as exercise  It does me. Researchers decided we’ve been concentrating too much on the ­negative fallout of our sedentary and inactive lestyles with bad news stories about heart disease, stroke, diabetes, even cancer. Scientists at the universities of ­Edinburgh and Cambridge wanted to celebrate the benefits of getting active rather than repeatedly telling people they’ll pay a pricethey fail to do so. The science team, including researchers from Moray House School of Education and Sport, studied data from  countries in an attempt to find out how many people on the planet were meeting recommended activity guidelines –  minutes of moderate exercise or  minutes of vigorous exercise each week. The proportion of people meeting these World Health Organisation guidelines in dferent countries was quite ied – from a low of % in Kuwait to % in Mozambique. The figure for Britain was %, still too low.To estimate the number of premature deaths prevented each year by exercise, researchers combined this data with estimates of the risk of dying early for active people, compared with the same risk in inactive people. What they found was that globally, thanks to exercise, premature death rates were % lower than they would have been – equating to approximately . million lives saved per year. This is a much more uplting message than the number of early deaths due to lack of physical activity – estimated at . million premature deaths each year. The researchers are keen to tell a good news story of what is already being achieved by focusing on the number of lives saved. In simple terms, concentrating on le rather than death.

As infections surge worldwide, face masks have become increasingly accepted as an effective means for combatting Covid- along with social distancing and hand washing. Increasingly more people are turning to clear plastic face shields and masks with breathing valves as a more comfortable option. But the US research suggests they are not as effective as regular cloth or surgical masks. Study author Dr Siddhartha Verma, of the American Institute of Physics, said: As studentsto schools and universities, some have wonderedit is better to use face shields as they are more comfortable and easier to wear for longer periods of time. But whatthese shields are not as effective  You would be essentially putting everyone in a tight space with droplets accumulating over time, which could potentially lead to infections. In their research, scientists found face shields block the initial forward motion of a simulated jet of a cough or a sneeze. But the expelled droplets can then move around the visor with ease and spread out over a large area.  To minimise the community spread of Covid-, it may be better to use high-quality cloth or surgical masks that are of a plain design instead of face shields and masks equipped with exhale valves. Dr Verma said: Even the very best masks have some degree of leakage. Itaposs still important to maintain physical distance while wearing them to mitigate transmission. The study suggests Covid- is still able to spreada person infected with the virus is wearing a mask with an exhalation port.  Such face coverings allow a large number of droplets to escape through the air valve unfiltered which make it ineffective at stopping the spread, results show. During their experiments, researchers used a hollow manikin head and simulated a cough or a sneeze with a pressure impulse from a manual pump. Tracers made from droplets of distilled water and glycerin were expelled through the mouth opening, and laser sheets visualised the spatial and temporal development of the ejected flow.

Damien Turner, , has been part of the adult baby diaper lover communityfor ten years and wears nappies all day. The US nappy-lover, from West Virginia, said acting like a baby gives off a very calm relaxing and safe vibe but that his lestyle has caused problems in his professional le. Currently unemployed, he is constantly in and out of jobs and has been fired by previous employers for being childish. Speaking to , Damien said: Diapers are very convenient, comfortable, and cute. It’s a very nice lestyle and I wouldn’t want to do anything .  Dressing and acting like a baby gives off a very calm, relaxing, safe vibe. It’s almost asyou were back in preschool without a worry in the world. Employment is hard. Iaposm constantly in and out of jobs. Sometimes my employers find my pictures online or just canapost put up with the fact Iaposm wearing a diaper and acting childish in the workplace. Damien never hides his lestyle choice but has lost friends and is often teased outside of work. He has since been welcomed into the ABDL community who have helped him feel at home. He said : Iaposve lost a few childhood best friends. I do still have a few good friends that all know about it. I never hide it. If you are around me, itaposs just the norm. The adult baby used to work in the catering industry as a service coordinator and is open about his lestyle on social media. He claims bosses felt uncomfortable by his actions and he is now forced to live off his savings after being fired. Damien said:I have enough saved up for a while but at the moment I’m currently putting in job applications. So we’ll see how that goes. Since childhood, Damien has had a desire to wear nappies and has been wearing them since he was . He initially told his parents, who support his lestyle, that he had an incontinence problem and fully embraced the lestyle during his teen years.  Damien added: ‘It’s something I’ve always been into since I was a kid. If I really had to pin it to something I’d say episodes of SpongeBob or Tom and Jerry where they are wearing a diaper for a gag or throwaway joke. I found it very appealing and have pretty much been wearing them since I was . I lied and told my parents I had an [incontinence] problem at the time so they would buy me some. Eventually, I told them the truth. My parents don’t really mind at all, I’ve never had a problem with them when it came to my lestyle.

The French satirical magazine carried the controversial cartoons on the cover of todayaposs issue, with the headline All that for that. Director Laurent Sourisseau wrote in an editorial: We will never lie down. We will never give up. Two brothers armed with Kalashnikovs attacked the magazineaposs Paris headquarters in January , shouting the prophet is avenged as they murdered . A police officer and four Jewish shoppers were killed over the following two days. Those responsible said Charlie Hebdo had deliberately used blasphemy to stir up hatred against Muslims around the world by previously publishing the satirical cartoons and articles about Prophet Muhammad.

Charlie Hebdo then published them in full in , leading its writers and cartoonists to receive regular death threats.This led up to the atrocities of , when two Paris-born brothers stormed into their Paris offices with Kalashnikovs, and opened fire. Despite this, Charlie Hebdo today carries the cartoons on its front page, under the headline All that for that. The landmark trial opening on Wednesday will see the  defendants facing a iety of charges including obtaining weapons and providing logistical support to the killers. Three of the accused will be tried in absentia, as it is believed they went to fight for Islamic State in Syria. It was on January ,  that brothers Saad and Cher Kouachi murdered  people in and around the Paris offices of the magazine. Police officer Ahmed Merabet was killed as he tried to stop the assailants after the attack and four people were wounded. The Kouachi brothers died during a shootout with police at a printing office northwest of Paris two days later. Marie-Laure Barre and Nathalie Senyk, barristers representing the Charlie Hebdo victims, said in a statement: This trial is an important moment for them.

But he has to find that consistency to stay in the team.#As far as interest in him, then I#m delighted for him. I hope there is because that means I#ve got good players here.#I wouldn#t want an empty scouting bay as that would mean people had made their mind up about my team.#I have no problem in teams taking an interest but it honestly won#t deflect away from every day improvement and trying to win games of football.#Mellon will come up against a familiar face in the opposition dug-out on Saturday when he takes United to Rugby Park to take on Alex Dyer#s Kilmarnock.Mellon knows the Englishman well from his time south of the border and while he insists there will be no old pal#s act this weekend, he is confident his friend can turn Killie#s campaign around after seeing them open up the season with just two points from the opening five games.The former Shrewsbury and Tranmere boss said: #I#ve known Alex for a long, long time. He#s a real good football man. I#ve competed against him numerous times.#I remember him and Chris Powell at Charlton and again at Huddersfield, so I know him really well.#I know that he will make sure his team are ready and we#ll have to overcome that challenge.#I#ve no doubt he can get Kilmarnock out of the situation they#re in. It doesn#t even need me to justy that.#Given his experience in football and the type of guy he is, you can#t look at him and think he doesn#t have the know-how to win games at any time.#It#s always dficult when you get both Rangers and Celtic in your first five fixtures.#But we know we#ll have to go down to Rugby Park and get an awful lot right.#We#ve shown in the first five games that we#re a match for anyone.#What we need to find is the consistency of that performance over a league season.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

The decision was taken to send me to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, and Neil Newman and Billy McArthur drove very carefully on the ersion route to Paisley, avoiding the recently damagedRest and be Thankful route.I am grateful to all those who delivered care to such a high standard, ensuring that my recovery was so successful after excellent treatment at the RAH.Jeremy Houston, PoltallochSir,As I read Councillor Alastair Redman’s letter in the August  edition of the Advertiser I thought how sad it is that a young man should always have such a pessimistic and depressing outlook that he chooses to share regularly with your readers.While we live through a pandemic we have seen the very best in people in our communities working to support and care for each other.Only last week the council publicly thanked the thousands of volunteers for their amazing efforts during the past months.The volunteers throughout our communities worked tirelessly and optimistically, always offering encouragement and kindness helping those who were at home to stay positive during such an anxious time.Local businesses provided an excellent service and continue to do so, enabling people to shop locally without making long journeys.If Councillor Redman cannot see the confident and positive support in all of our communities perhaps he should book an eye test, and he most certainly doesn’t have to travel to Barnard Castle to visit an optician.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertSir,I was delighted to see the piece in a recent issue of the Argyllshire Advertiser featuring a reader from Tayvallich, setting out his case for #Time for Change#. I share many of his concerns, and commend the series of articles.It would be good to hear from a range of Argyll and Bute residents with their ideas for how we get from #here# towards a better #there#. My personal pet project would be an Argyll and Bute Citizens’ Assembly, that would bring people together to generate real strategies to bring about just and #green# change for our area.A good start would be better transport links, via enhanced road and ferry services.A permanent solution to the Rest and be Thankful would be welcome, of course, but it was really heartening to see how Western Ferries rose to the challenge on Friday Auust .  They magicked away that endless queue at Gourock with great patience and goodwill and double service, showing what can be done.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,Following the latest landslide and road closure at the Rest and be Thankful, once again the road closure signs were placed at the wrong place on the Arrochar side.Having spoken to several of the local businesses owners, the main issue around the signs are they are too far away from the incident. There are information signs from Balloch to Tarbet advising of the closure at the Rest.Surely moving the signs to Ardgartan would make more sense. Should anyone have to turn then there is ample space to do this.

This is now brought into line with the public transport guidance.What about primary school children With the exception of school buses as outlined above, the new guidance in schools only applies to secondary school pupils.Do they need to be worn in class While staff and students can continue to wear face coveringsthey wish to, they will not generally be necessary in the classroom.This is because there is greater scope for physical distancing and face coverings can have an impact on teaching.However it remains the case that where adults cannot keep m distance and are interacting face-to-face for a sustained period , face coverings should be wornCan a child be excluded for not wearing one It is expected that the guidance will state that pupils should notbe excluded from schoolthey do not wish to wear a face covering.Can someone help my child with their covering Education Secretary John Swinney said:ldquoSchools will be asked to ensure children and young people have clear instructions on how to put on, remove, and store face coverings.\"Any staff member or pupil will still be able to wear a face covering when they wish to do so.\"John Swinney confirmed the new guidanceWhy is this being done Mr Swinney added:ldquoThere is increasing evidence that face coverings can provide some protection for the wearer as well as those around them.\"We also know that some pupils have found it very dficult to physically distance when moving around school, which could increase the risk of transmission of the virus.\"And on school transport, as on public transport, there can be mixing between dferent age groups.\"What  was said Mr Swinney said:ldquoWe want to continue to protect what we have achieved in suppressing the virus and re-opening schools, and to do the best for children in schools.\"Alongside this change to the wearing of face coverings, we need to reinforce the importance of maintaining high standards of cleaning, personal hand and respiratory hygiene and physical distancing, where possible.\"In situations where there is a local cluster, use of face coverings throughout the day may be required.ldquoThe position will be kept under review to ensure that our

It was the sound of their wings that caught my attention before I saw them. It was a lockdown morning, no traffic, no background sound, and they were flying low.I never have been much of a bird watcher well, what I mean is I have always loved sightings of wildle, including birds, but donrsquot sit for hours to spot dferent types. I know the names of some birds but many I canrsquot identy with certainty. My friend Jim is my human encyclopaedia for such things.Of course, we can still appreciate nature and wildle without being able to identy their exact names. A beautul tree is still worthy of admiration, evenyou donrsquot knowitrsquos an oak or a sycamore. You can enjoy the antics of a flock of birds, evenyoursquore not surethey are martins or swts.And there are some wild creatures we all know and can identy: a fox, a robin, a hedgehog, a squirrel, a rabbit, a mole, a deer, a dandelion, a daisy, a heron, a swan, a duck and a hare would be on this list, but itrsquos not as extensive as it used to be. As nature has receded from our lived experiences, so has the ability to identy and name much of the wildle and plants that survive around us.The beautully illustrated book The Lost Words by Jackie Morris and Robert MacFarlane was a response to this loss of nature vocabulary. With beautul pictures and poems, it brings back to le some of the animals and flora of our land. And resources like the ranger service do a fantastic job in our county, providing walks, giving fascinating information and talking to a iety of groups.But itrsquos the lived experience of nature that is the vital link between having knowledge and developing an understanding that will nurture a love of our natural environment. We cannot really love that which we do not experience and value personally. Itrsquos when we physically encounter a plant or animal that we develop a desire to know its name and understand its signicance.This seems a perfect time to find ways to enhance that lived experience of nature. In schools, because of the presence of Covid, learning outdoors as much as possible is being promoted. Some schools will have access to woodland or natural areas more than others. Some schools in built-up areas will be more restricted. But even in urban areas, there may be a grassy area with a tree or two, or perhaps a nature corner can be created.Teachers do a great job, and they are doing so in very challenging circumstances just now they know their business. But as a storyteller who until the lockdown was in schools every week telling stories, I am unable to do so in these new circumstances. I fully understand why, of course.But as things develop, it may be possible for storytelling to take place outdoors, wersquoll see. For me this is not so much a restriction but a new opportunity to make nature the stage, with listeners immersed in the natural surroundings in which so many stories are set. Evenonly concrete playground is currently available, there is potential to make more of the outdoor space now that it will be used in a dferent way.As I say, time will tell what will be possible. My interest is not just as a storyteller but also as a parent. Itrsquos a time to be cautious and safe, yes, but let us not forget the vital importance of the creative arts in all this. Many children have missed out on so much already, and music, song, storytelling and drama are such a vital part of childrenrsquos development and soul indeed for us all. Perhaps we all need to relearn the campfire spirit, around which so much human culture and understanding developed.And so my thoughtsto the swts which flew over my garden. They will now be flying over Africa, following the rains and chasing the insects there. Their story is utterly fascinating a lesson in natural and human history, as well as geography, biology and ecology.Soon the pink-footed geese from Iceland will arrive in their honking formations, to spend their winter here. Irsquove noticed some trees are showing they already feel the nip of autumn. The cycle of naturersquos stories are all around us,we have an ear to listen and eye to notice.More learning outdoors is a gt.

However, in our local conditions wersquove rarely seen it much above -.metres.If yoursquore looking for an evergreen tree, itrsquos worth remembering many coners are extremely hardy and tolerant of adverse conditions, surviving in severe coastal conditions and at altitude.The tree wersquore highlighting is the Picea omorika, sometimes called the Serbian or Bosnian spruce, being native to those countries.With dense, short green needles that are slightly whitish underneath, it has a dense, columnar habit, and forms a graceful, slender, conical feature in the garden.It is extremely hardy and, although it doesnrsquot require any pruning, it can be trimmed to remain in proportion to the garden.Many of our customers love garden lighting, and the stable conical form of P omorika makes it the ideal plant for strings of lights!For something a little dferent, why not try Phormium Phormium is sometimes known as the New Zealand flax because of its country of origin. It is one of the hardiest plants we know and indeed is used effectively at the front of the garden centre as a windbreak!Grown primarily for its form, the clumps of strap-like leaves are virtually indestructible, and some years will even produce tall, architectural flowering spikes which dry and remain a feature.Most often grown as a focal point, it can also be used to create an unusual hedge.There are many ieties of Phormium to choose from offering a wide range of colours, from eye-catching yellow through to deep, purplish-black, or combinations of colours on striped leaves.Similarly, therersquos a great selection of sizes available, from small compact ieties to the larger ieties that can exceed two metres.Itrsquos been very dficult to choose only five of our favourite evergreens, because there are so many wonderful plants that will provide you with structure, form, colour and interest throughout the year.If you require advice on these plants or other options, just please speak to one of our plant team and theyrsquoll help you choose an evergreen plant thatrsquos just right for you!"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-book-covid-test-testing-centres","story":"The First Minister suggests some Scots have had trouble trying to book coronavirus tests over the weekend due to a \"major spike\" in demand, which resulted in technical issues.Butyou are experiencing symptoms, how do you get a test  Heres everything you need to know.If you think you are experiencing symptoms of coronavirus, you should take a test.

I really wanted to get the role.IN WHAT WAYS DID YOU SEE YOURSELF IN THE CHARACTER Even physically we were quite similar. He talks about having a wiry strength from the long walks around the Yorkshire Dales... And I was very sporty as well, just like Alf was.Hes got a lot of passion and commitment to his field and that was like me. Once I found acting, I was completely enveloped in it - and havent looked back.He has little intricacies sometimes he can be a little socially awkward... Little quirks that I could identy with. I had fun with them as well.HOW DAUNTING WAS YOUR FIRST DAY OF FILMING I thought Id be more nervous or apprehensive on the first day of filming I really wasnt, and it was a fortunate revelation.My first day was with Samuel West - obviously a veteran of the industry. I was so excited to work with him and then, on top of that, he was just so lovely. Any questions I had, he was there for me.He just put me at ease straight away and, its maybe a bit corny, but I genuinely did feel at home on that first day.HOW DO YOU THINK FANS OF THE ORIGINAL SERIES WILL REACT TO THIS ADAPTATION The original is obviously loved the world over- and in a lot of peoples eyes, its perfect. But Ive never thought of it as a competition in any way, because its a completely new adaptation. The storyline will not be the exact same.That series was the late seventies, eighties, and the technology in filmmaking has come on leaps and bounds. Youre going to see the Dales in stunning HD, with drone shots and crane shots. I think the Dales are really realised in this it is like another character.WHO WAS YOUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL TO FILM WITH Theyve got these Jersey cows who were just lovely. When youre working with these bigger animals, a whole new focus comes into it. Theres an atmosphere on set you have to be really calm. So it was nice to do those scenes.But also the little dog who plays Tricky Woo, which people will remember well from the series and the books, is a little Pomeranian... tail waggles in the air as he walks along, you cant see his legs and its kind of like he glides. But the dog actor is actually called Derek. You would never expect this fancy little thing to be called Derek!He was a consummate professional and his character journey over the series is very strong. Hes going to be a star.WERE YOU BROUGHT UP AROUND ANIMALS I was raised in the north of Scotland, in a little town. It was my back garden, then a fence and then a field the field always had cows and sheep in it.When we were really small, there was one cow who we named Friendly because the farmer would lt us onto her back and let us ride on this cow for theof the garden and take us off again.THIS SERIES SHOWS THE IMPORTANCE OF BELONGING TO A COMMUNITY. IT FEELS VERY TIMELY...Its certainly that thing about helping your neighbour, and community, and coming together... [after schools shut because of COVID-] I remember a teacher going out with his backpack on full of school meals and he was doing kilometres a day to get meals to the kids. Brilliant stuff.I think it [All Creatures Great and Small] is simpler times and something many people yearn for, especially now, when times are a bit more complex. It will be a lovely bit of escapism.ARE YOU READY FOR THE FAME THAT WILL COME WITH THIS ROLE Honestly, I have no idea. In drama school, theres no class on people noticing you in the street. We were doing some interviews during the filming of the series and they were like, You will get fan mail. I was like I wont get fan mail and they were like, You will!

For the duration of these visits, we relocate across the landing, to the spare room. Its bed is not what yoursquod call generous. Itrsquos fineyou are alone, orboth of you have been on a diet, but less so in any other circumstances. It does, however, have the advantage of being above the kitchen, and thus the second warmest place in the house. For that reason itrsquos also my study.Back in April, as we used an old tin of Farrow  Ball found in the loft, and discovered too late that there was only enough to cover a single wall, we were uncertainAustrian friends due to visit in July would still be able to make it. While Alan slapped glossy woodwork paint onto the ceiling, wondering why it was so hard to work in, we discussed the advantages of cast iron bedsteads over wooden, Scandi sleekness over shabby chic. Gradually, though, the need to make a decision receded. As the weeks ticked past and Europe turned into a giant hairbrush, covered in spikes, all such international trips have been cancelled or pushed back a year.Even in the best of times, when it comes to hospitality we are more roadside burger van than country inn. Where we previously lived, we did occasionally have friends and family to stay, but it was not what yoursquod call a revolving door. More of a portcullis. It was noticeable, though, that after we moved to the Borders, footfall increased.What does Hoolet have that East Lothian or Glasgow doesnrsquot, you might ask  Itrsquos a question to which others, clearly, also wanted an answer. In my seven-year-old step-granddaughterrsquos experience, the big dference is a roaring fire, and the witchy shadows of moving trees on her bedroom wall during the night which, she told us next morning, ldquoliterally petried me.Peter Maylersquos A Year in Provence was the first and funniest of a genre that offers a humorously enticing glimpse of moving to another country, and meeting head-on the challenges of local lingo and customs while undergoing house restoration. One of the late Maylersquos charms ndash assuming you were not a neighbour ndash was his candour. He describes near strangers inviting themselves for a holiday, entirely oblivious or resistant to every excuse given to dissuade them. In that initial year he and his we learned their mistake: ldquoHalf-forgotten invitations, made in the distant safety of winter, were coming home to roost and drink and sunbathe. The girl in the laundry assumed from our sheet count that we were in the hotel business...At one particularly low point, with a boorish London advertiser in residence, they sat by the pool and ldquowondered why we both found it so dficult to get rid of thick-skinned and ungracious people. They realised then that in future theyrsquod require more than ldquofirmness and ingenuity. What they needed was an answering machine.The lucrative and entertaining well that Mayle dug is still gushing. Quite apart from the ever-popular Frances Mayesrsquos books, which turned the word Tuscany into a synonym for bourgeois, there have been quieter, better books. One such is A Season in Spain, by Andrew and Lesley Grant-Adamson. Taking on a fruit farm in Andalusia for two years, they lived among peasant farmers whose families have worked the land for centuries. Despite the excellence of local food and wine, they learned how tough and precarious subsistence living can be in a region that goes from scorching heat to freezing, from drought to deluge.They too had unwanted guests: ldquoQuiet. Remote. The essence of tranquillity  Not quite. We ed from our first foray to find a young English family stripping one of our few ripe orange trees. The man was wearing a cheeky grin and a hat that put us in mind of Eddie Grundy of The Archers. He and his we carried off sackfuls of oranges, using the Grant-Adamsonrsquos wheelbarrow to transport them to their mule. Meanwhile their children were stripping the mandarin trees.Fashion in travel writing has since turned the compass towards Scandinavia, Latin America, Japan, but the principle of all these books remains the same: hapless, starry-eyed foreigners stumble into a beautul and rural part of the world, and either makes a success of settling, or eventually, after discovering a worm in the apple, acknowledge defeat and retreat.The danger in any such enterprise, of course, is not poisonous reptiles or a poor grasp of grammar, but that writers have a tendency to hyperbolise. An ordinary day, in their hands, becomes the stuff of adventure, romance or glamour. Mayle was a former advertising copy writer, so could sell turnips as truffles. Not that he had to try very hard. Since Provence offers months of sunshine, sumptuous local cuisine and wine, and rolling fields of lavender, itrsquos no surprise that visitors flocked to his doorstep. His books became such a success that the whole region, previously an idyllic backwater, was flooded with tourists. So too Mayesrsquos Tuscany.Writing about the Borders carries no such risk, unless yoursquore keen to test out equipment for a trip to the North Pole. We once encountered a man who had a weekend place in the nearby hills. It was a beautul old house that he was slowly renovating, whenever time allowed, but we got the impression his guests hadnrsquot bargained on it still being under hammer and drill when they arrived. ldquoFor some reason they prefer to camp out in the field, he told us, waving to the rugged fields in which the house sat. They must have been robust. Even indoors the draughts whistled.And yet there is something about living here that makes the hardened hermits happy to make up beds and stock the fridge.

Suddenly % doesnt seem so ruinous now that the UK deficit is heading to % and Britains debt pile is over pound trillion. Rishi Sunak has borrowed nearly ten times the Scottish budget in six months. Curiously, the roof hasnt fallen in.The whole debate over debt has radically altered as even Conservatives have abandoned the discredited logic of austerity. The ldquocost of a budget deficit, crucially, depends on interest rates. As the UK government and the Bank of England keep telling us, interest rates are currently so low that financiers and banks are actually paying the governmentto take their money.Suddenly, independence doesnt seem such an expensive luxury. There are many issues and problems associated with independence since Brexit, but GERS isnt one of them. The figures are anyway largely discredited. Whatever GERS measures it isnt economic viability.Scotland has labour productivity and employment levels comparable to England with a highly educated workforce, world class universities and a developed financial sector. It also has prodigious natural resources, both hydrocarbon and renewable, plus high-value food and drinks brands. Few countries would be a safer bet for foreign investors.However, there is no disguising that independence would entail readjustment, hard choices, even a degree of sacrice in the interest of reconstructing the underdeveloped Scottish economy. Just like Brexit in fact. No pain, no gain. GERS is,anything, an index of dependency: a measure of how Scotland has lost out being a backwater of the UK, not a country with the economic powers ndash tax, borrowing, debt ndash required to run a national economy.But even then, as the tax expert Professor Richard Murphy has pointed out, it is absurd to claim, as GERS has in recent years, that Scotland with % of the UK population accounts for nearly % of the entire UK deficit. This just doesnt make sense. GERS crudely measures the taxes raised narrowly in Scotland and assigns a great heap of spending from all over the UK ndash like defence ndash onto the spending numbers. It is an arbitrary carve up, which can be challenged under international accounting conventions. But lets not bother with all that, because GERS is irrelevant for a much more important reason: pandemic economics.The catastrophe that is coronavirus has demonstrated how malleable and transitory debt and deficit figures really are. GERS is based on the discredited Thatcherite logic of the household budget. ldquoSpending what you can afford...balancing the budget...never a lender nor a borrower be. These are out-dated fiscal homilies, which have no bearing on how economies actually work, which is through issuing debt.You dont have to be a devotee of Modern Monetary Theoryto see that balanced budgets are a recipe not for economic strength and productivity, but often for economic stagnation and decline. John Maynard Keynes told us that much  years ago.Now even Boris Johnson has made debt the centrepiece of UK financial policy, justying prodigious borrowing on the basis of historically low interest rates. This is as near as we get to free money. The UK government can issue -year bonds locking in these evanescent interest rates, even making money out of being in debt. Central banks are now talking about negative interest rates.Of course, there are limits to this. If a government really did spend like there was no tomorrow, andthis spending did not generate economic activity, there would be inflation ndash possibly hyper-inflation as in Zimbabwe. But for an advanced economy, under current world conditions, this is a remote risk.So, evenScotland had this % independence deficit, ex-Covid. The answer has to be: so what  Countries are coping with much larger deficits. This is not Scottish exceptionalism or romantic nationalism. There is every reason to suppose that Scotland would perform better as an independent country than as a remote region of the UK. Look at small countries across Europe, from Slovakia to Norway, in and out of the EU. The idea that Scotland is uniquely cursed is not just offensive, it is economically illiterate.Debt is a bogus bogey man, always has been. But Covid has finally made this clear to everyone who looks at the national accounts. How could Boris Johnson be borrowing to invest when the UK deficit is heading into orbit and UK debt has just topped pound trillion  The European Union was the last redoubt of austerity economics, which was used brutally to impoverish Greece. But even Brussels has abandoned the Maastricht Stability Pact limiting debt to % of GDP.Actually, there is one final, final redoubt of austerity economics: the Scottish Labour Party. Having recently supported a leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who proposed the greatest borrowing and debt in economic history, it obediently applauds the scary logic of GERS every year ndash but only for Scottish viewers. If Labour wanted to make itself relevant again it would recognise that, in the real world, debt problems would largely vanish in the course of reconfiguring the UK after Scottish independence.Labour could seize the political moment by calling for a new union of equality. As this column has argued, the first act of an independent Scottish government would be to strike a new union with the rest of the UK to ensure economic continuity, free movement, common trading standards. Scotland is too wise to opt for autarky. In the process notional debts and deficits would be diminished as politics took over.The UK will want to be on good terms with an independent Scotland, not least because of the disruption that will follow Brexit. When Ireland became independent its nominal debt of % of GDP was negotiated away. Similarly, in Scotland there would be debt trade offs ndash such as leasing Faslane for  years, or as a quid pro quo for accepting most rUK trading deals with other countries. Debt is malleable because it is essentially political.The real lesson of GERS has always been this: there is no obvious way that Scotland can reverse its historic decline while remaining in the United Kingdom as it currently exists. This dependency culture can only get worse. Like unemployment benefit, Barnett bungs are no alternative to self-sustaining employment, to economic regeneration.GERS cheerleaders havent realised that the window of opportunity here is relatively narrow. Ideally, Scotland needs to become independent while interest rates remain at historically low levels to smooth the path to autonomy. Perhaps GERS should really stand for: get out while the going is good.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

There are a few things that could fairly be called unsafe, but Irsquom hard pushed to think of many that are  per cent safe. Most of what we do in le falls between the two, and where an act lies on the spectrum can be moved by how we perform it. We need to talk about risk, not safety or the absence of it.Free climbing, climbing rock faces without ropes or any other safety equipment, is clearly very risky. However, training and practice can reduce the level of risk to personally acceptable levels, as demonstrated by the extraordinary Alex Honnold when he climbed El Capitan in Yosemite. I spent my working le inside an aeroplane, a thin metal tube flying at  miles a minute, six miles above the earth, with the temperature outside - degrees. Flying is very low risk, made so by science and engineering, and by extensive training and adherence to procedures, but itrsquos not % safe: accidents do occasionally happen.Worldwide, over a million people die every year in road traffic accidents, more than have died from Covid-. So is driving safe or unsafe  Itrsquos neither, and the vastly dferent fatality rates in dferent countries show that itrsquos how we, as iniduals and nations, go about the business of driving that moves it along the risk spectrum.There are risks associated with opening up our schools and the economy. However, there are very substantial riskswe donrsquot educate our young and donrsquotour economy to something close to full capacity. Itrsquos clearly vital that we reduce the level of risk as much as we can, and the record of the Scottish Government has been good on that so far, but the task isnrsquot only for them. Itrsquos down to all of us to respect the rules that keep risk to a low level. Those rules wonrsquot stop all Covid- infections, but they will limit them, and thatrsquos the best we can hope for until science delivers a vaccine.Doug Maughan, Dunblane.RECENT coverage about the pandemic has shown that transmission of Covid- is greatly reduced in indoor spaces when the proportion of fresh air in the internal atmosphere is high. It is baffling that so many people have a mental block about providing good ventilation. The over the top legislation on indoor smoking would not have been requiredpubs and the like had to have suitable ventilation . How many schools , hospitals, and offices could be more Covid-secure with adequate ventilation They would not need a lot of bulky duct work. Compressed air can transport as much air in smaller pipes using no more material, and is easier to store than air at ambient pressures.Sandy Henderson, Dunblane.THE restrictions imposed on us by both governments are having results that no-one foresaw, largely economic but also social and health related.Unfortunately, politicians, both in government and opposition, have painted themselves into a corner. They are afraid thatthey come out and say that the restrictions should be stopped, that any increase in the statisticsfor the virus will be blamed on them, and the public will therefore not vote for them at the next election.It follows that the situation at present is that the restrictions are having a greater harmful effect than the virus, but most politicians feel unable to acknowledge this. All restrictions should be cancelled immediately, especially social distancing, which it is not.It is anti-social distancing. This is all about the next election.John Burton, Oban.REGARDING face masks for schoolchildren, do the powers that be not see any anomaly between washing hands meticulously and handling masks that have been moistened with germs and shoved into pockets throughout the school day Iris Clyde, Kirkwall.IF some school pupils think itrsquos uncool to wear a face mask, how cool will they look hooked up to a ventilator or weeping over the grave of a friend or relative dead before their time Stuart Neville, Clydebank."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-jonathon-shafi-scotland-must-full-powers-independence-deal-economic-legacy-covid","story":"Indeed, many independence supporters also felt at the onset of the pandemic that the context would marginalise moves towards a referendum. Instead, the issues have cross-fertilised. Trust, a most valuable resource in an era defined by alienation from political institutions, has been placed with more confidence in the Scottish Government than it has with a mendacious group of Tories who ndash yet again ndash are in government without the democratic approval of the Scottish electorate.In truth, rising support for independence is being driven by Westminster and an ailing British state. A cocktail of issues have come together to produce a now toxic liquor. Years of ruinous austerity ndash and downright cruelty pursued through a slew of punitive initiatives like the bedroom tax ndash have cemented a deeply felt sense of injustice. The fact that Scotland voted to Remain in the European Union, has stretched the democratic deficit to breaking point, while the centring of British nationalism and xenophobia has disaffected many who voted No in .:New Glasgow Labour leader named after upset winThe General Election result of  too, has served to reinforce the idea that change through Westminster is an impossibility. And Boris Johnson, a man so widely reviled in Scotland that his mere presence serves as a priceless campaign tool for independence activists, personies the trouble the Union is in.But despite this apparently inevitable march towards independence, supporters should cast a discerning eye over the SNP leadership and push for a revamped independence case that is fit for the post-Coronavirus world. This is especially important as the present prospectus in the form of the Growth Commission ndash whose chairman has argued for the lsquosoftest possiblersquo form of independence ndash has been so exposed by events.For example, the commission argues for Sterlingisation as a means to \"transition\" towards an independent currency. In truth, it is a straightjacket, bound by economic tests that would allow UK financial institutions to prevent Scotland establishing its own central bank all but indefinitely. Had this come to pass, Scotland would have been unable to furlough workers, and would not have been able to issue government bonds. Yet this catastrophic outcome is swept under the carpet, rather than being recognised and corrected. Already years, which could have been spent bedding in the idea of a Scottish currency into the society, have been wasted.There is further confusion. The SNP has prioritised opposition to Brexit to the extent that independence has become intertwined with EU membership. To be clear, the strategic value of this can be debated. Many would point to recent polling as a vindication of this approach. But what is particularly awkward is this has been so vigorously pursued at the same time as adopting a currency position that would actively prohibit entry to the EU. In short: it would not be possible to pursue Sterlinigisation with post-Brexit UK, and become an EU member.Perhaps the surging polls help to assuage doubts about the coherence of the independence case among supporters. But be in no doubt, these issues are easy pickings for those who support the Union in a campaign setting. It would be folly to continue to argue for positions that are so easily unravelled. New times require a new approach ndash and time is of the essence. The longer the preication over these big questions, the more entrenched they become.:Labour calls for out of date hate crime figures to be updated amid controversial proposalsWhat is urgently needed is a clear plan that can transform our economy, society and democracy. The independence movement should avoid complacency when demanding this of its leaders. When Nicola Sturgeon responds to Andrew Marr on the question of an independence referendum by saying, \"as long as I need to be focusing on the coronavirus crisis and the economic legacy of that crisis that will have my  percent focus\", that should prick up ears. Not only will the economic legacy of the pandemic go on indefinitely, but it is precisely because of the challenge that lies ahead that we require the full powers of independence.At this time, the SNP leadership lacks a strategy that can secure genuine independence and transform society from the devastation left by the virus and a decade of Tory austerity. A plan that can galvanise the movement, inspire the population, deliver independence and transform Scotland is required.

Anne and Rob were ordinary, working-class, Ayrshire Scots who didnrsquot have a lot of cash when they were growing up, took a deeply practical view of le, health, and other people, and were wary of salesmen, politicians, and journalists .Like a lot of Scots of their age and experience, Anne and Rob also had several core instincts that drove most of their views. First, they were cautious about spending money unnecessarily. Second, they were wary of change and had generally conservative instincts. Third, they were resistant to governments telling them what to do . And fourth, they had a dual identity that they pretty much took for granted: their Scottishness was their Britishness was their Scottishness.:Opinion: Mark Smith: In defence of Sarah Smith hellip and a plea to the First MinisterAll of these instincts ndash formed and confirmed by the war, and post-war governmentsndash led both Anne and Rob to be deeply suspicious of Scottish nationalism and the people who led it: first Alex Salmond, then Nicola Sturgeon. Salmond, as far as they were concerned, was a blowhard and Sturgeon a troublemaker and a stirrer. In later years, Anne would sit back in her chair after wersquod finished our cups of tea and cakeand say: ldquoSo, tell me, what has that besom been up to now I realise not all of you may feel quite as affectionate about Scots like Anne and Rob as I do: indeed, some of the nastier nationalists on Twitter take great delight in the fact that Scots of Anne and Robrsquos generationare dying out. But, as the law of demographics adjusts the population without pity, and there are fewer Scots like Anne and Rob and more Scots who take dferent views, I canrsquot help feeling a bit down dispirited depressed. The Scotland I know, through people like Anne and Rob, my grannies, my mother, is dying. And I need to accept it.A couple of recent trends have confirmed where things seem to be going. Scots like Anne and Rob were generally thrty ndash my granny in Thurso used to give us felt-tip pens to colour in the bald patches on her rugs so she didnrsquot have to buy new ones ndash and much of their antipathy to Scottish independence came from the realisation that it would be expensive for Scots like them. They would be worse off.However, increasingly, many Scots take a dferent, and more cavalier, view of money. A lot of them have credit cards and overdraftsand the idea of debt, and the cost of debt, is not off-putting to them, which explains why the economic cost of independence is no deterrent. They shrug their shoulders. So what  A Panelbase poll the other day showed that  per cent of Scots believe independence will be good for the Scottish economy.Anne and Robrsquos instinctive caution and suspicion about politicians, especially politicians telling you what to do, is also clearly under threat. Many Scots listen to Nicola Sturgeonrsquos briefings obediently rather than questioningly they are more likely than people in the rest of the UK to wear face masks and to do it zealously, belligerently even they also bristle at criticism of the First Minister. Scots like Anne and Rob may have been conservative, but they werenrsquot conformist. What happened to our antipathy to authority  Itrsquos one of the things I liked about us most.:Opinion: Mark Smith: The leaked SNP email that shows why Nicola Sturgeon is doing so wellAnne and Robrsquos dual British Scottish identity is also on the way out. I was chatting to a retired coal miner the other day ndash hersquos in his s ndash and it was interesting to see his take on the world. He was passionately anti-Thatcher and is passionately Royalist he is instinctively Scottish and instinctively British. Some nationalists would see those positions as contradictory but theyrsquore not. A lot of Scots feel that way. The problem is a lot of them are in their s and s and wonrsquot be around for much longer.I have to admit that fact does get me down. I accept there are lots of older Scots who support independence . But it seems to me that, as more of the post-war generation dies out, the more we lose the voices of caution and conservatism. Younger Scots are always going to be a bit more relaxed about risk ndash thatrsquos natural ndash but we are losing the Scots who look at the idea of change, and the cost of it, and say: ca canny.The only hope is that some younger voters wonrsquot always be the same as they are now and that, as they get older, their views will moderate and change. Who knows, they may even start to understand the value of Anne and Robrsquos approach to spending money, and to politicians and nationalistic politicians in particular. It sometimes happens as you get older: you see more.But I am not hopeful. Increasingly, when I speak to people under , they feel uncomfortably dferent to many of the Scots I know, and the effect is even more marked when you speak to people under . They are aggressively supportive of Nicola Sturgeon and aggressively attached to Scottishness. They are dismissive of the risks of independence and the benefits of being in a union. I do not like any of this. I think it is a mark of nationalist ideology. I would prefer itmore people thought like Anne and Rob, and my granny, and me.

The ldquoworried well, a growing section of young middle-class health obsessives, became a new model army for endorsing and promoting an atomised outlook , where staying healthy and constantly striving for ldquowellness became both a political and personal fixation.The lockdown logic is not a conspiracy, it is the result of the logic of a diminished political elite and the loss of a collective public. A situation within which a wider social sense of what is good for society has been lost in a sea of atomised anxieties encouraged by an empty political class that has lost any sense of the common good.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Forces are gathering to launch a Fox News-style TV channel to undermine the broadcaster, and cash in on lost public faith.One rival is GB News. Itrsquos gunning for what it describes as an ldquoout of touch BBC, and already has a licence to broadcast. GB News co-founder Andrew Cole kicked sand in the BBCrsquos face calling it ldquopossibly the most biased propaganda machine in the world. There might be an announcement come September. Itrsquos understood GB News has been in talks with Andrew Neil.Rupert Murdoch ndash Fox News owner ndash is also circling the BBC. Hersquos long wanted to wound his arch rival, and looks close to aiming a crippling blow. A second rival project to the BBC is being cooked up by Murdochrsquos News UK, spearheaded by David Rhodes, former Fox News executive.Most likely, any rival to BBC TV journalism from the right will set its sights on being comment-driven in a bid to get around UK rules on news broadcasting impartiality. TalkRadio, which is also owned by Murdoch, already operates by that standard. Itrsquos effectively a licence to propagandise, with highly partisan and provocative presenters thriving in a culture wars battleground. LBC, the countryrsquos other major talk radio network, operates to pretty much the same standards. It made Nigel Farage a presenter. Farage no longer hosts but itrsquos an open secret hersquod love another big media  to further his agenda. Therersquos speculation about his involvement in one of the rival ventures.These rival plans to the BBC prove some unpleasant truths about the broadcaster. The BBC is much less clever than it thinks, for starters ndash as the corporation created the very monster which is now attempting to eat it alive.The BBC, for years now, has pursued a clickbait agenda. Once you get beyond its traditional reporting slots ndash like the Six OrsquoClock News ndash its current affairs programming is cheap and sensationalist. Question Time being the number one offender.Think of the characters shows like Question Time created and pushed into the public consciousness. It gave Nick Grfin, the former leader of the BNP, a  it became like a rolling bandwagon for Nigel Farage it put Katie Hopkins on stage. The BBC fed the right-wing beast ndash and now the forces of the right are coming for it.The BBC also turned Andrew Neil from a partisan newspaper man into a national broadcaster. Neilrsquos background is evidently right-wing ndash and therersquos nothing wrong with that it might not be my political slant on le, but in newspapers itrsquos standard operating procedure to take a political position and fight for it. Thatrsquos what a free press is meant to do. The BBC, however, must be impartial.A savvy operator like Neil is perfectly capable of keeping any bias in check on air, but letrsquos be clear: the BBC built him into a powerful figure in British television ndash now it seems hersquos coming for them as a rival.The BBC also created the atmosphere in which these rival bids are thriving. Itrsquos pandered to a culture wars agenda ndash not just promoting the likes of Katie Hopkins, but elevating every Twitter storm into a national debate.As the old saying goes ndashyou sow the wind, you reap the whirlwind. The BBC is so clodhopping it even stokes culture wars against itself. The recent row over the singing of Rule Britannia during the BBC Proms was confected nonsense but the broadcaster worked to ramp up the storm in discussion segments.Herein lies the key flaw with the BBC ndash it should stick to reporting the news, not commenting on the news. Itrsquos the BBCrsquos job to tell the nation, impartially and intelligently, whatrsquos going on nationally and internationally through its publicly funded journalism. Itrsquos not the BBCrsquos job to get clicks online and stir up social media rows.Leave the commenting to newspapers. The British press is historically a rambunctious free-for-all ndash in print, the news should be reported with accuracy and balance, but in terms of comment you can fight your political corner as vehemently as you wish, within the limits of libel laws and decency. In contrast, broadcasting rules are very clear on standards of impartiality. And that makes sense ndash a newspaper isnrsquot piped into your home. You chose to read a particular paper. In Britain, you donrsquot chose the BBC ndash itrsquos a fact of le, like death and taxes hellip at least, until the Tories use the licence fee to finish it off.We got a hint that even the BBC sees the writing on the wall with reports that the new director-general, Tim Davie, is apparently lsquoopenrsquo to the broadcaster implementing some Netflix-style subscription model, in the wake of a damaging poll showing ebbing public faith.As an aside, I should point out that while the BBC has pandered to a right-wing agenda, thatrsquos now coming for it, itrsquos also pandered to the so-called lsquowoke leftrsquo, whose activists equally hate it. The BBC tried to play both sides against the middle and failed miserably.A word of advice for the BBC. Forget about social media ndash itrsquos drugged you and your journalists and you can no longer see the wood for the trees when it comes to reporting. Get your staff off Twitter ndash itrsquos not a good look when it comes to impartiality. Stick to reporting the news, not trying to whip up storms through comment on the news.The problem is, itrsquos too late to change the BBC. And that spells trouble for British democracy. The incorporation of Fox News-style TV to Britain will make our current culture wars look like a playground tf. Wersquoll further ide, truth will become ever more remote. Look to America ndash thatrsquos a land we donrsquot want to venture towards as a society.

In July of the next year the bowlers approached the town council for a seal of cause and on November ,  by charter or seal of cause the provost, magistrates and council erected a corporation or body corporate\".New rules were presented to the magistrates for their approval, the societys proceedings ldquobeing always consistent with the Laws of the land, customs of this City, and the trust reposed in the said Incorporation\". The trig is referred to in two of these rules which pre-date the first \"Laws of the Gamersquo by some  years:ldquo A right-handed bowler must keep his right foot on the trig when he plays, and a left-handed bowler his left foot.ldquo The trig must be laid within four feet of the place where the block lay the last end.The trig is nowadays referred to as the mat and is the place from which bowls are delivered.Sir Walter Scott was a member of the society and Burns played there as a guest on one of his visits to Edinburgh.David McGill, Edinburgh EH.A DEAD LOSSTHE moral of the Emperorrsquos New Clothes has clearly been missed at the Glasgow School of Art .There is no beauty in the photograph of a dead bird.

It comes after research found that during lockdown those living in more deprived areas had less access to gardens and green spaces.It is estimated that one in eight households has no garden, making access to parks more important.WWF Scotland said this figure is concerning as multiple studies have shown the benefits of nature to physical and mental wellbeing.The conservation charity says their findings add more weight to a fresh post-Covid campaign to ldquotransformative actions that will help Scotlandrsquos nature and ldquobuild a fairer future for all.Launched by a host of environmental charities including RSPB Scotland, Scottish Wildle Trust and WWF Scotland, it highlights five areas for immediate action from the Scottish Government: restoring and protecting Scotlandrsquos globally important peatlands replacing and expanding native forests improving deer management creating a new system to support eco-friendly farming and linking up wild places through a new Scottish Nature Network.Other proposals include introducing new legislation to ensure all new development is net-positive for nature establishing a Scottish inspectorate to tackle invasive non-native species and committing to at least a third of Scotlandrsquos seas being highly protected.Lang Banks, director at WWF Scotland said: ldquoThese findings make it clear that nature is a boost to peoplersquos wellbeing and that the majority of people in Scotland really valued having the opportunity to get out into nature during lockdown.\"Sadly, we know that not everyone has access to greenspace, with people living in the most deprived areas less able to enjoy nature close to home. Itrsquos in all our interests that everyone is afforded the chance to enjoy easy access to greenspaces and more nature.ldquoThatrsquos why our recent Nature Recovery Plan, calls for a change to planning policy, ensuring that new developments enhance and make space for nature and that habitats across Scotland are better managed and better connected. We need the places we live and work to support our collective well-being where people and nature can thrive.With the current climate and bioersity crises affecting species, habitats and landscapes here in Scotland and around the globe, the survey also found people in Scotland showed great concern for our natural world.Almost three-quarters of those askedsaid the Scottish Government should take decisive action to tackle the nature and climate emergencies on a similar scale taken to tackle the COVID- crisis.A recent study by researchers at the University of Exeter found that spending time in the garden is linked to similar benefits for health and wellbeing as living in wealthy areas.People with access to a private garden also had higher psychological wellbeing, and those with an outdoor space such as a yard were more likely to meet physical activity guidelines than those without access to outdoor space.Britainrsquos parks and fields are also at signicant risk of development, according to new research by the Fields in Trust charity.It estimated that . million people currently lived more than a -minute walk away from a public park, and this figure could increase by a further , in the next five years.The study, which coincides with Field in Trusts annual green space index, suggests that the equivalent of , football pitches worth of green space could be lost in the next  years due to population growth.Earlier research from Fields in Trust suggested that the wellbeing value associated with the frequent use of green spaces is worth more than pound billion each year to the UK.A Scottish Government spokesman said: \"Scotland is an environmental leader and the importance of green space is recognised in our policies from health to regeneration, early years to planning. Such spaces are important for peoplersquos health and our towns and cities boast a wealth of them. Our urban areas are % greenspace and our planning policy promotes these spaces as part of successful place-making.ldquoWe are also encouraging communities to get involved in the design, management and maintenance of greenspaces through our planning advice and funding for community regeneration.ldquoWe are also investing in the quality of our greenspaces, including funding the Central Scotland Green Network, Through the CSGN Development Fund we have invested more than pound million since  in projects that are promoting active travel, woodland planting, community growing and restoring land for the Central Scotland Green Network."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-andrew-mckie-activists-swapped-politics-cult-membership","story":"Bismarckrsquos career, however, is as good an example as one could present of just how many unlikely things, like creating an empire from scratch, are in the realms of the possible. Bismarckrsquos distinction should really be seen as being between ideas, however bizarre, that are realisable, and those that are merely idealistic.Charles Fourier, one of the godfathers of libertarian socialism, thought that the oceans would turn into lemonade when the workersrsquo paradise was achieved, which seems unlikely. But he was just as thoroughly mocked for some of his other wacky notions, which included feminism , redistribution of wealth, homosexual equality and the foundation of a Jewish state in Palestine.Politics may not be able to contravene the laws of nature, which includes human nature. Attempts to produce ldquosystems so perfect that no one will need to be goodmay be doomed by humanityrsquos instincts towards free association, self-interest, collective action, the desire to trade, to challenge authority or any of dozens of other impulses.But when it comes to redrawing longstanding borders, or throwing out regimes, or even fundamental forms of government, that have seemed invincible, history has no shortage of examples. Indeed, what most of us think of as history is a list of such events: the fall of Rome, the Reformation, the French Revolution, universal suffrage and countless other seismic changes that were thought unthinkable by many, until they happened.In Malcolm Bradburyrsquos novel The History Man, when someone objects to a Marxist studentrsquos assertion that ldquoall forms of knowledge are ideological. That means they are politics, another student asks: ldquoWho is this crazy doll  She says we donrsquot need a revolution.Howard Kirk, the bookrsquos radical protagonist, replies: ldquoThere are people who think like thathellipthere werenrsquot, we wouldnrsquot need a revolution. The historical fact of revolutions is proof that that what once seemed unthinkable is perfectly possible politically. The same is true of counter-revolutions: the historian Richard Cockettrsquos account of the academics and think-tanks that challenged the economic and political assumptions of the post-war period was entitled Thinking the Unthinkable.Yet those ideas about markets and globalisation have been dominant for decades, as was the Clause IV-era of socialism that preceded them .Clearly, these positions are all in the realms of the possible. The error ndash whatever the claims of Marxian historicists, or those who believe in the necessary triumph of liberal democracy , or assert that technology, or laisser-faire economics, can fix anything ndash is to think them inevitable.Despite that, there is a growing tendency among those actively committed to certain kinds of politics ndash notably the Left, though it is apparent on all points of the compass ndash to consider any contrary view unthinkable:not strictly speaking impossible, somehow impermissible.They mostly donrsquot seem to think that because of pseudoscientic Marxist economics or post-Hegelian historical determinism, but because they are incapable of seeing why anyone  might not share their views. Much of the current atmosphere of what passes for political discourse is not about disagreements, however vehement, about basic principles, or even the traditional,sometimes irrational, tribal loyalty of political parties .Instead, justication is by faith alone, and evidence can be cheerfully disregarded when it collides with doctrine. Whatrsquos more, its claims are to be advanced by constant searches for heresy: those who donrsquot share the grouprsquos opinions are not just wrong, but wicked. They canrsquot just be mistaken they have to be thick, or misled by deceitful conspiracies, or fascist.All sorts of people, some of whom previously seemed fairly normal, now operate like this. Ardent Remainers, of course, who think anyone who voted for Brexit was thick, misled, selfish, too old for their views to count and, naturally, racist. But Leavers who now maintain anything except a WTO settlement is a betrayal look very nearly as unhinged.Corbynites, who collectively share the delusion that only a conspiracy of Tories masquerading as members of the Labour Party prevented St Jeremy from gaining a landslide win. Anyone who thinks that the Union, or independence, is a self-evident, easily settled or straightforward issue, even when presented with the knowledge that their side can be no more than a few percentage points ahead. Those convinced of the existence ndash nay, the desirability ndash of identity politics and coming race or culture wars, and who are deeply entrenched in their commitment to one side or the other.All of these groups seem to regard it as an affront, not only to their own opinions, but to the natural order of things, that they might not be on the winning side. But itrsquos not particularly useful to deny reality.Letrsquos take an example I suspect most of us will find uncontroversial. I donrsquot think Donald Trump is a good president. He has a record that ought to make it certain hersquoll lose: unemployment is over  per cent, the economyrsquos in trouble and hundreds of thousands of people have died. He keeps saying things that are demonstrably untrue. He gives plenty of evidence of being an unscrupulous and unsuitable candidate.But I still think Mr Trump might win, yet the reaction of most of his opponents to Joe Bidenrsquos relatively poor polling is to maintain that their man is still ahead, and to deny that Mr Trump can prevail. If he does, they will claim that he has cheated.I can readily believe that Mr Trump would cheat, but that attitude is missing the point. If they donrsquot understand that it is possible for others to disagree with them, theyrsquore not engaged in politics, but magical thinking.

That strategy failed in a blizzard of broken promises and unfinished and lethally dangerous hospitals, bungled police centralisations and ferry fiascos. It promised to abolish the ldquohated council tax, institute a local income tax and deliver class sizes of  for P-P and have a referendum within  days. None of it achieved. It promised to abolish PFI but ended up as major users of it. The standard of Scottish education has declined drastically in the SNP years, key health targets have been set but not met for years on end. It is fair to say that the competence strategy has failed. The gang that couldnt shoot straight has nothing on the SNP in taking a beady aim at the totally wrong target and then missing it by a country mile.If competence is out, what of the economic case for independence  The SNPs own Growth Commission decided that there was no case without extended austerity, tax rises and public service cuts. The collapse of the oil priceand the costs of the virus pandemic have emphasised the strength that we get from being part of the larger UK economy. Last weeks GERS figures confirmed that an average Scottish family would be almost pound, a year worse offwe left the UK. Next year the full impact of Covid- will hit the accounts, making this year seem like a sea of tranquillity by comparison. No wonder the SNP has withdrawn its promise to publish an annual ldquoeconomic case for independence. There isnt one.So, back to competence. Some claim that the Scottish Government has performed better than the UK Government in the pandemic. But has it  The three main disasters of the pandemic have been the movement of untested elderly people to care homes and the resultant mortality, the lack of a testing strategy and the exams fiasco. In the first two Scotland has done worse than the UK, in the second no dferent. For death rates during the pandemic there is nothing to dferentiate Scotland from the rest of the UK. Is Nicola Sturgeon a more convincing communicator than Boris Johnson  Indeed she is. Should that deflect from the grim statistics of failure and incompetence that both preside over  Indeed it should not.If the Scottish people vote in line with the current polling numbers next year, what will they be voting for  Certainly not competent governance from the SNP. And will a large number of the electorate really vote to make themselves, their families so much poorer  Next May is a long way off and it is still possible that public opinion will catch up with the facts. We have to hope so for the sake of our country and its citizens.Alex Gallagher, Labour councillor, North Ayrshire Council, Largs.NICOLA Sturgeon used to say \"judge me on education\" and we all know how well that has gone. Now she is saying \"judge me on jobs\" and it looks to be in the same category. As the coronavirus epidemic continues to make a mockery of her so-called \" safe pair of hands policy\" we are witnessing an economic meltdown with few parallel health benefits. Scotland might even be heading for another lockdown as well as losing a large number of jobs.With this backdrop of very major problems Ms Sturgeon is unleashing her \"national mission\" for greener and better-paid jobs to stimulate the Scottish economy. This is called putting the cart before the horse. Is it any wonder many of us are still questioning the economic competence of both the current Scottish Government and its flagship quest for independence Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow G.COLIN Mayalloddly involves Burns whilst not addressing the incontrovertible truth that devolution has failed. I have long believed that the current SNP incarnation, and there have been a few, was the accidental consequence of too many pints of heavy and a penchant for the songs of the Corries in the s. A mass hangover. Like those nights of ancient memory, the morning after independence we will all wish it had not happened, and we will all have all made utter fools of ourselves along the way. There is, and never has been, an economic case for independence.John Dunlop, Ayr.WHERE on earth did William Loneskieget the idea that an independent Scotland would have ldquono currency, no currency reserves, no central bank  Of the vast number of countries around the world which have become independent since the Second World War can he name a few to whom this would have applied On day one of independence, Scotland would have a currency. The threats during the last referendum that Westminster the Bank of England would not ldquoallow Scotland to use sterling, were patently rubbish, as any country can choose the currency it wishes to use without any permission. How many around the world use the US dollar without US permission Equally, any country becoming independent will set up a central bank and decide whether to use its own currency or some other, according to what seems most suitable. If its own, new currency seems best, old and new currencies can run parallel for as long as it deems necessary. Then those who wish to change to the new currency can do so without loss of value, and then every sum exchanged from the ldquoold currency automatically provides the central bank with foreign reserves.Anent Mr Loneskiersquos other unfounded assumptions, one major credit rating agency, Moodyrsquos, I believe, stated even in  that Scotland would have top rating, while the UK was having its rating downgraded. With the dire state of Westminster debt, I doubt that has changed.The GERS so-called ldquodeficit for Scotland is a based almost entirely on estimates b includes as Scottish debits expenditures an independent Scotland would not have ndash for example, a new sewage system for London, Crossrail, HS, the Brexit lorry park at Dover, Trident, two aircraft carriersc is a reflection of how well or badly Westminster has managed the spending of our Scottish taxes and d only illustrates the future state of Scotlandrsquos financeswe make the exact same decisions and spend on exactly the same things.Regarding pensions, the Pensions Minister in  actually put it in writing to the Scottish Government that legally, all pensions for which people had paid their contributions would continue to be paid as before.Everything  mentioned in Mr Loneskiersquos letter is mere supposition. Cuts in public expenditure and salaries, privatisation, and tax increases, are assumptions he makes about the policies of whichever party governs after the initial independent election. I doubtanyone has heard any suggestion of supervision by the IMF, which I find quite ludicrous.Perhaps all this is simply a wish list of fearmongering from a unionist in a panic, who realises that the Union has no compelling arguments left.P Davidson, Falkirk.SCOTLAND is not the basket case William Loneskie would have us believe, as we have vast natural resources, a highly educated population, with a healthy balance of trade surplus and in the top  global economies in terms of income generated per head.As GERS attributes % of the estimated deficit as interest on the pound trillion national debt run up by Westminster I assume that Scotland will get its population share of the UKrsquos reserves of pound billion and our share of the Bank of Englandrsquos reserves of pound billion to support our new central bank and currency.I doubtanyone can show how much of the UKrsquos debt was spent in Scotland over above our tax contributions, particularly when oil and gas revenues contributed surpluses for much of the last  years.Even before Covid and Brexit, the UK was the worst performing economy in Europe, in OECD and in the G. Scotlandrsquos chance to become a wealthier nation sits with independence and not with staying tied to the self-destructing UK economy, and a Brexit that we didnrsquot vote for.Fraser Grant, Edinburgh EH.WE dont need GERS arithmetic to tell us north of the Border that we dont count, nor do we require these statistics to know that those who politically compile them cant count, because there is an ever-present enigma at the very core of this annual exercise. Started by John Majors Tory Government in  to, hopefully, deter Scots from wanting devolved government, it didnt do the trick, no more than it does today. The enigma is that GERS is supposed to show Westminster is subsidising us Scots and that therefore any prosperity enjoyed by us is due to us being part of the UK. As a UK liability it therefore follows thatWestminster willingly and knowingly keeps us, to its cost, then either its kindness tolerates this or  its sums are wrong.In whatever event, a kindly disposed UK should be happy to have Scotland as a self-governing sovereign neighbour, orGERS numbers are correct, and we are a financial liability, then a hard-faced, cash-driven UK should be relieved, delighted even, to have us removed from its economic computations.As many of us say about this GERS thing, it doesnt quite add up.Ian Johnstone, Peterhead.IAN Moirstates \"Edinburgh splashes out more than a billion\" on trams and \"Edinburgh splashes the cash on two additional bridges across the Forth\", clearly suggesting the \"Edinburgh\" concerned was the Scottish Government.It was Edinburgh City Council which wasted so much on the tram system, much against the wishes of the Scottish Government.

This is only the beginning though.“The plan will evolve and respond to reflect the feedback and the needs of the sector. We are therefore calling for industry to review and contribute to the plan.” The recovery plan is available to view on the CLF website.Feedback can be submitted via the website on enquiries@constructionforum.scot by September .CLF will take all feedback on board to help develop the plan further, with regular updates published on the CLF site.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The infrastructure proposals have been designed to enable Orkney to manage a transition away from fossil fuels, while continuing to generate social and economic benefit from ongoing oil and gas activity.The proposals will have #transformational# impact on Orkney#s economy and society. As well as creating as many  new jobs, there will also be a substantial number of job opportunities during the construction phase.OIC leader James Stockan said: “Our vision is to build a truly sustainable business that is a core economic asset for Orkney, but also a first phase in enabling a scale of investment and logistical capability for the UK, which will be of international signicance.“Prime Minister Boris Johnson clearly welcomed our ambition and Orkney’s potential during his recent visit to our islands, describing as a ‘fantastic idea’ our vision for Orkney as a low-carbon, zero-emissions hub of innovation, with Scapa Flow at its heart.“We believe the time is right to maximise the incredible natural assets and geography of Scapa Flow and Orkney, to ensure a long-term sustainable future for our communities. We are open for business now, and ready to work with potential investors and operators to develop the signicant strategic and international opportunities Scapa Flow offers.“The Scapa Deep Water Quay proposal has been included in the Islands Deal list of projects that has received funding commitment from the Scottish and UK governments, and we are continuing to ensure that the funding earmarked for this will be secured.”Central to the project is the unique geographical advantage of Scapa Flow, described by the council as the largest natural deep-water harbour in the northern hemisphere, as the potential setting for internationally signicant marine logistics to serve the new and emerging sectors, including low-carbon fuel transition and offshore wind developments.Scapa Deep Water Quay is seen as the optimal location for construction and operations and maintenance activities, associated with offshore wind, as well as for a liquefied natural gasstorage and distribution hub. At the same time, this infrastructure has the capability to accommodate semi-submersible s of all types, giving Orkney a unique UK competitive edge within the existing oil and gas market.The project team believes it could be delivered by . Other proposals, such as Hatston and Kirkwall, could take three or four years to deliver.Phase two will ultimately develop the islands’ smaller harbours and piers across the islands.Harbour users and key stakeholders were consulted from the outset, to help gain an understanding of the issues, constraints and opportunities associated with harbour infrastructure around Orkney, through workshops and interviews. The range of stakeholders includes local communities, harbour users, potential funders and environmental bodies such as Scottish Natural Heritage.Harbourmaster James Buck added: “Tackling decarbonisation is the strand that binds these proposals together, providing infrastructure and knowledge for renewable energy developments around our waters will allow us to reach climate change targets. “We will also look at the potential for net environmental gain through habitat reinstatement and enhancement.”According to the OIC, Orkney Harbours is one of the most erse and successful council-run port authorities in the UK, with an annual turnover of £ million and nearly , annual vessel movements.The council added that the exact timing of construction for each of the phase one masterplan proposals is not yet known.This will be determined over the next six to  months, and will depend on a range of factors including market requirements, funding and environmental considerations.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Then it was quite clear we were falling. I remember seeing the sea coming towards us too quickly.#As we were coming down, it felt like the chopper had lurched to one side and the pilot tried to right it, but a little bit too far, so we hit on the other side.#The inquiry had heard Mr Bower had been sitting in a seat directly behind the pilot#s cockpit after boarding the CHC-owned helicopter.Mr Richardson asked him: #From your perspective, you heard a noise, the helicopter was moving to your left, there was a correction, and then it moved to your right.##That#s correct,# Mr Bower replied, adding the aircraft instantly #went over#.#It took people by surprise,# he said. #There wasn#t enough time. There was a point when we were coming out of the cloud and the sea was coming towards us. It was quite clear it wasn#t right.#He said the aircraft was then #filling up instantly# with water.Mr Bower said #training kicked in# and he was able to remove a window before swimming to the surface of the water.Sherf Principal Derek Pyle was shown a safety video which offshore workers watched ahead of the flight, which gave instructions on the wearing of survival suits, lejackets and the use of specialist equipment.Mr Bower said the video related more to a controlled ditching situation # a landing on water # than to a crash.The inquiry later heard that a fth worker on the aircraft, Samuel Bull, subsequentlydied in December  after taking his own le.Sherf Principal Pyle said it was important to record that there was another victim, apart from the four who died on the day of the tragedy.Meanwhile, another worker described how his lejacket failed to properly inflate once he was out of the Super Puma.Paul Sharp, who was working as a scaffolder offshore, said: #I was looking out the window on my left hand side and all I could see was water. I remember someone screaming but I don#t know who that was. The person next to me # I called him the #Magazine Man# because he had magazines in his pockets # said #what the f***#s going on ##And then the impact happened.#* The inquiry continues...Ryan Taylor has worked as a reporter since , and has been at The Shetland Times since , covering a wide iety of news topics.Before then he reported for other newspapers in the Highlands, where he was raised, and in Fe, where he began his career with DC Thomson.

But what of other aspects What of community resilience, something I suspect will barely register as a priority for most us when deciding on our weekly shop It may be the case that more people will try and grow more of their own food and local produce will, hopefully, be in greater demand.All very welcome. But what’s really needed is a completely fresh approach to our behaviour as consumers.As the pound in our pocket becomes ever more stretched we need to value it in terms of what benefit it can bring to the wider collective # who can it support, what should it support and how can that can bring about greater resilience within our own communities.It’s not radical or revolutionary. It’s just about taking a bit more time and effort to think about where best to spend our cash, especially when it comes to our most basic of needs.It can’t possibly make sense to get your Sunday roast from the supermarketthe same cut of meat is available at your local butcher at a comparable price . And especiallythat butcher has sourced his meat from the crofter down the road.It takes a bit of extra effort to call in at the butcher, for sure, but add in important elements like food miles and provenance and there really is no excuse, except for our own inherent laziness.It has always amazed me how there is any fish at all on the shelves of supermarkets in this part of the world when the local fishmongers offer far higher quality at a lower price.And, in any case, it’s now perfectly possible to buy direct from the fisherman, with many of them now offering sales to the public.That may have come about through the closure of their overseas markets during lockdown, but what better example of necessity being the mother of invention.If west-coast prawns were coveted by sophisticated palates on the Mediterranean, then they should be more than adequate for consumption a bit closer to home.It’s not that long ago that our communities were completely self-reliant in food.We do demand a more discerning choice these days # no-one would want toto a diet made up entirely of fish, mutton and potatoes.But, with an abundance of quality produce on our own doorstep, surely it makes sense to take more advantage of that and in the process create greater community resilience through sourcing from independent, local retailers.If there’s a downside to that approach, I fail to see it.ONE aspect that looks certain to change, certainly for the foreseeable, is that there will be less air travel.Through the lockdown it is estimated that carbon emissions have been reduced by over  per cent by planes being grounded alone.That’s not even taking account of reductions in car journeys and it is a staggering figure from just one simple change.There are certain elements in the environmental lobby who would have you believe that methane emissions from cattle make a signicant contribution to climate change.Never mind that bovineshave roamed the land for thousands of years without causing much harm.Never mind that it’s only the last  or  years, as our economy became ever reliant on fossil fuels, that the damage to our planet has been made.The reduction in air travel will be for economic, more than environmental, reasons.But the staggering statistics of these last few months should at least mean that when it comes to a real determination in tackling environmental damage the finger of blame will be pointed in the right direction.Then again, maybe cows are a much easier target."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image.jpg","title":"royal celtic societys unique music","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWork has begun on processing the twenty entries received for a unique competition which set the country’s musicians the challenge of creating a new shinty composition.

After years of campaigning, same-sex couples of faith can finally register to marry in a church or other religious setting.In line with our campaign, we are pleased that the law will protect religious freedom, and that churches will neither be compelled nor prevented from offering wedding ceremonies to same-sex couples.This is an important issue for many couples in Northern Ireland, who have previously been prevented by law from marrying in their own church.We now urge the Government to finish the job of marriage equality in Northern Ireland by allowing couples in civil partnerships to convert to married statusthey so wish.Rev Chris Hudson, minister of All Souls Church in Belfast, which is a member of the Non-Subscribing Church of Ireland, also welcomed the law change.He said: This is great news for couples who wish to celebrate their marriage in church, embraced by family, friends and the love of God.I have already been speaking to a number of couples who have been waiting for this day so they can finally have the church wedding that they have longed for.Same-sex civil marriage became legal here on January  this year.

This report is confirmation of how big a con by republicas that ‘decommissioning’ was.”However, all the weaponry controlled by the IRA was confirmed to have been decommissioned in  when the senior IRA figure liaising with the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning gave an assurance that the organisation’s entire arsenal was put beyond use.The decommissioning process was hailed by the British and Irish Governments, and praise was heaped on the committee headed by Canadian general John de Chastelain.West Belfast-based Catholic priest Fr Alex Reid and former Methodist president Rev Harold Good witnessed the decommissioning.In a statement afterwards, the two clergymen said: “We are satisfied that the arms decommissioning represents the totality of the IRA’s arsenal.”It is claimed that in the MI recordings of the dissident meetings New IRA leaders boast of having raised signicant funds abroad.A source with knowledge of the recordings said: “They boast about raising £m in America and Russia, the bulk of which came from America, but claim they can’t get access to the money.”It is also claimed that the New IRA leaders complain about the lack of respect they receive compared to former IRA leaders.A Glaswegian, Dennis McFadden, was last week named in court as an MI agent by lawyers representing those dissident republicans facing charges following the sting operation in Co Tyrone.Houses were bugged during Operation Arbacia, which has devastated the New IRA.

Learners seeking to book a new test will still be no closer to getting on the road for education, work or pleasure,” she said.“Driver Vehicle Agencyoperators are still working on the basis that general booking will not open until the November .“To make matters worse departmental officials are now telling customers to expect a three to  four month delay beyond average waiting times to take their test.“This would push first tests for many of our young people well into the new year.“Thousands of homes and workplaces would be affected, and the livelihoods of local driving instructors put under further pressure.“This situation is completely unacceptable. It is not something the public or we as elected representatives should be willing to accept – nor is it something the minister or officials can continue to deflect from.”Ms McIlveen has urged the department to work urgently with the DVA to increase capacity.“Moving ahead there are serious concerns around the DVA’s ability to deal with an influx of requests when general booking eventually does reopen,” she said.Meanwhile, MOT testing services for additional vehicle categories including four-year-old cars and motorbikes resumed on Tuesday.MOT tests were suspended in January after faults were detected in some of the lt equipment.The vehicle tests were further disrupted by lockdown.DVA issued temporary exemption certicatesfor some vehicles so that motorists could stay on the road.PAMost ReadTerrorist who allowed Newry home to be used for IRA plotting dies suddenlyNI primary school closes classroom after pupil tests positive for coronavirusDUP MLA questions police Portstewart promenade closure to put brakes on #boy racers# Coronavirus Northern Ireland: No further deaths and  new cases confirmedMI bugging #casts doubt on destruction of IRA arms#,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

These courses could potentially add hundreds of additional students to the Magee campus. They include physiotherapy, radiography, occupational therapy, podiatry and speech  language therapy. Now that the medical school has been approved and the school of nursing is based at Magee, it is believed that these courses would be complementary. In February , Ulster University launched a public consultation on the future location of its School of Health Sciences.The consultationwaspausedin April when the University revieweditsdecision to conduct a full Equality Impact Assessment . googletag.cmd.push The augmented consultation willre-open onstSeptember, with the EQIA open for  weeksuntil th Novemberand the location consultation running concurrently, butremaining open for a further two weeks, closing onthDecember. The Health Sciences appraisal document identies the Magee as the preferred option for undergraduate courses. It says: Based on the evidence gathered and presented, the Magee option maximises subject alignment and synergies,bolstering the potential for interprofessional learning. The Magee campus will be the location of the School of Medicine, now recruiting staff and students for  opening following NI Executive approval and ring-fenced funding, and successful progression through the next steps of the General Medical Council’srigorous quality assurance process for new medical schools. googletag.cmd.push It is also home for the delivery of undergraduate nursing. Such a mix of disciplines creates the opportunity not only for anenriched student experience, but also provides the basis for educational interventions designed to enhance clinical outcomes. The use of shared infrastructure also provides opportunities and efficiencies across Schools allowing for investment in high-end equipment which will have a positive impact on the quality of the student learning experience and provide staff with the very best teaching equipment. This option has the potential to achieve campus sustainability by maximising capital investment in Magee, particularly, with the establishment of the Graduate Entry Medical School . This is particularly pertinent given recent pronouncements from Northern Irish politicians in support of the GEMS initiative at the Magee campus. There are other synergies with Personalised Medicine and C-TRIC both based in Magee and Altnagelvin.

These courses could potentially add hundreds of additional students to the Magee campus. They include physiotherapy, radiography, occupational therapy, podiatry and speech  language therapy. Now that the medical school has been approved and the school of nursing is based at Magee, it is believed that these courses would be complementary. In February , Ulster University launched a public consultation on the future location of its School of Health Sciences.The consultationwaspausedin April when the University revieweditsdecision to conduct a full Equality Impact Assessment . googletag.cmd.push The augmented consultation willre-open onstSeptember, with the EQIA open for  weeksuntil th Novemberand the location consultation running concurrently, butremaining open for a further two weeks, closing onthDecember. The Health Sciences appraisal document identies the Magee as the preferred option for undergraduate courses. It says: Based on the evidence gathered and presented, the Magee option maximises subject alignment and synergies,bolstering the potential for interprofessional learning. The Magee campus will be the location of the School of Medicine, now recruiting staff and students for  opening following NI Executive approval and ring-fenced funding, and successful progression through the next steps of the General Medical Council’srigorous quality assurance process for new medical schools. googletag.cmd.push It is also home for the delivery of undergraduate nursing. Such a mix of disciplines creates the opportunity not only for anenriched student experience, but also provides the basis for educational interventions designed to enhance clinical outcomes. The use of shared infrastructure also provides opportunities and efficiencies across Schools allowing for investment in high-end equipment which will have a positive impact on the quality of the student learning experience and provide staff with the very best teaching equipment. This option has the potential to achieve campus sustainability by maximising capital investment in Magee, particularly, with the establishment of the Graduate Entry Medical School . This is particularly pertinent given recent pronouncements from Northern Irish politicians in support of the GEMS initiative at the Magee campus. There are other synergies with Personalised Medicine and C-TRIC both based in Magee and Altnagelvin. The move to the Magee campus will also support economic growth in the North West and fostering of healthy communities within the City and wider environs.

The colleges smart new unorm includes a blazer and jumper piped in gold which can be worn with a skirt or trousers. School principal, Martine Mulhern, said the new look came about after pupils said they wanted to be able to decide which they wanted to wear. A lot of the girls prefer to wear a skirt, but they said other pupils should have the choicethey want to wear trousers, she said. The whole idea of respecting other peoples choices is very important. googletag.cmd.push Last year the school council surveyed the pupils who voted overwhelmingly in favour of introducing a trouser option. This led to a long process of designing the new unorm, with the pupils allowed their say in how it should look and feel. The conversation started with Hunters Apparel in Derry who gave us dferent designs and that solid groundwork allowed us to get to the place where we are today, said Mrs Mulhern. The girls were so mature and insightful throughout it all. They knew and understood that there were certain things we couldnt do, but it was so important they felt comfortable. googletag.cmd.push There were a few prototypes before we got to the finished designs, but everyone is delighted with them. They are all loving the new blazer because its very smart and really brightens things up, and a surprising number of them have decided to take the option of wearing trousers. StCecilias worked closely with local unorm suppliers Max Fashions and Select Kidz to keep the cost of the new unorm, which has been adopted by the new intake, down. There will be a gradual phasing out of the old unorm over the coming years. The girls are loving the new unorm and as a school community we are so proud of them for taking the lead, added Mrs Mulhern. The children always come first and we have to listen to them.

Micky Doherty was presented with the Foyle Pride Mark Ashton Award for Outstanding Contribution to the LGBTQ+ community by the citys real Mayor, SDLP Councillor Brian Tierney, at a ceremony at the Holywell Trusts Garden of Remembrance on Saturday night. A spokesperson for Foyle Pride said Mr Doherty, who fronts the citys Pride parade each year, was a truly deserving winner who does so much, for not only the LGBTQ+ community, but also the wider city and district community. Mr Doherty is a tireless charity fundraiser and helped set up a special fund to help local people in need during the oronavirus crisis. googletag.cmd.push Im known in the local area as being a charity fundraiser-theres a charity fundraiser Ill host it, said Mr Doherty. Its just part of me that I like helping people. During lockdown I knew people had started to struggle and they were coming to me and I started to think about how I could help. Because I have been working with charities for a long time people put their trust in me. Mr Doherty was hosting a drive through bingo event last week when he got a phone call to say he had won the Foyle Pride award. I just burst out crying, he admitted. I really didnt expect it so I was just overwhelmed. googletag.cmd.push I just have so much gratitude for the award and for everyone who nominated me and I want to thank them all. Mr Doherty said he wished his late mum, Cathy, could have been there on Saturday to see him receive his award. Its hard to accept that my mammy couldnt be there, he said. Its just not the same without her but I am still filled with so much gratitude for it, he said. Derry LGBT+ campaigner, Suzanna Toland, who passed away earlier this year, was remembered at Saturdays ceremony. It was really nice to see Suzanna recognised for everything that she did, said Micky. She was a very special person.Before she passed away she had set up an LGBT+ disco at Rosie Joes so that people would have a safe place to socialise.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The guidance, announced this evening by Peter Weir, comes into effect from August . The Minister said: “My key priority is that pupilsto school on a full-time basis, as soon as it is safe to do so. “Following further advice which I have received today from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientic Adviser, I am recommending that pupils and teachers wear a face covering in corridors and other communal areas of post-primary schools from next week when schoolsfull-time. googletag.cmd.push ”This updates the existing guidance on the use of face coverings in educational settings. “The current public health advice is that the use of face coverings provides some benefits, however, it is not a replacement for frequent hand washing, social distancing where possible, covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and regular cleaning of surfaces. “It is also important to remember that evidence suggests that the risk of transmission in schools is relatively low compared to some other settings. “My existing guidance on the reopening of schools already deals with the use of face coverings. “In terms of school transport, the advice remains the same, that we strongly recommend that all pupils wear a face covering on all dedicated school transport including buses and taxis where it is appropriate for them to do so. googletag.cmd.push “In relationto communal areas in schools, the guidance already strongly encourages face coverings for activities that entail large numbers of staff or pupils within an enclosed space where social distancing is not possible.  “Given the risk mitigations in place in schools to limit and contain the spread of Covid-, face coverings are not recommended as being compulsory for routine use in education settings. “However, staff and pupils may wish to use them during the routine school day and this is acceptable. “Schools should also be aware that some personsare exempt from wearing face coverings. “I will continue to keep all guidance in respect of education settings under review in light of the latest medical and scientic advice. Peter Weir added: “The first step in keeping our schools safe is that anyone with symptoms should not attend school. Parents should not send their children to schoolthey have any of the Covid- symptoms including: a high temperaturea new, continuous cougha loss or change to your sense of smell or taste.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is understood that the mystery vessel was bought for pound with the unknown owner planning to convert it into an Airbnb boat.  Foyle Search and Rescue , the police and other relevant agencies responded to reports of the boat being stuck on Sunday when they offered the crew assistance. The vessel, Day Dawn N , was last known to be engaged in fishing. according to the Marine Traffic website. Another site, Vessel Finder, also states that it received the latest position of the boat at .pm on August . googletag.cmd.push FSR were tasked on Sunday last, following reports of a grounded vessel. Pat Carlin, of FSR, said the boat was likely to be there until mid-September when the tide would be high enough for it to re-float. “She’s stuck solid,” he added. “We went and assessed the boat, determined that the crew were safe and passed that information on to the police service,” Mr Carlin explained “We provided them with some basic supplies that they needed and basically the vessel is grounded and can’t be move until the tide is lted. “All relevant services were notied and are aware that it’s there.” googletag.cmd.push Mr Carlin continued: “I think they were up on the council pontoon and to the best of my knowledge they may have come from outside the area, I don’t know exactly. “They’ll have no choice but to wait, maybe with the sudden floods tonightthey’ll be lucky and might get re-floated otherwise they’ll have to wait until the tides are high enough.” The PSNI confirmed that police assisted partners, including FSR and Coastguard in liaising with the crew. A report from , shows that Day Dawn N  was bought for the purposes of fishing from Portavogie. It was said to be the first time the vessel had been based anywhere  apart from Kilkeel since her arrival in  from Banff where the wooden-hulled boat was built by John Watt  Sons as a trawler. Harbour master at Portavogie, Neil Warnock, yesterday said Day Dawn was based there but left a couple of months ago. “Somebody bought it for a pleasure craft,” he explained. “It’s not a fishing boat any more, the licence on it was sold off a while ago there. “The last I heard the boat was in Portrush, I saw a picture of it at Portrush harbour after it left here.” At Portrush, the assistant harbour master said the boat owner was only there for three days and he believed the man travelled from the Greencastle direction. He was trying to get himself a permanent mooring, he said, but wasn’t able to secure it. The owner left Portrush heading towards Derry where he tried to get a mooring in the town and ended up on the mud flats. “I just know that he bought that for pound. None of the fishermen like decommissioning so they basically would rather they go off. “So I think he bought it for a pound and wanted to change it into an Air B ‘n’ B, but we couldn’t offer him a permanent mooring in Portrush, so he was only here for three days,” the Assistant Harbour Master added. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Foyle Port added: “Foyle Port is aware that a small trawler has run aground at Madams Bank in the River Foyle. “There is no environmental threat or impediment to other marine craft. “Once conditions are right we expect the vessel to become buoyant again.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Bark n Baths in the Springtown Industrial Estate has four dog washing stations equipped with a professional shower and dryer and specially formulated sham- poos and conditioners.  Co-owner Garaidh Tomas Grfiths said the idea came about after many dog owners had to start washing their own pets during lockdown. “All the dog groomers had to close but they were sharing videos online to show people how to wash and brush their dogs coat themselves, said Mr Grfiths. People had no choice but to do it for themselves, but they were bent over their bath and giving themselves a bad back. googletag.cmd.push Then they had to chase a wet dog around the house to try and dry them before they got that wet dog smell and after all that they had to spend another half an hour cleaning their bath so it could be used by the rest of the family again. Mr Grfiths, who also owns the Canine Lodge doggie day care, hit on the idea of opening a self service dog washing salon. “After lockdown people are looking to save as much money as possible and we are able to offer people the chance to wash their dog from as little as pound. googletag.cmd.push “Its great for people who have taken their dog to the beach or a country park and want to give them a quick wash and get rid of any sand or muck. Every station at Barks n Baths is set up with an industrial shower and dryer, highly absorbent towels, and PH balanced dog shampoo and conditioner and disposable aprons and gloves. A dogs PH level is dferent to a human so using the wrong product can affect their skin, coat and overall health, said Mr Grfiths If we can help someone maintain their dogs health we are happy to do it. A  minute session will cost pound and the price goes up from there to pound for  minutes, pound for  minutes and pound for an hour which would be long enough to wash and dry a big dog with long hair. There is also a private bay for dogs that may be anxious or anti-social. The private bay is partitioned off and has its own entrance so it is perfect for dogs that are nervous or aggressive around other dogs or people, added Mr Grfiths. We have had people come to us who have been told their dog isnt suitable to go to a groomer, so they are delighted this service is here. Bark n Baths is located at Site , Unit  in the Springtown Industrial Estate close to Cable  Accessories.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Derry man Stephen Whoriskey has loved Brooks’ music since she he was a teenager and often listens to it when he is having a tough time. The -year-old has struggled with anxiety, depression and insomnia on and off for nine years and the coronavirus lockdown brought his mental health problems to the fore again. In a bid to give him a distraction, his we Kimberly set him the challenge of learning to play the guitar and promised she would buy him the same model as the country music superstarhe succeeded. googletag.cmd.push Meanwhile, Stephen sent Garth a message on his live Facebook QA page sharing his battle with depression, asking how Brooks kept his spirits up during lockdown and telling him about his we’s guitar challenge. The Derry man burst into tears when Mr Brooks choose his question for a live video chat. “He said me and you have a lot in common, I deal with a lot of stuff too, said Stephen. “And he said he liked being dark for his music, but that the dference was he could switch it off. “I just broke down in tears. I ran up the stairs to my we but I couldn’t speak. googletag.cmd.push “She thought something bad had happened, but I just couldn’t get the words out.” Before signing off, Garth said he would send Stephen a guitar. Weeks had passed and there was no sign of the much-longed-for instrument, but out of the blue he got a call from UPS saying it was being held in customs as it might be made from illegal Brazilian rose wood. A frantic string of phone calls followed until a Garth Brooks impersonator from England, who had the same guitar, confirmed the rose wood was East Indian. Finally, Stephen’s guitar was delivered to his home in the Waterside and he hasn’t put it down since. “I still can’t really believe it, he said. “My two-year-old Aria was always slapping and twanging away at the strings on my old guitar, but she knows not to touch this one,” he laughed. “It shows how much Garth cares about his fans. “He always says his fans made him and they are like his family.” Stephen, who is a youth worker and a performer with ‘In Your Space’ circus said it’s important to him to be upfront about his mental health. “Lock down is so unprecedented, he said. “No one has ever been here before. “It has caused a lot of anxiety and depression. “Because I work with young people I think it’s important to show them it’s ok to talk about your feelings- particularly young men. “Younger and younger people are dealing with stuff like this. “I would say to anyone who is struggling to look for the small things to get you through. “But this, for me, was massive,” he added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In an article for last weeks Sunday Independent, former Derry player and GAA pundit Joe Brolly stated the Oakleaf board had borrowed a poundk Covid bounce-back loan and the county were currently poundk in debt. In the article, in which Brolly quoted former All-Ireland winning teammates Kieran McKeeverand Fergal P McCusker, who is part of Derrys Finance Committee, he said the board were having serious discussions about the feasibility of entering the senior team in the  championship. However, Derry GAA county board chairman Stephen Barker yesterday said: “The simple facts are: Derry GAA is on an extremely solid financial footing.” googletag.cmd.push Barker said that any talk of not entering a senior team in next years championship was completely farcical. “We are not in debt and any reports which suggest otherwise are completely ,” read a county board statement released yesterday. “Unfortunately, these baseless reports about our financial position are causing serious concern among our members and supporters. It is within this context that we feel it’s necessary to address these unhelpful reports by presenting the facts.” The statement also had an extract from Treasurer Martin Devlin, saying that Derry GAA will have capital assets of poundm by the end of this financial year, with no outstanding debt. googletag.cmd.push Devlin outlined that the countys accounts are annually audited. Derry GAA took out a capital loan of poundk in  to finalise the development of Owenbeg. Both Owenbegs stadium pitch and Celtic Park have had renovation work done on the playing surfaces during lockdown. The venues were in a poor state during the NFL NHL campaigns and subject to pitch inspections. Celtic Park is due to host three games in this weekends championship schedule and the senior hurling final is set for the city venue later this month. “At this time, % of that loan remains and the monies have already been set aside to complete that payment schedule within the next three months,” Devlin stated. As part of this seasons championship, the group games were played on a home, away and neutral basis, with a total of approximately poundk in gate receipts. Clubs were promised all the money from their home championship games. “We generated approximately poundk in gate receipts from the group stages and the county board has taken the decision to redistribute that money back to the clubs. “This should help to alleviate some of the financial pressure felt by our clubs due to the Covid- situation,” Barker points out. We are also planning ahead and have secured an additional facility of up to poundk,required, in line with our strategic plan. At this time, and with current interest rates due to Covid-, this just makes solid business sense. “Derry people are fanatical about the GAA and we are aware that these  reports are causing a lot of concern. We want to allay those fears because we are incredibly well served by our members and our loyal sponsors. “We have revealed these financial figures and released this statement because we want to put all this nonsense to rest.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In an article for last weeks Sunday Independent, former Derry player and GAA pundit Joe Brolly stated the Oakleaf board had borrowed a poundk Covid bounce-back loan and the county were currently poundk in debt. In the article, in which Brolly quoted former All-Ireland winning teammates Kieran McKeeverand Fergal P McCusker, who is part of Derrys Finance Committee, he said the board were having serious discussions about the feasibility of entering the senior team in the  championship. However, Derry GAA county board chairman Stephen Barker yesterday said: “The simple facts are: Derry GAA is on an extremely solid financial footing.” googletag.cmd.push Barker said that any talk of not entering a senior team in next years championship was completely farcical. “We are not in debt and any reports which suggest otherwise are completely ,” read a county board statement released yesterday. “Unfortunately, these baseless reports about our financial position are causing serious concern among our members and supporters. It is within this context that we feel it’s necessary to address these unhelpful reports by presenting the facts.” The statement also had an extract from Treasurer Martin Devlin, saying that Derry GAA will have capital assets of poundm by the end of this financial year, with no outstanding debt. googletag.cmd.push Devlin outlined that the countys accounts are annually audited. Derry GAA took out a capital loan of poundk in  to finalise the development of Owenbeg. Both Owenbegs stadium pitch and Celtic Park have had renovation work done on the playing surfaces during lockdown. The venues were in a poor state during the NFL NHL campaigns and subject to pitch inspections. Celtic Park is due to host three games in this weekends championship schedule and the senior hurling final is set for the city venue later this month. “At this time, % of that loan remains and the monies have already been set aside to complete that payment schedule within the next three months,” Devlin stated. As part of this seasons championship, the group games were played on a home, away and neutral basis, with a total of approximately poundk in gate receipts. Clubs were promised all the money from their home championship games. “We generated approximately poundk in gate receipts from the group stages and the county board has taken the decision to redistribute that money back to the clubs. “This should help to alleviate some of the financial pressure felt by our clubs due to the Covid- situation,” Barker points out. We are also planning ahead and have secured an additional facility of up to poundk,required, in line with our strategic plan. At this time, and with current interest rates due to Covid-, this just makes solid business sense. “Derry people are fanatical about the GAA and we are aware that these  reports are causing a lot of concern. We want to allay those fears because we are incredibly well served by our members and our loyal sponsors. “We have revealed these financial figures and released this statement because we want to put all this nonsense to rest.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Shortly before nine oclock to be precise. Peter Buzzers back bar in Maghera is sparsely populated. Apart from the commentary, as Gaeilge, from TGs GAA  programme humming out of the TV on the wall, you couldve heard a pin drop. Its a Monday club with a dference. There are no boom boxes, no empty take away pizza boxes strewn around the tables nor half drunk people roaring into your ear while making little or no sense. Less than  hours earlier, two decades of concerted Slaughtneil planning and effort morphed into a slick hunger Loughgiel simply couldnt deal with. By the tenth minute, the maroon and white hooped juggernaut had broken into the orbit of Ulster hurling. Nine points clear and  months after the hurt of an extra time defeat by Cushendall, there was no catching them. googletag.cmd.push In his victory speech, Chrissy McKaigue thanked every man, woman and dog involved in their success. Everyone except Thomas Cassidy, who had passed away days before. He waited until the inner sanctum of a packed Slaughtneil hall later that night, when back among their own. The Four Seasons Cup was clasped by one victorious outstretched fist. The index finger on his other hand gestured to the hall floor scarcely visible below the throngs of fans, where Thomas taught him how to play hurling all those years ago. There wasnt a dry eye in the house. Even the walls wouldve had goosebumps. googletag.cmd.push On the Monday night, his brothers Mark, Declan and Bungazed at Buzzers TV with a look and a body language that money couldnt buy. Slaughtneil were at the top of the tree. The new Ulster champions had many helping hands to shape them along the way. But the Cassidys fingerprints were always prominent. Taking over the mantle of the Kellys, who sowed the seeds in the s. Mark and Declan seemed like eternal minor managers when, in the beginning, silverware didnt always reward their toil. On a monsoon afternoon at Kevin Lynch Park, a saturated Bun thumped the roof of the then prefab dressing rooms to the sound of campeones. A team he managed with former minor winner Eoin McGuigan, that included Cormac McKenna and Chrissy McKaigue, had brought home the bacon. It was another building block. Also seated for that Monday viewing was Dermot Doherty, a selector under Michael McShane who is now running his eye over the minors. The apple doesnt fall far from the tree. His father Barney and the late Eugene Babs Kelly managed the clubs  winning team. It was a fitting reward for Barneys ferrying of average underage teams, year after year, in the back of his blue Mercedes van. Often on the lookout for a th player to make up a team that would iniably be on the end of many a hammering. An U shield at a blitz in Dungiven and a South Derry minor hurling final win against Lavey were the modest s for the effort. A FIRST FEacuteILE Below it all, another batch was coming to the fore to cut new ground. In , under Thomas and Barney and captained by current minor selector Adrian Quigg, Slaughtneil won their first ever Feacuteile title. By minor level, with direction from Mark and Declan Cassidy, back to back Ulster minor titles followed, from a group that also won a football title at St Pauls and lost in the final the following year. A generation that also produced current senior football boss Paul Bradley. Under Thomas wing, they won the senior title in  before being beaten out the gate by Dunloy in the Ulster final. It couldve been the beginning of dominance, but instead it was a last senior title for  years as Kevin Lynchs and Lavey ruled the roost. Armed with more coaches coming forward, the Slaughtneil underage hurling production line succeeded Ballinascreens time at the top. No longer was the journey south to the Feacuteile a novelty. It was a permanent fixture in the calendar. With it, came families bonding together and each success inspired the younger teams to follow. A new wave of minor glory at Ballinascreens Ulster tournament followed, but Kevin Lynchs were still the standard at senior level.  was supposed to be the breakthrough year. After winning a league title, Slaughtneils young guns were the pretenders to the Fr Collins Cup only to be sent home with their tail between their legs again by the Lynchs. It was neighbours Swatragh that took the cup for the first of eight seasons into the Granaghan parish where it still remains. The following year, under Mickey Glover, Slaughtneil eventually wrestled clear of Kevin Lynchs on their way to glory. In Ulster, their gung-ho tactics and bravery put Loughgiel to the pin of their collar in a moral victory to ascertain the level required. For the next two years they faced Cushendall in Ulster, but again came up short. All the while the underage production line continued. The Fr Collins Cup was present at one of the underage management meetings, almost as a sign of the level that needed maintained. With every year, came one or two new players into the squad. The fact that Michael McShane handed Shane McGuigan his senior debut in an Ulster final, while still a minor, was a sign of their commitment to growing the team to a height to challenge the big boys. McShane built a management team to match the players ambitions. Every base was covered. Cormac Donnelly came in as trainer. Their games were all analysed. Like the footballers and camogs, the strength and conditioning made them a finely tuned engine. The pre-game routine was planned to the nth degree, so that all the players had to do was turn up and deliver. And they did. Three Ulsters later and their stature on the national stage has soared. Cuala beat them in the manner Dunloy did in . It was followed by defeat to Na Piarsaigh, a game they surrendered from a position of strength. How times had changed. In the s, when Tom Magill had Lavey at their peak, just winning a championship game was a challenge. Now, not being happy after putting up a performance on the All-Ireland stage told enough about the ambition. The Ballyhale game was the greatest statement of intent, taking the giants of club hurling every step of the way. In the physical stakes, they were able to match them and in the skills of the game they were not found wanting either. In an epic, they came so close to the biggest day of all. This weekend, they enter the knockout championship stage again. They will have the favourites tag. There are no two ways around it. Last week, they saw off Na Magha with virtually a reserve team. Only Jerome McGuigan, suspended against Lavey, started from their All-Ireland semi-final team. Thats how far Slaughtneils hurling story has come. From the days when getting  players for a game was an achievement, they have set a standard of skill, attitude and athleticism that the rest of Derry must strive to reach. Success comes in cycles. In recent times, Kevin Hinphey has followed his father into coaching and led Kevin Lynchs to back to back Ulster minor hurling titles. They have been swimming in Slaughtneils wake, searching for ato the top table. The overall Derry hurling landscape needs them, and others, to narrow the gap. To do so, they will need to match an unrelenting hunger for more success. When you have had barren years like Slaughtneil, you wont want to step off the perch anytime soon.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The yells of delight at the tackle and the calls of support as she picked herself up were the perfect examples of the spirit in this Derry City Womens team as they enter a new season.That tackle came with the Candystripes - down against title hopefuls Sion Swts, but rather than disappear into themselves as would be natural, the circumstances only served to fire the girls enthusiasm, as they began to show what they were really about.The first half was a disappointment but no great surprise, a Sion team with loftier goals taking advantage of an opponent finding its feet with a whole host of new players. Sion will likely go on and win the league title, but for Derry City Women its about building a foundation, and last Wednesday showed the first signs of that at the Ryan McBride Brandywell Stadium.Four goals down at the break, the girls were re-organised by manager Kevin McLaughlin, who watched on as his team showed the hunger, the discipline and the enthusiasm he wanted to see. The only obstacle in that second period was physical tiredness, but even that was challenged by the improved mentality of the girls, with McMullans tackle just one moment of passion and drive shown by those in red and white. The result did not go their way, but there was pride and encouragement for the girls at the full-time whistle.“I think from a tactical point of view and a coaching point of view in the second half, it was what I wanted to see,” McLaughlin said afterwards.“We have made so many signings that in the first half, off the top of my head, I think we had only three players who played last season. It was always going to be a bit scatterbrainyou like. Because there werent disciplined in the first half, they had to do a lot of running and that actually tired them out for the second.“But you could see than in the second half that they were playing with discipline, they were playing their shape and we limited Sion to opportunities to mainly corner kicks, I know they scored at the end, that was probably due to tiredness, but they couldnt open us up in open play. That was brilliant from our point of view, because whoever finishes ahead of Sion this season is probably going to win the league.”As with most football leagues around the world, the Coronavirus pandemic has led to adjustments and the Danske Bank Premiership is no exception, the season starting at the end of August and finishing in just a matter of weeks at the start of November.Any football is better than no football however with the few games that there are providing the opportunity for the new players to settle into le as Derry City players.“We definitely have a stronger side this year, and the fact is, because of the restrictions there will only be ten games and no relegation, which is great also,” McLaughlin continued.“That doesnt mean that we take it easy because we still want to finish as high as we can. This was a litmus test against the best team in the league.“We can look at the second-half performance and take heart from that and see where we go, but I would like to put some points on the board and make some noise this season.“You could use this game as an analogy of the season. We still need to test the waters. Because they are all new coming in, we dont really know where we are going to land in this league.“The last two seasons we have just avoided relegation and we have stayed up which was great so were establishing ourselves in the Premier League instead of yo-yo-ing up and down so thats great.” googletag.cmd.push DERRY CITY SQUADClaire Friel, Jenna Doherty, Kathryn Canavan, Tara O’Connor, Coral Lapsley, Leah McGonagle, Danielle Doherty, Aiveen Lavery, Naomi McMullan, Megan Havlin, Eimear-Marie Callaghan, Natalie McFadden, Rosemary Cunningham, Lauren Cregan, Naoimh Callaghan, Nicole McCauley.

Due to Covid regulations there will be a restriction on the number of spectators who can be admitted to this Saturdays North West senior cup final at Beechgrove. There will be no pay at the gate facility in operation on the day- admission will be by strictly ticket only . Tickets can be purchased direct from either club or purchased online and details are provided below. Union General Manager, Peter McCartney, explained the process and how those hoping to attend Saturdays match needed to secure their ticket as soon as possible. googletag.cmd.push Covid restrictions mean that we have to have strict protocols in place for all games, however demand for this one is sure to exceed availability. We have carried out a Risk Assessment at Beechgrove and have agreed with both clubs that as well as teams and support workers we can accommodate  spectators  Contact tracing means it would be impractical to have a pay at the gate arrangement, therefore we have spoken atwith the two clubs and all parties have agreed on the ticket policy. We want to give priority to the supporters of Brigade and Donemana and they have been given the option of buying a quota of tickets to sell on to their own members. googletag.cmd.push Both clubs have however been instructed that complete lists of supporters who have purchased tickets must be provided to the Union by Friday evening. Anyone not on that list will be refused admission and unfortunately there can be no exceptions. It is absolutely vital that supporters who wish to attend the game speak to their clubs as soon as possible as we will not be able to accommodate any requests once the allocation has been sold. We know that a number of other cricket supporters in the North West will wish to attend and therefore we are also selling a small amount of tickets for public sale and these can be purchased online at Eventbrite. It’s a strange position to be in where we are restricting numbers for our showpiece final but I’d like to thank the committees of both Brigade and Donemana for their efforts and understanding in helping us reach a solution.” Tickets Tickets can be purchased either by contacting the clubs directly or at https:www.eventbrite  e north-west-senior-cup-final- tickets- Please note: no tickets can be purchased at the gate and all tickets must be purchased in advance.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He took trains from Milan to Torino, and then up the Susa Valley and around six hours later he was installed in Susa where it was  degrees.Race day dawned without a cloud in the sky and with the temperature already soaring, Hanna joined the front row of the grid designed for social distancing wearing his mask. The mask was obligatory for the first m. Hanna tucked into a front bunch that was a whorsquos who of Italian mountain racing. Hanna covered the first mile in :, and then at km the race became steep. He climbed well, as ever, encountering a dficult patch around the middle and then at about .km he spotted Baldaccini ahead of him, a past winner in  and .By now Hanna was in tenth place and with his climbing legs feeling good again set about moving up the field. He caught Baldaccini and kept pushing and on to the final k, with  flats and true flats at over , feet altitude, Hanna surged to cross the line in a brilliant eighth place.In the process he had taken the scalps of, not just the former winner of the race Baldaccini, but also Puppi, who had taken second place in last yearrsquos World Long-Distance Mountain Racing Championships, and Bernard Dematteis, the former European mountain racing champion.At Down Royal on Saturday, the sound of hi-tec racing flats reverberated around the horse racing turf as the ChampionChip Ireland Road Race Series continued following its event at Eikon, Balmoral, three weeks ago.It was only August , but could easily have been mistaken for late autumn as the blustery conditions from the remnants of tropical Storm Ellen continued to cause havoc in the quest for personal bests.It was a testament to the consistent running many had done during lockdown and throughout the winter before that there were many personal bests achieved.First up was the km, won by Mourne man Andrew Annett in : in a sprint finish with Annadalersquos Eskander Turki . Three weeks ago, David McNeilly, who now graces the ranks of the M category, ran a k PB of :and came home in : for a PB of  seconds dating back over seven years.Next clubman home was Niall Goodman in :, just three seconds outside the time he set at Eikon, he was slightly disappointed but the run consolidates the improvement he has made this year. The ever-improving Francis Tumelty is now in the M category and after just missing out on his K PB three weeks ago with a : clocking in Eikon, he smashed his : from the Bay Road k in  with a : PB here at Down Royal.Fteen year old Tom Crudgington doesnrsquot much like running on the flat mdash instead he loves the hills and mountains. However, hersquos learning that he needs to improve his running on the flat to take it into the mountains and here he set a PB by around a minute with his : time. Phil Murdock broke the -minute barrier for the first time clocking :.Mark Holland has shown steady improvement in training and is another who is getting faster as he gets older, now in the M category. With a previous best of around  and a half minutes, he smashed that with a brilliant : clocking, a fine product for all the work he has done.Nichola Watson has had injury troubles, but over the past couple of months has been training consistently again. Wondering beforehandshe would be strong enough to dip under  minutes, she put any doubt to rest with a brilliantly paced race to record a letime best of :.Also ing to racing, this time less than six months after giving birth to baby Roacutenaacuten, Ashlene Mussen surprised herself in recording a very strong :.Next up was the half-marathon and as ever a glutton for real punishment, Thomas OrsquoGorman toed the line on the back of his :: PB at Eikon three weeks ago. With conditions a bit harder here, he had to settle for :: and a th place.The final race of the day was the k where Lisburn ACrsquos Chris Madden won in an excellent :.Three weeks ago, Aidy Brown was gutted to run  seconds outside  minutes and  seconds outside his best and he vowed totoday and put the record straight. He ran brilliantly to record a big PB of . and dip under the -minute barrier for the first time.James King has been a revelation over the past year and after a wee hiatus during the first half of lockdown has put in a very consistent block of training. He was rewarded with a big PB on Saturday of . and also demonstrated he has learned the art of how to run a quick time ndash . for the first k and a swter . for the second half.At Eikon three weeks earlier, Frank Cunningham had run a PB of . and today came back and blew that out of the water to record . and a PB by  seconds.

It will also include new lighting, railings, trees and hedgerows and all associated site works. The council report states the plan is for a ldquopocket park of temporary use for three years.The council report states: ldquoThe proposed development will have a positive impact on the amenity and character of the area and there will not be any detrimental impact on bioersity within the space. The proposed works will improve the attractiveness and vitality of this area.The site is located on the corner of Ravenhill Road and East Bridge Street on an area of land measuring  square metres. The land slopes from east to west from Ravenhill Road down to the River Lagan.It has been associated with antisocial behaviour due to its obstruction from public view by vegetation and the toilet block. The surrounding area is mainly commercial in nature and located at a major road intersection within the city.In  the council gave permission at the site for a mixed use development forming the headquarters for a charitable organisation with offices, conference and exhibition space and training rooms. The plan did not come to fruition.Stormont bodies the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, the Historical Environment Division, Department For Infrastructure Roads, and the Rivers Agency, were consulted in relation to the proposal and offered no objections subject to conditions.Belfast City Councilrsquos Environmental Health, Trees and Landscapes team, as well as the Regeneration and Development Team, all showed no objections.A letter was received by the council in November  from the owner of a neighbouring property and raised concerns that the removal of the public toilets will result in the site being more easily accessible and their building will be at greater risk from graffiti.The owner requested the proposed scheme could include a screen or fence in the area of the proposed hedge adjacent to his premises which would make the exposed wall of the building more dficult to access.The council responded to this representation stating that ldquothe adjacent property provides a natural surveillance of the site. The gable end of the buildinghellip provides an attractive back-drop to the proposed public area, therefore to forty this boundary with mesh screen fencing would detract from the aesthetic and result in the loss of natural surveillance.The scheme was amended to include a row of dense deterrent type planting along the boundary with the property. The plant species has been revised to Berberis Darwinian, a thorny plant which will restrict access to the wall."},{"url":null,"title":"bridge scotland great idea terrible proposal ","story":"Body recovered in search for missing man | deepest sympathies expressed to family | PSNI launch search for Keith Carlisle last weekCriticism for PSNI after ‘boy racer’ action blocks north coast townNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensCoronavirusFarmingNewsOpinionA bridge to Scotland is a great idea but a terrible proposalRecent contributions to this paper suggest there is still support for the idea of a bridge from Larne to Galloway.By Carl McCleanTuesday, st September , : pmUpdated Tuesday, st September , : pm\"\"Prime Minister Boris Johnson visits Northern Ireland Ambulance Service in south Belfast in August. His ‘seamless’ NI-GB trade pledged has been shown to be nonsense, writes Carl McClean. Photo by Kelvin Boyes   Press EyeSee links belowIndeed, the prime minister appears to be preparing a feasibility study on it.Even among bridge enthusiasts the engineering problems are well accepted.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...During his visit to Northern Ireland last month, Michael Gove announced £m in funding to deal with trade barriers, thus confirming the border. \"Any unionist talking about a bridge across the Irish Sea down which a border will be drawn is not serious,\" writes Carl McClean. Photo Kelvin Boyes  Press EyeThe financial costs, not so much, perhaps taking from a prevalent view in Northern Ireland politics that London is there to pay for things . After all, the government will have borrowed an extra £ billion this year to deal with Covid — what’s £ billion more  The opportunity cost of the bridge — what we won’t build because we’re spending time and treasure on a bridge, over a dozen more urgent things — is barely considered. So whether our interest is NI’s future economic wellbeing, or safeguarding the Union, or both, any proposal for a sea bridge that doesn’t even consider the costs against the benefits is totally unserious. Carl McClean is an Ulster Unionist councillor for North Down and ArdsThe context is crucial. If I am asked about a bridge in the abstract, I might think ‘sure why not ’ But this not an abstract proposal. Here is the economic context: after over two years of unionist ‘unprecedented influence’ in London, an Irish Sea border is being established which splits Northern Ireland off from the rest of the United Kingdom for customs purposes. This locks Northern Ireland into the European Union for customs purposes. Worse, as the UK erges away from EU law, Great Britain will erge from Northern Ireland. We will take orders from the EU on manufacturing and agriculture rules. There is no plan for what will happen to Northern Ireland consumers wanting to buy goods from Great Britain. GB businesses may withdraw from the NI market. The prime minister promised ‘seamless trade’ between NI and GB, but that was shown to be a nonsense when Michael Gove offered £ million to help businesses deal with the GB-NI trade admin that’s coming.All this, with the global economy heading into a worsening recession. Then there is the political context.Hell was raised by nationalists, the European Commission, and those who never accepted the referendum result, to ensure the new and necessary EU-UK customs border was not allowed at the Northern Ireland Republic of Ireland land border. This led to the suggestion of the Irish Sea border. The prime minister has suggested we can change this at Stormont but will clearly have been advised that’s unlikely to happen. While the rest of the UK gets on with Brexit, and with Europe finally resigned to it, the battle will rage on at Stormont, with nationalism and likely the Alliance party fighting to keep us effectively part of the EU. This is a dangerous situation for unionism. Apart from the immediate response to Covid, our representatives must devote their energies to mitigating the damage of the incoming sea border — not talk up a bridge to distract from what happened on their watch.They need to accept their responsibility for the Theresa May negotiations, when they were entirely mercenary, and the subsequent resentment it caused in the Tory party. This led to the sea border. Then there is the larger challenge — making the case for the Union in our centenary year and beyond. This involves repairing relationships with a Tory government that had been sympathetic. It involves selling the Union not just to our core vote, but to everyone in the Province, and across the UK. For now, at least, the DUP are the sole voice for unionism at Westminster. They can continue with the Ulster nationalism act, seeking to rinse London every time there’s cash to be had, and continue to act shocked and betrayed when that comes back to bite them. Or, they can drop the Millwall FC brand of Unionismand start putting heads together with unionists all over the UK to make a head-and-heart case for the Union.Those wishing to break up the UK now have the tools and motivation to do it. Our opponents are certainly doing their own thinking. The SNP are running rampant in Scotland and polls favour separation. Nationalism is with increasing confidence talking up ideas of a ‘New Ireland’. The Taoiseach confirmed his government’s new Shared Island Unit will plan for possibilities like Britain becoming “turned off” Northern Ireland altogether.Consider that last fact and consider whether in the last decade it even occurred to most of our loud and incurious MPs what the rest of Britain thought of us. A Boris bridge is a shiny gt given in apology for a sea border. This bridge, which would span that very sea border, is a distraction and we should not indulge it. In the crisis into which we are heading, any unionist politician still touting a bridge to Scotland disqualies themselves as a serious or capable advocate for our United Kingdom and Northern Ireland’s place in it.• Carl McClean in an Ulster Unionist Party councillor for Ards and North Down• Ben Lowry: ‘The Boris bridge to Scotland plan is a nice dream but a distant one and a distraction from other priorities for unionism and infrastructure’• Robert Park: ‘A bridge to Scotland is not just a unionist umbilical project, but a strategic bridge to Europe and to the world’• Shane Greer: ‘Let’s dispense with lazy criticism of the bridge to Scotland idea and back a proper feasibility study’• John Barstow: ‘A fixed link will boost the ports of Belfast and Larne’——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

It’s legal by just . metres,the elevation was two metres more it would be illegal. “It’s very flat, it’s very fast andwe get a westerly wind the last six miles will have the wind behind it. Having a fast course is of paramount importance in attracting any international runner. “In my time in the sport it would look to be the greatest ever domestic field for a half marathon in Britain or Ireland. I would include the Great North Run in that.“There’s  Olympians in the race. It’s great to get one or two of these runners but when you start to go through lists of  people it’s going to be something special.”He advised spectators not to line the route of the -mile race where all athletes would be following Covid guidelines: “We’re streaming it live so that people can watch this event safely from the comfort of their own home.”\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusGetting outFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

a cheatit had been suitable.ldquoBack in  there were a few areas in Barry which were beginning to look a little tired, but it also came with a timeless charm that provided us with the perfect texture and feel that Dave and I had discussed.ldquoAdded to this was the welcome we were given by residents and, in particular, the support of the local council.ldquoPorthcawl was also a serious candidate for the backdrop to this show, but having scouted tirelessly the whole of Barry and Barry Island, I knew that this ticked every box.Mr Evans said Trinity Street was an instant favourite.ldquoI knew Gwenrsquos house was here, he said. ldquoThe terraced houses on a steep hill and its far-reaching views over to Barry Island and docks meant that no matter which direction the camera was pointing, there would be interesting textures and views.ldquoThe next objective was to get inside as many houses as possible to seeany worked for us as Gwenrsquos house.ldquoI letter dropped about  houses to gauge the interest.ldquoIrsquod heard that Matt Lucas was going to be involved so I used his name get to my foot in the door.ldquoThis usually helps.ldquoIn those days very few had heard of James Corden.ldquoI viewed and took pictures of about five houses on that street and Glendarsquos who was one of the first to contact me.ldquoThe decor and character of Glendarsquos house fitted my brief perfectly, but my first thought was that house was a little on the small side.ldquoTo get a film crew and the actors to work in such a tight space would be quite a challenge, butI could convince our director and designer that it could be achieved Gwenrsquos house was found.ldquoI took Dave and Christine along to Trinity Street and both fell in love with the location within minutes.Mr Evans continued: ldquoGlenda was so accommodating.ldquoI remember very well discussing with her the details of how filming on location works, how disruptive the whole process can be and also the location fee.ldquoWhat I do remember was her reaction when I mentioned the amount.ldquoGlendarsquos reply was: ldquoIrsquom so sorry Clive, but I donrsquot think I can cover that.ldquoGlenda thought that she needed to pay for the privilege of having us there and not the other way round.ldquoShe is a lovely lady and still loves being a part of the Gavin  Stacey world.During the locationsrsquo breakdown meeting, we discussed how Pam and Mickrsquos house might look in Billericay so homes were viewed in and around Llandaff and Sully until Dinas Powys was selected thanks to the welcome that was received.ldquoSt Cattwgrsquos Church at Llanmaes was not the first-choice wedding venue for Gavin and Stacey, Mr Evans said. ldquoThey were due to be married at St Nicholas Church at the village of St Nicholas, but a last-minute change of heart by the Church in Wales meant that we needed to find an alternative at the th hour.ldquoA friend and another locations manager called Chris Hill pulled in a favour and we were able to use St Cattwgrsquos.ldquoI dont recall any candidates other than Island Leisure .ldquoWhile filming on the front, Marco opening up early for the crew to be able to get a nice coffee as the weather was pretty unkind.ldquoWe didnt use the interior of the coffee shop as a location in series one, but as it was so cold when we filmed on the seafront the coffees were very welcome.ldquoWe also filmed at the Vale of Glamorgan Resort for the exterior of the wedding fair.ldquoThe interior was shot at the Copthorne Hotel at Culverhouse Cross.ldquoWhile at the Vale resort, the Wales rugby team came into the reception of the hotel.ldquoRuth Jones askedIrsquod be able to set up a photograph of the cast with the Welsh team.ldquoWe got them to agree so out there somewhere are pictures of the Gavin  Stacey cast with the Wales rugby team.ldquoUncle Brynrsquos house was only an exterior in series one so very little was involved in its search.ldquoQuiz night at the Colcot Arms was interesting.ldquoWe were close to completing our filming when the pub opened to the public - so the last few shots took a little while longer than wersquod planned.Mr Evans lives with his we Rhiannon and daughter Cerys Mim and runs his own Film and TV Facilities company.He added: ldquoThe actors usually donrsquot get to see the locations beforehand.ldquoThey are brought to set, run through a quick rehearsal then go for the real thing.ldquoThey then have to go through the whole thing over and over with the camera shooting from dferent angles.ldquoIt is a slow process and  hours on camera gives us around three minutes of footage.ldquoI get a real buzz from seeing locations that I have found on TV, but when it comes to Gavin  Stacey the story I always bring up is that while scouting in the very early days with the series producer in the car he askedI would consider reading for Dave.ldquoMy le could have been so dferent, but I have no regrets as no-one could have played it better than Steffan Rhodri.ldquoMy daughter Cerys Mim was born during filming and James Corden was the first to congratulate me when I ed to work on the show after her birth.ldquoHe joked about us naming her Nessa or Stacey.ldquoBarry and the Vale have always provided me with a fantastic hunting ground for film and TV locations.ldquoIts a huge contributor to South Wales becoming a hotspot for filming in the last decade or so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than half of the children with covid- reported no symptoms.However, the study found that gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting were the most common symptoms of covid- in children, ahead of cough or changes in their sense of smell or taste.The findings also showed young children under  years of age were just as likely to have evidence of prior infection as older children, and that asymptomatic children were just as likely to develop antibodies as symptomatic children.Executive director of Public Health for Cardf and Vale University Health Board, Fiona Kinghorn said: ldquoCovid- remains a relatively new virus to us, and it is important that through valuable research studies such as this we continue to increase our understanding of it.ldquoI would like to thank my research colleagues here at Cardf and Vale UHB for their excellent contribution to this study, and congratulate everybody involved for their role in these important findings as this research continues to monitor community transmission of the virus in children.Paediatric research nurse specialist, Zoe Morrison added: ldquoThanks to this study we now better understand the prevalence of covid- in children after the first wave of the pandemic, and know that while the majority of children with Covid- will display no symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting could be a sign that they are infected with the disease, and must now consider the value of refining the testing criteria for children to include these symptoms.ldquoThe interest in participating in this clinical trial has been unprecedented and we would like to extend our thanks to all the children and their parents who have volunteered to take part in this study, helping us gain important insight into how this virus behaves among children.CYARU were able to input into the study thanks to funding for research equipment from the Noahrsquos Ark charity.The team will also be using samples collected during the study to test the efficacy of new antibody tests that are developed, as well as monitoring the longer term behaviour of the antibodies to understand whether they reduce in numbers orchildren can lose them over time. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Over the past number of months the Minister has made available the Belfast, Craigavon and Newtownards test centres to be used as Covid- testing centres.“The grounds of the Craigavon Test Centre are currently being used by the Department of Health to conduct COVID- testing. As a result, while it is possible to conduct vehicle testing in the test centre, the DVA cannot safely conduct driving tests from the test centre at this time.“The Minister has asked officials to urgently work with driving instructors, examiners and the Department of Health to find an accommodation locally that will allow the resumption of driving tests in Craigavon and local covid testing. The Department understands that the centre will no longer be needed by the Department of Health from mid-October.”The ADIs said local driving schools were ‘reeling’ from the economic impact of COVID-’ and any decision that the driving test centre remain closed to them ‘would worsen this’.https:www.portadowntimes news people covid--outbreaks-sports-clubs-gyms-businesses-and-school-A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Over my years as principal, we have had great support from the club and some of our past pupils have gone on to represent their county.For me, the notable achievement has been to see the way in which past pupils have progressed in a iety of chosen careers and been successful in so many walks of le.Another achievement is the way in which the staff both past and present have worked together as a team to have accomplished so many things over the past  years, not least to have been awarded Outstanding in our last inspection report.The development of the St. Cairealls Community Playschool on the school site has also brought me great joy over the past ten years to see it now as a successful pre-school provider with DENI status and funding for our local children.Having spent so many years of my le in St Cairealls P.S., it has become a second home and the staff and pupils a second family. Retiring for me brings mixed emotions. However , I am looking forward to having more time to spend with my family, my husband Kevin, our daughters Emer, Niamh and Fionnuala and their partners. Also our son Michael and his partner and my two precious grandsons Micheal and Braidan. Mrs McHugh concluded: I want to offer good wishes to the future of this very special school – St. Cairealls Primary School, Aghyaran and success and happiness to my successor, Mrs Michelle Ellis.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cdbcaadccaba   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fecfaebabfcedf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1598431969897.jpg--post_primary_pupils_now_to_wear_face_coverings_in_corridors.jpg?159843197000","title":"post primary pupils now to wear face coverings in corridors ","story":"Education Minister Peter Weir has announced that guidance on face coverings will be updated to include wearing them in corridors of post-primary schools. This will come into effect on  August when schoolson a full-time basis. The Minister said: “My key priority is that pupilsto school on a full-time basis, as soon as it is safe to do so. “Following further advice which I have received today from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientic Adviser, I am recommending that pupils and teachers wear a face covering in corridors and other communal areas of post-primary schools from next week when schoolsfull-time. This updates the existing guidance on the use of face coverings in educational settings. “The current public health advice is that the use of face coverings provides some benefits, however, it is not a replacement for frequent hand washing, social distancing where possible, covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and regular cleaning of surfaces. It is also important to remember that evidence suggests that the risk of transmission in schools is relatively low compared to some other settings. “My existing guidance on the reopening of schools already deals with the use of face coverings. In terms of school transport, the advice remains the same, that we strongly recommend that all pupils wear a face covering on all dedicated school transport including buses and taxis where it is appropriate for them to do so. “In relation to communal areas in schools, the guidance already strongly encourages face coverings for activities that entail large numbers of staff or pupils within an enclosed space where social distancing is not possible. “Given the risk mitigations in place in schools to limit and contain the spread of Covid-, face coverings are not recommended as being compulsory for routine use in education settings. However, staff and pupils may wish to use them during the routine school day and this is acceptable. Schools should also be aware that some personsare exempt from wearing face coverings. “I will continue to keep all guidance in respect of education settings under review in light of the latest medical and scientic advice. Peter Weir said: “The first step in keeping our schools safe is that anyone with symptoms should not attend school.
