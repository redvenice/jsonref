At 1930 the fliers adjourned either to officers\u0027 or sergeants\u0027 messes for the usual pre-flight meal.Security had billed that evening\u0027s activity as merely another round of training, but those with eyes to see noticed that bacon and eggs were being served, luxuries in wartime Britain which were readily accessible only to men not unlikely to be dead before morning in their country\u0027s service. At 2000, ninety minutes before the first take-offs, they drifted towards the crew rooms to strip themselves of personal possessions, don flying kit, collect parachutes, flight bags and flying rations –— chocolate, sandwiches, fruit juice, an orange, chewing gum — and escape equipment, consisting of Dutch and German currency, miniature compass and silk maps.Then they lay on the grass chatting, smoking, in the beauty of a fine summer\u0027s evening. Men solemnly shook the hands of friends and said goodbye.Gibson later described his own sensations at such moments, when almost every flier\u0027s anticipation was at its most acute: \u0027Your stomach feels as though it wants to hit your backbone. You can\u0027t stand still. You laugh at small jokes, loudly, stupidly. You smoke far too many cigarettes, usually only half-way through, then throw them away. Sometimes you feel sick and want to go to the lavatory.\u0027The smallest incidents annoy you and you flare up on the slightest provocation . . . All this because you\u0027re frightened, scared stiff.\u0027He had learned how to conquer it, however, and sometimes showed himself harshly unforgiving towards others who were less fortunate.For all the breezy confidence that most men exuded when among a crowd, Flt Sgt Bill Townsend, a veteran of 26 operations, was convinced that they were all \u0027for the chop\u0027.John Hopgood told Dave Shannon: \u0027I don\u0027t think I\u0027m coming back.\u0027Lewis Burpee, whose wife was expecting their first baby, shook the hand of fellow-Canadian Ken Brown, saying \u0027Goodbye Ken\u0027 with undisguised finality. \u0027One rear-gunner spoke confidently about the occupants of other aircraft who shared their bus to the dispersals: \u0027You know those two crews aren\u0027t coming back, don\u0027t you?\u0027Thirty minutes later, Gibson gave the word: time to go. Buses and trucks bore the airmen to their planes, and they clambered aboard. At 2100 a red light soared from the Very flare pistol of Gibson\u0027s Lancaster, G-George, to signal them to start engines.An airman on the ground gave a thumbs-up, signalling that the wooden wheel stops had been dragged clear, followed by a hiss of air as brakes were released.One by one the big aircraft began to bump across the field.The Reserve Wave crews watched almost in disbelief as the first planes lifted off \u0027with this enormous thing, almost like a garden roller, hanging underneath\u0027.For me, the so-called Dambusters represent an emotional journey from my own childhood, from the day at boarding school when I first thrilled to Richard Todd\u0027s portrayal of Gibson in the most popular British war film of all time, with its stirring march composed by Eric Coates.Both the 1955 film and the book which preceded it made a profound impression on me. I memorised the names of 617\u0027s pilots assembled and painted plastic models of the Avro Lancasters they flew became intimately familiar with Enemy Coast Ahead, Gibson\u0027s posthumously published memoir.I perceived - as did millions of other Britons - a nobility about the bravery displayed that night as these young men, almost all of an age with modern gap-year adolescents, or students at university, lifted their big, clumsy bombers into the air, barely four decades after the Wright brothers initiated heavier-than-air flight, and embarked in cold blood on a mission that would require exceptional courage, skill and luck to succeed, and which many recognised was likely to kill them.For two and a half hours they raced through the moonlit sky towards Germany, at a height that made power cables as deadly a menace as anti-aircraft fire.They then attacked Hitler\u0027s dams, flying straight and level at 220mph, much lower than the treetops and less than a cricket pitch length from the lakes below, to unleash those revolutionary weapons created by the brilliance and persistence of Barnes Wallis. Half of 617\u0027s aircraft which got as far as Germany failed to return, but two of the biggest man-made structures in the world collapsed into mud and rubble.The fliers contrived a feat that caused all the world to wonder — the Allied nations with pride, the German people and their leaders with horror and apprehension.But I now blush to remember how I embraced The Dam Busters with special enthusiasm because the raid seemed victimless, save for the 53 dead among the gallant young men who carried it out.In truth, however, as we will see in more detail later, something approaching 1,400 civilians perished, more than half of them foreign female slaves of Hitler.         The crew of 617 squadron\u0027s G for George board the Lancaster bomber (left to right): Trevor-Roper, Pulford, Deering, Spafford, Hutchison, Guy Gibson, TaerumAlongside our continuing awe for the fliers who breached the dams, the enormity of the horror that they unthinkingly unleashed upon a host of innocents has to be confronted.There was never an easy route from Lincolnshire to the Möhne. Gibson\u0027s aircraft were obliged to brush the Ruhr, the most heavily defended region of Nazi Germany, in order to reach its water supplies in the rural Sauerland beyond.The received wisdom of bombing operations was that height conferred improved prospects of survival, yet for this one mission, the squadron was flying all the way to the target below the threshold at which German radar would pick them up and send in the night-fighters to slaughter them.This, though, put them at the mercy of anti-aircraft guns, which were clustered in belts between the Dutch coast and the dams.Gibson\u0027s three lead aircraft - G-George, P-Popsie and M-Mother - approached Holland but the ground defences, surprised, stayed mute at first as they swept overhead, navigating by map, compass and landmarks: a windmill here, a communications mast there.Fleeting glimpses of houses, factories, railway lines were punctuated at intervals by an intercom yell of \u0027Pull up!\u0027 from the nose, signalling a power line in front. They were flying so low that M-Mother - piloted by \u0027Hoppy\u0027 Hopgood, a 21-year-old who still began his letters home \u0027Dear Mummy\u0027 - passed beneath one set of power lines.They spotted the Wilhelmina Canal, and followed it eastwards until they turned north-east and passed over the German frontier.The flight to the dams was a remarkable affair in its own right, demanding the highest skill, courage and luck, even before the Lancasters launched their attacks.Already for five crews, fate had run against them and they had either crashed (one into a power line) or returned home.The strain for the remaining 14 was immense, dodging flak, becoming briefly lost, flying 30 tons of metal, Perspex, fuel, armament and human flesh as if the Lancasters were stunt planes.But they surged onwards, fields and villages flashing beneath them, until the Rhine came into view and they knew that the industrial conglomeration of the Ruhr lay beyond. The sky erupted as searchlights and light flak raked the darkness around them.Identifying their last turning point just 19 miles from the Möhne, they swung south-east for the last - mercifully uneventful - six minutes of the flight.Just after midnight, Micky Martin in P-Popsie was first to glimpse the Möhne dam, followed seconds later by Gibson, to whom it looked \u0027squat and heavy and unconquerable\u0027.He was relieved to see no sign of searchlights, from which the dazzle could have been fatal to attackers making low-level bomb runs.Instead, there were only angry stabs of light flak, green, yellow and red, streaking up from six German gun positions, the gunners puzzled by the appearance of enemy aircraft.Surely they weren\u0027t hoping to breach the vast Möhne? \u0027Bit aggressive, aren\u0027t they?\u0027 muttered one of Gibson\u0027s crew.Over the VHF radio link, Gibson ordered Hopgood and Martin to orbit the valley while he examined the approach to the dam. Then he joined them as they circled overhead, with three more Lancasters that had just arrived.Of the three target dams, the Möhne offered by far the most open approach, but to fly a heavy bomber head-on towards the guns on the dam walls nonetheless represented an immensely daunting challenge.Gibson told his crew, \u0027Well, boys, I suppose we\u0027d better start the ball rolling.\u0027 Since much about Bomber Command\u0027s fliers echoed the mood of students attempting some supreme athletic challenge, it does not seem frivolous to compare Gibson\u0027s predicament with that of a cricket captain.Under the eyes of his team, he was opening the bowling. It would betray everything that he represented if he let them down, muffed the moment, made a hash of his run.                A wartime photograph showing the damage inflicted by the \u0027Dambusters\u0027 raid on the Eder dam. The RAF\u0027s 617 Squadron used bouncing bombs to breach two dams within Germany during a night attack in May 1943The hydraulic motors were started on the bombs to spin them at the required speed of 500rpm. Gibson announced: \u0027I am going to attack. Stand by to come in to attack in your order when I tell you.\u0027 Then he ed G-George towards the lake, the airframe vibrating as the four-and-a-half ton cylinder packed with explosive spun beneath the bomb bay.As G-George lost height the crew could clearly see everything under the brilliant moonlight — the dam wall, twin towers, sluices. One called from the nose: \u0027Good show. This is wizard\u0027, before suffering a moment\u0027s panic about the proximity of fir trees a few feet beneath him.Then came the vital 45 seconds as they raced at 230mph above the surface of the lake.The navigator switched on the spotlights, saying \u0027Down — down — down\u0027, then \u0027Steady — steady.\u0027 Incoming tracer from the dam wall whipped past and each man braced for a brutal collision between German shells and the thin alloy of the Lancaster.At the wheel, Gibson felt almost overwhelmed by the vastness of the dam looming, his Lancaster suddenly so small.\u0027Left — little more left,\u0027 called out the navigator. \u0027Steady steady — steady — coming up.\u0027 Then: \u0027Mine\u0027s gone!\u0027 The first of Barnes Wallis\u0027s \u0027bouncing bombs\u0027 was on its way.G-George surged sharply upwards with the loss of weight, then Gibson heaved back on the yoke and climbed away.A voice over the radio called from another aircraft: \u0027Good show, leader. Nice work.\u0027 But it wasn\u0027t. The bomb bounced once . . . twice . . . three times — then vanished beneath the surface.A huge explosion sent a column of water shooting high into the night sky and the lake surface boiled, yet as minutes passed and the lake calmed, the dam still stood.Disappointment was crushing for Gibson. The evidence suggests that his bomb was dropped early, causing it to sink before striking the dam wall. After his extraordinary exertions, not least to overcome exhaustion, his personal effort had failed. But it now became his task to rally and support the other attacking crews.Hopgood was next in M-Mother but his attack went disastrously awry. Cannon shells thrashed the aircraft and it erupted into flames.The dropped bomb sprang over the top of the dam as the burning Lancaster struggled to gain height and hurtled 200ft downwards, to explode on the power station below.Hopgood somehow cleared the forested ridge behind the dam but then ordered his crew: \u0027For Christ\u0027s sake, get out of here!\u0027In those terrible seconds aboard the blazing M-Mother, three were able to escape before it ploughed into the ground and dissolved into flames, killing the four men still aboard.\u0027Poor old Hoppy,\u0027 said an unidentified voice among the crews still circling the target, stunned by the horror of the spectacle they had witnessed.It was now Mickey Martin\u0027s turn in P-Popsie. \u0027Come in number three, you can go in now,\u0027 called Gibson, who had decided to fly alongside P-Popsie as he approached, to ert German fire.He would invite his own destruction, the fate that had just befallen John Hopgood and his men, to improve another crew\u0027s chance of success.Gibson had been an exhausted man even before he took off. Only iron strength of will could be keeping him airborne.The ruse didn\u0027t work. As the two Lancasters roared up the lake, P-Popsie was hit in the starboard wing, jolting the aircraft just as its bomb fell away, bounced across the water and exploded a critical 50 yards off the central aiming point.As Martin banked away, his rear-gunner saw a gigantic waterspout as the bomb exploded — and left the dam standing. The three outstanding fliers of 617 Squadron had now failed in attempts to breach the Möhne.From the pack circling overhead, Melvin Young — nicknamed \u0027Dinghy\u0027 because he\u0027d twice been shot down over the sea and survived —in A-Apple was called in next.P-Popsie took station on his port wing, matching his approach as A-Apple flew in low, low, lower, up the lake. Then their load was gone, skipping over the water while the two bombers banked and climbed steeply away.The bomb bounced three times, struck the dam wall and vanished. The positioning was perfect.Three seconds later, 6,600lb of Torpex exploded, inflicting upon the Möhne a pulverising earthquake shock.As a new column of water soared upwards, Young cried exultantly over the VHF: \u0027I think I\u0027ve done it!\u0027 Yet as the lake calmed, still the wall appeared unbroken.So at 0049, it was the turn of J-Johnny, piloted by David Maltby, who had celebrated his 23rd birthday a week earlier and had a wife back in Lincolnshire expecting a baby any day.He made a perfect run, dropped his bomb and even as his aircraft crossed the dam wall, he saw its crown already crumbling.Water soared into the sky, this time accompanied by mud and fragments of masonry, then gently fell back to reveal a colossal breach opening in the midst of the dam. Gibson banked towards the wall and saw the lake surface looking \u0027like stirred porridge . . . gushing out and rolling into the Ruhr Valley towards the industrial centres of Germany\u0027s Third Reich\u0027.There was a thrilled yell over the VHF: \u0027It\u0027s gone! It\u0027s gone!\u0027 The desperation that had overtaken the fliers, the sense of humiliating failure, was replaced by exhilaration, wonder, relief, triumph.In every watching cockpit there were cheers and roars across the intercoms as these very young men succumbed to a schoolboy joy. \u0027I can hardly describe the atmosphere in the plane,\u0027 said Maltby. \u0027The yelling, the pure excitement.\u0027There has since been debate about whose bomb breached the dam. It seems almost certain that Young\u0027s had achieved a decisive fracture, which became apparent even as Maltby\u0027s exploded.Now Gibson watched the tidal wave sweeping down the valley, the clouds of spray that became a fog, the irresistible weight of water racing through the breach in the dam.\u0027Down in the foggy valley we saw cars speeding along the roads in front of the great wave of water which was chasing them and going faster than they could ever hope to. \u0027I saw their headlights burning and . . . water overtake them, then the colour of the headlights underneath the water changing from light blue to green, from green to dark purple, until there was no longer anything except the water, bouncing down in great waves.\u0027The codeword indicating success was received at operations HQ back in England at 0056. There, Barnes Wallis had been burying his head in his hands at the earlier news of casualties and of failure.The young men, the fliers, were doing their parts with wondrous courage. The old ones, like him, who had sent them, appeared to have got it wretchedly, tragically wrong. And now despair was replaced by success. He jumped up, pumping his arms like a triumphant athlete. Every face in the operations room broke into beams of relief and congratulation.Back at the Möhne, Gibson ordered home those Lancasters whose bombs had gone, while he turned towards the Eder dam, 45 miles away, to mastermind the next phase of Operation Chastise.He stood off in G-George issuing instructions as, one by one, four Lancasters took a tilt at what was an even more terrifying objective than the Mohne. Surrounded by wooded hills, attacking it required a sudden dog-leg turn at the last minute, release of the bomb and then an instantaneous violent climbing turn, to gain height over the towering dam.The first dozen passes were unsuccessful, the Lancasters failing to drop their bombs or missing the target. One exploded in mid-flight and was lost. The last hope now rested on N-Nuts, piloted by Les Knight.On his second attempt, the bomb-aimer made a perfect drop at 240mph, 450 yards from the dam. The bomb bounced three times, hit the wall, sank and exploded. For a moment the dam remained intact but then, as one of the crew reported, \u0027as if some huge fist had been jabbed at the wall, a large, almost round black hole appeared and water gushed as if from a large hose.\u0027\u0027We could see the water gushing out,\u0027 said N-Nuts\u0027s navigator Sid Hobday, \u0027and all the masonry coming down. It really was fantastic, a sight I shall never forget.\u0027A similar attack on the third target, the Sorpe dam, was made by a sole Lancaster — all that remained of the five-plane third wave — but failed to breach it. A second plane later had a go but with the same result.However, the main aim of the mission had been achieved. Gibson called up his crews and told them: \u0027Good show, boys. Now let\u0027s all go home and get pie,\u0027 —though the last word may in truth have been more vulgar.And so they headed back to Scampton, the first arriving at 0319, the last at 0615, many of the Lancasters holed and limping. Eight out of the 19 did not return at all. Fifty-six of the 133 men who had set out on Operation Chastise were dead.Barnes Wallis lingered in the debriefing room, devastated by 617 Squadron\u0027s losses, a price for the fulfilment of his vision such as he had naïvely never contemplated.Those who made it, however, were ecstatic. \u0027Absolutely marvellous,\u0027 was the verdict of one pilot. \u0027Water, water everywhere — wonderful, wonderful. A terrific show.\u0027A few of the exhausted young men went to bed, but many partied for hours, with beer and whisky freely available in the officers\u0027 mess. Some Waafs were dragged from their beds to join a conga. Around the piano, remembered one airman, \u0027stubble-chinned, bleary-eyed aircrew types croaked out dirty songs about the Germans\u0027 before collapsing into unconsciousness.Their spirits revived after sleep and the grant of seven days\u0027 leave. They were young, and thrilled by the blaze of publicity and indeed adulation that descended upon them. \u0027We were treated like bloody gods,\u0027 said wireless operator George Chalmers in wonder.BUT what Gibson and his men had achieved would come to trouble the \u0027WingCo\u0027. In his memoirs, he wrote: \u0027We destroyed a legitimate industrial objective so as to hinder the Ruhr Valley output of war munitions.\u0027The fact that people were in the way was incidental.\u0027The fact that they might drown had not occurred to us. Nobody likes mass slaughter, and we did not like being the authors of it. It brought us in line with Himmler and his boys.\u0027It was — and still is — a fair point, and one often overlooked.In 1948 a Norwegian Resistance hero, Knut Lier-Hansen, wrote words that linger in my mind whenever I compose narratives of conflict: \u0027Though wars can bring adventures which stir the heart, the true nature of war is composed of innumerable personal tragedies, of grief, waste and sacrifice, wholly evil and not redeemed by glory.\u0027In tomorrow\u0027s extract, I shall consider whether the extraordinary tale of Operation Chastise —its impact upon World War II set against its human consequences — is redeemed by glory.Extracted from Chastise: The Dambusters Story 1943 by Max Hastings, to be published by William Collins on September 5 at £25. © Max Hastings 2019.

With a curt nod or a swift hand gesture, the price was settled, tallies thrown down to indicate the fish’s new owner, and the group moved on. It took less than 10 minutes to dispose of the night’s catch.Most of the fish would be heading south, to England or mainland Europe. The Scots are not big cod eaters, preferring haddock with their chips. This dates, apparently, from pre-refrigeration days: haddock is a fish best eaten really fresh, whereas cod is tastiest a couple of days after being caught.Independent auditors are reviewing the Ices report, and by late September they will announce whether the fisheries can retain their Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certificates of sustainability – issued only two years ago – or whether those certificates will be suspended. Depending on the decision, North Sea cod could soon be off the menu.At Peterhead, Europe’s largest white-fish port, the cod haul was small, perhaps half the amount of the previous night, causing a buyers’ scramble. “It fluctuates,” said an official, shrugging his shoulders.Stuart Cowie, who has been in the industry for 20 years, said everyone was worried about the Ices advice. “There are too many merchants and too few fish.”But Will Clark was more sanguine. The managing director of Wilsea had bought 37 boxes of cod that morning, he declared after consulting a small black notebook. The fish would be heading down “the spine of England” – the Midlands and London, which were “strong cod-eating areas” – and across the Channel.“The fish will be with my customers by 1am or 2am, and in the shops by 7am or 8am tomorrow. People will be eating it anywhere in Europe by tomorrow lunchtime.” North Sea cod, he said, was “well managed. All stocks go up and down. It’s a concern, but we’ve been here before.”And indeed we have. North Sea cod stocks were once plentiful but plummeted – and came perilously close to collapse – between the early 1970s and 2006. A “cod recovery plan” sought to restore stocks to sustainable levels by limiting fishing days, decommissioning boats, banning catches in nursery areas and putting larger holes in nets to allow young cod to escape.In what was seen as a significant achievement, the stock rose fourfold between 2006 and 2017, when the MSC – on whose guidance big retailers and many consumers rely – awarded three fisheries sustainable status. The MSC’s distinctive blue label with a white tick was a huge fillip to the industry.The UK consumes about 115,000 tonnes of cod each year. Only 15,000 tonnes comes from the North Sea, with the rest imported mainly from the fertile grounds in the Barents Sea and around Norway and Iceland. But the species is of huge symbolic importance to the UK fishing industry, which employs about 24,000 people – more than half of them working in Scotland.Ices, an international organisation of scientists from countries bordering the North Atlantic, advises governments and the industry on stock levels and the sustainable quotas that can be fished without endangering future stocks.“It is unclear what the reasons are for this further work is required to investigate climate change, biological and fisheries effects,” the report said.Environmental organisations point out that cod has been fished above its maximum sustainable yield in recent years, meaning the fish are taken from the sea faster than they can reproduce.The species is not breeding as fast as it used to, too many unwanted “juvenile” fish are caught, and the practice of “discarding” – throwing dead fish back into the sea to keep within quotas – continues despite being banned.With the end of the cod recovery plan, fishing vessels are now entering sites that have not been trawled for more than a decade, causing damage to the ecosystem, they say.“This is a fishery that was on the road to recovery, but failures to reduce fishing pressure have led to serious overfishing and a reversal of fortunes for cod,” said Samuel Stone of the Marine Conservation Society.“It’s a very harsh lesson, but this is why we need legally binding commitments to fish at sustainable levels, to effectively monitor our fisheries and to take an ecosystem approach to fisheries management. We have to properly protect our fish stocks for the benefit of our seas, coastal communities and consumers who expect sustainable seafood.”The Marine Conservation Society, WWF and ClientEarth jointly wrote to the environment secretary on the day Ices published its advice, calling on the government to take urgent steps to secure the future of North Sea cod.Ices is an advisory body with no legal authority. Its advice will be the subject of negotiations between the coastal nations bordering the North Sea to determine the “total allowable catch”, or quota, for cod next year.Brexit is a further complicating factor, of course. In the 2016 referendum campaign, the fishing industry became a symbol of the Leave campaign, which claimed it would be a clear beneficiary of its “take back control” message.The EU common fisheries policy was held up as an example of European bureaucrats dictating to the UK fishing industry what it could and could not do in the country’s coastal waters. But marine experts point out that fish do not respect national boundaries, and therefore the industry needs coordinated international management.“Species like cod are ‘shared stocks’,” said Phil Taylor of Open Seas, which works on protecting and recovering the marine ecosystem.“After we leave the EU we will have greater control of how fishing takes place at sea. But the buck will then land squarely at the feet of UK and Scottish ministers. We may have greater control, but we will also have greater responsibility and accountability.“It will be completely within the gift of our ministers – whether they take a short-term, smash and grab approach to fish stocks or manage these fisheries more fairly to protect the environment and yield the best long-term profit from the system. We require an urgent transition towards more sustainable seafood.”The latest challenge on cod stocks could be overcome by “responsible, practicable measures”, he added. “It will not be easy, and many sacrifices will have to be made along the way. But we will succeed, and when this country is no longer in the common fisheries policy we will be able to set our own more meaningful and stringent sustainability goals and ensure that it is our fishing boats that will have first call on quota.”The MSC acknowledged that the drop in cod stocks was “disappointing news” for the industry. But, said the MSC’s Erin Priddle, “it is imperative that effective measures are introduced to secure long-term sustainability of this iconic and ecologically important fishery … protecting North Sea cod for this and future generations must be a key priority for all involved”.Consumers, said the MSC, could continue to eat cod it has labelled as sustainable. If the auditors decide next month to suspend the certificates, the change would come into force towards the end of October.According to the National Federation of Fish Friers, one in five Britons make a weekly trip to the chippie. But big hikes in the price of fish in the past few years are putting the industry under pressure.“Every day shops are going up for sale. A lot are really struggling, but it’s tight for everyone,” said Andrew Crook, the federation’s president.The first fish and chip shop is believed to have been opened by Joseph Malin, a Jewish immigrant, in east London around 1860. Another businessman, John Lees, is also credited as a fish and chip pioneer, selling the dish from a wooden hut at Mossley market in Lancashire as early as 1863.It soon caught on. By the 1930s, the number of fish and chip shops across the country had reached about 35,000. In The Road to Wigan Pier, George Orwell credited the ubiquity of much-loved fish and chips as one of the factors in averting revolution.During the second world war, the government ensured that fish and chips were never rationed. Winston Churchill described the constituents of the dish as “the good companions”.Traditional takeaway fish and chips, seasoned with salt and vinegar and eaten with fingers out of newspaper wrappings, sometimes accompanied by a pickled onion, have long been superseded by polystyrene cartons, plastic forks and sachets of sauce.Now the dish is also served in miniature portions at glamorous parties, and it has a place on the menus of expensive restaurants as well as pubs and seaside cafes.Fish and chips is ingrained in the nation’s identity, said Crook.“You remember eating fish and chips with your grandparents on the seafront in Blackpool or Margate, but you don’t remember your first kebab. There’s a romance to it, and a sense of theatre, as well as being a comforting and nutritious meal.”The looming Ices decision on cod could, however, take its toll. At a cafe in Peterhead run by the Fishermen’s Mission, Kyle Wood said that if cod was deemed unsustainable, “supermarkets will take it off their shelves”. “There’ll still be fish and chips, but there’s bound to be an impact on price and availability,” he said. “It will be a big struggle for the industry.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6cff5452b5c5ad0f691e3e018e5558511c7cee5/0_341_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=946d260581587302ff6973af51f4d17d","title":"food after oil how urban farmers are preparing us for a self sufficient future","story":"Bristol is at the head of a food phenomenon that is helping residents better connect with their cities and each otherIf you travel by train into Bristol from north of the city, there is a point two miles from the centre when you can catch sight of a tiny farmyard. Nestling at the bottom of a railway embankment between houses, builders yards and a car rental depot, it has sties, snoozing Gloucester Old Spot pigs, a paddock with caramel-coloured Dexter cattle grazing and vegetable plots in which you might see the farmer and her three young children at work.It is not, as you might assume, a visitor attraction. Founded on the council-owned site of a former market garden, Purple Patch is a fully functioning four-acre smallholding that turns a profit from vegetable boxes, bagged salads and meat. Mary Conway, the 32-year-old who formerly worked for a veg-box scheme in Norwich, set it up five years ago and has become something of a local hero. Her salads – blends of unusual leaves, herbs and edible flowers – are popular in the nearby liberal enclave of St Werburghs. She lives in a converted shed on Purple Patch, with her kids and her husband, Jona, a carpenter, and finds any missing suburban comforts amply compensated for by the friendships she makes.“It’s nice having a relationship with the animals,” says Conway, walking through the yard as the pigs glance up at a train whooshing past. “Especially the cows, because they’re so emotionally intelligent. But I also love it when you sell someone a bag of salad and later they tell you they thought it was amazing. The relationships you can have with people you’re supplying food for are really great.”Conway is one of the stars of a food phenomenon that has been developing in Bristol since the early 2010s. Back in 2009, the city council and a sustainability group, Bristol Green Capital Partnership, commissioned a report on what might happen to the city if the world began to run out of oil. One of the most alarming revelations was that the food supply, utterly dependent on cheap oil and gas for growing and transportation, could be severely depleted, which in turn could lead to a breakdown of law and order. In response, the NHS commissioned a report exploring Bristol’s food system in more depth, and the council helped set up a food policy council to produce a plan based on its findings.One aim of that plan was “to promote the use of good quality land in and around Bristol for food production”. A number of support organisations – horticulturalists, conservationists and a Bristol chapter of the Incredible Edible “guerilla gardening” movement – worked with the policy council on this. At first, the focus was on straightforward ideas such as reviving allotments or encouraging container farms that used hydroponics and artificial lighting. But after a couple of years, the leaders of the initiative began to notice something else happening. More people than they had expected were contacting the organisations with ideas that combined social good and an interest in nature with growing, and these people seemed to have few problems finding volunteers to help with the schemes.In 2016, a group of residents approached Incredible Edibles to ask if it could help them plant a food and flower garden in the St James Barton roundabout. Commonly known as the Bearpit, it is a blighted, below-street-level crossroads in the city centre where various subways intersect, and problems of rough sleeping, drug use and petty crime are rife. Sara Venn, a horticulturalist who runs Incredible Edibles as well as sitting on the policy council and chairing the Bristol Food Producers network, knew this would be a serious challenge and was worried it might be vandalised, but agreed to support it with advice and her network of volunteers. They planted flowers, herbs, soft fruit and vegetables, with all the food free to anyone who wanted to pick it three years later, it continues to flourish.“Incredible Edibles has supported 90 gardens, but the Bearpit had a great impact,” says Venn. “People in the city liked it and it got international attention – I remember getting emails about it from people in Norway, Ireland and Japan. It was a pivotal moment, one that made us all think that a food-growing movement could really happen here. In fact, it could just go mad.” Three years later, the Bristol Food Producers network has 36 producers within 10 miles of the city, and several eateries, including Poco, an award-winning restaurant specialising in local ingredients. “We’re creating networks so people can access land more easily, become upskilled and find markets for their food,” says Venn. “We’re helping Bristol to become as self-sufficient as it can be, but it isn’t just about food. It’s about what we want cities to be and the part food can play in that.”Three miles north of the Bearpit, next to the M32 motorway, sits perhaps the most fully realised example of Bristol’s urban farming. Feed Bristol is a six-acre jumble of gardens, vegetable plots, polytunnels, offices and sheds, which has been run as a conservation project by the Avon Wildlife Trust since it leased the site – then a derelict former market garden – from the city council in 2012. As well as running programmes for volunteers and community groups to grow herbs, wild flowers and vegetables, Feed Bristol also operates a commercial wildflower nursery and works as an incubator hub for small food-producing businesses there are currently seven on the site, including veg-box schemes, a mushroom grower and a medicinal herb producer, employing 15 people.One wet summer morning, Matt Cracknell, the project’s madly enthusiastic manager (“Look, bird’s-foot trefoil – that flower attracts 150 pollinators!”), yomps me round to explain. The ambition, he says, is to create “not just a passive nature reserve, but also a place where plants and wildlife exist in a way that is sustainable because people are making a livelihood from the land. We try to encourage producers to take on wildlife management and help them sell into the local food market in Bristol. That means we’re using local food to help restore the natural environment.“If you want to restore the environment,” he continues, “you have to be able to pay for it somehow, even if that’s just through good land stewardship.”Cracknell says a cheery hello to a group of cagouled volunteers getting training in a covered-over area. The gardens are open to visitors and the trust’s training and volunteer growing programmes are as important as the business incubation, he says. There is a strong belief here that spending time in the natural environment benefits not only inidual wellbeing, but also the planet.One of the staff later mentions the influence of Miles Richardson, a professor of human factors and nature connectedness at the University of Derby. Richardson has recently shown that people who feel an emotional and physical connection to nature are 30 times more likely to do something to help the natural environment than those who have just read, or been taught, about it.For Cracknell’s team, that means people learning how to grow vegetables might help to save the world, or at least part of Bristol, which is a good start.“The city is using food-growing as a holistic solution,” Cracknell says, as we pause to smell a fragrant wildflower meadow abloom with ox-eye daisies and the helpful trefoil. “We’re reconnecting people with the environment, nature and local food systems. That helps restore nature, and it also helps people.”If you’re the sort of cynical urban person who finds such talk a bit Fotherington-Thomas, you might like to know that many of Bristol’s new pastoralists do have a harder, more political vision of what they’re doing. In the shelter of a large shed stuffed with boxes and tools, 33-year-old Humphrey Lloyd explains that he founded Edible Futures, his Feed-Bristol-based salad and vegetable growing business, “because I was interested in climate change and food sovereignty rather than being into gardening as a kid, or enjoying the outdoors. You might have powerful political ideals, but you have to find a way of making a living that fulfils political and ecological roles as well.“This feels practical, it earns me an income, and it contributes to a different food and political system as well,” he adds.As his sweatshirt logo gives away, he also works for the Landworkers’ Alliance, a small union-cum-campaigning group for farmers and growers who don’t feel the National Farmers’ Union is right for them. He lets people work for him only if he can pay them the minimum wage Lloyd himself will make £10,000 in 2109 from working roughly half the year on the business, supplementing that with what he earns from a part-time music career.It’s hard growing crops, he says. It’s more technical than he had imagined and requires a substantial knowledge of plant and soil science, as well as the ability to run the back end of a business. On the whole, answers to problems you encounter tend not to be Googleable. A few weeks ago he was having trouble with his peas they were yellow, which meant they were lacking in nitrogen, but why would that be when there was plenty of nitrogen in the soil? Eventually he discovered that nitrogen provided in the form of horse manure, as this was, couldn’t be accessed by the peas. He had to save them by mixing compost and manure in water, and adding the solution to the plants. How did he work it out? “I asked a mate,” he says, demonstrating the value of those networks and support organisations.Mutual support, finding ways to help each other, adapting old ways of doing things to work in a new world: these ideas crop up time and time again in these food producers’ conversations, providing ample proof that building a food system creates relationships between people. Sometimes you sense an older, countercultural spirit resurfacing in a new guise. Carol Laslett helps run Street Goat, an organisation that allows communities to work together to run a small herd of milking goats, and hires its billies out to people who need robust grazing on their land (one is currently clearing shrubs at Feed Bristol).Laslett, a veteran of the grow-your-own, self-sufficiency movement of the 1960s and 70s, has a knack of subtly adapting old ways of organising. Street Goat is a cooperative, but that decision was driven not so much by a desire to share the rewards equitably as a recognition that lots of time-starved people could have the contact with animals they craved if they found a way of pooling their scraps of free time.The quantity of food that Bristol’s farmers could produce is open to question. Certainly, they can’t hope to make the city self-sufficient. To produce all the food that one average meat-eating British adult consumes in a year, you would need about half a hectare of land – roughly three-quarters of a large football pitch. Bristol covers 11,000 hectares, so even if you could grass down the entire city, it would feed only 14,700 of the 534,000 residents. The area of publicly accessible green space would feed 1,320, and just 3,300 even if they only ate grains. Having said that, self-sufficiency in specific crops might be just about conceivable. The real output of container farms is contested, but using conservative figures of a 38m2 container farm producing a tenth of a hectare’s worth of salad leaves a year, you could meet Bristol’s lettuce needs (6.9m heads a year, using UK average consumption figures) with about 1,000 containers, which, with no space between them, would occupy only about 3.7 hectares.When looking at cities in this context, she says you start to wonder why we do things the way we do. “Why are city centres so dominated by concrete, with no community involvement? Why is nature so unwelcome in them? Our cities would be so much more vibrant if we looked at the spaces between buildings in a more meaningful way those spaces are always the last thing anyone thinks about and we could reverse that, looking at what we need and how we could achieve it by using them. Cities can’t continue to be just about economic growth. They have to be about our health and wellbeing as well.”Of course, the idea of producing food in cities isn’t new and in some ways Bristol could be said to be merely reviving a system of allotments and market gardens that has declined in the past 30 years or so. Nor is it confined to Bristol. There are initiatives in cities across the UK, many adapted to local needs. For example, Bentley Urban Farm near Doncaster has, since it was founded in 2016, worked closely with teenagers who have been excluded from schools, achieving significant improvements in behaviour. The site, Doncaster council’s former horticultural training centre, used to be permanently vandalised, but the excluded children now come to repair it.So could urban farming change the way we live in cities? Or is it destined to be a set of pleasing stories, scraps of bucolic fantasy glimpsed from train windows, or purchased now and again in the form of unusual salads? Sceptics will lean towards the last of these, but it might just be worth reflecting on the origins of our current system.In the 17th and 18th centuries, a number of British farmers such as Jethro Tull of Berkshire and Norfolk’s Charles Townshend, began experimenting with newfangled equipment and techniques such as seed drills, fertiliser use and crop rotations. These were often mocked by their peers, and some caught on while others didn’t. At the same time, successive governments were making it easy for the wealthy to enclose common land. Once you owned or farmed a lot of land, you had an interest in maximising the return from it, which gave you a motivation for trying out those new ideas and using the ones that produced more crops. And thus the form of farming we now know came about, founded on what amounted to massive government intervention, plus ideas developed on little plots of land, by people who some considered impractical if not barmy.Of course, no one knew at the time that Tull, Townshend and the government were inventing modern agriculture, and no one can know now whether some aspect of our food’s future might be being invented at Purple Patch or on an old horticultural training centre in Doncaster.If you walk north from the Bearpit along Gloucester Road, the street at the heart of Bristol’s alternative community, you come to a cafe that would sit nicely in the kind of future people such as Venn and Cracknell are hoping to build. Suncraft, all pared-back and recycled wood, is a vegan cafe run by restaurateur duo James Koch and James Smailes. It’s particularly notable for the glass tank in which 140 salad greens and microherbs are grown hydroponically for use by the chefs – a consumer-friendly example of the much-heralded climate-controlled container farming, that is also now being taken up by supermarket salad sections. Sitting in Suncraft one morning, Koch looks at the tank and says, “It’s not so much about what we harvest at the moment, it’s more that it is interesting for us to start thinking about food in this way. Our customers are also fascinated to look at it and to get into a conversation about urban farming.”It’s an interesting take on how all this might play out for customers. Tesco may be stocking an urban mix salad, using leaves from a London hydroponic farm, Waitrose may be planning to put tanks in its salad aisles, but no one’s pretending that there’s huge consumer demand for food grown in cities. Dermot O’Regan, founder of the Grow Bristol urban farming consultancy that installed and manages Suncraft’s tanks, believes urban food will be as important as an educational debate starter as it will a source of food. Having set up, and then sold, one of the country’s first container farms in Bristol in 2015, he’s sceptical about claims that that kind of small-scale production can make money he just about made money on the quick-growing microgreens, but had he wanted to grow lettuce, he would have had to charge about £20 a head. However, as an entertaining, conversation-starting feature in shops and restaurants, it could be invaluable.“It gets people to think about where their food is from,” he says. “What does natural mean when rural fields might be near roads and all the work in them is done by machinery using oil? Should we be thinking about eating more algae, seaweed and insects? Can people be persuaded to pay for more sustainable food? How can we distribute it to make it as accessible as supermarket food? It opens up all sort of issues, and that’s important. Because whatever you think about urban farming, you can’t really look at the current food system and says that it’s working, can you?”Read more about the future of cities at thecities"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbfdfbc476dd4cd6ee24cfc965492f2063452df9/0_149_3907_2345/master/3907.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21f84df63728972903bdf13ee740ac6d","title":"dutch take cycling to a new level with worlds biggest bike park","story":"In the Netherlands, where there are more bikes than people, serious money is being spent encouraging even more people to get on their bikesIn a nation with more bikes than people, finding a space to park can be a problem. The Dutch city of Utrecht is unveiling an answer at its railway station on Monday morning: the world’s largest multistorey parking area for bicycles.The concrete-and-glass structure holds three floors of gleaming double-decker racks with space for 12,500 bikes, from cargo bikes that hold a family to public transport bikes for rent.It is part of a strategy in which hundreds of millions of euros are being devoted to enhancing cycling infrastructure across the Netherlands, a nation so fervent about its two-wheelers that it is applying to add cycling to its inventory of intangible heritage.“We are striving to make it a cyclists’ paradise and there’s still much to be done,” said Stientje van Veldhoven, a junior infrastructure minister. “I’d like us to make better use of what I call this secret weapon against congestion, poor air quality in cities and climate change that is also good for your health and your wallet.”She added: “If you want to get people out of their cars and into public transport, you need to make sure using public transport is easy and comfortable. It needs to be very easy to park your bike as close to the train as possible – and you don’t want to be looking for half an hour for a space.”Demand for public transport is growing, the main four cities are predicted to expand, and the Netherlands has been struggling to meet its climate crisis commitments, so encouraging more bike use is a political priority.“In the next 10 years, 500,000 more people will come to urbanised areas, and if all of those people bring their car then we are going to have massive congestion,” said Van Veldhoven. “So investment in public transport, cycling lanes and cycle parking facilities is crucial to keep this area that’s essential for our national economy moving.”Utrecht is promoting cycling as part of a “healthy urban living” policy. “We are counting on biking as a healthy and sustainable form of transport for a growing city,” said the deputy mayor, Victor Everhardt. “Cycling is in the genes of people from Utrecht and in 1885 it built the Netherlands’ first bike lane. Every day, 125,000 cyclists go through the city centre to work, school and the station, and the world’s largest bike park sits perfectly in this global cycling city.”The scale of Dutch investments shows cycling is about more than just the issue of transportation, according to BYCS, a social enterprise behind a network of international cycle mayors. “The bike park in Utrecht shows you need massive investments into cycling infrastructure parking, cycle lanes and great architecture, but we believe this is one of the most impactful things a city can do,” said its strategy director, Adam Stones. “If you look at it as transformation – how it addresses mental and physical health, brings communities together and addresses resource use and the environment – you put more weight behind it.”But some experts sound a note of caution. Although the Fietsersbond, a Dutch cycling organisation, warmly welcomes the investment, it warns that it is irritating and counterproductive when bike parks are combined with a no-tolerance policy to on-street parking – as in central Amsterdam, where “wild” parked bikes are confiscated.“I am not a fan of this,” said its director, Saskia Kluit. “There’s a grey area growing where the government wants a clean appearance and wants to get rid of the bikes, but parked bikes give the street liveliness and movement, and if you want the benefit of the cyclist shopping, it’s better they can stop everywhere they want.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb2674861ac033f81ff3c5a2caefe6d8caba4ea7/0_65_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f2c9dd784adaa05d6c554451e128388","title":"cost no deal mps operation yellowhammer brexit","story":"The term “Project Fear” must be expunged from the respectable political lexicon. Now that we know the full detail of the government’s Operation Yellowhammer assumptions about a no-deal Brexit, these two words – scornfully applied for three years to all warnings about Brexit – have no meaningful place in the present political emergency.“There’s a lot of scaremongering around,” declared the energy minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, on Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday show, in dismissive response to the Sunday Times’ reports on the leaked Yellowhammer document. Really? These, after all, are the government’s own assessments, not the panicked assertions of ultra-remainers.In the event of a no-deal exit, there are likely to be serious shortages of fuel, food and medicine disruption at the nation’s ports civil disorder increased poverty and a hard border with Ireland. To be profoundly and vocally concerned about such a prospect is not “scaremongering”, but a basic civic responsibility.Indeed, as the “Project Fear” slur diminishes in impact, it is intriguing to observe the prime minister and his acolytes preparing its successor: the “Great Betrayal” narrative. In a letter to Philip Hammond and 20 other Tory MPs seeking to thwart no deal, leaked to the Mail on Sunday, Johnson alleges that “it is as plain as a pikestaff that Brussels – or the EU27 – will simply not compromise as long as they believe there is the faintest possibility that parliament can block Brexit on 31 October”. In other words: if no deal happens, it will be because the EU saw no need to renegotiate. It will be your fault, Spreadsheet Phil.This is spectacularly disingenuous. There are absolutely no signs, coded or otherwise, from the EU27 that, dazzled by Johnson’s brio and joke book, they are ready to strike a new deal in the time remaining before 31 October.It is he who insists that this deadline cannot be shifted, “no ifs, no buts”. It is he and his fellow Brexiteers who led the charge against Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement, making it impossible for the Commons to agree on an alternative. We are in this predicament because of the serial dishonesty, manoeuvring and lust for power of those who insisted that leaving the EU would be easy. This may be what Dominic Cummings, the PM’s senior adviser, would call an “unhelpful narrative”. But it’s also the truth.What matters now is how those who want to prevent a historic disaster respond to the challenge how imaginative they are prepared to be and whether they are ready to put nation before party, and the interests of subsequent generations before narrow political advantage. Johnson and Cummings are determined to get the UK out on 31 October “by any means necessary”. Are their disaggregated opponents equally committed?The question answers itself. I deplore those who are ready to vandalise the future of this great country just to satisfy an ideological itch. But it is also hard not to be exasperated by the fastidiousness of their opponents – a squeamishness that is fine in times of relative political calm, but an unaffordable luxury at moments such as these, when the stakes are vertiginously high.Let us address the bearded elephant in the room. I think I have made it fairly clear that I do not want Jeremy Corbyn to become prime minister and that I firmly believe he is not up to the job. But – if Johnson loses a vote of no confidence in September, triggering a 14-day period in which, by law, any MP can seek to form an alternative government – it is self-evident that Corbyn will be at the heart of any such discussions, ex officio, as leader of the opposition. I might wish that Stella Creasy or Yvette Cooper or Hilary Benn held that post. But none of them does.Liberal Democrats:\u0026nbspTheir first choice would be legislation to extend article 50 then call a second referendum. If this did not work the party would support the no-confidence motion, but rather than installing Corbyn, the Lib Dems would seek a cross-party government led by a backbench grandee, such as Ken Clarke or Harriet Harman. It is not clear if the party would try to block a temporary Corbyn government.SNP:\u0026nbspThe Scottish National party supports a no-confidence motion. They have said they will talk to Corbyn about his plan, despite their differences over\u0026nbspBrexit. The party’s leader, Nicola Sturgeon, has criticised Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson\u0027s stance.Plaid Cymru:\u0026nbspLiz Saville Roberts, Westminster leader for the party, has indicated she could back the Corbyn plan, but would prefer an immediate second referendum rather than general election.Independent Group for ChangeIndependents: The group formerly known as the TIGers, now split and reduced in number after two joined the\u0026nbspLiberal Democrats, seem wary of the Corbyn plan, with some MPs saying they could not support him.Greens: Caroline Lucas, the Green party’s sole MP has taken a similar view to Saville Roberts, and has also appealed to Swinson to reconsider backing a temporary Corbyn-led government.Rebel Tories: Conservative party MP Guto Bebb has said that even a Corbyn government would be preferable to no deal. But it seems hard to see many other Tories following him.Former\u0026nbspLabour\u0026nbspindependents: Ian Austin, a long-time Corbyn foe, has already ruled out supporting his plan for a temporary government, and it is hard to see MPs such as Frank Field, John Woodcock, and others, doing so either.As it happens, I doubt that Corbyn could cobble together a Commons majority. But it was foolish of the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, and Tory opponents of no deal such as Dominic Grieve and Oliver Letwin, to make their opening move a veto on the Labour leader heading even an interim government committed to an extension of article 50, an early general election and a fresh referendum. All this grandstanding has been a great morale-booster for the no-deal Brexiteers. Who can blame them? The very first signal sent by their opponents was one of disunity, introspection and petty partisanship.Again, to be clear: I think the chances of a so-called government of national unity being formed have always been slim. The better prospects are for parliament to pass fast-tracked legislation to mandate the government to seek an article 50 extension and a variety of strategies in the courts, especially a judicial review to prevent Johnson postponing a general election until after 31 October.That, though, is not the point. As the comedian Dave Chappelle has put it, progress always, inevitably, depends upon a readiness to work with imperfect allies. Those who claim they are committed – really committed – to preventing the outrage of a no-deal exit have yet to prove that they are prepared to do whatever it takes. And time, to put it mildly, is running out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/974d1cf5486a154d92c9554f6783f41276ad2567/29_313_3367_2020/master/3367.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=954de3cce6d9be06f64b03c104c5e551","title":"matteo salvini italy populist league five star movement","story":"A dangerous new phase in Italy’s populist drama is beginning, with the nationalist League set on devouring its coalition partnerWe are witnessing the beginning of act two in the drama of Italian populism, and it is a showdown between the protagonists who made phase one happen. Since the election of 2018, Matteo Salvini’s League has grown stronger, and it has had enough of its coalition partner, the Five Star Movement. It now feels it can claim sole leadership of the country, with Salvini as prime minister.Act one of this new Italian political phenomenon – last year’s game-changing general election – testified to a solid populist majority among the electorate. But the coalition that resulted highlighted the deep differences between the allies. The European elections of 26 May, in which the League won twice as many seats in the European parliament as the Five Star Movement, signalled to Salvini that the time was finally right to trigger act two. The League’s motion of no confidence in the current prime minister, the lawyer Giuseppe Conte, is designed to test whether the project can be pulled off or not. On Tuesday, in a moment of truth, Conte will face Italian MPs over the crisis.This is about the re-making of Italian populism in the image of the aggressive nationalism of the League. The Five Star Movement, which has been more ambiguous in its political positioning, is increasingly seen as a collection of losers.What we are seeing is essentially a revolt of the Italian middle classes. It started out as a protest against inequality, migrants and corruption it has grown in strength by generating conflicts and new enemies, and it craves a strong leader rather than a complicated, amorphous alliance.The nationalism of the League involves closing ports to migrants planning to impose fines of up to €1m on anyone assisting a refugee at sea voting in Strasbourg against the new president of the European commission and aiming to make the next budget a platform for openly challenging Europe over its fiscal rules. With Salvini at the helm, it all plays out in a public performance featuring crucifixes, beach orations, the vocabulary of football ultras and a tribal exaltation of ethnic-nationalist identity. The hostility to migrants and the duel with Europe are the two pillars around which Salvini garners votes, making mincemeat of the Five Star Movement, which is banking on a policy of offering a basic income to “defeat poverty”. That was too vague an objective to ever be credible.Now Salvini is getting ready to pounce on his former allies. In order to see him off, the Five Star Movement would have had to transform itself into a credible force for government and a guarantor of stability. It would have had to move on from protest to the art of governing.The reason it wasn’t able to is because it was wedded to an anti-growth ideology, which led it to commit a series of errors. It was a mistake to oppose Rome’s nomination for the 2024 Olympics and Turin’s for the 2026 Winter Games. It was a mistake to oppose a high-speed train link between France and Italy, a new motorway in the north of Italy, and a project to drill for oil in territorial waters off the coast. The Five Star Movement has given the impression that it opposes the modernisation of the country.As a result it lost the leadership of the protest movement: first it was wiped out at the regional elections, then it was humiliated at the European elections. Now, with a possible no-confidence vote against Conte, it may lose its prime minister of choice. In this new phase of Italian populism, the nationalists will be in charge, possibly as the result of a deal between Salvini and Giorgia Meloni’s far-right Brothers of Italy party. The country will move even closer to emulating Poland and Hungary. The Five Star Movement will be left with the desperate choice of going under or allying itself with the traditional mainstream parties in an attempt to stop its ex-comrades-in-arms.What’s coming will be aggressive and confrontational. Act two of Italian populism, if Salvini is in charge, will put up a tough fight against anyone trying to get in its way. His political adversaries will have to choose between forming a coalition government in the current parliament, bringing together all the anti-Salvini forces, or a head-on challenge at the polls. Either way, this clash will become a kind of referendum on national identity and the relationship with Europe. The next phase of political struggle in Italy is destined to be a duel between extremes.• Maurizio Molinari is the editor-in-chief of La Stampa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f28366b4699372ef0dac03b09eefa3f505f884a1/0_0_3035_1819/master/3035.jpg?width=685\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=898d83b3e49828647b17efc8dda4bbc4 1370w","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of appetite","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘appetite’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘appetite’.Share your photos of what appetite means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 21 August at 10am.

See every wrinkle,” says the Glaswegian comedian, who is 58. For a glancing moment, she sounds a little awestruck. “I survived rape, I survived my Ma being murdered, this is my face. If it offends you, don’t look at it. I think other people should have that attitude.”Godley is sitting in the kitchen of the elegant Edinburgh tenement flat she has rented for the duration of the fringe with her daughter Ashley Storrie, a successful comic too, of whom her mum is glowingly proud. It is a biblically rainy day, and Godley has erected a shoe-changing station of plastic bags and a small stool at the front door, anxious to keep the carpets clean.With years of five-star reviews and sold-out gigs behind her, recent months have brought her a huge new audience as a result of the political voiceovers she posts online. Within hours of Boris Johnson visiting Nicola Sturgeon at her official residence last month, for instance, Godley had posted a video that articulated the first minister’s imagined interior monologue in an irritable Glaswegian accent. The prime minister had extended his arm to escort Sturgeon into her own home – in what many saw as a gesture of male entitlement – and Godley as Sturgeon is blunt: “Put your arm down, ya arsehole, get in.” The clip lasts for only a few seconds, and has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times.This month, Godley has brought the format to the Edinburgh fringe, where her shows are packed out in advance of a UK-wide tour. “I can’t believe that people like them so much,” she says. “But then we don’t have many satirical shows, and the ones we do have are like Have I Got News for You. I was the first working-class Scottish female comic ever to do it.” She pauses. “Last year. So even when we have satire, it’s not relatable to everybody.”Godley has strong opinions about Johnson and Trump. She came to the pro-independence cause during the 2014 referendum campaign, and is pragmatic about the prospects of an independent Scotland: “I don’t think its going to be a utopia, I think we’re going to fuck up a lot of things, there will be mistakes. But what can be worse than Boris Johnson, who is a Poundland Donald Trump?”She believes that Johnson’s premiership and the “shambles” of Brexit is causing many of those who voted against independence in 2014 to reassess: “People are like: ‘This is tribal, this is the flag, this is the Queen, we love the union.’ Then they see their benefits affected, their taxes, that they can’t get insulin, and then people change their minds.”As Godley rattles through the details of her “dodgy background”, there are elements of slapstick, and she is not coy about a pitch-black punchline. When she tells me that the uncle who raped her as a child was found dead in his bed last year, she fixes me with an even gaze. “All the men that fuck me about die alone. Weird, eh?”She is unsentimental about experiences that must have been painful, brutal and frightening. But she is also scrupulously clear about where responsibility lies: it’s not her shame, she reiterates several times.The youngest of four, Godley was raised by an alcoholic father and a chaotic, debt-prone mother in the East End of Glasgow. She was systematically abused by an uncle throughout her childhood, left school without any qualifications and was married at 19 to the son of a local gangster. Her mother died in 1982, when Godley was 21, murdered, her daughter believes, by her violent boyfriend, who was never charged by the police despite her family’s protestations.“I had nits, scabies, we were poor,” she says bluntly of her childhood. “I remember eating out of bins and being a teenager with dirty clothes. But I was bright and I loved reading, so I had the chance to escape. And I’m not ashamed of it, because it wasn’t my fault.”That is one of the reasons she does the free fringe (her gigs have an honesty bucket at the exit). “I love the fact that people who are pure skint can come through from Glasgow and see a free show, because it’s a very elite business.”What is blazingly obvious, listening to her life story, is the way Godley has taken direct action, with great courage, often in the face of male power. Aged 12, she threatened her uncle with a red-hot poker: “He backed off because he’d never been confronted before.” As an adult, she took him to court, along with her sister, whom he had similarly abused, and secured a conviction. After years of bullying, she walked out on her gangster in-laws and forged a successful international career “doing something I’d never seen anyone like me doing”.Godley is never lost for words, but she pauses here for a millisecond when I ask her about this. “When Ashley meets members of my extended family, she’s like: ‘HOW?’ I don’t know what made me different and I know there is something different.”To describe Godley’s route to comedy as unusual is an understatement. Critics who describe her standup material – which embraces child abuse and murder – as “unique” do so for good reason. Godley spent her 20s running a pub in Calton, an area regularly cited as having the lowest life expectancy for men in the whole of the UK, with her husband. The pub belonged to George Storrie, a notorious criminal patriarch with seven sons, six of whom deeply resented Godley and her steadfast refusal to keep quiet.The young couple surprised even themselves in their ability to run a business well: “We were proper young grafters,” she says fondly. “We didn’t smoke or drink, we paid tax, put our daughter through a private school. I wanted her to get an education because I never got one.”But after her father-in-law’s death, the police raided his property – “they wouldn’t come when George was alive” – where Godley’s family and several other brothers were living. They found guns and weapons secreted about the place: Godley and her husband were put in prison for the night, but let out, “because we could prove the guns weren’t ours”.Then a dispute over the running of the family pub, combined with already toxic fraternal relations, pushed Godley and her husband to walk out of their home one night, with their daughter, the cat and some schoolbooks, never to return. While the brothers’ mutual chaos has continued across the decades, the couple have not had further contact with them for 27 years.The family moved into temporary accommodation. It was terrifying, she says: “We had no transferable skills.” But that wasn’t entirely true: as a barmaid in one of Glasgow’s roughest pubs, Godley had honed the comic timing and expert crowd control essential for a stand-up career. Having already excelled at open-mic nights, she progressed quickly on the comedy circuit.It was the mid-90s, she reminds me, when “alternative” comedy was very much the domain of “student boys in nice jeans and funny haircuts”. She rolls her eyes: “I saw a lot of cock back then.” At one show, a couple of male comedians came out naked, carrying a plank of wood, “and the promoters were like: ‘This is genius.’ And I was like: ‘This is NOT genius, I don’t understand any of this.’ And the audience weren’t laughing, they were bemused. I realised in that moment there were two types of comedy: comedians who people called ‘genius’, who only the promoters laughed at, and comedians the audience loved, and the promoters didn’t. I went on after them, did straight standup, and the audience laughed.“It was quite a shock to have a working-class, older woman – I was 35 and a mum – do this, and it got a few backs up.” But promoters were also suspicious because she was talking about subjects that people didn’t normally make jokes about.“I spoke about my Ma being murdered, child abuse, gangsters. Back then, even comics were saying: ‘You shouldn’t talk about that.’ But I’m so glad I did. The amount of people that came up to me and said: ‘I was abused and I’ve never laughed before.’ One of the most important things about comedy is nobody gets to tell you what you can joke about, as long as you’re punching up and not punching down.”The voiceovers aren’t her first brush with online fame. The day after the UK voted to leave the EU, the presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump flew in to visit his golf course at Turnberry, on the south-west coast of Scotland. Fuelled by righteous anger at the referendum result, and at Trump himself – “We’ve all met that man in the pub, that checks a woman out as he talks and then moves on if he’s not interested, then tells you that women’s issues don’t matter” – Godley hand-wrote a succinct protest slogan and headed for the coast. The photograph of a small but defiant woman, holding an A3 sign reading “Trump is a cunt”, surrounded by police, went viral.“I think half the world was shocked I used that word,” she says, “but there are worse words. Food bank is worse.” When Godley returned to Turnberry to protest against Trump’s visit as US president in 2018, she adapted the sign to read “Trump is a runt” with a strategically placed hand.She has depicted May trying to persuade Jeremy Corbyn to join a minoge (a Scottish savings club), and begging Sturgeon for her Netflix sign-in, before heading over for the summer to her Spanish caravan with Isa MacNamee and all the Sandras. Arlene Foster is not impressed: “Big Theresa’s pure steaming over in Torremolinos. She’s just joined the Snapchat group, Face-timed me at two in the morning singing Abba, as if I don’t have enough to do!”The references in the voiceovers – the savings club, Pippa Dee clothing parties, which auntie last borrowed the soup pot – are emphatically local to the west of Scotland, but Godley has a theory about why they travel so well: “These are really troubling times, and folk want to hark back to something with a sense of community. The soup pot is the very definition of that. People in America, Venezuela, Australia have all written to me and said it doesn’t matter what culture you belong to, whenever there’s a death, a birth, a homecoming, people get out the big soup pot. So that is a global icon of community.”She is bullish about requests to subtitle her broad Scots delivery: “I say, no, learn my accent. If you can learn to read Shakespeare and there’s a Burns club in every country, you can understand my accent.” Has she ever been confronted by one of her voiceover subjects? Politicians have written to her privately and asked “Can you do me?”, she twinkles, but refuses to disclose any further. Yes, she has been told that Sturgeon has seen them. “Apparently she finds them funny,” she says with the deliberate vagueness of someone who knows all too well that she does. But Godley insists they have never met, or spoken. “I wouldn’t want to be photographed with her because I’ve got such a dodgy background that I don’t want to infect her with it. I don’t want to be pals with any politician.”Godley has received death threats for her opposition to Trump, and so is well aware of the poison welling online. But the great thing about social media, she says, “is that people speak out. Before, if you stood in a pub and spoke about domestic violence, you’d be shut down in a minute.” For her mother’s generation, it was normal to see a woman walking down the road with two black eyes. “There’s laws that have changed. In Scotland, you can’t even gaslight a woman and rightly so – there’s refuges, places women can go.”There is a strong impression that Godley – who suffers fools gladly only to the extent that they provide her with another laugh line – has found her playground on Twitter. “Has Twitter changed my life? It has. I make a joke about it on stage: ‘My husband loves it because I used to argue with him …’ I treat it like daily life – if one person says you’re not funny, you don’t have to find me funny. My tour sells out.”For details of Janey Godley’s upcoming tour, go to janeygodley"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5df178c09a8d7005c6143cde1994f088dbfae423/310_0_2538_1524/master/2538.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=673c2d485d6ea2779aedde7ed62837f3","title":"english a level tell us whats driving the drop in take up of the subject","story":"We want to hear from students and teachers why English is declining as a choice for A-level pupilsOnce a popular subject choice for sixth formers, schools are now seeing a sharp drop in the take-up of English literature and language at A-level.Some blame the recently reformed English GCSEs for “sucking the joy” out of the subject, while others suggest the push for vocational secondary education is stopping people from choosing it.We want to hear from students, educators, parentss about why you think fewer people are studying English at A-level.

This site ranked 32nd in the report, producing 207 kilotonnes of sulphur dioxide emissions in 2018, according to the analysis.The Yallourn, Loy Yang A and Loy Yang B power stations in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley ranked 49th at 151 kilotonnes.The Vales Point and Eraring coal-fired power stations in the Lake Macquarie region of NSW ranked 79th, and the Liddell and Bayswater power stations near Muswellbrook in the Hunter Valley 91st.The Victorian SO2 air pollution hotspot covers a population of more than 470,000 people, and the NSW hotspot covers an area of more than 1.7 million people, but Greenpeace said the the impacts from secondary pollution covered a far greater population.In Sydney alone, more than 100 premature deaths a year are thought to be caused by pollution from coal-fired power stations. Nationally it’s more than 4,000.“Australian coal-burning power stations are polluting at levels that would be illegal in China and most other parts of the world,” said Jonathan Moylan, a campaigner with Greenpeace Australia Pacific.“Air pollution is the price our communities pay for the federal government’s failure to stand up to big polluters. It’s time for state environment ministers to show leadership by championing health-based sulphur and nitrogen dioxide standards, strong pollution limits for industry and speeding up the switch to clean renewable energy.”Sulphur dioxide can cause health problems including heart and lung disease, and asthma.Ben Ewald, a doctor with Doctors for the Environment Australia, said there were places in Australia that had “a serious SO2 problem” and limits were set well above what was needed to protect human health. He said the same was the case for nitrogen dioxide, another airborne pollutant.“These pollutants can cause childhood asthma, lung disease, cancer, birth defects and reproductive issues,” he said. “Australian governments must introduce tougher standards to protect community health.”Environmental Justice Australia has been pushing for tougher air pollution standards across the country. EJA is representing the Nature Conservation Council in a legal challenge to the NSW Environmental Protection Authority’s decision not to vary the pollution licences of the Mount Piper, Vales Point and Eraring power stations.EJA is also calling for Victoria’s Environment Protection Authority to finalise a long-running review of the pollution licences for the Latrobe power stations and set tougher limits.“It’s pretty extraordinary to see the Latrobe Valley in that list of highest-polluting hotspots in the world.”• Sign up to receive the top stories from  Australia every morningA spokesman for the Victorian EPA said it had considered 477 submissions to its review of the three licences in the Latrobe Valley and was drafting its assessment and amendments to the licences.He said the EPA had also designed an air-monitoring network with the Latrobe Valley community “because we value their involvement, knowledge and concerns”.“Victoria’s air quality is considered good by world standards but scientific knowledge on the impacts of air pollution on public and environmental health is continually growing and EPA is keen for this to be reflected in industry standards and requirements,” he said.The spokesman said Victoria’s EPA was also leading the national review under way for nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide under the national environment protection (ambient air quality) measure and it was likely this would lead to stricter national standards.There have been 17,000 public submissions to the review."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea09f0162570b711fd7fd7f9932af27eca81ca48/0_112_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40c6c280fe733af6152575454786b009","title":"tell us how have you reused your wedding dress","story":"We want to hear if you opted for a non-traditional dress, or if you’ve repurposed it so you could wear it againWorn for the big day, gone tomorrow – for many people a wedding dress will be the single most expensive item of clothing they ever buy.

More importantly he cooks and eats with them firstGiles Duley, a 47-year-old photographer, is no stranger to some of the world’s most desperate places. His work on the impact of war has taken him to Lebanon, South Sudan, Ukraine and Afghanistan, where in 2011 he lost both legs and his left arm after stepping on a landmine. But his experience in Mosul, Iraq, in the spring of 2017, covering the fallout of the military campaign to retake the city from Islamic State, was something else.“I saw some of the worst things I’d ever seen in terms of war – just horrific things,” says Duley, shaking his head. “It was overwhelming and I came back in quite a dark place from that trip. It was shut the curtains, I don’t want to speak to anyone. And I just started cooking, I started making pasta and bread. I realised that was therapy for me, because when you’ve got those dark thoughts and you’ve seen children injured, you can put the television on or you can read a book, but you are still thinking about those things. You can’t get away from them. But I found cooking was the one time I did, because I think it’s the manual tasks: you are lost in that moment.“Suddenly I was cooking obsessively,” he goes on, “getting up at 4am, making bread, cooking all day. Literally going up to my neighbours and saying, ‘Would you like a whole meal?’ I hadn’t eaten any of it, because I was already stuffed, but I’d just made a load of cannelloni.”Sitting in Duley’s sun-drenched living room in St Leonards-on-Sea, watching him skilfully prepare fennel and lemon risotto with scallops, the horrors of Mosul feel a world away. But Duley’s obsession with cooking has continued – in fact probably intensified – and now influences both his life and work. The fun side is an Instagram feed called The One Armed Chef, where he shares the food he cooks at home and eats on his travels with more than 5,000 followers. Duley began posting photographs a couple of years ago, mainly as a distraction from his day job. But there’s also a serious element – a comment on how many of us respond to disability.“It’s really a ‘fuck you’ to people in restaurants who said, ‘Oh, can I cut that up for you?’” says Duley. “Because I would turn around to them and show them a handmade egg-yolk ravioli and they’d go, ‘Uh?’ And I’d say, ‘I did that one-handed, I think I can cut my potato in half.’ I know people want to help, but it’s humiliating that somebody just assumes you can’t do something one-handed. Just because somebody’s different it doesn’t mean they can’t do things that you can’t even do.”Last year, Duley was contacted by Instagram’s headquarters in San Francisco, saying it was an admirer of his work and wanted to feature it on its main feed. Duley was thrilled: he knows how difficult it is to reach an audience with stories of refugees. Only later did he realise that Instagram was reaching out to The One Armed Chef. “And they were like, ‘Oh, you’re a photographer as well?’” he recalls. “Yes, I can also do that!”Nothing in Duley’s kitchen, or indeed his flat, has been altered because of his injuries: “I always say the only thing that was adapted was my patience.” He notes, with a laugh, that some things which sound easy are actually near-impossible, and vice versa. “I can travel to Iraq on my own and take photographs,” he says, “but I can’t put a woolly hat on.” When he first started cooking, frying an egg was an ordeal, just standing at the stove in his prosthetic legs. Even now he has to plan ahead when he puts a heavy casserole dish in the oven, because it’s awkward to remove it with one hand.Food increasingly plays a central role in Duley’s work, too. Now, when he meets a family he wants to photograph, he asks to cook with them first. It might be borscht in Ukraine or goat stew in central Africa he’s also eaten land snails in Nigeria and fried tarantulas in north Cambodia, but he’d rather not dwell on that. Only after he’s spent hours preparing food with someone will Duley lift his camera to take a picture.“When a family invites me into their house and lets me cook with them, I feel like the most privileged person in the world, because you have that moment of intimacy with them,” says Duley. “For them it’s a sign of respect: I’m not just there to get your story, I’m not taking your story from you, I want to learn about you and I want to understand you.“The difference between an acquaintance and a friend is when we’ve eaten together.”“In this family, the father had died. He’d been on the roof collecting water and a drone strike had killed him. A few weeks later, a mortar had gone off in the garden and killed the grandfather. The mother was hit by shrapnel in the kitchen and died over several days. So it was just the grandmother Laila and four grandchildren left. The house was like a film set, if you were getting central casting to make a bomb-damaged house. It had blackened walls, windows with bullet holes. It was horrific.I arranged to cook with the grandmother and the only things I could find in Mosul were a frozen chicken, a bag of rice and a couple of onions. It turned out she was a terrible chef! We later discovered that her sister used to help her cook. We spent the first hour trying to break the chicken to get it in the pot. We got a knife and hammer and smashed it.The kids were laughing and jokes were being made, and there was a warmth to what was happening. Then we sat down and ate. Arab food is personal because you put your hands in the food together. You are at the same level when you share food like that.”“Another family, another terrible story. Oleksander, a teenage boy had been at home, his father was out and his mother was cooking in the kitchen. He went into his bedroom to listen to music and he heard this massive explosion he was thrown from his bed – an artillery shell had landed in the kitchen, which destroyed the room and killed his mother.This is the kitchen where it had happened. They’d patched up the roof, and his older brother was living there with him, looking after him, because their father had passed away since then, too.I thought, ‘Do you know what, I don’t need to talk to him about it because you don’t need to, to understand that that was a terrible thing.’ So what I did was ask him questions about the food they used to have and the traditions of their food.Of course, being Ukraine it was all about the borscht. And so I said: ‘Can I come back tomorrow? Why don’t we cook together?’So I did, and that taste will never leave me. It was beautiful that borscht, and we were all laughing.”“I met Khouloud and Jamal in 2014, when I was just starting to work again. Khouloud is a woman who was paralysed by a sniper in Syria six years ago, near the beginning of the war. They were the first family I sat down and ate with, which started the idea that this was how I could build relationships. I would turn up and Jamal, Khouloud’s husband, would cook the most amazing food and I knew they didn’t have the money to do it. I was so humbled sitting there eating with them.I have known them over the years, so the first meals we shared were in a tent in the Bekaa valley in Lebanon, where they had nothing. And now they live in Holland they have been relocated there and now when I go there they still cook for me, but they are able to do much more.They are able to cook as they always said they wanted to in the past but weren’t able to.”“Rose is a smart businesswoman. She is also one of the strongest women I’ve ever met. I met her in Uganda in a refugee camp for the South Sudanese where she had, well, let’s call it a cafe, but it was a little mud hut. It had a stove made of mud and she made stews and bits and pieces, and refugees would give a few pennies to eat there.I said: ‘It’d be fun to cook with you.’ I could tell her mind was ticking over, and she said: ‘Yeah, be here at 9am.’ So she got me there and she said: ‘You can cook today.’She’d worked out that as soon as there was a one-armed white bloke cooking in her cafe everybody was going to come and see this. We were absolutely packed: it was the most successful day she’d ever had.At the end of the day I’m like, ‘Do I get a cut?’ And she said: ‘No! Of course not!’ She was hilarious.”“Food is a moment of release for a lot of people living in terrible situations. On the trip that I met Rose, I met Reida from South Sudan who was less fortunate, who had a child with a severe disability. She had lost her husband and was surviving on just a handful of beans given to her by NGOs. I remember sitting with her while she split those beans into days for her three kids and herself. When you see someone counting the beans they have for that day – that’s survival at its most basic.She would cook the beans and add a bit of flavouring: she had something like dried anchovies which she would add in to give it a little more protein. But, of course, she still offered to share that food with me.Even then, food was still a moment when the family came together, they laughed and chatted, and for a moment they escaped everything going on around them. It was humbling for me. You think, ‘I’m going to appreciate every meal I have and every moment.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51d45e56671f8863dff59331b853fa89764d7d30/152_1899_4821_2891/master/4821.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b7b3fcecad5d8679ecaa26585e9ea6a","title":"nigel slater ice cream recipes","story":"In this heat, it’s ice screamingly obvious what you need to doThe summer staggers on. The air is hot and thick as treacle. There is no breeze, not a single leaf moves. For some, the summer of their dreams. For me, the perfect excuse to make ice-cream. To be honest, there has barely been a day when there hasn’t been at least two tubs in the freezer. Homemade vanilla or raspberry ripple, perhaps one made with roast plums, another with basil and lemon. Some have been made here in my kitchen (crème fraîche, lemon, a less than perfect pistachio), others have been rushed home from the shops. There have been wafers and cornets, sundaes and ice-cream sandwiches, and more than I care to admit eaten straight from the tub.Then there are the water ices, the granitas and sorbets that have been particularly welcome in this, the stickiest of summers. Of these, it is the apricot that has been the most pleasing. A frustrating fruit, whose flavour can be generously described as fleeting, caught at its best simply by being allowed a brief simmer in a light sugar syrup. The ice-cream that has induced the most cheers has been one of vanilla and blackcurrant, the dark fruit made into a thick, intensely flavoured jam and marbled through the pale and creamy ice.I do have an ice-cream maker and it does produce an ice of particularly smooth and creamy texture, but I don’t regard it as an essential piece of kit. You can make a perfectly fine ice-cream with a fork and freezer box. The trick is to let the mixture freeze around the edges so only the centre is still soft, then beat briefly with a whisk or fork, bringing the glistening crystals into the middle, then return it to the freezer. Doing this every hour or so will produce a much lighter textured ice than one that has just been left in the freezer to do its own thing.You don’t need perfectly ripe apricots to make a gently flavoured water ice. Bringing the fruit to softness with a little sugar brings out the flavour of those fruits that stubbornly refuse to ripen. The lemon makes them sing. We have made this sorbet all summer this year, eating it as it is, or spooning it into cones and sundae glasses with alternate layers of raspberries and vanilla ice-cream.caster sugar 250gapricots 750g, ripe or almost ripelemons 2Put the sugar into a stainless-steel or enamelled saucepan, add 500ml of water and bring to the boil, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar. Halve the apricots and remove their stones, then add to the sugar syrup and leave to cook at a steady simmer for 10-15 minutes, depending on the ripeness of your fruit. They should be completely soft.Halve and squeeze the lemons and pour the juice into the apricots. Tip the fruit and their syrup into a blender jug and reduce to a thin purée. Pour into an ice-cream maker and churn until almost frozen. Alternatively, pour into a freezer box and place in the freezer for two hours. As the mixture starts to freeze around the edge, stir gently then return to the freezer for a further hour or two, before repeating until the mixture is almost frozen.Scoop into bowls and serve.This ice-cream is rich enough without using cream, but you could replace half the milk with cream if you wish. If you can find a plump, sticky vanilla pod, then one will be enough. Failing that, two or three smaller ones will do.For the vanilla ice-cream:milk 600mlvanilla pod 1egg yolks 6caster sugar 150gFor the blackcurrant ripple:blackcurrants 250gcaster sugar 3 tbspwater 100mlTo make the ice-cream first pour the milk into a saucepan. Slice the vanilla pod in half lengthways and scrape the sticky black vanilla seeds into the pan with the point of a knife. Drop the scraped pod in, too, then bring the mixture almost to the boil. Turn off the heat just before it boils. Leave for 30 minutes or so, for the vanilla to flavour the milk.Beat the egg yolks and caster sugar until light and fluffy. Discard the vanilla pod, then pour the milk through a sieve into the yolks and sugar, stirring to a thin custard, then pour into a clean saucepan.Put the custard over a moderate heat and, stirring almost continuously with a wooden spoon, bring it slowly towards the boil. Once the custard is thick enough to thinly coat the back of the wooden spoon, remove from the heat, pour into a cold basin and leave it to cool. Refrigerate the custard for a good half hour before pouring into an ice-cream machine and churning until almost frozen.Transfer the ice-cream into a freezer box and freeze for two hours.Remove the blackcurrants from their stems. Put the fruit in a small saucepan with the sugar and 100ml of water and bring to the boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 5 or 6 minutes until the currants are starting to burst and the liquid has become a deep purple colour. Turn up the heat and boil rapidly for 2 or 3 minutes until the liquid has formed a thickish syrup, then remove from the heat and leave to cool.As the ice-cream is starting to firm in its freezer box, spoon in the blackcurrants and swirl through the ice-cream to form ribbons of purple. Avoid the temptation to over-mix. The ice-cream should be mostly creamy white with ripples of blackcurrant through it. Return to the freezer until set."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37e69d147bde9d2ab8bb1ff863707fd27b5e4dbc/0_56_1179_707/master/1179.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44151f60a5482757ce8f022935ff7902","title":"tottenham mauricio pochettino transfer window christian eriksen","story":"• Spurs manager fears club could lose Christian Eriksen• Pochettino wants longer window like other nationsMauricio Pochettino has described the decision to close the domestic summer transfer window in early August as a “massive mistake” and claims he has even persuaded Tottenham’s hard-nosed chairman, Daniel Levy, of the same thing.Pochettino could still lose Christian Eriksen to Real Madrid as the Spanish transfer window does not shut until 2 September. Were that to happen Pochettino would be unable to replace one of Tottenham’s key players until January at the earliest. Italy, France and Germany have the same deadline as Spain.Pochettino spoke after his side secured a point at Manchester City in dramatic fashion, with VAR ruling out Gabriel Jesus’s stoppage-time winner on the basis of a handball by Aymeric Laporte in the build-up to the goal. The manager was proud of the display and pointed to how his club has a different model regarding building his squad.“We sign players who are young and have the potential. Tanguy Ndombele only played two seasons at Lyon, didn’t win anything and we brought him here to try to make him a top player,” he said. “Giovani Lo Celso on loan from Real Betis is similar. Ryan Sessegnon is more of a potential player. And, of course, we signed Jack Clarke.“When you compare with the different teams who are in the same race as us it’s a completely different way. People understand we are playing to try to win but we have different resources to fight in the same race with teams that operate in a different way.”“They are preparing themselves to win.

Healthy leftovers from the night before, bulked up with extra vegetables or a salad, can be a good option, says Gillian Killiner, a dietitian and spokeswoman for the British Dietetic Association. Shop-bought convenience food “should be the last resort”, she says. “It can be laden with pro-inflammatory ingredients, especially cheap vegetable oils and fillers, which do not provide long-acting energy, so leave you hungry and unsatisfied.”Enjoy your food somewhere peaceful, if possible, perhaps outdoors. If you eat at your desk, you will probably carry on working rather than focusing on your food, which could lead to weight gain. “The receptor from the gut to brain will not work optimally and leaves you feeling unsatisfied and reaching for more without realising what you have already consumed,” says Killiner. Sitting hunched over, eating mindlessly without chewing well can also cause or exacerbate gastrointestinal issues.An hour (if you are lucky) may not sound long enough to travel, change, workout, shower, eat and be back at your desk, but it is possible to exercise at lunchtime. Hollie Grant, a personal trainer and the founder of Pilates PT, says high-intensity interval training (HIIT) is “the quickest way to get fit in the shortest amount of time. It’s short bursts of hard work you can easily do a HIIT workout in 20 minutes.” You don’t need a gym – you can turn a run into a HIIT workout by alternating 30-second sprints with 30 seconds of jogging or walking. You could do the same on a bike, or in a pool. Just remember to warm up and cool down – and to eat afterwards, not before, says Grant.It is best to drink water often and in small amounts, says Killiner. “Too much liquid at meals can cause some people to have acid reflux, which can cause pain and bloating.” About 250ml of water should be enough with a meal, but Killiner suggests drinking 500ml about 30 minutes before lunch. “It assists with reducing hunger, allowing more control in selecting healthier options when meals come round.”That feeling of wanting a nap – or a chocolate bar – shortly after lunch can be staved off with better food choices. The slump can be made worse with carb-heavy meals, such as lots of bread, pasta or potatoes. Killiner recommends instead “eating nutritious choices such as white or oily fish and seafood, brown rice, oat cakes, quinoa and a variety of colourful vegetables. Sprinkle with some seeds or nuts.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66c1cd4287f6e49cd0d50319a1ff94726eb0fbbe/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60d0c4a530ef026b743870ae40e4ae4b","title":"how to minimise scars caused by acne or injury","story":"Moisturising and massaging can speed up the healing process, but if you still find your scars distressing, a variety of treatments are available, advises a consultant dermatologistScars are one of the body’s ways of repairing itself. If skin is damaged, your body works to form fibrous structures to mend the wound. Unfortunately, the resulting scar will look and feel different from the surrounding skin. There are different causes of scarring, but surgery or acne are particularly common. When a scar appears, it often looks angry and red, but will usually fade over several months. There are things you can do to help.One way to reduce scarring is to moisturise and massage developing scars for five to 10 minutes every day. This helps to stimulate blood flow, which is good for scar remodelling. Some people use specialist skincare oils, but the massaging is more important than the product used. If you have a scar that is healing, it is important to refrain from exercising or moving around, as the tissue may begin to move apart and the scar will take on a larger, rugby-ball shape during remodelling. If you smoke, stop: as well as all its other health risks, smoking has a negative effect on healing and the scar will end up looking much worse.If a scar causes pain, the NHS may be able to help, but for less serious scars that still cause distress, private dermatologists have a variety of treatments aimed at reducing their appearance, including dermarolling (using a small wheel covered with tiny needles to gently prick the face) or subcision (a minor surgical procedure).

Here are the key points:• The worst disruption to the short Channel crossings might last three months, although disruption could continue much longer.• In a reasonable worst-case scenario, HGVs could face a maximum delay of 1½-2½ days before being able to cross the border.• EU likely to have increased immigration checks at border posts. This may lead to passenger delays at St Pancras, Cheriton (Channel tunnel) and Dover.• With significant disruption lasting up to six months across the Channel, this will have an impact on the supply of medicines and medical supplies unless there is mitigation via other sources.• The supply of certain types of fresh food will decrease. Critical elements of the food supply chain (such as ingredients, chemicals and packaging) may be in short supply. In combination, these two factors will not cause an overall shortage of food in the UK but will reduce availability and choice and increase the price, which will affect vulnerable groups.• Public water services are likely to remain largely unaffected, thanks to actions now being taken by water companies. The most significant single risk is a failure in the chemicals supply chain. The likelihood of this is considered low.• The UK would impose the “no new checks with limited exceptions” model announced on 13 March … but this is likely to prove unsustainable because of economic, legal and biosecurity risks.• Protests and counter-protests will take place across the UK, using up police resources. There may also be a rise in public disorder and community tensions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1bf654e46aa10a08c9a9de3a72b6950d8b8f4cbe/0_195_5464_3280/master/5464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97abf76cbe45926e9b9455fcc7f97561","title":"martin rees astronomer royal interview brexit","story":"The astronomer royal and risk specialist on cyber-attacks, pandemics, Brexit and life on MarsMartin Rees is a cosmologist and astrophysicist who has been the astronomer royal since 1995. He is also a co-founder of the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, Cambridge. His most recent book, On the Future: Prospects for Humanity, is published by Princeton.After Boris Johnson’s recent announcement of an increase in the number of special visas for scientists, Sir Andre Geim accused him of taking scientists “for fools”. Did you feel patronised by the announcement? I wouldn’t put it that way. Anything that makes it easier to get visas is welcome but won’t remove the serious downsides of Brexit.So you agree with Sir Andre that the turmoil will last for many years and that issuing a few more visas isn’t really the answer? The main point is that science is truly global, straddles all boundaries of nationality and faith. So anything that makes the UK less welcoming to scientists around the world is going to have a negative impact. Why should the passenger on the Clapham omnibus care about the situation of science post-Brexit?Because science is not just a venture for academics – most of our life depends on how it’s applied. The UK is specially strong in scientific expertise and in its universities – it would be deeply damaging to jeopardise this strength. A Brexiter would say you are part of an elite protecting vested interests. Well, it’s very odd of people such as Jacob Rees-Mogg to refer to their opponents as an elite. As a university teacher, I think the whole country ought to care about the quality of our hi-tech industry and our education. And most young voters are anti-Brexit.Would you say the only group of scientists who are more relaxed about Brexit are working on GM foods?That is true – many of us feel that the EU regulations on GM are over-stringent. But even from that perspective it’s not clear you’re better off out than in. We want to sell our stuff in the EU, so we’d be better placed to do that if we were inside and could influence the regulations rather than having those regulations imposed on us and inhibiting our trade.Technology played a disputed role in the outcome of the referendum. At the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, you study some of the potential impacts for humanity of speedy technological change… One consequence of modern technology is that the world is more interconnected. It’s possible for small groups or even iniduals to produce an effect that cascades very widely, even globally. But doesn’t that interconnectedness mean we’re able to monitor what’s going on around the world? The International Atomic Energy Agency can monitor compliance with nuclear regulation. But we have minimal success in enforcing drug or tax laws globally. Regulations of cyber and biotech will likewise be harder to enforce because, unlike the nuclear case, they don’t require conspicuous special-purpose facilities. We may have a bumpy ride because we can’t eliminate these threats completely.The climate crisis is another area where international agreements have had limited impact. There is a strong grassroots movement led by Greta Thunberg and others, yet we have populist presidents in the US and Brazil who are climate-change deniers and reneging on agreements… Politicians don’t prioritise things when the benefits are diffuse and in the far future. They will only take action if the voters are behind them. That’s why it’s very important to sustain these campaigns. We want to make sure that these issues of climate stay on the agenda. For instance, the 2015 papal encyclical on climate change. The pope has a billion followers from Latin America, Africa, East Asia and this helped towards consensus at the Paris conference.To take a more parochial example, we have to give some credit to Michael Gove, who introduced legislation against non-reusable plastics. However, he wouldn’t have done that had it not been for the influence of our secular pope David Attenborough, who introduced us to Blue Planet footage of albatrosses coughing up plastic and so on.Is climate change the threat that you’re most concerned about? The most worrying thing on a 10- or 20-year timescale is the misuse of cyber- and biotechnology.Are the dangers from rogue iniduals or rogue states? I think both, and error as well as terror. We are so dependent on the electricity grid that the lights going out are the least of the problems. A 2012 report from the US Department of Defense says a cyber-attack from another state that downs the grid in the eastern US would merit a nuclear response.Were you heartened by the amount of interest in the 50th anniversary of the moon landing? That was an extraordinary feat. But once the US had achieved their mission of beating the Russians to the moon there was no motive to continue with that level of government expenditure.The need for sending people into space has evaporated. If you were building the Hubble telescope now, you wouldn’t send people to refurbish it, you would send robots. I hope human space flight will continue, but as a high-risk adventure bankrolled by private companies. If I were American, I wouldn’t support taxpayers’ money going on Nasa’s manned programme. But I would cheer on Messrs Musk and Bezos with their companies SpaceX and Blue Origin. And perhaps by the end of the century a few adventurers will be living on Mars. Musk has said he wants to “die on Mars, but just not on impact” and that’s not a crazy aspiration.But it is a delusion to think we can solve Earth’s problems by relocating to Mars. I completely disagree with Musk and with my late colleague Stephen Hawking on that, because dealing with climate change on Earth is a doddle compared with terraforming Mars. Do you think we should be concerned about artificial intelligence?I don’t worry yet about a general intelligence that invades the internet of things and takes over the world – that still seems to be science fiction. But AI and robotics are affecting the labour market and lots of jobs will be replaced or supplemented by AI. These will include work in call centres and warehouses. But that would be good news if the people displaced could find work where the human element is crucial, such as caring for the old, the young and the vulnerable. There are too few such jobs now and they’re insecure and poorly paid. Those who employ robots need to be taxed and that funding should be used to set up huge numbers of dignified and secure jobs of the kind a humane society needs.Lord Rees is speaking at HowTheLightGetsIn London which takes place on 21 and 22 September at Kenwood House, north-west London.

Other common terms included “ladiesgentleman of a certain age”.Carol Vorderman, who worked with SunLife on the research, said: “The report shows that we’re bombarded with phrases and behaviours which imply that life after 50 must be awful and that it’s ‘downhill all the way’. That just isn’t true, but this nonsensical school of thought will continue unless we raise the profile of the impact this type of language can have.”Everyday ageism is increasingly of concern to mental health experts, with evidence that it can impact people’s mental health, hasten the onset of dementia and even shorten their life expectancy.Vorderman said: “For more than two-thirds of those who are over 50 to feel badly affected by casual ageism is unacceptable. This is one of the final taboos to smash through.“Life after 50 is a great kind of different,” she added. “It can be the best time of all: less stressful, less competitive, freer, happier, more joyful. Life at any age is there to embrace, so it’s time we stopped using ageist language, intentional or not.”Emma Twyning at the Centre for Ageing Better welcomed the report: “These subtle but damaging messages are everywhere, from the TV shows we watch featuring “doddery but dear” characters and the “anti-ageing” face creams we buy, to the constant media reports about the “burden” of our ageing population,” she said. “The evidence suggests that this ageist societal narrative negatively impacts on our personal experiences of ageing and perhaps even our health and wellbeing.”Caroline Abrahams, charity director of Age UK, said: “Ageism must become as unacceptable as every other form of discrimination.” Shelley Hopkinson, public affairs manager at Independent Age, agreed, adding:“part of the problem is that people often don’t even realise that the language they’re using can be ageist or cause offence”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d19df985060b01b2aa77af69e64d0686de3432ab/0_52_5166_3100/master/5166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4c61a12dddafe4eb697a446fdf0307b","title":"helping nine year old eating disorder recovery podcast","story":"We hear about the importance of early intervention in rare cases of pre-teen eating disorders.

Moments after Dina Asher-Smith finished second to Shaunae Miller-Uibo in a world-class 200m at the Birmingham Diamond League she received some golden news – the brilliant Miller-Uibo, who has not lost since 2017, would be running only the 400m at next month’s world championships rather than doubling up over 200m and 400m.It means that Asher-Smith, along with Jamaica’s Elaine Thompson, will surely be the one to beat over 200m in Doha. However, the 23-year-old Briton is keen to play down expectations.“My coach always says we don’t run on paper – which obviously isn’t funny, it’s a dad joke, but it is very true,” she said. “I ran well here, great, but where does that put me for the world champs? It doesn’t really mean anything with the greatest respect because at the end of the day it is what happens in Qatar that matters.”That is certainly true. But Asher-Smith knows she is both a major championship performer, having won three gold medals at the Europeans last year, and in good form having gone beneath 11 seconds in all four of her races over 100m and won two of her four 200m races in the Diamond League this year.This time, however, she had to play second fiddle to Miller-Uibo. It probably did not help that conditions were far from ideal. The wind swirled, the rain spat and the temperatures were more mid-May than mid-August. But Asher-Smith ran a storming bend only to be reeled in over the last 20 metres by the impressive Miller-Uibo, who thundered home in 22.24 to win by 0.12sec.Behind them were an impressive roll call of stars – including Jamaica’s Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, the winner of two Olympic 100m gold medals, in third and Dafne Schippers of the Netherlands, the double world champion at 200m, in fourth.“This was like an Olympic or world final, so it would have been a silver,” said Asher-Smith. “It was fantastic to be able to run against this class at home.”Certainly Miller-Uibo believes the Briton is the one to beat over 200m in Doha now she is no longer part of the picture. “She’s doing extremely well,” she said. “I think it’s going to be her time. I’m really excited for her. She’s definitely stepping it up.”However, the brilliant Bahamian admitted she was frustrated not to be able to double up in Doha after the IAAF refused her request to shape the schedule in a way that would let her do both events – something they have done in the past for Michael Johnson and Wayde van Niekerk, among others.“We’ve decided I’ll do only the 400m in Doha,” she said. “The schedule just wouldn’t allow both. The semis are on the same day. That made it impossible. I asked the IAAF two years ago but things didn’t change. We just had to live with it and move on. We’re asking for Tokyo now.”Katarina Johnson-Thompson, another major British medal chance at the world championships, also showed impressive form with a long jump of 6.85m – her best for four years – as she finished third.However, her great heptathlon rival, Nafi Thiam, the Olympic and world champion, once again proved her superiority as she smashed her personal best by 20cm with a jump of 6.86m to win the event by one centimetre from Serbia’s Ivana Spanovic and Johnson-Thompson.“I haven’t jumped that far in a long time so I’m really happy with that showing,” said Johnson-Thompson. “I felt like there was more in there as well. It spurs me on going up against her in an inidual format like today.“I’m so happy because I’ve been saying for the past two years that my long jump needs to get back to what it was. Nafi’s stepped her game up as well, so I’m going to have to step up the javelin or something now.“I was a bit worried I might be a little bit burnt out but I feel so much more confident now about being in a good place come Doha.”Adam Gemili, whose career has been stop-start-stop in recent years due to a succession of injuries, hinted that the good times could be again around the corner as he finished second behind Yohan Blake in the 100m after both men clocked 10.07sec.“It wasn’t my best start but I’m just so happy to be healthy and back up running,” said Gemili. “It’s good to be in the mix with some of the best sprinters in the world.”Lynsey Sharp, another who has struggled to find her best form in recent seasons, also showed promise to finish second behind Ajeé Wilson in the women’s 800m in 2min 01.09sec – 0.3sec behind the American. “The last couple of years I’ve not been as close to Wilson and the other girls and I felt good coming off the last bend and being able to pick people off rather than being picked off,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85818e8e3f78da0daa483b4bde69eaea997cfe44/0_0_4211_2526/master/4211.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc6a6ef613a2653a7b51d71488c8150a","title":"earthlight prix morny 2000 guineas","story":"André Fabre has a live contender for the 2,000 Guineas, following a game success in the Prix Morny by Earthlight. It was a victory to cheer all of French racing, as it ends a run of summer Sundays when the biggest races had consistently been won by British or Irish raiders.The Morny had become a weak race for the home defence, with one French-trained winner in the previous 14 years, and Fabre has not had this trophy on his mantelpiece since the days of Zafonic, back in 1992.A strong raiding party, including three Royal Ascot winners, made the journey to Deauville but were sent away empty-handed as Earthlight stuck his head out and prevailed by a neck over Raffle Prize, with the rest well held.Fabre scoffed at a suggestion that the chestnut might prove to be a specialist sprinter. “He will go further, he will be a Guineas horse for sure,” the trainer said on Sky Sports Racing.As to which country’s Guineas that would be, Fabre added: “I would favour Newmarket.” Fabre has won the English Classic twice, with Zafonic and Pennekamp, but the most recent of those will be 25 years ago by the time the Guineas rolls around in May. Having been a 25-1 shot for the race this May, Earthlight is now down to 12-1 with most firms.Whether Newmarket is the right target for Earthlight is a subject that high-ranking figures at Godolphin may be kicking around this winter.After all, the same blue colours are carried by the 7-2 favourite Pinatubo, trained in the town by Charlie Appleby, and it might make more sense for the team to try winning two Classics rather than beating themselves on the Rowley Mile.But Fabre has no doubts about the quality of his unbeaten two-year-old and suggested Earthlight might make an exploratory trip to Newmarket for the Dewhurst in October, if he recovers in time from this outing. “He’s a top-class horse,” the trainer said.Less pleasure radiated from Mark Johnston, trainer of the runner-up, who said: “Second sucks, as always,” and pointed out that his horses have been second in four Group Ones this year. Raffle Prize is likely to run next in the Cheveley Park Stakes next month.British and Irish runners filled the next six places behind Earthlight, with Clive Cox’s Golden Horde third and Arizona in fourth, possibly unsuited by the soft ground.Frankie Dettori, who came up short on Raffle Prize, gained compensation half an hour later when landing the Prix Jean Romanet on Coronet. “She’s a wonderful filly, doesn’t know how to run a bad race. I love her so much,” the jockey said. John Gosden’s grey may run next on Champions Day before retiring to the paddocks.There was further British success on the support card when Hughie Morrison’s Marmelo won the Prix Kergorlay, a Group Two. “They may be lucky we’re not going to York with him,” Morrison said, surely a light-hearted allusion to the Lonsdale Stakes on Friday, when Straarius will be a hot favourite to gain his fourth win of the year and a £1m bonus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5122a292d597f421ded8122f8771d41d6e0afdb9/0_72_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2caae476f31a543fbcd641a2f7383452","title":"brutal jofra archer cricket ashes blows concussion england","story":"In the end it took an act of God to stop Jofra Archer. A thick bank of black cloud blew over the Grand Stand at a quarter-past-seven and in the twilight of Sunday night the umpires rightly decided that it was all of a sudden so dark that the Australian batsmen could not safely face him any more, if they ever could safely face him at all. Archer had already hit Marnus Labuschagne, Tim Paine and Matthew Wade earlier in the day, and that was in bright sunlight. So Archer slapped on his hat, turned his back from the crease, then strolled off to field at mid-on, despondent. Force majeure. Who knew there was a superior force out there?Archer bowled 44 overs in this match and by the time they were over he had proved himself the most lethal fast bowler in the world. On Sunday he cracked open the Australian second innings, had David Warner caught at slip, Usman Khawaja caught behind and, later in the day, removed Paine too. But it was not just the wickets. Archer has hit 19 batsmen in the body and head in the short time he has been playing international cricket. Right now he is averaging a strike every 10 overs or so. His bowling is a test not just for Australia’s batsman but for the way the game handles these blows, too.There is an old story about Australia’s coach, Justin Langer, from back in 2006. It was his 100th Test, a match against South Africa at the Wanderers in Johannesburg. Facing the very first ball of the first innings, Langer turned away from a bouncer from Makhaya Ntini that caught him smack on the back of his helmet. Langer retired hurt and in hospital later that day he was diagnosed with a concussion and warned he would not be able to bat again in the match. One doctor even said that another blow to the head could be fatal. Langer spent the next three days in the hotel, feeling sick and sorry for himself.On the fifth day Langer decided he was well enough to travel in. Australia were 248 for six at the start of play and needed another 45 runs to win. By the time the last pair came together they were still 18 away. It was then that their captain, Ricky Ponting, came in from the balcony and found Langer, in his whites, with his pads, helmet and arm-guard on, running laps round the dressing room. “There’s no way I’m letting you do it,” Ponting told him. Langer insisted: “I’ll be all right.” They went back and forth, until Ponting finally told him he would forfeit the match rather than let him bat. In the end Brett Lee and Michael Kasprowicz won them the game anyway, so no one will ever know how it would have played out.That story came to mind again late on Saturday night, in that 10-minute spell when Steve Smith was back in the Australian dressing room at Lord’s, 80 not out and insisting he was ready to go back in. “We asked him over and over again,” Langer said that evening. “I asked him behind closed doors two or three and times and in front of the group. What else do you do?” Of course Smith wanted to go back in. Any good Australian batsman would. They grow up on stories about Dean Jones batting in the heat in Chennai, Steve Waugh scoring a century on one leg and, yes, Langer ignoring the doctors’ warning at the Wanderers.This time Smith woke up with a headache, feeling dizzy, dozy and in a fog. The night before, when he resumed his innings, he had batted as if he was lost in one, too. He started with a yahoo over mid-wicket against his very first ball back, bowled by Chris Woakes, who beat him, in his very next over, on the inside and outside, before dismissing him lbw, leaving a ball that went straight on.Cricket is still figuring out how best to handle all this. The Langer story shows the game has come a long way in a short time. But it may still have further to go. Those new protocols will need to be continuously monitored, just like Smith’s injury was. One clear change the ICC should make is to bring in independent match-day doctors at all internationals, men and women who can make the decision about whether or not a player is fit to resume batting. Australia’s doctor, Richard Saw, seemed to handle this incident very well according to the protocols but so long as he is an employee of the team there is always going to be uncomfortable conflict of interest there, too.Beyond that there is a wider problem to work on, one that everyone who loves the game needs to address. Right now all of us players, fans and pundits are conditioned to think the admirable thing to do after being hit on the head is to carry on batting. We are still applauding players for their bravery when we ought to be chastising them for their foolishness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9503336c860fe519293fc16bde1d9f9dbf9a4834/3032_1503_2483_1490/master/2483.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=399e7febd792da702d125652924b9751","title":"before the revolution review edinburgh 2019","story":"Summerhall, EdinburghAhmed El Attar’s bruising two-hander es into the long lead-up to 2011 in an attempt to determine what causes mass revoltWhat causes a people to rise up? Is it a simple trigger or a complex web of reasons? Where news reports prefer an easy cause-and-effect narrative, the reality is less straightforward.That’s the thinking behind Ahmed El Attar’s bruising two-hander. His own production for Cairo’s Temple theatre company is a theatrical collage that gives an impressionistic account of the driving forces behind Egypt’s revolution of 2011. He uses a striking visual metaphor: dressed in white, actors Ramsi Lehner and Nanda Mohammad stand stock still for the play’s 40-minute duration, staring straight ahead with a look somewhere between caution and terror. They are well advised to be alarmed around their feet is a bed of nails, leaving no room for ergence, no chance of stepping out of line. Charlie Aström’s lighting glows bright – then brighter still.Exacerbating their discomfort is Hassan Khan’s punishing score, a percussive barrage of beats and blips with an unsettlingly wavering time signature. You don’t imagine there’d be much demand for a soundtrack CD.Over this, Lehner and Mohammad race through a sequence of apparently unrelated passages. They give matter-of-fact accounts of terrorist atrocities, political assassinations and fatal accidents in the two decades before 2011. They run through the plots from soap operas broadcast during Ramadan involving pretty nurses and handsome pilots. There are scenes of domestic rows and workplace sexual abuse. We get football chants, religious prayers and jokes about President Mubarak, coming at the end like the release of air from a pressure cooker.It is the accumulation of violence, cover-ups and oppression, the playwright seems to say, that makes people hunger for change and take to the streets."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6b29b4e8aa508d14a02c6f0b7e24a05cd6b8633/1098_113_4543_2726/master/4543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d7176e3725f8f07be66dec193f36067","title":"since u been gone review edinburgh 2019","story":"Assembly Roxy, EdinburghTeddy Lamb untangles the difficulties of relationships in a bold monologue that is bursting with loveThe ache of lost time is contained in this delicate monologue grappling with grief and gender. With simple stagecraft and raw storytelling, Teddy Lamb’s Since U Been Gone is about the people who make us, and how they continue to do so long after they’re gone.Lamb addresses the audience as if we are their best friend – not a generic one but the one they lost several years ago. They catch us up on news mental health, America’s Next Top Model, pronouns. They turn over the script of grief, battle through regret and emerge after an hour, a bit broken but somehow fuller, prouder, shining. Nicol Parkinson shimmers on guitar throughout, producing tender synth-pop chords and humorous twangs to match the tone of the performance.Lamb articulates the thorny side of friendship – how we let each other down no matter how much we care, and how the pressure of being someone’s life support can sometimes be too much. Running alongside this thread of friendship is one of identity, as Lamb grows into their newfound confidence as trans non-binary. While these new pronouns fit like a glove, they say it is like growing up all over again, and without their best friend, this time they have to do it alone.However tough its subject matter, Since U Been Gone is buoyant, as theatre becomes a place of exploration, distraction and safety. Lamb bursts with charisma and generosity, with the occasional snarky aside only adding to their charm. The piece takes a while to find its feet and some transitions are clunky, but it is bold, honest and swollen with love. As the opening chords of Kelly Clarkson start to play, the audience – cheeks scrubbed raw from tears – leave with the pang of wanting to call a friend who can no longer pick up the phone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad1030b09e3727e95f9eae2dc0ea9a835aa6ffb8/0_0_5760_3840/master/5760.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8aefc9d7ba98ebf600b6a3614e48c578 1440w","title":"manchester city face calls to reconsider facial recognition tech","story":"Campaigners say scanning faces as alternative to tickets would be intrusiveManchester City have been cautioned against the introduction of facial recognition technology, which a civil rights group says would risk “normalising a mass surveillance tool”.The reigning Premier League champions are considering introducing technology allowing fans to get into the Etihad Stadium more quickly by showing their faces instead of tickets, according to the Sunday Times.If someone is recognised as having bought a ticket, they would be ushered in by a green light, and if not they would be halted with a yellow one.Hannah Couchman, the policy and campaigns officer at Liberty, said: “This is a disturbing move by Manchester City, subjecting football fans to an intrusive scan, much like taking a fingerprint, just so they can go to the Saturday game. “It’s alarming that fans will be sharing deeply sensitive personal information with a private company that boasts about collecting and sharing data on each person that walks through the gate, and using this to deny people entry. Manchester City should urgently reconsider their involvement in normalising a mass surveillance tool which can track and monitor us as we go about our everyday lives.”Blink Identity, a Texas-based facial recognition company, says its technology can identify people walking at regular speed, so fans will not need to slow down to show a ticket or use a turnstile.To opt in, supporters would need to register a selfie taken on their phone. Blink Identity says it is also possible to “collect usable and sharable data” on every person that walks through its facial scanning software.The team behind Blink Identity have spent the last decade creating large-scale biometric identification systems in the Middle East for the US Department of Defense, according to its website. Last year Live Nation, the company that owns Ticketmaster, announced investment in Blink Identity as part of plans to replace paper tickets with facial recognition.A source at Manchester City said reports of a pilot facial recognition scheme were premature andthere was no such plan in place. They said the club would always be “open to exploring new and appropriate technologies and systems to improve fans’ experience at the stadium”.Amanda Jacks, a caseworker at the Football Supporters’ Association (FSA), an organisation that represents football fans, said she shared the concerns of civil liberties organisations regarding the necessity for facial recognition technology. She saidthe FSA would be monitoring how it was used.“Given fans will still have to be searched before entering any stadium, and the technology is apparently only fractionally faster that electronic card readers, it’s difficult to see how this is genuinely an improvement on the current system,” Jacks said. “Notably, and to the best of our knowledge, there is no formal guidance from the Premier League or Sports Ground Safety Authority on the use of this technology.”Privacy campaigners have recently warned of an “epidemic” of facial recognition use in private spaces around the UK. An investigation by Big Brother Watch, which tracks the use of surveillance, found that property developers, shopping centres, museums, conference centres and casinos were using the technology.The Observer reported that some police forces were pushing back at Home Office proposals to introduce facial recognition schemes.Last week the information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, announced an investigation into the use of facial recognition in a new shopping development in Kings Cross, central London, and last month the parliamentary science and technology committee said authorities should halt trials of facial recognition technology until a legal framework was established."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d78c9820f7887e5906f7ee020bc9b7c0626b915/357_90_2648_1589/master/2648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19e7cb6a536122df55d4bbb302eb51be","title":"when chase is on his computer he feels like any other nine year old","story":"Nikki Hunter-Pike explains how accessibility technology has opened up the online world to her son, who has cerebral palsyIt’s Saturday morning at Nikki Hunter-Pike’s home. While she prepares breakfast, and her husband Daniel plays with their daughters Brooke and Harper, her son Chase is engrossed in sending an email to his beloved stepgrandfather, “Pops”, his face a study in intense concentration.Nine-year-old Chase, who has the neurological condition cerebral palsy, cannot walk, talk, feed himself or pick up a pen. Yet, thanks to technology that’s widely available, he can communicate, learn and explore the online world from his family’s home in Northfleet, Kent.On his computer, “Chase uses the on-screen keyboard (OSK) tool, because he doesn’t have the fine motor skills to type on a keyboard,” says Nikki. Running on Windows 10, “it displays a visual keyboard with all the standard keys. Using a joystick that he can control with just his thumb, once he switches on the OSK, he can do everything from browse the internet to search for videos on YouTube and write emails. We introduced him to it when he was six and it really has been life-changing for him.“Because he can’t speak or type messages on a phone, being able to write emails to his friends and close family is so important to him – it helps him feel connected.“The keyboard also has a text prediction function, which suggests words for him as he types. It makes it quicker for him, and, because he has learning difficulties too, it helps him with his spelling.“When I see him on his computer, and how its technology empowers him, it fills me with confidence that as he grows up he’ll be able to lead a fulfilling, independent life. That is all I’ve ever wanted for him.”Nikki’s hopes for her son are mirrored by Microsoft’s mission to empower every person through building inclusivity into technology, such as the Windows 10 operating system, which supports the OSK and its Office 365 suite.After a normal, healthy pregnancy, Nikki says she was devastated when Chase was born with brain damage, having been deprived of oxygen during her labour.“The hardest part was the uncertainty. No one knew how severe his level of disability would be, and for the first few years of his life it felt like I was living in limbo watching and waiting to see what milestones he would reach, or not,” says Nikki.“He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was nine months old, but it wasn’t until he was around three that the full extent of his disability was clear. He’s never spoken, he can’t stand unaided, and he suffers from almost constant involuntary movements of his limbs. His reading ability is closer to that of a five-year-old. He’s also incredibly loving, with a wonderful sense of humour and a very determined personality.”While Chase uses an electric wheelchair and requires round-the-clock care, Nikki says technology gives him the independence he craves.“He’s well aware his siblings and other children don’t need the same help he does. But when he’s on his computer, he feels like any other nine-year-old, because he’s in control and he doesn’t need any assistance,” says Nikki. “That means so much to him and it’s vital for his self-confidence.“I see how he puffs up with pride when he shows his little sisters, who are five and three, something he’s discovered online – his current obsession is looking at locations around the world on Google Maps. It gives him the chance to be the big brother and take the lead.”A keen gamer too, Chase uses his Microsoft adaptive controller to access his Xbox console.“We all game together as a family. It can be stressful going out because of the challenges Chase can face with poor disability access and toilet facilities. Sometimes it’s just nice to stay at home and have a relaxed afternoon gaming and cuddling up on the sofa.”Summing up how much the technology means to her son, Nikki says: “It’s no exaggeration to say Chase’s computer is his window to the world. I can’t imagine his life without it and I’m thankful he was born at a time when technology like this exists.“It’s so important to him and, thanks to its emphasis on inclusivity, it’s the one part of his life in which he can be completely independent.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

He tells  Lucy Jolin about how he started his travel blogging business with The Deaf Traveller, and the tech that helps himTravel blogger Ed Rex has had plenty of memorable moments in his career to date, from snorkelling in Fiji to marvelling at the Iguazu Falls on the border of Brazil and Argentina. But one of the most memorable was when he accidentally signed up for a job at a nudist resort in Australia.“The plan was to work at resorts in return for bed and breakfast,” he says with a grin. “The resort sent me a nice email saying they were looking forward to me coming and would pick me up – and by the way, we’re nudists: is that OK with you? And I had to be nude as well. That was a challenge! I’ve certainly never done naked gardening in the UK ...”Rex was born deaf, but he’s never let that stand in the way of his determination to experience life to the full. He studied environmental biology and science at the University of Leeds and worked in the sector for several years before jacking in his job to see the world.“I’d always had a love of travel but I didn’t have anyone to travel with, and I didn’t have the confidence to travel on my own,” he says. “Then, just before I left my last job, I had an operation to insert a cochlear implant into my right ear, as the hearing in that ear had gone completely. I was struggling to be involved in social situations, and feeling pretty down.”While the operation isn’t the preferred choice for all, for Rex it made a huge difference. “I was a completely different person,” he says. “Suddenly, I had so much confidence. So off I went, around the world. That was the start of the travel blogging, too. I realised I had a love of storytelling.”Rex charts all his travels on his blog, rexyedventures (strapline: “Adventures of a handsome backpacker travelling the unexpected”), which quickly caught the attention of major brands, including KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, MyDestination and Hotel.info. These days he’s a well-known figure on the travel blogger scene. He’s often asked to go on trips and to review accommodation and experiences – recent adventures include quad biking in Australia and two weeks in South Africa. And he’s written widely about his experiences as a deaf traveller too, on rexyedventures and his Deaf Traveller blog.There have been challenges, of course, as well as some some odd attitudes. “I remember one Australian guy saying: ‘Can I catch deafness from you?’ which was bizarre! I took out my hearing aid, which I use for my left ear, and said: ‘Quick, quick, the germs are on the loose!’ But most of the time, it’s fine. Sometimes people have questions but they are afraid to ask, so you have to start the conversation yourself. For me, deafness is not a taboo subject and you can make fun of yourself. It’s part of who you are.”But odd attitudes like the earlier one are rare, he points out. “Most of the time it’s just about looking after yourself and making sure you’re not in a situation where you could be vulnerable. I’ve always felt quite safe. And if something happens – like being dropped off by a bus in Thailand in the middle of nowhere – it’s fine if you don’t lose your cool and get stressed.”Rex is a keen user and advocate of better accessibility tech – he’s passionate about the need to get British transport right, particularly train companies that still use tannoys to make announcements. He’s pleased that Microsoft’s most recent software is taking steps in the right direction.“I particularly like the visual notification feature, which sets the screen to flash, rather than making a sound, and the accessibility checker on Word, Excel and Powerpoint,” he says. “Subtitling is great: it’s a massive thing to be able to turn on subtitles in Powerpoint,” he says, adding that it gets better every time you use it.“You can get subtitles for every video on the web, too. And I’ve used Skype for yonks, but I never realised before that you can turn on subtitles for every single Skype call, and you can download the transcript at the end of it. That’s so good for business meetings.”In the future, Rex is looking forward to more trips and continuing to use his platform to inspire others and break down stereotypes, particularly among young people.“Deafness is associated with people who are old! But there are so many deaf kids who don’t have any role models. And there’s a wide spectrum of deafness, too: people who use sign language, people who have mild hearing loss and so on. I want to say: you can do this. If I can do it, you can do it. It’s all about standing up and believing in yourself,” he says.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Computer software is essential to her dual career, writes  Sue George“Teaching yoga, hosting yoga brunch events and doing a full-time finance contract is pretty tiring,” says Jemma Ralston, “but it is so exciting because I am in control. All these things I am choosing to do. Yoga is my passion.”Ralston teaches ashtanga vinyasa yoga in classes across London and – alongside her new yoga business – she also works as an accountant.Ralston has a condition called Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) that leads to problems with blood clotting, causing easy bruising and prolonged bleeding. It also involves nystagmus – uncontrolled eye movements, leading to reduced vision and depth perception.After university in Glasgow, Ralston went to work in Jersey on a graduate training scheme. “I was thrown in at the deep end,” she says. “Being a trainee auditor and visually impaired wasn’t easy. A lot of my work was going through papers with a red pen.” She had to pass some tough accountancy exams. “Things take me longer to read than they might for a person with 20-20 vision. Yes, things were sometimes tough. But not that bad,” she laughs.While she was working in Jersey, Ralston started yoga classes and immediately felt the impact on her stress levels and long-term anxiety. “I felt at home. As someone who grew up with a few physical ailments, I thought: ‘I can do this! I feel relaxed!’ I understand what the instructor is telling me and I can listen to my body.”Three years later, she was working in London as a senior-level accountant at a large corporation. After a painful relationship breakup, she travelled on her own to Thailand, where she practised yoga every day for a month. “From then on, I knew I was going to be a yoga teacher. I didn’t know when. I had a successful job in the City and had worked very hard. But I knew I would when the time was right.”That time came three years ago. Her father was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and she had an incident with her blood condition where she went into cardiac arrest. “That was when I made the decision. A couple of days later, I booked my teacher training,” she says.She qualified in October 2017 and left her full-time City job three months later. Ralston began teaching classes all over London, soon deciding the best plan was to be a contractor in the finance sector while she established her yoga business.Her corporate background is a good complement to her yoga business. “Yoga teachers don’t do it for the money – we do it because we love teaching. But I would like to find a way where I can teach and live a comfortable life. I think my knowledge of finance and business models will help me on that journey.”As soon as she starts a contract in a new office, Ralston sets up Ease of Access Center in Windows 10. “I tend to ‘lose’ the mouse cursor, and the larger the monitor, the more space there is to lose it in. I make the mouse cursor bigger so I can follow it,” she says. Ease of Access options also allow her to use the Narrator function, meaning that she can hear audio descriptions of elements on the screen, something she may need if her sight deteriorates.The Ease of Access Center enables Ralston to increase the size of, and contrast within, documents. Working with spreadsheets for her own business, or with financial modelling for clients, she uses Excel and changes the text to be white on a black background. She also finds the search function helpful, rather than having to look through documents for particular figures.Right now, she has yoga brunch events to organise, and technology can help with that. “When I am on the computer for a long time, I use the Magnifier tool because my eyes get tired, especially for things like proofreading,” she says. “It’s about independence. These things are here to help everyone.“I can accept my body as not perfect – but no one’s is,” she continues. “We all have our limitations and have things we can excel at. It’s about appreciating what you can do.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Sue George finds out howLike many teenagers, Ella Warren-Roberts, 14, is very creative. She makes slate jewellery, she does woodcutting, and paints in watercolours. “She always has more than one project on the go,” says her proud mother, Glenda Roberts. “And she always completes them.”“So I don’t get too stressed out on one thing, I can relax by doing another,” says Ella. This lively, cheerful teenager also really likes science but, until recently, she wasn’t able to shine at it. She struggled reading science questions and her work took too long. But now, she is third in her year at chemistry.Ella is a day pupil, and Glenda is a teacher, at St David’s college, an independent boarding and day school in north Wales for children aged nine to 19. The school prides itself on teaching mixed classes, where pupils with additional learning needs, and those with none, work together to reach their full potential. Many of the pupils, like Ella, have dyslexia, and teachers, such as Glenda, have been trained at Bangor University to work with dyslexic learners. Some teachers bring their dogs to work, which pupils – including Ella – find very calming. “I have anxiety, and animals really help me. They aren’t judgemental,” she says.Using a computer for her schoolwork has also played a part in reducing Ella’s anxiety – which came about because it took her longer than others to complete certain tasks. “It made me feel more stupid than anyone else,” she says firmly. But now she realises that she isn’t stupid and her past problems with reading and writing have eased greatly.The apps and programs available with Office 365 allow this to happen smoothly. For instance, the school has a OneNote account used by both pupils and teachers. OneNote is a collaborative digital notebook that can be typed into, drawn or written on, and visual or audio clips can be added to it. Teachers use it to compile worksheets pupils then work on them online.Glenda points to the Microsoft Edge immersive reader, part of Microsoft’s learning tools, and the assistance this tool can give learners across a range of programs, including OneNote and Word. For instance, it can highlight words or sentences, or split inidual words into their component syllables – something that can also help anyone learning in an additional language.Ella uses it to change the background colour on her screen: she finds it easier to read on a sepia tone, where there is no glare. Previously, she relied on teachers printing worksheets on coloured paper. Then there is the choice of fonts. She can immediately choose a font she finds legible. “I used to be behind everyone else, but now I’m on target,” she says.For Glenda, Microsoft programs have also been a big help. Last year, she was away from work for nine months after being diagnosed with endometrial cancer. “I was in dire straits,” she says. “They gave me three months to live.” She is currently on the anti-cancer drug Avastin and is still going to the Christie hospital in Manchester for treatment.OneNote helped her feel less isolated when she was off work, and even in hospital the apps on her phone helped her keep track of how her pupils were getting on. “I might be part-time, but I am invested,” she says confidently.Using the Microsoft Teams platform, she was able to see what they were learning and could make comments to help their teachers.Both Glenda and Ella are physically active, doing the Race for Life 5k together. They live in an area where outdoor activities are popular people come to the family’s Airbnb to enjoy the nearby mountaineering. Her school also gives Ella the opportunity to enjoy another of her hobbies: wakeboarding. This sport is similar to waterskiing, but with one board instead of two skis. Ella describes it as “like snowboarding, if the snow had melted”.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops, whatever your need.

Ross is at the bottom of an empty well! With Ned hanged and Demelza distracted by the stealing of the ore, who will save him now? Although perhaps a more realistic question is: how much more fake jeopardy can our blood pressure take, ‘Darkers? I don’t know if I can stand much more of this. Which is just as well, as there are only two episodes to go.There has been a tension this series between what’s going on (the plot) and what we really care about (the characters). Most of the plot has been about the characters we care about the least. This came to a head in this tricky outing. The trouble with the Ned storyline is that no one apart from Ross likes Ned. We don’t give a fig if falsehood and tyranny are vanquished we just want Ross and Demelza to be happy. Plus, Ned was so evidently set up that there was no point resisting in the first place. And the bit with the pardon-that-wasn’t-a-pardon was pointless melodrama. “Oh, good, you’re just going to hang me and not disembowel and behead me. Thanks, prime minister.”The trial scene was entertaining, especially when Ross took to the stand. Do not disrespect Ned, he argued. He has always been in service to the crown! He has dug ditches! He has done the full Joe Wicks programme in prison to keep himself trim for his celebratory exit gavotte! Set him free! I’m not sure you’d want Dr Enys telling everyone that you’re probably not guilty, you’re just brain-damaged. But never mind. The judge’s sentence was shocking, especially in view of the jury expressly asking for mercy. It was almost as if it was a setup, paid for by Sir Evil George and the slave traders …Of course Ross was always going to break Ned out of jail. With Ned disguised as Benny from Crossroads, this was one of the noisiest and least discreet prison breaks ever. And in the middle of it, Ned – already extremely annoying – decided he definitely didn’t want to get into a sewer and escape anyway. “Leave me here, and go finish what I could not.” No idea how Ross managed to do a reverse prison break without punching Ned.I wondered, too, about Sir Evil George’s cruelty towards Geoffrey Charles. After all, he is Elizabeth’s son. And unlike some of the other young people in Sir Evil George’s life, he is clearly not Ross’s son. No matter. Geoffrey Charles gave as good as he got, emboldened by his witch-finder general’s hat. “Her heart belonged to one man only. And it wasn’t my father and it wasn’t you.” (Yes! It was Ross Poldark!) And then we had this zinger of an exchange: “I gave myself body and soul to Geoffrey Charles.” “So if you wed her, you will always wonder … Is your first child mine or yours?” Holy moly! For once I felt sorry for Cary Warleggan who must be exhausted with all these shenanigans, especially at his age. He’s right, of course: we definitely need considerably more pliable females.In Cornwall Jacka was busy stealing sacks of rocks or similar. I wasn’t sure they would do the smuggling in broad daylight, or that Demelza with her flaming red hair would spy on them in broad daylight. Again: better not to think too much about these things. In happy news, there was quite a bit of Prudie in this episode. In even happier news, Morwenna has finally let Drake near her. “If it were up to I, I would never leave this bed.” All we need now is for Tess and Sir Evil George to replace Ross in the well, Rosina to marry Sam and Kitty to have her lovely baby. I am sure this can be managed in two episodes.“Dr Enys will do whatever is required.” “Caroline, are you mad?” I love the double act of Dr Enys and Sindy Doll, with or without Horace the Pug. A great partnership built by two brilliant actors (Luke Norris as the good doctor and Gabriella Wilde as Caroline Enys nee Penvenen). We really aren’t seeing enough of them this series. But in the moments where they intervene, they light up the screen. And Dr Enys seems able to carry the anachronistic elements more convincingly than any other character. (“Guys, have you heard of mental health? It’s, like, really important to be compassionate towards the patient. Step away from the leeches.”) I’ve missed the interplay between Demelza and Caroline this season too. But ‘e cannot have everything.A special mention must go to their corpulent sidekick.

What kind of actor gets tasked with simulating throwing up in a pub fireplace while playing a drunken, out-of-focus Mike Ashley at the denouement of a reconstructed corporate bonding bender? One who needs to change his agent, is my guess.In Sports Direct: Secrets of the Mega Sports Factory (Channel 5), there were multiple out-of-focus Mike Ashleys, like my worst nightmare, or like a knockoff Being John Malkovich with bad lenses.There was little Mike as a blurry teen, taking in the vista of his native Maidenhead. The voiceover told us he was lean, mean and had a beautiful dream of blowing off this yawnsome burg and making his first million. There was an older, thinner Mike playing out-of-focus squash, evoking the period when he tried and failed to become a squash professional. Instead, his parents lent him £10,000 to set up a sports shop, which today is a 500-shop empire filled with bargain basement kit supplied from a Derbyshire warehouse you could see from space.Thereafter, it was bald acting blurs with beer guts in ill-cut suits who interpreted Ashley. His business model initially involved buying up sports brands you thought dead – Lonsdale, Donnay – and shifting manufacturing operations to Asia, where the newer brands that had crushed them had already relocated, thus cutting labour costs and making them profitable anew. The idea was that customers would get suckered into Sports Direct by promises of Adidas, Nike and Puma, then have a nostalgic pang over an old brand that had been reborn at knockdown prices.This ingenious business model explains why on so many Sunday afternoons, you might find yourself queueing with a Slazenger racquet, Lonsdale sports bra and Karrimor jockstrap when you only came in for discount trainer socks. Then, underpaid till staff would inquire if you would like to buy a bag for your sports tat and charge you £1 for a pint-sized Sports Direct mug to add to the horror show. Social media memes of this huge mug thrived, some joking it was so big that if upended, it would cause a flood. Hilarious. Who were the biggest mugs in succumbing to Britain’s charmless answer to Ryanair’s Michael O’Leary, a man whose mission was to dress increasingly unfit-for-purpose Britons in – be still, irony – sportswear? It was you, you fools! And, to a lesser extent, me!Channel 5 played footsie with this ripe idea of mugging off a nation by having an ident of a Sports Direct paddling pool deflating as we cut to commercials for no doubt equally pitiful consumer goods. Nice gag.We never heard from the Asian workers who keep Britons in lurid footie tops and ostensibly must-have flip-flops. Instead, we heard from the heroic undercover  reporter Simon Goodley, who blew the lid off the Derbyshire warehouse, exposing zero-hour contracts and Dickensian work practices. As staff left the satanic gulag at the end of their shifts, they were told to roll up trousers and turn down waistbands to make sure they hadn’t been amplifying their genitals with tubes of shuttlecocks. Staff were not paid during these humiliating searches, which meant – if you extrapolated – their already tiny remunerative packages often fell below minimum wage. Ashley played the ignorance card before MPs over such disgraces, grinning like an irresponsible foetus throughout.Curiouser than the actors were the talking-head industry watchers with implausible-sounding surnames and jobs, such as the shopping vlogger Megan Gamblin and the consumer journalist Harry Wallop. They explained, using obviously made-up words such as “athleisurewear”, how Ashley lost his Maidenhead and became a FTSE 100 player. They told how he bought up Newcastle United and eviscerated it (cut to a scarcely coherent Sun football reporter who, abducted – or so we must suppose – by the Toon Army cult at birth, told us how Ashley’s stewardship meant he didn’t believe in anything any more). Now Ashley is attempting the last of his barmy trifecta. That involves buying up failing high street stores – Debenhams, House of Fraser – and turning them around. He has failed with the former, and if he succeeds with the latter, Wallop will change his name to something even more unlikely.Meanwhile, he has a side bet: to transform Sports Direct into the Selfridges of sportswear, largely, Gamblin told us, by targeting women who wear makeup while working out, and who – understandably – want to run without their mascara running perpendicular to their forward motion. Good luck with that, laughing boy.When the real Ashley appeared in shot, it was inevitably a disappointment – a beached whale on the Baudrillardian desert of the real outperformed by his out-of-focus simulacra. But don’t feel sorry for him. It is those who played Ashley who really suffered. Their CVs are compromised by interpreting someone who typifies Britain’s industrial, sartorial and moral decline."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5c5773e40156fde3099748d76c85e139323ff4b/0_605_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cbc9fa1722fdf8477d1a22b7f5668ac","title":"tv tonight masterpiece documentary on assassination of lord mountbatten","story":"His killing by the IRA in 1979 is the focus of a moving and powerful documentary.

Torrential rain came down an hour into the rally, turning the park into a sea of umbrellas. At the same time, protesters walked towards Central, the heart of Hong Kong’s business district, and surrounded government headquarters.Police had turned down a plan for Sunday’s march submitted by the Civil Human Rights Front group and gave permission only for a rally in the park. Those defying the ban risked being charged with unlawful assembly, which can lead to up to five years in prison.“Stand with Hong Kong! Fight for freedom!” protesters shouted at the rally.Throughout the afternoon, streets around Victoria Park were so densely packed that the march frequently came to a complete standstill. Some protesters walked on to a flyover near the park as the crowds on the streets were unable to move.Protesters were orderly but burst into choruses of slogans as they waited to move forward. “Hong Kong people, go!”, “Reclaim Hong Kong, revolution of our era!” they chanted.Observers saw Sunday’s rally, the largest in weeks, as a test of the movement’s momentum and public support as tensions between police and protesters have escalated.“Even though the weather was so bad, even in the face of threats of the People’s Liberation Army and water cannons, Hong Kong people never back down,” said Wong, 21, a university student.Wong did not expect this to be the last major rally. “For as long as the government doesn’t respond, there will only be more large-scale protests.”US president Donald Trump said on Sunday he wanted to see the crisis resolved peacefully, warning against any hardline crackdown.“I think it’d be very hard to deal if they do violence, I mean, if it’s another Tiananmen Square,” Trump told reporters in New Jersey. “I think it’s a very hard thing to do if there’s violence.”Organisers of the rally, who estimated that 1.7 million people turned up at the park and in the nearby Causeway Bay and Tin Hau areas, said many more were unable to get there. Train services to the metro stations near the park were suspended intermittently throughout the day due to the huge numbers of people.The crowd was a mix of young protesters, families and elderly residents. Parents walked alongside small children.By early evening, protesters occupied a six-lane road outside the government in Admiralty, shining lasers at the building and the nearby People’s Liberation Army garrison and yelling insults at the police. After convoys of police vans were seen entering the government complex, protesters called for a retreat and the crowd gradually dispersed. A statement from the force late on Sunday condemned the protesters and accused them of paralysing traffic in the area.As protesters marched past the police headquarters, they chanted, “Return the eye!” referring to a recent incident in which a young woman’s eye was badly injured during the protests. Both the government and police headquarters were surrounded by giant water-filled barricades.In the early evening, a number of protesters ignored the organisers’ advice to leave after reaching Central and continued to march west towards the Chinese government’s liaison office, where previous protests have ended in violent clashes. Dozens of riot police officers armed with shields and guns were seen patrolling the area.Organisers insist that the Hong Kong government must stop using the police force to suppress them and respond to their five political demands, including the complete withdrawal of the now suspended extradition bill – under which iniduals can be sent to China for trial – the setting up of an independent body to investigate police violence, and universal suffrage (the free election of Hong Kong’s leaders).A late-night government statement said although the protests were peaceful, they caused inconvenience to the community. The statement said it was “most important” to restore social order and “the government will begin sincere dialogue with the public, mend social rifts and rebuild social harmony when everything has calmed down”.The Civil Human Rights Front had earlier called for a “peaceful, rational and non-violent” rally and online posts urged “self discipline and calmness” after 10 weeks of intensive protests, many of which have ended in violent clashes as police increasingly employed teargas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowds.“China is taking over Hong Kong. Our society has no justice and no future. We’re just making a last-ditch attempt to do something amid our despondency,” said Carol Lui, a teacher in her 30s. “Hong Kong is dying anyway, so we are just fighting to our last breath.”Hong Kong had its first teargas-free Saturday for weeks after three separate rallies took place in Kowloon. The marches this Saturday and Sunday marked the 11th weekend of protests in Hong Kong.Tensions reached a new level during the past week. Following last weekend’s violent clashes with police, protesters occupied Hong Kong’s airport. Over the past week, state media outlets have published videos showing armoured Chinese troop carriers purportedly driving into Shenzhen, the south-eastern state that borders Hong Kong.Chinese officials have also released a series of threatening statements about Hong Kong’s protesters, with one claiming “terrorism” was emerging in the city after flights were cancelled.Despite the call for peace on Sunday, some protesters have warned that the protests could turn violent again if the government continues to ignore their demands.“Violent escalation is an extreme measure … but if it is effective, we would continue, because we need to try all means to attract attention to our cause,” said a 25-year-old engineer wearing full protective gear who gave his surname as Fan.Janice Hui and Clea Skopeliti contributed to this article"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e653e365a4b8b1ae0f2bade1c7a5c30903b10062/0_105_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6c26bee09ccc7a7aea797f9d6d9bfff","title":"how a pan european picnic brought down the iron curtain hungarians austrians","story":"On 19 August 1989, Hungarians and Austrians gathered in friendship at the border, paving the way to unificationWhen the end finally came for the iron curtain, it was not bulldozers or hammers that struck one of the first decisive blows, but a picnic.Thirty years ago this Monday, on 19 August 1989, thousands of Hungarians and Austrians gathered at the border fence between the two countries, which also marked the iding line between the Communist bloc and the west. They had come for a “pan-European picnic” of solidarity and friendship across the iron curtain, as momentum for political change increased and the eastern bloc regimes struggled to keep up with rising popular discontent.They were joined by hundreds of East Germans who took the opportunity to rush across the border into Austria and from there to West Germany. Hungarian border guards declined to shoot, and in the subsequent weeks thousands more made the crossing. Three months later the Berlin Wall fell and the path to the end of communism in Europe and the continent’s unification was irreversible.On Monday the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, will travel to Sopron, a Hungarian town near the border, to mark the event together with Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán. Merkel, born in East Germany, has spoken repeatedly about the importance for her personally of the fall of the wall and the events leading up to it.Thirty years after the opening of the border and the tearing down of the fence, it is hard not to view the symbolism of the event through the lens of the present. Merkel has been outspoken against present-day walls, both real and metaphorical, using a Harvard University commencement address this year to call on people to “tear down walls of ignorance and narrow-mindedness”, a thinly veiled rebuke of Donald Trump’s politics.Orbán, meanwhile, is the European champion of modern-day walls, having built his popularity in Hungary on promising to keep refugees and migrants from Africa and the Middle East out of Europe. His government constructed a fence along the country’s southern border with Serbia after hundreds of thousands of people crossed Hungary in 2015, many of them with Merkel’s Germany as their final destination.Orbán’s media empire railed against Merkel’s decision in 2015 to extend a welcome to those fleeing war, and he has been the most extreme of the many anti-migration politicians in central Europe, warning of a Muslim “invasion” of Europe and calling for strongly guarded borders.It is a far cry from a declaration made at the time of the picnic, calling for “the demolition of barbed wires and cultural barriers raised by political chicanery” to achieve worldwide peace. But for the Hungarians who organised the picnic three decades ago, comparisons between the two border walls are misguided and offensive.“The iron curtain was built to imprison us, the fence in 2015 was built to protect us by a democratically elected government,” said László Nagy, of the Pan-European Picnic Foundation. He spoke of disappointment about the criticism of Orbán’s government from western Europe, and put it down to a patronising attitude among western Europeans, who he said had betrayed Hungary and other central European countries after the fall of communism and did not understand the region’s history.In a recent interview with a Hungarian magazine, László Magas, the main organiser of the picnic in Sopron and now a local councillor for Orbán’s Fidesz party, said that during trips to western Europe in the 1980s he had envied the tranquility and affluence of life, but he was now less impressed with life further west.He recalled a recent trip to France and Germany during which he had been horrified to encounter gender-neutral toilets and homosexual couples, and quoted German friends he stayed with, dismayed at the prospect of migrants from Africa being housed in their village: “You’re lucky to have a prime minister like Viktor Orbán!” they told him.Whatever people’s attitudes to today’s wave of people fleeing oppression, EU membership remains popular in Hungary, and there is no doubt that for a whole generation of Hungarians the events of August 1989 remain a defining memory on the path to liberation.“After the war we were closed in a box for decades. Opening the border gave us back the freedom we didn’t have for so long,” said Ditte Preznánszky, who was a 22-year-old languages student in Budapest in 1989, and travelled to the picnic on a bus arranged by a student summer camp she was attending.The Hungarian government of the time, which had taken steps to start dismantling parts of the border fence several months earlier, gave official blessing to the picnic, and thousands of Austrians came across the border to join the Hungarians for an afternoon of music and speeches. Pliers were handed out and people set about dismantling the fence, which until not long before had been electrified.“I had an uncle who escaped in 1956 and most of us knew the terrible things that had happened on the border, so it was very exciting to cut down the iron curtain,” said Preznánszky.The organisers insist they had not banked on the arrival of hundreds of East Germans, who were allowed to holiday in Hungary but not to travel to the west. Still, tipped off by West German diplomats in the country, several hundred travelled to Sopron and burst through the border gate and into Austria. The guards on duty decided not to shoot, and although the border crossing was resealed a day later, the tide had turned. Overcoming worries of how Moscow would react, Hungary’s government opened the border properly on 11 September and tens of thousands of East Germans passed through.Nowadays there is heavy traffic in both directions across the border. Sopron has found a niche in dental tourism, with Germans and Austrians travelling to the town to receive cut-price treatment, while thousands of Hungarians go the other way in search of higher salaries.The border post was removed when Hungary joined the European Union’s Schengen zone in 2007, but Austrian border guards reappeared in 2015 during the migration crisis and have remained in place. “They’re there, but they will only stop you if you’re brown. They’re racist but nobody cares, you in the west only care about harassing Hungary for being racist because we are the doormat of Europe,” said Nagy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/338682058472c7544b8ca1cb9296a320d194abe1/0_54_757_454/master/757.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f928fbe448e2162e9a3f814ad12e862","title":"un experts discover british made bomb parts in yemen","story":"Guidance unit for ‘high explosive bomb’ found at site in Yemen capitalA United Nations panel of experts has uncovered fragments of British-made laser guidance missile systems at an air raid site in Yemen in a strike that it concluded breached international humanitarian law.The attacks took place in September 2016, a month after the then foreign secretary Boris Johnson said he was content to allow the export of weapons systems to Saudi Arabia in the expectation they would be used in Yemen.A guidance unit for a “high explosive” bomb – stamped with the name of a Brighton based company, EDO MBM Technology Ltd – were found at the site in the Yemen capital Sana’a after four bombs were dropped on the site at 12.45am on 13 September.Missile parts from the same British factory – ultimately owned by the US arms supplier L3 Harris – were also found by the UN experts at the Alsonidar complex following a second air strike nine days later, where a water pump factory and a former tube maker were located.Though the UK has licensed at least £4.7bn of exports to Saudi Arabia since the country became embroiled in the war in Yemen, the UN documentation demonstrates that British technology has been deployed in a conflict where the Saudi-led coalition has been repeatedly accused of indiscriminate bombing.British arms sales to Saudi Arabia of equipment that could be deployed in Yemen were held to be unlawful in June by the court of appeal in London, because ministers had failed to conduct a proper impact assessment of the bombing on civilians.Dr Anna Stavrianakis, a senior lecturer in international relations at the University of Sussex, said the UN report showed that such an assessment could have taken place. “This revelation is a damning indictment of a policy that is reckless in its disregard for civilian harm.”At the time, a spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition said that warplanes had hit the Alsonidar plant because it “is now becoming a military manufacturing unit specialised in producing pipes Houthis use to assemble local-made missiles.”But reporting to the UN security council, the panel concluded “there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the factory complex had become a legitimate military objective” because there was no evidence that any hardware was manufactured on the site.The tube maker on the site had not been operational since 2014, and the panel said the only mitigating factor was that there were no casualties in the bombing because the attacks took place shortly after midnight.The UN accounts were made publicly available in January 2018, following the panel investigation, though they had remained largely unnoticed.Ministers have said they would appeal the ruling in the upreme court but the former international trade secretary, Liam Fox, told parliament that arms exports to Saudi Arabia would be suspended pending an official review.“The government’s emphasis on the diplomatic, strategic and economic benefits of arms sales are ringing increasingly hollow,” Stavrianakis said. “Its commitment to international law is repeatedly revealed to be superficial.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78e847cf79400d7e865798eab27ea87e21faed97/0_252_5401_3242/master/5401.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=638b9ea8966051e08f2c39047248553f","title":"austrian peoples party promises to ban far right identitarians","story":"Centre-right MPs say the policy must be part of any coalition agreement after September’s electionsAustria’s centre-right People’s party has said it will insist on the banning of the far-right Identitarian Movement as a condition of any coalition after parliamentary elections next month.Such a ban “must be in the next coalition agreement,” the People’s party (OeVP) parliamentary group leader August Woeginger said in a statement released to Austrian media.The Identitarian Movement (IBOe), previously best known for its anti-immigration stunts, sparked controversy in Austria earlier this year after it was revealed that its leader, Martin Sellner, allegedly received money and exchanged emails with the suspected perpetrator of gun attacks on mosques in New Zealand in March which left 51 people dead.The OeVP’s call for the movement to be banned comes as it tries to maintain its commanding poll lead ahead of parliamentary elections on 29 September while at the same time distancing itself from its former coalition partner, the far-right Freedom Party (FPOe).Austrian media reports have documented numerous links between Identitarian activists and FPOe party members.After the OeVP first floated possible moves against the Identitarians earlier this week, the FPOe’s former interior minister, Herbert Kickl, rejected the possibility of banning the IBOe, saying such a move would be “a deep attack on the rule of law”.Woeginger said in his statement that Kickl had become the Identitarians’ “principal patron saint”.The coalition between the OeVP and the FPOe was created in late 2017 but was dogged by frequent scandals over extremist statements by FPOe party members.The government collapsed in May after a video emerged of the then leader of the FPOe, Heinz-Christian Strache, appearing to offer public contracts to a fake Russian donor in return for campaign help for the FPOe.The scandal prompted Strache to resign as vice-chancellor and led then chancellor Sebastian Kurz to call fresh elections.Earlier this week Strache’s house was raided as part of another investigation into possible corruption offences surrounding the appointment of an FPOe official to a high-ranking position at a gambling corporation.Despite the scandals, and the recriminations that have flowed between the OeVP and the FPOe since their coalition collapsed, a fresh government composed of the two parties is seen as one of the most likely outcomes of September’s poll."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd156abe8dd0e98d18008dd2867c4539dc363716/0_117_5228_3138/master/5228.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec790f691a6857f12a1fc6ccc4fadd7a","title":"monday briefing brexit leak feeds no 10 blame game","story":"Dossier reveals fear of possible food shortages and unrest … Prince Andrew ‘appalled’ by Epstein abuse claims … and the year’s best jokeGood morning briefers. I’m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories you need to start the week.Downing Street insiders have accused pro-remain former ministers of leaking an official document predicting that a no-deal Brexit could lead to food shortages and chaos at ports in an effort to undermine Boris Johnson as he travels to meet European leaders this week. Sources in No 10 blamed former members of Theresa May’s government for releasing details of scenarios being looked at by Whitehall’s Operation Yellowhammer. They include a shortage of medicines, the return of a hard border in Ireland and the prospect of police intervention being needed to quell protests. Although Michael Gove, the cabinet minister in charge of post-Brexit planning, dismissed the details as “absolutely the worst case” scenarios, the leak will embarrass the prime minister ahead of his talks with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, on Wednesday and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, on Thursday. The leak comes as Jeremy Corbyn prepares to set out his pitch to voters ahead of a possible autumn election by accusing Johnson of being a “phoney outsider”. In a speech in Corby today, the Labour leader will promise to do “everything necessary to stop a disastrous no-deal Brexit” and lay the blame for Britain’s political paralysis at the door of the Tories. The prospect of Brexit could also be prompting a surge in homebuying, according to Rightmove, as people rush to complete purchases before the uncertainty of a possible exit on 31 October.Our columnist Matthew d’Ancona demands that the term “Project Fear” must be dropped from the political lexicon as the possibility of no deal becomes more likely and No 10 prepare to blame remainers for betraying the people. He writes: “We are in this predicament because of the serial dishonesty, manoeuvring and lust for power of those who insisted that leaving the EU would be easy.”Duke denials – Prince Andrew says he is “appalled” by the recent sex abuse claims surrounding his former friend Jeffrey Epstein. The Duke of York has been dogged by accusations of a lack of judgment about his friendship with the disgraced financier, who committed suicide in a New York prison last weekend. As fresh stories circulated about his relationship with Epstein, a statement released by Buckingham Palace last night said: “The Duke of York has been appalled by the recent reports of Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged crimes. His Royal Highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.”‘I won’t be intimidated’ –  columnist Owen Jones, who was attacked outside a pub on Saturday night, says he was targeted because of his leftwing views but vowed to continue speaking out. Jones was leaving a pub in Islington, north London in the early hours of Sunday morning when he was set upon by a group of men who knocked him to the ground and kicked him in the head. There was “no question that it was anything other than a targeted attack”, he said, adding that an emboldened, increasingly violent far right had been egged on by online “hate preachers” and parts of the media. But he vowed: “I’m not going to be intimidated. I’m not changing my politics.”Tanker sails – The Iranian tanker seized by Royal Marines off Gibraltar six weeks ago left the British territory last night for the Greek port of Kalamata with its £115m cargo of oil, according to shipping data. The Grace 1 – now renamed Adrian Darya 1 – has been at the centre of a diplomatic row between Britain and Iran after it was held on 4 July for suspected breach of EU sanctions. The news came hours after Gibraltar rejected a final US request to detain the tanker, which is filled with an estimated 2.1m barrels of oil.You must be joking – To add a bit of cheer to your Monday morning, the briefing brings you news of the officially decreed best gag of the Edinburgh fringe. The Swedish funster Olaf Falafel was the winner, receiving the Dave funniest joke of the fringe award for this joke: “I keep randomly shouting out ‘Broccoli’ and ‘Cauliflower’ – I think I might have Florets.” Runnerup was Richard Stott with: “Someone stole my antidepressants. Whoever they are, I hope they’re happy.” Third was Milton Jones’s attempt to extract some humour from the wreck of British politics: “What’s driving Brexit? From here it looks like it’s probably the Duke of Edinburgh.”Janey Godley has plotted a roundabout route to the top of standup comedy and as she prepares for a sold-out tour of Britain, she talks about how her tough upbringing and marriage into a criminal family forged her career. As a barmaid in one of Glasgow’s roughest pubs, Godley honed the comic timing and expert crowd control essential for a stand-up career. But it was still a shock for many people in the industry when she started performing at the age of 35. She says: “I spoke about my Ma being murdered, child abuse, gangsters. Back then, even comics were saying: ‘You shouldn’t talk about that.’ But I’m so glad I did.” Now her targets are more political, with Boris Johnson and Donald Trump bearing the brunt of her highly popular online political voiceovers.In the end it took an act of God to stop Jofra Archer.

Video: IFI Irish Film Archive  British Pathé\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn Irish soldier and an RUC officer share a joke at the original Irish Border in 1924. Still from Pathé, courtesy of the Irish Film InstituteThe original hard Border on the island of Ireland was imposed by the Irish Free State in 1923, and footage of it has now been digitised and put online.The British Pathé reel shows Irish Army soldiers and Royal Ulster Constabulary policemen joking and laughing with each other in 1924, but the film is introduced with a preamble that shows the Border was as hot a topic then as it is now.“The seat of all the trouble – first pictures from the much debated Ulster Border.”The footage is from an unnamed Border town and shows an RUC officer looking over into the Free State where the tricolour flies from the top of a castle turret.The film comes from the time between the imposition of customs posts by the Free State government and the findings of the Boundary Commission in 1925, which left the Border intact.Many nationalists on both sides of the Border had hoped the commission would transfer nationalist areas in the North to the Free State, but its report was leaked in advance and envisaged no such transfer.The footage has been acquired by the Irish Film Institute, and it and 34 other films from the early years of the Irish Free State have been put online.The Border was the most significant issue for Dublin’s colourful lord mayor Alfie Byrne, who served in the position between 1930 and 1939.In 1935 he declared in a rare recorded interview, in tones that could be repeated today, that the Border was a “festering sore which is a danger to our country and to England”.He declared that there were no animosities between British and Irish people before checking himself – “there are no serious animosities between the British and the Irish people”.“If we can get that Border removed by consent, and our people can settle down, I am satisfied it will be to the benefit of England and to our people in Ireland.”Slinging insultsByrne was critical of those who shouted the word “traitor” to people they disagreed with and he suggested that politicians would be better working together than slinging insults at each other.“This little country of ours cannot afford to keep two parliaments with two sets of officials going. I hope the day is not so far off when they will think of the unemployed and think of the future of the country regardless of what it means to themselves in their public positions.”It is the second release by the IFI of footage about Ireland that it acquired from British Pathé. A previous release focused on the decade of centenaries and the foundation of the State.IFI’s head of archive, Kassandra O’Connell, said the Border footage showed how little had changed in the last 75 years.“We are still grappling with the lack of understanding and the complexity of Ireland’s political situation.”She had assumed that British Pathé’s Irish footage had been digitised but subsequently found that it hadn’t and was in danger of being lost for ever.“The material is very old. It’s on nitrate. If we hadn’t done this now, the material wouldn’t be there in five or six years.”Other highlights of the collection include celebrations to mark the declaration of the Republic of Ireland in 1949, the inauguration of Douglas Hyde as the first president of Ireland in 1938 and footage documenting the lives of ordinary people in the country."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3989886.1566163299!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"up to 40 000 motorists with uk licences face being put off road","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTo exchange a licence drivers must complete an application form and present it along with a €55 fee and their UK licence at any of the 36 NDLS centres.  Photograph: Getty ImagesUp to 40,000 motorists in Ireland who are still driving with a UK licence are being warned they have just weeks to exchange it or face being put off the road in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Latest figures from the National Driver Licence Service (NDLS) show an almost five-fold rise in the number of UK driving licence holders switching to an Irish licence to date this year compared to previous years. Over the past five years less than 6,000 drivers on average swap out their UK licence for an Irish one every year. However, to date this year, more than 27,000 have been exchanged. Insurance Ireland – which represents insurers – estimated earlier this year that there were between 50,000 and 70,000 UK driving licence holders in Ireland. The Road Safety Authority (RSA), which operates the NDLS, said it believes that between 30,000 and 40,000 of these have yet to switch over to an Irish licence. Those who do not do so in the coming weeks face a driving ban if Britain crashes out of the EU on October 31st without a deal, according to the RSA. “There is an opportunity now to exchange your licence in good time and be certain you have a valid driving licence when the UK leaves the EU,” an RSA spokeswoman said. “If you wait until close to the UK exit date of October 31st you may face lengthy delays in exchanging a UK licence, and the NDLS cannot guarantee when you will have a valid licence to drive here in Ireland. For this reason those living in Ireland who hold a UK driving licence are strongly urged to act now and exchange their licence.” Original deadlineThe RSA said there were currently no delays in the processing of exchange applications, but that there were backlogs in March and April, around the date of the original deadline for Britain to leave the EU. Nearly 700 exchange applications were being made every day at the time. There are plans for extra staff at NDLS centres in October, but this may still “not be able to cater for demand if applicants leave it until the last minute”, the RSA spokeswoman said . To exchange a licence drivers must complete an application form and present it along with a €55 fee and their UK licence at any of the 36 NDLS centres around the country. Appointments can be made online at ndls.ie but there is also a walk-in service available at all centres.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Jon SuperReuters.Irish politicians have said a leaked report setting out British preparations for a hard Border in the event of a no-deal Brexit comes as no surprise.The documents, published by the Sunday Times, warn that the UK will be hit with a three-month “meltdown” at ports, a hard Irish border and shortages of food and medicine if it leaves the EU without a deal.The paper said the documents compiled this month by the Cabinet Office under the codename Operation Yellowhammer was marked “official-sensitive” requiring security clearance on a “need to know” basis.The documents said the UK government expects the return of a hard Border in Ireland as current plans to avoid widespread checks will prove “unsustainable” and this may spark protests, road blockages and “direct action”.It also says logjams caused by months of border delays could “affect fuel distribution” in the UK, that up to 85 per cent of lorries using the main Channel crossings “may not be ready” for French customs and could face delays of up to 2½ days and the availability of fresh food would be reduced and prices would rise.According to the documents, petrol import tariffs would also “inadvertently” lead to the closure of two oil refineries, while protests across the UK could “require significant amounts of police resources” in a no-deal scenario.They also warn that Gibraltar could face delays of up to four hours at the border with Spain for “at least a few months”A senior Whitehall source told the paper: “This is not Project Fear - this is the most realistic assessment of what the public face with no deal. These are likely, basic, reasonable scenarios - not the worst case.”Responding to the report, Sinn Féin’s deputy leader Michelle O’Neill said Ireland as a whole had been voicing these concerns for months.“These reports are no surprise to those of us on this side of the Irish Sea who have been voicing our very real concerns on the consequences of a no-deal Brexit for a considerable period of time directly with the British Government and the European Commission,” she said.“The island of Ireland faces its biggest and most profound challenges in a generation as the threat of a no-deal Brexit becomes a growing reality in the immediate time ahead.“The British Government continues to purposely ignore the cross-community majority of citizens in the North of Ireland and elected Assembly members who vehemently disagree and voted to oppose this unwanted Brexit during the referendum in 2016.“The consequences of a no-deal Brexit will result in a hard border which threatens our hard-won peace and undermines the political and economic progress of the past 21 years enjoyed across the whole island, but particularly in border communities which have been transformed.“It will have devastating effects for the island of Ireland and our people, businesses, farmers, workers and communities.“Staying within the single market and customs union, safeguarding the Good Friday Agreement, protecting business, jobs and the all-island economy and citizen’s rights remains paramount for the majority of the people of the North and across Ireland.“The British Government is dealing with the North of Ireland and the peace process as though it’s a commodity and it is a reckless, dangerous approach to take and one which must be opposed by the EU27, US Congress and those who value the progress of the past 21 years in Ireland.”‘Catastrophic’Fianna Fáil noted the severe impact no deal would have on Ireland’s economy. Its Brexit spokeswoman Lisa Chambers said: “This leaked document merely backs up all of the warnings that Ireland has been outlining about the fallout from a no-deal Brexit.“Let me be clear, a no-deal Brexit would be catastrophic for the island of Ireland - this document catalogues a sector-by-sector impact on the UK, but there will also be huge implications for these areas in Ireland.“Given the make-up of the North’s economy, structured around the SME and agri-food sector, and the very tight supply chains linking North-South and East-West, the effects of a no-deal Brexit would be severe and damaging.”SDLP Leader Colum Eastwood said the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson does not understand the situation in Northern Ireland. “Boris Johnson and his plans for a no-deal Brexit on October 31st are a threat to stability and prosperity on this island,” he said.“Following our meeting earlier this month, SDLP concerns that Johnson does not fully understand the complexities and fragilities of relationships in Ireland were confirmed.“The details in this leaked document now confirm that he doesn’t care either. We know that a no-deal Brexit will result in food and medicine shortages. Now, by the British Government’s own admission, we know that trade across the border will grind to a halt.“This British Government, far from sending a clear message to Brussels, is sending a clear message to people and businesses in Northern Ireland - they are willing to sacrifice our economic, political and social wellbeing to please rabid nativists in their own ranks.“This British Government has no mandate for a no-deal Brexit. If they refuse to reverse position then they should call a general election and put it to the people.‘Worst-case scenario’The British Government sought to play down the documents however on Sunday.Business Minister Kwasi Kwarteng said a “lot of people” were playing into “Project Fear” following the leak of documents which detailed the “most likely aftershocks” of the UK crashing out of the EU.When asked about the dossier, Mr Kwarteng told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: “I think there is a lot of scaremongering around and a lot of people are playing into Project Fear and all the rest of it.“We’ve got to prepare for no-deal ... now we’ve got a new Prime Minister who is very much focused on that and the scale and intensity of those preparations are increasing and we will be fully prepared to leave without a deal on October 31.”However, Michael Gove - the Cabinet minister responsible for no-deal planning - insisted Yellowhammer represented a “worst-case scenario”, and a Downing Street source claimed it had been leaked by a former minister.Mr Gove tweeted: “We don’t normally comment on leaks - but a few facts - Yellowhammer is a worst case scenario - v significant steps have been taken in the last 3 weeks to accelerate Brexit planning - and Black Swan is not an HMG doc but a film about a ballet dancer...”A Number 10 source said: “This document is from when ministers were blocking what needed to be done to get ready to leave and the funds were not available. It has been deliberately leaked by a former minister in an attempt to influence discussions with EU leaders.“Those obstructing preparation are no longer in Government, £2 billion of extra funding already made available and Whitehall has been stood up to actually do the work through the daily ministerial meetings. The entire posture of Government has changed.”The Government of Gibraltar said the Operation Yellowhammer documents were “out of date” and based on “planning for worst case scenarios”.Fabian Picardo, the chief minister of Gibraltar, said: “We do not want a no-deal Brexit. We think it is bad for Gibraltar. We are, nonetheless, now ready for it. The matters raised in the outdated Yellowhammer leak have already been responsibly addressed in detail.”Insisting on new dealMeanwhile Boris Johnson will tell Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron that there must be a new Brexit deal when he makes his first trip abroad as prime minister.Mr Johnson will make clear to the French president and German chancellor that Britain will leave the European Union on October 31st with or without a deal.The prime minister, who is heading to Berlin on Wednesday and Paris on Thursday, is expected to say that Parliament will not and cannot cancel the outcome of the EU referendum.He will insist there must be a new deal to replace Theresa May’s thrice-defeated Withdrawal Agreement if Britain is to leave with a settlement on October 31st.Speaking at the Fleadh Ceoil in Drogheda on Saturday, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he was due to speak to Mr Johnson in coming days.“It’s really just an opportunity to state our positions,” Mr Varadkar said.“Certainly I’ll be interested to know from him if the withdrawal agreement isn’t something he believes he can accept and how the UK will honour the commitments they made to Ireland and the EU back in 2017.”Asked whether he expects Borris’ position to shift, the Taoiseach said: “I’ll have to talk to him but what I expect between now and October 31st is there’ll be many twists and turns. But we’ll see how it goes.”Details of the PM’s travel plans emerged as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn reiterated his call for MPs to work together to prevent a no-deal Brexit.Mr Corbyn, who set out his plan to be installed as a caretaker prime minister last week to stop the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal, said his proposal is the “most democratic way” to prevent a no-deal.He told the Observer: “My message to MPs across Parliament is simple and urgent: only by working together can we stop no-deal.“Three years after the EU referendum, the country stands at a precipice. Boris Johnson has become Prime Minister without any popular mandate. He has no right to drive our country off a cliff and into the arms of Donald Trump with his no-deal fixation.“The plan I set out this week is the simplest and most democratic way to stop no-deal. We have to seize the opportunity before it’s too late, so the people, rather than an unelected Prime Minister, can decide our country’s future.”The Liberal Democrats and senior Tories have rejected his proposal, however it won the potential backing of the SNP, Plaid Cymru and Tory MP Guto Bebb.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Most men grow up surrounded by women, work with women, have women in their family, watch women on tv and film (not always a good barometer but still….), read about women and some even have relationships with women.  Why then should they not be able to depict women as real people with the same hopes, fears, ambitions and desires that men have? It could just be that some men are not good writers, full stop.Promising a lighthearted look at a serious subject she added: We hope it will inspire men to think again about how women appear on the page, particularly when they are alluding to sex.The panel will have echoes of The Bad Sex Awards, now an annual event in publishing which has seen some of Britain\u0027s most famous and successful authors lampooned for their attempts at romantic or erotic prose.Catherine Mayer, co-founder of the Women\u0027s Equality Party and the festival, said much of the conversation would be tongue-in-cheek, with the panel inspired by a Twitter conversation poking fun at male writer\u0027s misconceptions about the female anatomy. Referring to literature that uses the weather to reflect and amplify mood, she said: There\u0027s a whole section of male writing where breasts do the same. They droop they are depressed they seem to be capable of pointing to things.We\u0027re not actually saying men can\u0027t write women - we have two men on the panel. But my point here is the men who write that kind of stuff, they are lacking imagination and possibly talent. We\u0027re having some fun about that. One of the much more serious points about Primadonna generally is that although women buy more books than men and get more books published than men, they earn less than men, and they\u0027re much less likely to be taken seriously.The Primodonna Festival will be held at Laffitts Hall, Suffolk, from August 30 to September 1.Comment: Why not raise the pension age?

She alleged that something had happened with him and alluded to this being sexual.He spoke to her about watching pornography of women of her size, saying that it turned him on and he had been having a good time.Colleague A was embarrassed and raised her hands to indicate that he should stop talking like that.He then took a step towards her and put one hand on her bottom and the other hand on her right breast. She felt intimidated because he is a large man and this took place in a small room.This was clearly conduct that was inappropriate and sexual in its nature.Colleague A said that on 5 June 2017, Robertson asked to speak to her and led her into a side meeting room in the office.She said Robertson then started speaking to her about pornography. He put his hand down her top and touched the top of her right breast, and told her \u0027they didn\u0027t disappoint\u0027.She told the Panel she looked down to make sure that her clothing was in order and noticed that he was aroused. This conduct was clearly inappropriate and sexual in its nature.On about 6 June 2017, Colleague A returned to the office from shopping at Asda with a packet of bread rolls.She told the panel Robertson asked what she was cooking for his dinner, then he squeezed the packet of bread rolls she was holding and remarked, \u0027I like a good pair of baps\u0027.Robertson accepted making a comment about baps, but he maintained that it was a silly joke in bad taste.The disciplinary panel heard Robertson had also propositioned the woman a month earlier, asking if he could book a hotel room for them both to go to.Another female member of staff at Kent County Council gave evidence to the panel, telling them Robertson was often flirtatious.The disciplinary panel found Robertson had acted in a sexually inappropriate manner while working as a senior member of staff and suspended him for 12 months.Comment: Why not raise the pension age?

Pick incorrectly and it could derail the whole enterprise.Find the right person, though – someone with the right blend of confidence, naivety and unselfconsciousness – and the results can be breathtaking.This week sees Jacob Tremblay continue his run of impressive roles with Good Boys, which follows three sixth grade boys who ditch school and embark on an epic journey while carrying accidentally stolen drugs. Before that, he starred in the 2015 drama Room, giving a performance that was as deserving of an Oscar as his co-star Brie Larson, who took home Best Actress. And he’s still only 12.In celebration, we\u0027ve counted down the 18 most memorable performances by children in cinema. Click through the gallery below to see who made the cut.Created with Sketch.18 best child performances in film history Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.118 Christina Ricci in The Addams Family (1991)In the 27 years since she was transferred to the big screen via Christina Ricci, Wednesday Addams has become less a character and more a mood, a religion and a lifestyle. Ricci’s deadpan performance is so gloriously apathetic and mean that she comfortably steals the show from her adult co-stars, and deservedly had her role beefed up for the film’s sequel. (AW)218 Saoirse Ronan in Atonement (2007)Since Atonement, Ronan has become one of the most accomplished actors of her generation. And it’s no surprise, given how convincingly she brought to life, at the age of 13, Ian McEwan’s precocious and stubborn protagonist Briony Tallis, whose misinterpretation of a romantic encounter between her sister and her childhood friend wreaks havoc in the lives of those around her. (EH)318 Quvenzhané Wallis in Beasts of the Southern Wild (2012)Quvenzhané Wallis is proof that lying sometimes gets you places. As a five-year-old, the child star convinced her parents to let her fib about her age so that she could audition for Beasts of the Southern Wild – their minimum age was six. So impressed was director Benh Zeitlin by Wallis that he changed his entire script so that the character of Hushpuppy matched her stubborn personality. At the age of nine, she became the youngest Best Actress nominee in Oscars history. (JS)418 Aleksei Kravchenko in Come and See (1985)Horrific war film Come and See – which depicts Nazism through a child’s eyes – is a nightmarish but essential experience, if only to witness the performance of Aleksei Kravchenko. It would have been tough for an actor of any age to film the scenes asked of him by director Elem Klimov let alone a 14-year old one, but Kravchenko commits so nobly it’s hard to tear your eyes from the screen. He found the shoot so troubling that he reportedly developed grey hair. (JS)518 Jean-Pierre Léaud in The 400 Blows (1959)Jean-Pierre Léaud was one of several hundred boys who François Truffaut auditioned for The 400 Blows and it’s easy to see why he won the role. In Truffaut, Léaud found a mentor –  he took control of the 15-year-old\u0027s upbringing when shooting ended after he was expelled from school and kicked out of his carers’ home – and Léaud would return as the character five more times. (JS)618 Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone (1990)Considering he starts Home Alone as an obnoxious “little jerk”, it’s a testament to Macaulay Culkin’s skill that Kevin McCallister manages to worm his way into viewers’ hearts . Culkin has insane amounts of fun ruling the roost when his family accidentally forget to bring him on their Christmas holiday, and it never fails to be a gleeful experience watching Kevin runs rings around bumbling burglars Harry (Daniel Stern) and Marv (Joe Pesci). (JS)718 Abigail Breslin in Little Miss Sunshine (2006)Breslin became one of the youngest Oscar nominees of all time when she received a nod for Best Supporting Actress for her performance, aged 10, as Olive Hoover in the beloved 2006 road movie. She played an underdog youngster on a mission to win a beauty contest, accompanied by her quirky and dysfunctional family, with real wit and flair. (EH)818 Alex Hibbert in Moonlight (2016)Giving a performance in perfect symmetry to the film around him, Alex Hibbert is one of a number of brilliantly subtle actors in Moonlight. Only on screen for the film’s first third, he mostly inhabits a quiet and devastating yearning, embodying a character buried under the emotional weight of playground bullying and constant domestic upheaval, and desperate for someone to show him compassion and answer his questions. If Hollywood has any sense, Moonlight will be just the first of many incredible opportunities for the young star. (AW)918 Mara Wilson in Mrs Doubtfire (1993)Mara Wilson is one of those great child star success stories, immortalised in at least three classic movies while still in single-digits, retiring early, and now writing, podcasting and saying smart, funny things on Twitter. But while 1996’s Matilda is often talked about as her best work, she was somehow even more brilliant in Mrs Doubtfire three years earlier, where she is adorable and grouchy and seems to possess a beautifully sincere, if today bittersweet, joy over merely being in Robin Williams’s company. (AW)1018 Isabelle Fuhrman in Orphan (2009)Isabelle Fuhrman is scarily convincing in her role as Esther, the sickly-sweet orphan girl turned murderous dwarf asylum escapee. The sexual and violent nature of some scenes may be uncomfortable to watch, but there is no denying Fuhrman executes them perfectly. (MH)1118 Tatum O’Neal in Paper Moon (1973)Tatum O’Neal was, and still is, the youngest person to ever win an Oscar for her role as the sassy, smoking, swindling tomboy Addie in Paper Moon. Addie may or may not be the daughter of con man Moses, who is reluctantly saddled with the youngster before realising she can help him with his scams. Moses is played by O’Neal’s real-life father Ryan O’Neal, and there’s just no faking that kind of chemistry. (AP)1218 Lindsay Lohan in The Parent Trap (1998)Lohan was just 12 when she played identical twins Annie and Hallie in the 1998 classic. While the sisters were of course impossible to distinguish by their looks, their personalities and backgrounds could hardly have been more different: one was a well-to-do Londoner, the other a boisterous American tomboy. The young star impressed audiences with her ability to switch effortlessly and convincingly between the two. (EH)1318 Heather O’Rourke in Poltergeist (1982)Heather O’Rourke tragically died aged just 12 in 1988, but she will long be remembered as the ethereal blonde Carol Anne Freeling. Cast after a chance meeting with Steven Spielberg, she captivates the audience as a little girl who can communicate with “the other side” through the family television set. (MH)1418 Jacob Tremblay in Room (2015)Egregiously overlooked for an Oscar in 2016, Jacob Tremblay\u0027s performance in Room will pull out heartstrings you never knew you had. As Jack, a long-haired five-year-old who has been imprisoned in a garden shed all his life and is oblivious to the outside world, he not only raises the film\u0027s cute quotient, but also brings surprising depth. His is a turn of great maturity, one that scratches away at the fact that Jack has never had any male interaction. Brie Larson, who plays his mum, did win an Oscar for her role here. (PS)1518 Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense (1999)Haley Joel Osment’s performance as Cole Sear, a young boy tormented by his ability to see and talk to the dead, is so strong that he remains the most memorable part of the M Night Shyamalan film, despite a career-best turn from Bruce Willis and one of the most effective twists in cinema history. (JS)1618 River Phoenix in Stand by Me (1986)One of the few comforts to cling onto when thinking of River Phoenix’s tragic death aged 23 is that he was at least able to showcase his vast acting range before he died. The actor, whose brother is Joaquin Phoenix, played everything from tortured teenagers to tough adventurers and street hustlers. But perhaps his finest work came early, in 1986’s Stand by Me, when he played a sensitive pre-teen who masks insecurity and self-loathing beneath a veneer of macho posturing. It’s a staggering bit of acting from someone so young. (AW)1718 Hailee Steinfeld in True Grit (2010)It’s probably not true to say that Hailee Steinfeld is the only person who could have pulled off the role of the fearless Mattie Ross in the Coen brothers’ adaptation of Charles Portis novel True Grit – but from the moment she arrives in Fort Smith with plans to hunt down her father’s killer, she makes you feel like she is. How she didn\u0027t win Best Supporting Actress at the 2011 Oscars will remain a mystery. (JS)1818 Heather Matarazzo in Welcome to the Dollhouse (1995)Generally speaking, children acting in Todd Solondz movies need to have nerves of steel and far more self-confidence than average youngsters. But it takes a child of unusual gutsiness to enact the horrors inflicted upon poor Dawn Wiener in his 1995 film Welcome to the Dollhouse. A yearning, eager loner played to perfection by Heather Matarazzo, Dawn is the recipient of a level of casual cruelty that would feel fetishistic if it weren\u0027t so tragically true to life. When she was killed off before the credits in Solondz’s 2004 film Palindromes, the collective mourning it inspired in his fanbase was only a result of how powerfully Matarazzo’s performance lingered. (AW)118 Christina Ricci in The Addams Family (1991)In the 27 years since she was transferred to the big screen via Christina Ricci, Wednesday Addams has become less a character and more a mood, a religion and a lifestyle. Ricci’s deadpan performance is so gloriously apathetic and mean that she comfortably steals the show from her adult co-stars, and deservedly had her role beefed up for the film’s sequel. (AW)218 Saoirse Ronan in Atonement (2007)Since Atonement, Ronan has become one of the most accomplished actors of her generation. And it’s no surprise, given how convincingly she brought to life, at the age of 13, Ian McEwan’s precocious and stubborn protagonist Briony Tallis, whose misinterpretation of a romantic encounter between her sister and her childhood friend wreaks havoc in the lives of those around her. (EH)318 Quvenzhané Wallis in Beasts of the Southern Wild (2012)Quvenzhané Wallis is proof that lying sometimes gets you places. As a five-year-old, the child star convinced her parents to let her fib about her age so that she could audition for Beasts of the Southern Wild – their minimum age was six. So impressed was director Benh Zeitlin by Wallis that he changed his entire script so that the character of Hushpuppy matched her stubborn personality. At the age of nine, she became the youngest Best Actress nominee in Oscars history. (JS)418 Aleksei Kravchenko in Come and See (1985)Horrific war film Come and See – which depicts Nazism through a child’s eyes – is a nightmarish but essential experience, if only to witness the performance of Aleksei Kravchenko. It would have been tough for an actor of any age to film the scenes asked of him by director Elem Klimov let alone a 14-year old one, but Kravchenko commits so nobly it’s hard to tear your eyes from the screen. He found the shoot so troubling that he reportedly developed grey hair. (JS)518 Jean-Pierre Léaud in The 400 Blows (1959)Jean-Pierre Léaud was one of several hundred boys who François Truffaut auditioned for The 400 Blows and it’s easy to see why he won the role. In Truffaut, Léaud found a mentor –  he took control of the 15-year-old\u0027s upbringing when shooting ended after he was expelled from school and kicked out of his carers’ home – and Léaud would return as the character five more times. (JS)618 Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone (1990)Considering he starts Home Alone as an obnoxious “little jerk”, it’s a testament to Macaulay Culkin’s skill that Kevin McCallister manages to worm his way into viewers’ hearts . Culkin has insane amounts of fun ruling the roost when his family accidentally forget to bring him on their Christmas holiday, and it never fails to be a gleeful experience watching Kevin runs rings around bumbling burglars Harry (Daniel Stern) and Marv (Joe Pesci). (JS)718 Abigail Breslin in Little Miss Sunshine (2006)Breslin became one of the youngest Oscar nominees of all time when she received a nod for Best Supporting Actress for her performance, aged 10, as Olive Hoover in the beloved 2006 road movie. She played an underdog youngster on a mission to win a beauty contest, accompanied by her quirky and dysfunctional family, with real wit and flair. (EH)818 Alex Hibbert in Moonlight (2016)Giving a performance in perfect symmetry to the film around him, Alex Hibbert is one of a number of brilliantly subtle actors in Moonlight. Only on screen for the film’s first third, he mostly inhabits a quiet and devastating yearning, embodying a character buried under the emotional weight of playground bullying and constant domestic upheaval, and desperate for someone to show him compassion and answer his questions. If Hollywood has any sense, Moonlight will be just the first of many incredible opportunities for the young star. (AW)918 Mara Wilson in Mrs Doubtfire (1993)Mara Wilson is one of those great child star success stories, immortalised in at least three classic movies while still in single-digits, retiring early, and now writing, podcasting and saying smart, funny things on Twitter. But while 1996’s Matilda is often talked about as her best work, she was somehow even more brilliant in Mrs Doubtfire three years earlier, where she is adorable and grouchy and seems to possess a beautifully sincere, if today bittersweet, joy over merely being in Robin Williams’s company. (AW)1018 Isabelle Fuhrman in Orphan (2009)Isabelle Fuhrman is scarily convincing in her role as Esther, the sickly-sweet orphan girl turned murderous dwarf asylum escapee. The sexual and violent nature of some scenes may be uncomfortable to watch, but there is no denying Fuhrman executes them perfectly. (MH)1118 Tatum O’Neal in Paper Moon (1973)Tatum O’Neal was, and still is, the youngest person to ever win an Oscar for her role as the sassy, smoking, swindling tomboy Addie in Paper Moon. Addie may or may not be the daughter of con man Moses, who is reluctantly saddled with the youngster before realising she can help him with his scams. Moses is played by O’Neal’s real-life father Ryan O’Neal, and there’s just no faking that kind of chemistry. (AP)1218 Lindsay Lohan in The Parent Trap (1998)Lohan was just 12 when she played identical twins Annie and Hallie in the 1998 classic. While the sisters were of course impossible to distinguish by their looks, their personalities and backgrounds could hardly have been more different: one was a well-to-do Londoner, the other a boisterous American tomboy. The young star impressed audiences with her ability to switch effortlessly and convincingly between the two. (EH)1318 Heather O’Rourke in Poltergeist (1982)Heather O’Rourke tragically died aged just 12 in 1988, but she will long be remembered as the ethereal blonde Carol Anne Freeling. Cast after a chance meeting with Steven Spielberg, she captivates the audience as a little girl who can communicate with “the other side” through the family television set.

Ataer\u0026nbspnow has exclusive rights to look into Britain’s second-largest steelmaker in greater detail over the next two months as part of due diligence.\u0026nbsp“During the exclusivity period, close negotiations will be held with customers, suppliers and employees who will play an important role in the future success of British Steel,” Oyak said.If due diligence is finalised\u0026nbspsuccessfully in October, the transfer of the company will be completed by the end of this year, it added.The official receiver for British Steel said: “I have now received an acceptable offer from\u0026nbspAtaer\u0026nbspHoldings AS for the purchase of the whole\u0026nbspbusiness and\u0026nbspI am now focusing on\u0026nbspfinalising\u0026nbspthe sale.“I will be looking to conclude this process in the coming weeks, during which time British Steel continues to trade and supply its customers as normal.”The deal will throw a lifeline to the steelmaker’s 5,000 workers, most of them in the UK, and another 20,000 people employed in its supply chain.It was put into compulsory liquidation after a breakdown in talks between the government and British Steel’s owner\u0026nbspGreybull Capital,\u0026nbspwhich bought the company for £1 just weeks before the EU referendum in 2016.The government had lent British Steel £120m\u0026nbspbut Greybull asked for more to deal with “Brexit-related” issues.

But, all the same, he has a strong case. “Do you know what percentage of people live in Asia?” he asked. I guessed around 50 per cent. It turns out to be 60 per cent. 4 billion people in Asia. A mere 700 million in Europe. QED.\u0026nbspNivern, now 37, is a posterboy for the utility of studying modern languages. At 14 he went on a school exchange to Paris. Brought up in Manchester, he found himself living across the street from the Louvre. At 17 he got a summer job in a factory outside Paris, packing cakes in boxes, where he was known as “Anglais”. “I was impressed that, even in the industrial zone, they still stopped for a proper lunch with a baguette and a bottle of wine.”This was the summer of 1998, the year of the Mondial in France. He tried – and failed – to get into the World Cup final at the Stade de France, but watched France beat Brazil 3-0 on a screen outside and saw the whole city go mad. “I couldn’t get home and I couldn’t get to work the next day either.” He went on to take French and German at Keble College, Oxford, specialising in 17th century French theatre. “Learning languages opens up your eyes to other parts of the world,” he says. “I just wanted to keep on going.”\u0026nbspWhich explains why, a couple of months after graduating, he took a job teaching English in a high school in a town, Hengshui (“not scenic, but with wonderful people”), three hours south of Beijing. With practically no knowledge of Chinese. He just threw himself in at the deep end and found he could float. When he got back to England he switched to international management and Chinese for his masters at Soas (the School of Oriental and African Studies), London. \u0026nbspNivern joined forces with fellow student Ed Holroyd Pearce (who had studied Oriental languages at Cambridge) to set up not just one but two companies, China Recruitment and China Consulting. “The simple idea was to make it easier for people to do what we did.” Those two eventually fused into one, CRCC Asia. They arrange the jobs (across a range of sectors), travel, accommodation and visas, and do all the networking for you. From small beginnings in Nivern’s kitchen in 2006, they now have a team of 50 working out of offices across Asia, collaborating with companies large and small. Nivern is based in Philadelphia, where he has set up partnerships with American universities like Texas and Michigan. And they are now expanding into South Korea, Japan and Vietnam. \u0026nbspI would love to say I get it right all the time. But the Chinese are incredibly receptive to foreigners trying to speak ChineseThis year they expect to send some 1,500 college students and graduates (generally between 18 and 23) to internships in Beijing, Shanghai, Seoul, Tokyo, Ho Chi Minh City and… Manchester (it works in reverse too). Forty per cent\u0026nbspwill come from the UK, 40 per cent\u0026nbspfrom the US, and others from New Zealand and Australia. And CRCC Asia are providing a number of scholarships to support people can’t afford to self-finance. There is funding for 250 places\u0026nbspby the British Council. Globalism – combined with Brexit – is persuading a lot of young people to look east in search of work experience and an enhanced CV.\u0026nbspNivern picked up the Mandarin language relatively late. “I would love to say I get it right all the time. But the Chinese are incredibly receptive to foreigners trying to speak Chinese.” He reckons that the grammar is not as difficult as German, “what’s tricky is the tonality.” The same syllable, “Ma”, can mean either “mother” or “horse” (and a few other things), depending. “Hopefully the context helps,” says Nivern. A sentence involving a mother riding a horse is a well-known tongue twister. Most people, like Nivern himself, go to China with no Chinese, “but we encourage everyone to try – it makes a huge difference”.\u0026nbspChina bans actors and films from Asian awards ceremony in TaiwanChina warns Hong Kong protesters as police amass near borderAsian stocks fall as China hits back at US claim of yuan manipulationNivern says that China is like an onion: “You can go on peeling off layers. You think you know it but you don’t.” In CRCC Asia’s “Career Bridge” programme (which gives you training in “intercultural fluency”), one of the key concepts they try to get across to those new to China is mianzi or “face”. You can give face and you can lose face. Nobody wants to lose it. You have to be sensitive to hierarchy in China. If you’re arranging a dinner party, you put the least senior person closest to the door. Conversation should be addressed to the most senior person (like a government official) to begin with. If there is a toast, you can clink glasses, but you have to make sure the rim of your glass is lower than the local bigwig’s glass, otherwise you risk giving offence. By going lower you are giving face. “There’s sometimes a battle as to who goes lower,” says Nivern. “You can end up on the floor.”\u0026nbspJust as Nivern was inspired by the 1998 World Cup, so too, 10 years later, the Beijing Olympics of 2008 gave CRCC Asia a significant boost. The Chinese government took the games seriously enough to close factories and pull vehicles off the road with a view to cutting pollution. “It was all perfectly choreographed. You could say regimented. The closing ceremony was fantastic too.”\u0026nbspApparently the thing that shocked his Chinese friends most was the sight of then mayor of London, Boris Johnson, leading our 2012 handover, looking scruffy, with his jacket unbuttoned, one hand in his pocket, and his shirt hanging half out. He showed a lack of respect and lost a lot of face that day. “But at least I managed to get into the stadium this time,” said Nivern. \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But reality is more complicatedClick to followThe IndependentIf Britain wants a trade deal with the US, it must accept American food standards, including those allowing genetic modification and chicken to be washed in chlorine, the head of America’s farming lobby has said.Both of those practices are controversial in the UK. Washing chicken carcasses in chlorinated water to kill off harmful bacteria is banned in the EU. And unlike the US, the EU has also not approved any fresh genetically modified (GM) fruit or vegetables for human consumption.But Zippy Duvall, head of the American Farm Bureau, said concerns over the practices are not “science-based”.“There is no scientific basis that says that washing poultry with a chlorine wash, just to be safe of whatever pathogens might be on that chicken as it was prepared for the market, should be taken away,” Mr Duvall, a poultry farmer in Georgia, told BBC Radio 4.“If there was something wrong with it, our federal inspection systems would not be allowing us to use that.”Created with Sketch.The exercise it takes to burn off high-calorie foods Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.310 Chicken and bacon sandwich - 445 calories 410 One quarter of a large pizza (449kcal)610 Packet of crisps - 171 calories910 One bowl of cereal - 172 calories310 Chicken and bacon sandwich - 445 calories 410 One quarter of a large pizza (449kcal)610 Packet of crisps - 171 calories910 One bowl of cereal - 172 caloriesBoth the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the British Poultry Council have said eating meat treated in that way is safe.However, the EFSA opposes chlorine rinsing because it enables farmers to lower their standards of animal welfare and hygiene as they can simply use a chemical bath to kill off any harmful pathogens after animals are slaughtered.The EU takes what it calls an integrated approach to food safety, “from farm to fork covering all sectors of the food chain”. As part of that approach, there are minimum legal requirements for the amount of space, lighting and ventilation in EU poultry-rearing houses.As there are no laws governing this in the US, the birds can be crammed in tightly, according to Simon Dawson, a food safety expert at Cardiff politan University. This reduces production costs but increases the risks of disease and contamination in a flock.“Some US abattoirs and processing plants rely heavily on chlorination because their other hygiene standards are so poor that they would be illegal in Europe,” Mr Dawson wrote in 2017.“The process is also very good at removing odours and surface slime, meaning the meat can be passed off as fresh for much longer than it should be.”The EU is less strict on GM food, allowing some such products to be sold provided the EFSA has deemed them safe and they are labelled as GM.The World Health Organisation says it is not possible to make general statements on the safety of all GM crops, and that each food should be assessed separately.Earlier this week, Donald Trump’s national security adviser said the UK will be “first in line” for a trade deal with the US after Brexit.John Bolton suggested that the US could focus on striking bilateral trade deals in certain sectors like manufacturing and car-making and work out more complicated areas later.According to Mr Duvall, though, any trade agreement would have to include agriculture.“To have a trade treaty and not discuss agriculture would be turning your back on rural America and that’s where a big part of our population lives,” he said.A government spokesperson said: “Any future deal with the US must work for UK consumers, farmers and companies.\u0026nbsp“We have been clear on numerous occasions that we will not compromise on our high food or animal welfare standards as part of any trade deals.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But has the rise and fall and rise again of James Charles turned the tide on influencer culture, asks Sirena Bergman, or shone a light on how much we love watching celebrities fall from grace?Click to followThe IndependentLast month, Time magazine released its list of the 25 most influential people on the internet. Nestled among politicians, royals and activists of household-name status are hugely popular YouTubers many may not have heard of. The endlessly relatable Emma Chamberlain, with over 8 million subscribers, features. As does 16-year-old tween sensation and former Dance Moms star JoJo Siwa, with almost 10 million followers.And then you come to the name James Charles, who up until this spring was relatively unknown to the masses, despite more than 16 million people subscribing to his YouTube channel. Like many influencers, he existed in a curious celebrity middle-ground, where despite being mobbed by thousands of adoring fans, the traditional media pretty much completely ignored him. But all that changed on 10 May, when fellow YouTuber and former friend Tati Westbrook uploaded a 43-minute video which can broadly be described as a character assassination of Charles, kickstarting what would become one of the most talked-about, consequential feuds in influencer history.The making of James CharlesTo understand the monumental cultural impact of the dispute, we must go back to 5 September 2016, when a relatively unknown 17-year-old James Charles Dickinson, who had built up a\u0026nbspmodest following by\u0026nbspfilming make-up tutorials on YouTube for under a year, tweeted his senior yearbook picture. He explained that he’d had the photos retaken with his ringlight\u0026nbsp“so my highlight would be poppin” because he loves “being extra”.\u0026nbspThe photo went viral and racked up more than 33,000 retweets and 84,000 likes on Twitter within just a day, including a retweet from then 20-year-old actor and singer Zendaya. By the following month he’d amassed more than 440,000 Instagram followers and was announced as the first male ambassador for US make-up brand CoverGirl. It was widely acknowledged as a pivotal moment for LGBT+ inclusivity and the beauty industry abandoning the gender stereotyping which it had been propagating for decades.\u0026nbspSuch was the impact of Charles’s story that he was invited on The Ellen DeGeneres Show to talk to the LGBT+ icon about his story. He appeared in a full face of make-up, discussing his sudden rise to internet fame, coming\u0026nbspout as gay aged 12, becoming interested in make-up and growing up on social media. Born in 1999, he was only five years old when Facebook was founded, seven when Twitter launched, and 11 when the first version of Instagram was released.\u0026nbspCoverGirl (James CharlesTwitter)His viral fame became emblematic of a generation of creators and celebrities whose careers took off on social media. Musician Billie Eilish, who was born in 2001, has achieved worldwide fame after the huge success of her single “Ocean Eyes”, which she posted on SoundCloud. Fellow singer Lil Nas X broke records this year when, aged 19, his song\u0026nbsp“Old Town Road”\u0026nbspbecame the longest-running hip-hop track on the Billboard Hot 100 after going viral on the video-sharing app TikTok. YouTuber Tana Mongeau found herself on real-life billboards all over LA this year after landing an MTV reality show based on the run-up to her 21st birthday. But Charles’s sudden fame landed him in a wholly different world.The top tier of beauty YouTubers is a place of fame, wealth and tremendous influence, punctuated by collaborations with the likes of Kim Kardashian, partnerships with behemoths of the make-up industry and incestuous, cliquey friendship groups that result in feuds and dramas that are all closely covered by commentary channels on YouTube, which are watched by millions.Everything wrong with the James Charles–Tati Westbrook controversyCharles’s meteoric rise to the top of this exclusive club has been uniquely defined by seemingly endless scandals. In February 2017 he was forced to apologise after a tweet in which he joked about getting Ebola while on a school trip to Africa. Just a few months later, fellow beauty influencer Thomas Halbert posted screenshots of conversations which seemed to discredit the ringlight story that led to Charles’s fame, suggesting he actually photoshopped his “poppin” highlight. In April 2019 he caught flak yet again after saying in a video that he was not “full gay” because he had been “into” trans guys, suggesting that they did not count as men for the purpose of identifying his sexuality.The following month he was widely ridiculed for posting on Instagram that his invitation to the Met Gala was “a step in the right direction for influencer representation in the media” and that he was glad to be the “catalyst”.\u0026nbspWhile his comments were somewhat tone-deaf and self-aggrandising as someone with such huge privilege, it’s true that the media and fashion industry\u0026nbsptend to ignore social media influencers in favour of covering more traditional celebrities, leading to a disconnect between the reality of their huge impact and lack of awareness among the masses.This was epitomised in January when Charles made an appearance at a shopping centre in Birmingham and thousands of fans brought the city centre to a standstill, much to the surprise of officials who clearly failed to understand the scope of his influence and plan accordingly.Charles’s wish to be acknowledged by the mainstream would soon be granted, but in a cruel twist of fate it would not be for his success, but for the projected death of his career.The cancelling of James CharlesTati Westbrook is a 37-year-old beauty YouTuber. She has been on the platform since 2010, and for much of that time was posting five videos a week, mostly focusing on product reviews and tutorials. Over almost a decade, she amassed more than 6 million subscribers and is widely respected on the platform for her perceived authenticity (unlike most influencers, she rarely accepts brand sponsorships) and ability to stay out of the drama despite her\u0026nbsppublic friendships with controversial figures such as Jeffree Star. Newsweek referred to her as “a progenitor of YouTube’s beauty scene” and indeed that is how she was broadly perceived among the community.So people were inclined to not only listen, but also blindly believe her allegations when she posted her now-infamous 43-minute video entitled “Bye Sister”\u0026nbsp– the title being a reference to Charles’s trademark term for his subscribers (“Hi sisters!”), his friends (“I’m doing a collaboration with sister Jeffree Star!”), and pretty much any word in his vocabulary (he’s going to put on a “sister winged liner”, his day is “sister stressful”, he gives people he likes a “sister shoutout”).Westbrook’s video (which has since been deleted) was ostensibly triggered by Charles accepting a sponsorship from vitamin supplement brand Sugar Bear Hair (SBH), which many – including Westbrook – saw as a betrayal of their friendship given the company is the main competitor to her supplement business Halo Beauty.\u0026nbspvlogger\u0026nbspin Birmingham: fans brought the city centre to a standstill, much to the surprise of officials, who had not prepared to accommodate them\u0026nbsp(James CharlesTwitter)Her response was, by most measures, brutal. It detailed how much she and her husband had done for Charles, acting as parents to the teenager, offering business and personal advice, helping him gain popularity and sponsorships, taking him under their wing. She discredited his story that he had to take the partnership with SBH because the brand had saved him from being mobbed at Coachella, and criticised him for promoting supplements to a young audience. She also made allegations of sexual misconduct, claiming Charles systematically tried to “convince straight men that they were gay” and was consistently inappropriate and coercive around men who were not interested in him.Posting the video was a risky move by Westbrook, who throughout it emphasised how much she “still cared” about her former friend. She has since stated that she had no idea how drastic the reaction would be, despite the loyalty of Charles’s audience, which was much larger than hers.\u0026nbspIt’s hard to imagine that anyone could have predicted what happened next – the video received millions of views, was on YouTube’s trending page, and subscribers started flocking away from Charles and towards Westbrook at record-breaking speed.\u0026nbspTati Westbrook during the now-deleted 43-minute video entitled ‘Bye Sister’ in which she details the allegations against her ‘former friend’ James Charles\u0026nbsp(TatiYouTube)Within a day he had lost 1 million subscribers – something that had never before occurred in the 14-year history of YouTube – Westbrook was simultaneously gaining hundreds of thousands of subscribers at lighting speed.\u0026nbspThis mass exodus continued for days and the feud was covered across\u0026nbspmedia outlets. Charles posted\u0026nbspa teary apology video\u0026nbspand other high-profile figures weighed in, including comments from huge influencers including Manny MUA in defence of Charles, and Jeffree Star backing Westbrook. Within days the race was on to see who would hit 10 million subscribers first – Charles, who began at 16 million, or Westbrook, who just days before was at 6 million.The story became a global talking point. People who had never watched a make-up tutorial in their lives were weighing in, and Charles was largely declared “cancelled”.Herd mentality and social media mob ruleThe YouTube community has been mired in scandals for years. Last summer\u0026nbspa wave of top-tier influencers (with Star at the centre of it) were called out for inappropriate content and behaviour Logan Paul, with 15 million subscribers, vlogged the dead body of a suicide victim for a video his brother Jake Paul (19 million subscribers) posted a video in which his YouTube nemesis FaZe Banks was falsely accused of assault Tana Mongeau (4.7 million subscribers) hosted a convention so disastrously organised that it left fans waiting outside for hours in blistering sun with no food or water creators including Shane Dawson (22 million subscribers) and Philip DeFranco (6.4 million subscribers) were accused of exploiting their followers’ mental health concerns for money after promoting the controversial BetterHelp app. Yet none of these situations came close to creating the kind of backlash Charles experienced.Hollie-Anne Brooks is a journalist and former editor of We The Unicorns, a digital publication that covers YouTuber news. She thinks that while Westbrook’s video kickstarted the backlash against Charles, it snowballed into a collective desire to be involved in the drama, which led many to follow in the footsteps of his first critics without questioning the reasons for doing so.“There were a lot of people who enjoyed getting caught up in the #JamesCharlesIsCancelled movement and it felt like you were part of a group,” she says.Katie Woodland is a psychologist who now works as a business coach, but her background is in child development. She believes that part of the reason for the extreme response to the scandal is the age of the subscribers involved.“When you’re a teenager you’re desperately looking for an identity and a tribe. Initially James Charles spoke to that need, being an outsider himself,” says Woodland. “The cliques and groups we pick as teenagers are part of us trying to work out where we belong and as soon as we align with someone, we feel they are an extension of our identity, but if they say or do something we feel doesn’t align with our world view, teenagers can feel truly betrayed, and want to hurt them back.”SBH and Westbrook’s story where she indicated she was upset about his post, but didn’t name him (Instagram)Woodland explains that due to the increased exposure to influencers’ day-to-day lives, younger generations can feel that they are within their orbit, compared to the more removed sense of fandom for traditional celebrities. As a result, the reaction can be as intense as if you were to fall out with a friend. Followers may also feel a connection to Westbrook, so by claiming Charles betrayed her, her younger viewers could empathise so deeply that they took Charles’s alleged actions personally.Research bears this out, showing that the brain isn’t fully developed until around age 25. According to the University of Rochester Medical Centre, adults think with the prefrontal cortex, the brain’s rational part. This is the region\u0026nbspof the brain that responds to situations with good judgment and an awareness of long-term consequences. Whereas teens process information with the amygdala, which governs emotions. As a result, young people are more likely to succumb to a “herd mentality”.Nicola Morgan is a psychologist who has spent decades researching the teenage brain. In her book The Teenage Guide to Friends, she writes that this phenomenon can lead to problematic behaviours. “Groups (including groups of adults) often react and behave emotionally, without thinking. The iniduals may hardly register that they’ve hurt anyone by their laughter, exclusion or thoughtless comments.”Tati Westbrook following scandalShe also writes that social media can exacerbate this behaviour in people of all ages “because of the ‘online disinhibition effect’, which describes how people often behave online in a way they wouldn’t do face-to-face. Group behaviour on social media causes problems for adults, too, as people of any age can behave badly, be cruel and have poor self-control.”He argues that part of the reason people feel comfortable “ganging up” on someone on social media is that it has become a comfortable echochamber for our own opinions. “Twitter’s like a sort of mutual approval machine,” he says.\u0026nbsp“Tech utopians call this a new type of democracy but it’s the opposite. In a democracy, you listen to each other.”YouTuber who\u0026nbspfaced worldwide scorn after uploading a controversial video in Japan’s suicide forest (Getty)The desire to surround ourselves by people who validate our views existed long before social media, but platforms like YouTube, Twitter and Instagram certainly exacerbate it. Writing in Psychology Today, moral psychologist Rob Henderson states that: “There is a heuristic most of us use to determine what to do, think, say, and buy: the principle of social proof. To learn what is correct, we look at what other people are doing.”The impulse to be part of a vindicated group – in this case, the people “cancelling” James Charles – is compounded by the unparalleled visibility of the sentiment. Social media analytics site Social Blade was live-streaming the subscriber differential for Charles and Westbrook, allowing viewers to watch Charles’s fall from grace in real time, and contributing to a collective mentality which lacked awareness of the potential nuance in the feudBrooks says that watching Charles’s subscriber count go down was “a meme and a moment on social media in itself”.Created with Sketch.Youtube\u0027s top 15 most subscribed channels in 2019 Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The YouTube channel homepage for Indian record label T-Series, which overtook controversial Swedish vlogger PewDiePie in 2019PewDiePie has been the most popular YouTuber since 20135-Minute Crafts, which offers quick and quirky DIY tips to viewers, didn\u0027t even feature in the top 15 YouTube channels in July 2018Brazilian music video producer and director KondZilla began his career after buying a camera with life insurance money left to him after his mother died when he was 18Sony Entertainment Televesion (SET) launched in 1995 and has recently seen huge growth of its Hindi-language YouTube channelCanadian musician Justin Bieber held the number-two spot in 2018 before T-Series took over World Wrestling Entertainment has managed to gain a huge following on YouTube by sharing clips of fights and interviews with its starsThis YouTube channel specialises in 3D animation videos of nursery rhymes, as well as its own original songs.

While the accusations of treachery and entitlement may have riled viewers on an emotional level, the reaction to her claim that Charles was pressuring men into sexual contact elicited a more complex response.It would be naive to say that the Me Too movement has completely changed society’s view on sexual assault and harassment, but it is fair to suggest that in cases where accusations are made, the morally correct response is broadly understood to be:\u0026nbspbelieve the victim. But we forget that the allegations against Charles did not come from a victim, but from a former friend who – by her own admission – was a bystander in more than one of these apparent instances. Further, the power differential in the allegations against Charles isn’t as straightforward as that of Harvey Weinstein, for example – allegations of a straight, white,\u0026nbspmale\u0026nbspmultimillionaire\u0026nbspHollywood producer coercing young unknown female actors into sexual acts under the understanding that their refusal would end their careers.Jeffree Star and Tati’ video\u0026nbspposted in January, before the feud (James CharlesYouTube)In an episode of Radio 4’s Late Night Woman’s Hour, host Emma Barnett discussed the situation at the time with beauty journalist Sali Hughes and writer and broadcaster Miranda Sawyer. Hughes, who admits she didn’t know who James Charles was until that week, points out that he is “this barely-an-adult, young gay man in make-up – which is a hard thing to be in society”.\u0026nbspOf course, Charles does have a huge following, wealth, and stature in the community, so it’s not unfeasible that he could have wielded the power to pressure men into sex, but the narrative around the discussion at the time seemed to ignore the reality that there is a big difference between a heterosexual man pressuring a woman into sex, and a young gay man doing the same to straight men.AFPGetty)The double-edged sword of overnight fameHerd mentality and cancel culture do not lead to thoughtful analysis of a situation, but rather to a distilled version of a story which people will blindly latch onto to validate their own beliefs, and a pervasive one is that influencers largely do not deserve the acclaim and success they achieve.\u0026nbspThey are seen as narcissistic and entitled. People who manage to make a living just by being young and charismatic. This sense of unfairness around their success is amplified in cases like that of Charles, whose sudden rise to internet fame was not necessarily unique, but the scope of his influence and the lightning speed with which he achieved it is unparalleled.By May 2019 – just over two and a half years after the ringlight photo – Charles had 16.6 million subscribers on YouTube, putting him in an elite category of beauty influencers alongside Rachel Claire Levin (14 million subscribers), who began posting YouTube videos in 2010 Jeffree Star (15 million subscribers), whose audience has been growing since the mid-2000s when he was one of the most popular pages on MySpace NikkieTutorials (12 million subscribers), who’s been posting on YouTube since 2010 and Safiya Nygaard, who rose to prominence when she made videos for BuzzFeed in 2015. Charles’s overnight success stood in huge contrast to the reality of “making it” as an influencer, which typically involves years of hard graft and steady growth.YouTuber outside his dressing room on ‘Ellen’ in 2016: he discussed fame, coming out, make-up and social media with the LGBT+ icon (James CharlesInstagram)Brooks believes his fast rise to fame may have been a key factor in the collective desire to take him down. “A lot of YouTubers – including Tati Westbrook – started at a time when the industry and the community wasn’t so fickle. James’s very quick rise to fame in a way gives way to his downfall.”She explains that while YouTubers who have been on the platform for a decade have a dedicated, loyal audience, the new wave of followers who have latched onto Charles recently have not developed the long-term allegiance to him, and know they have hundreds of others creators out there whose content they can consume instead.Influencer and author Emily Clarkson wrote about the scandal as it was unfolding. On her blog, Pretty Normal Me, she wrote that James Charles was “a victim of his own success”.“For months and years he has been treated like a god, been made allowances for, had his bad behaviour excused because of his celebrity status. In turn, he got swept up in himself and his life and his wealth and his fame. He lost his sense of everything important and he fucked up. And now he’s paying the price. He is a victim of his own success, of an industry that builds people to extraordinary levels. And one that tears them down at a moment’s notice too,” she said at the time.It’s impossible not to see the parallels between Charles – someone who achieved giddy heights of recognition at such a young age – and the schadenfreude with which society has always consumed stories of young celebrities falling from grace.\u0026nbspKardashian in 2016: Kardashian unfollowed Charles during the Westbrook feud, but they have since made up (James CharlesInstagram)In an article examining the fallout from Britney Spears’s notorious breakdown in 2007, author Kate Leaver writes: “It was us, after all, who destroyed her. She didn’t crumble in isolation or simply of her own volition she overdosed on fame and we were complicit in that. We made her the single most watched human being on the planet and then, gleefully, watched as she nearly died from overexposure. We celebrated her ascent to celebrity and then punished her for attaining the very perfection we demand.”We can see this unflattering trait of society in the way we’ve revelled in the demise of countless other young celebrities – Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Bynes and Aaron Carter to name just a few. While Charles’s fame may be slightly more niche than his mainstream counterparts, he was by no means insulated from the cruel delight with which the people who built him up rushed to take him down.Charles made a fatal error in his handling of the situation – one which it seemed might cost him any chance of overcoming the mass exodus of his followers: he uploaded an apology video.Tati Westbrook following the James Charles \u0027Bye Sister\u0027 scandal: \u0027I don\u0027t want you guys hating him\u0027YouTube has seen so many apology videos that the concept has become a meme in and of itself. Earlier this year, images of a child who attended VidCon – the world’s biggest YouTuber convention – dressed as an apology video went viral. These videos are generally portrayed as unscripted and teary, with the influencer in question usually make-up free and wearing the strangely ubiquitous grey hoodie.Writing about the “apology video genre” for Vice, journalist Bettina Makalintal says: “On YouTube, apologies …\u0026nbsphave become just another product. With high-profile stars always selling something, the apology video is a necessary step of damage control. And if the scandal blows up enough, the apology video can be a way of reeling in new viewers, too – plenty of people, I’m sure, hadn’t heard of Tati Westbrook or James Charles until explainers of their situation ended up everywhere.”Indeed, Charles’s eight-minute now-deleted response video, somewhat gauchely titled “Tati”, did little but add fuel to the fire, and gave viewers further fodder to ridicule him. Grey hoodie-clad and make-up-free, he emphasised how distressed he was by the situation, and at one point rather bizarrely even spoke directly to his mother to apologise.It seemed like it couldn’t get any worse for Charles, and people speculated that his career was over.Then, on 18 May, just over a week after this all began, Charles came back with a vengeance in a second video about the scandal.\u0026nbspIn flawless make-up and with a crisp white backdrop and not a tear in sight, Charles calmly and respectfully spent 41 minutes breaking down Westbrook’s allegations and – crucially – he provided “receipts” – evidence to back up his claims. Westbrook’s original “Bye Sister”\u0026nbspvideo offered no such proof, and relied on the credibility of her personal brand to back her up. While this initially worked, now followers had questions. Suddenly, a second wave of criticism started to boil up on social media, this time\u0026nbsptowards Westbrook, who\u0026nbspher followers began to feel was more calculated in her original video than they originally believed.Charles quickly gained back more than a million subscribers, while Westbrook’s began to fall. At the time of writing, just over two months after it all began, Charles’s Social Blade is consistently green (meaning he’s gaining followers rather than losing them), and he stands at over 15.9 million subscribers – almost as many as he had before the fateful\u0026nbspSBH\u0026nbspsponsored post.“James Charles turned himself around very quickly, and I thought it was very interesting to see how he handled it,” says Brooks. “A lot of people probably expected him to stay silent for a very long time – but for him, that would mean admitting guilt which he didn’t think he had – or to really hit back in this really extravagant, dramatic, almost bitchy way that we’re used to seeing James do.”After his video was posted, both Westbrook and Star (who had been publicly lashing out against Charles and threatened to post a tell-all video “exposing” him) gracefully backed down, saying they would no longer be addressing any of the allegations.Jeffree Star speaking about his relationships after Charles named him in his ‘No Mores Lies’ video (Jeffree StarYouTube)Within the subsequent couple of weeks most of the videos and tweets made by Westbrook and Star were quietly deleted, leading many to believe this was a carefully orchestrated – and highly successful – act of damage control involving lawyers.That’s not to say Charles hasn’t lost out. His clothing brand Sisters Apparel, which was distributed by Star’s company Killer Merch, was conspicuously unavailable while this unfoldedJames Charles cancels his Sisters tour after Tati Westbrook rowThis is why the James Charles and Tati Westbrook feud matters so muchJeffree Star wades into feud between James Charles and Tati WestbrookHe also had to cancel a series of live events entitled – you guessed it – Sisters Tour, at least in part due to the impact of the feud. It could also affect his chances of gaining brand sponsorships in the future –\u0026nbspespecially given his history of scandals – and there are still\u0026nbspquestions about the allegations of sexual misconduct made by Westbrook, as he is yet to respond directly. Although, he did “vehemently deny” the allegations made by Gage Gomez that he felt pressurised into sexual activity with the YouTuber when the pair attended Coachella together\u0026nbspearlier this year.But Westbrook hasn’t come out of this well either. Although her subscriber count sits at just under 10 million, her Social Blade is consistently red, meaning she’s losing subscribers on a daily basis. This makes sense – with the outrage at Charles all but gone, many people are back to subscribing based on content, rather than moral judgment, and many of Westbrook’s new followers who wanted to jump on the “cancel James Charles” bandwagon may not actually be fans of her video style. Meanwhile devoted followers may be rethinking their loyalty towards her as the motives behind her original video are called into question.It’s hard to imagine another scandal hitting as hard or rippling as wide as this one.\u0026nbspUsers have perhaps learnt a lesson in the potential consequences of acting on impulse.Brooks believes the debacle has changed the YouTube beauty industry. “Since the drama, we’re realising that we’re feeding into a bigger PR machine more than the audience perhaps realised,” she says.She explains that while\u0026nbsp“authenticity” used to be the currency\u0026nbspfor YouTubers among audiences now in their late 20s who consumed this kind of content a decade ago, younger followers are looking more for the dramatic, soap-opera-esque escapism.Kylie Jenner appeared on Charles’s channel for a Halloween special in 2018 (James CharlesYouTube)“We need to reestablish the balance because there is drama, and while that’s OK for some it’s not necessarily setting the best example or showing the beauty industry in the best light. We need to take a step back and look at the creators who aren’t all about the drama and the big flashiness, what they’re doing is be exceptionally talented – and push those people to the forefront.”While the rise, fall, and rise again of James Charles is unlikely to end a culture of scandal and drama among the beauty YouTuber community, it may well be the catalyst for change in the way audiences react to it.In June, YouTuber Jaclyn Hill (6 million subscribers) released a line of lipsticks which was met with disastrous feedback and allegations that they were expired or contaminated due to reports of plastic and metal shards embedded in the lipstick, holes and grittiness in the products and fluff and hairs in\u0026nbspthe formula.For those eagerly awaiting the next YouTube scandal, this was it. It featured a notoriously controversial influencer, hundreds of thousands of angry consumers, conspiracy theories and endless commentary videos and input from other established YouTubers.\u0026nbspAnd yet while the backlash has been harsh, it has also been measured. Drama channels are treating the scandal with care, urging their viewers to be mindful of Hill’s mental health, and while she is losing subscribers, the numbers are in the hundreds, not the millions.\u0026nbspIt’s hard to imagine her getting off so lightly had this occurred pre-James Charles, and that is surely a sign of a change in the tide of influencer backlash and cancel culture.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke).

It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.During\u0026nbspa recent\u0026nbspEmpire\u0026nbspinterview, Feige\u0026nbspdetailed\u0026nbspa scrapped\u0026nbspAvengers: Endgame\u0026nbspscene that would have been extremely traumatic for kids\u0026nbspand, at Comic-Con,\u0026nbspnamed\u0026nbspthe Avenger that could have single-handedly taken down Thanos\u0026nbspin the blockbuster.Feige also revealed Gwyneth Paltrow had no idea Samuel L Jackson was in the MCU – despite co-starring in five films with him.You can find a rundown of the 10 biggest Comic-Con announcements\u0026nbsp – including Natalie Portman’s promotion to female superhero alongside Chris Hemsworth’s Thor\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbsphere,\u0026nbspand a ranking of every character, from worst\u0026nbspto best,\u0026nbsphere.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Home Office and private companies are making billions from ordinary people paying through the nose for visa applications. It’s not fair and ripping them off damages the UK’s international reputation.”Home Office makes millions from outsourcing visas to Dubai-based firmLiberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson Ed Davey said he had\u0026nbspasked the National Audit Office to investigate.“The UK is richer economically and culturally by people moving to work and study here as well as from tourists who want to visit some of the best places in the world. To put up barriers to this by allowing private firms to excessively profiteer from visa applications makes no sense,” he added.Contract documents released under freedom of information laws to Finance Uncovered show the Home Office takes a cut of the revenues these premium services generate, but the department refused to state how much it has received.Stephanie Boyce, deputy vice president of the Law Society of England and Wales, said: “The Home Office’s duty to ensure contracted visa and immigration services are reasonably priced is undermined if it benefits from increased revenue generation.“We want to see far greater accountability and transparency in outsourced visa and immigration services –\u0026nbspa review of domestic and overseas arrangements with contractors is urgently needed.”Nicole Francis, chief executive of Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association, said\u0026nbspthere was a lack of transparency in the Home Office’s contract with VFS and called on the department to “urgently review the contractual arrangements in place with VFS to ensure that customers are adequately protected”.How visitors feel exploited by the UK’s outsourced visa systemThe joint investigation found the amount the Home Office makes on average per visa application had increased from £28.73 to £122.56 in the five years since it outsourced the services to\u0026nbspVFS.VFS, which is contracted to process visas from all countries outside Europe and Africa, has meanwhile increased its average revenue per applicant by 38 per cent between 2016 and 2018 by selling more premium services.The contract handed to\u0026nbspVFS\u0026nbspmade it mandatory for contractors to provide certain “premium services”, including premium lounges and priority visa services, some costing in excess of £1,500. The Home Office said that when the contract was renewed in 2018, premium lounges were removed as a mandated service.Fees were also introduced for applicants wishing to make a query about their application, at £5.48 per query for the email service and £1.37 per minute for the phone helpline.It follows calls for\u0026nbspan independent investigation into the in-country visa system, which has also been outsourced to a private company – French firm\u0026nbspSopra\u0026nbspSteria – after it emerged vulnerable people were forced to pay “extortionate” fees and travel long distances to apply for UK status.A Sopra Steria spokesperson said at the time that its service was experiencing “higher than anticipated demand” and that it would be increasing the availability of free appointments at its core centres.In relation to the VFS contract, a Home Office spokesperson said it demanded the highest standards from service providers.A VFS spokesperson said optional services were “developed in response to specific demands from applicants for greater accessibility, personalisation and convenience in visa services – they are determined in consultation with, and agreed by, the respective governments”. The spokesperson\u0026nbspadded that the services were clearly labelled as optional, while visa decisions were “the sole prerogative of the concerned embassyconsulate”.UK Visas and Immigration\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But reality is more complicatedClick to followThe IndependentIf Britain wants a trade deal with the US, it must accept American food standards, including those allowing genetic modification and chicken to be washed in chlorine, the head of America’s farming lobby has said.Both of those practices are controversial in the UK. Washing chicken carcasses in chlorinated water to kill off harmful bacteria is banned in the EU. And unlike the US, the EU has also not approved any fresh genetically modified (GM) fruit or vegetables for human consumption.But Zippy Duvall, head of the American Farm Bureau, said concerns over the practices are not “science-based”.“There is no scientific basis that says that washing poultry with a chlorine wash, just to be safe of whatever pathogens might be on that chicken as it was prepared for the market, should be taken away,” Mr Duvall, a poultry farmer in Georgia, told BBC Radio 4.“If there was something wrong with it, our federal inspection systems would not be allowing us to use that.”Created with Sketch.The exercise it takes to burn off high-calorie foods Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.310 Chicken and bacon sandwich - 445 calories 410 One quarter of a large pizza (449kcal)610 Packet of crisps - 171 calories910 One bowl of cereal - 172 calories310 Chicken and bacon sandwich - 445 calories 410 One quarter of a large pizza (449kcal)610 Packet of crisps - 171 calories910 One bowl of cereal - 172 caloriesBoth the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the British Poultry Council have said eating meat treated in that way is safe.However, the EFSA opposes chlorine rinsing because it enables farmers to lower their standards of animal welfare and hygiene as they can simply use a chemical bath to kill off any harmful pathogens after animals are slaughtered.The EU takes what it calls an integrated approach to food safety, “from farm to fork covering all sectors of the food chain”. As part of that approach, there are minimum legal requirements for the amount of space, lighting and ventilation in EU poultry-rearing houses.As there are no laws governing this in the US, the birds can be crammed in tightly, according to Simon Dawson, a food safety expert at Cardiff politan University. This reduces production costs but increases the risks of disease and contamination in a flock.“Some US abattoirs and processing plants rely heavily on chlorination because their other hygiene standards are so poor that they would be illegal in Europe,” Mr Dawson wrote in 2017.“The process is also very good at removing odours and surface slime, meaning the meat can be passed off as fresh for much longer than it should be.”The EU is less strict on GM food, allowing some such products to be sold provided the EFSA has deemed them safe and they are labelled as GM.The World Health Organisation says it is not possible to make general statements on the safety of all GM crops, and that each food should be assessed separately.Earlier this week, Donald Trump’s national security adviser said the UK will be “first in line” for a trade deal with the US after Brexit.John Bolton suggested that the US could focus on striking bilateral trade deals in certain sectors like manufacturing and car-making and work out more complicated areas later.According to Mr Duvall, though, any trade agreement would have to include agriculture.“To have a trade treaty and not discuss agriculture would be turning your back on rural America and that’s where a big part of our population lives,” he said.A government spokesperson said: “Any future deal with the US must work for UK consumers, farmers and companies.\u0026nbsp“We have been clear on numerous occasions that we will not compromise on our high food or animal welfare standards as part of any trade deals.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Overall, I think they did a good job despite incredibly arduous conditions.”Another officer, who also did not want to be named, told the paper the area where Nora was found is still being investigated by forensic experts to seethere were any signs Nora was abducted or assaulted before her death.The officer added: “We have found no evidence to support a criminal element so far and we are continuing to examine the area where she was found for clues. Locals are also being interviewed.“The circumstances surrounding her death remain a complete mystery. Nora was barefoot and dressed only in her underwear when she disappeared from an open hall window of her holiday bungalow on the first night of the family’s holiday.“Snfer dogs only picked up her trail about  metres from the lodge, and how a child with special needs could have walked nearly two miles into dense forest and through a steep ravine is mystying.“Everyone is very upset and we have agonised over how she ended up in a waterfall area that had been combed by search teams in the first seven days.”The window was also open in the room that Nora had been sharing with her two siblings.August : Missing persons charity The Lucie Blackman Trust says that Malaysian police are treating Noras disappearance as a potential abduction, but officers deny there is any foul play involved.August : Noras family say they believe her to have been abducted.She never goes anywhere by herself. We have no reason to believe she wandered off and is lost.August : Police say they are analysing unidentied fingerprints an open window and in a downstairs hall  found in the familys hotel suite.August : Police investigate whether footprints found in the forest where Nora went missing belong to the missing teen. Her family say she wouldnt have wandered off on her own.August : Noras family thank the search teams involved since the teenagers disappearance.August : Hundreds of rescuers still involved in the search operation a week after she disappeared.August : A visibly emotional Mrs Quoirin makes a further appeal for her daughter tohome.Nora is our first child. She has been vulnerable since the day she was born.She is so precious to us and our hearts are breaking. We are appealing to anyone who has information about Nora to help us find her.A reward of £, - donated by an anonymous Belfast business - is made available for information leading to Noras safe .August : A body is found and police said Noras parents confirmed it was her .August : An initial post-mortem examination inconclusiveAugust : Post-mortem finds that Nora died of intestinal bleeding after a stomach ulcer burst, probably caused by hunger and stress.The comments come after a volunteer member of the search team said it would have been impossible for the barefoot -year-old to cross the dense jungle on her own.Nora suffered from physical and mental dficulties - making it extremely unlikely that she would have ended up near the ravine without any help.The treacherous gradients and dense vegetation surrounding the place where Nora was found would have been impossible for her to reach.This new information has generated even more doubt over the police theory that she reached the site alone after wandering off from her familys holiday chalet.While the authorities have ruled out any foul play, her family are insistent that she couldnt have walked out on her own.The volunteer, who is an expert on the area surrounding the remote Lata Berembum waterfall, said: Nora couldn’t have got there by herself.I struggled to walk. The path is dficult even for an able-bodied person.Dense vegetation snags your feet. The average gradient of the slopes where Nora was found range from  to  per cent.You have to cross two reasonably deep streams to reach the area where she was found.The terrain by the stream is very slippery. The roots and rocks are wet.My boots were destroyed by the end and Nora was barefoot.I can’t imagine how she could have walked to the place where she was found.Nora’s family have consistently said they cant believe she walked out on her own - and this new information has brought more speculation to the theory.Nora - who had learning dficulties - was reported missing by her parents Meabh, , and Sebastien, , at am Sunday August .Two days later, local police were told a “white girl” had been spotted swimming in a nearby river the afternoon she went missing but were said to be unsure whether to believe the eyewitness.Nora wandered around the jungle for a week before her body was found by volunteer hiker – three days after she died – and the family’s lawyer has said it is possible she would have met someone in that time.It has been claimed Malaysian police made five key blunders in the hunt for Nora and that she could have been saved.Child protection expert Jim Gamble who has been advising Noras family told Sky News that there are still questions to be answered about the teen’s disappearance and death.He said the Malaysian authorities should keep an open mind despite them insisting Nora’s death wasn’t the result of foul play.Gamble, the former chief executive of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, also told the BBCs Breakfast said the cottage window where the family was faulty and could not have been locked and could have been opened from the outside.A post-mortem examination found she died from internal bleeding in her intestine after a stomach ulcer burst, following a period of prolonged hunger and stress.Grandad Sylvain Quoirin, , has claimed that “someone tampered with her body” believing she was dumped at the waterfall by sinister forces in an attempt to “get rid of her” and called for a fresh criminal investigation.Retired businessman Sylvain told The : She wasn’t there yet [during previous searches]. Someone put her there.“Can you imagine her walking .km, naked and barefoot, over rocks, in the middle of the night  For me, that’s absurd.He added: “Do you think she would go walking around at night  For me, it is obviously a criminal case, by default. She could not have wandered.”Mr Quoirin insisted there were “dark areas that need to be cleared up for the family to be able to grieve in peace”.Police in Malaysia have also arrested a -year-old man after he posted on social media alleging Nora had been raped by a local tribesman.Nora was on trip of a letime with her family including sister Innes,  and brother Maurice, eight, at the time of her disappearance.The teen had only arrived the day earlier with her parents and two siblings at the resort in a nature reserve near Seremban,  miles south of the capital Kuala Lumpur.Noras parents are an Irish-French couple who have lived in London for about  years.Her family paid tribute to the youngster and also thanked people across the world for their support.Nora is at the heart of our family. She is the truest, most precious girl and we love her infinitely.

We come together as a brotherhood at times like this and hopefully your family can take some comfort from that love and support.”The Union Jack at a local parish church flew at half-mast in tribute to the killed officer.At a press conference Det Supt Kent said: “A post-mortem was carried out on Andrew’s body yesterday and the cause of death has been recorded as multiple injuries.“The cause of death is consistent with our current belief that Andrew was caught between a vehicle and the surface of a road and then dragged for a distance. However, the circumstances as to how Andrew came to be out of his vehicle and then caught under the suspect vehicle is unknown.”Andrew had been due to go on honeymoon to Australia next week with new we Lissie, .Det Supt Kent revealed he was responding to a reported burglary in the nearby village of Bradfield Southend when the horror unfolded.PC ANDREW Harper embodied the values that make our police service the finest in the world — courage, professionalism and commitment.Like tens of thousands of officers, he was simply performing his duties, yet fell victim to a terrible and cowardly violent act.By all accounts he was a lovely man, newly married, and the pain this loss will have caused his family, friends and colleagues is unimaginable.I’m sure I speak on behalf of the country to say we stand with them, and the policing family, and will offer every support.From the outset, the new Government has made clear our commitment to give police the resources and powers they need to do their crucial work.All our brave officers must know we’re committed to their safety as they face the challenges each day brings.PC Harper gave his young le in the service of our safety. We must remember him and his sense of duty as we strive to make our country safer still.She said: “While responding, the officers located a vehicle that was suspected to be involved in the burglary.Within an hour of the incident happening we arrested ten males aged between  and  years on suspicion of murder.“I can confirm the males were arrested from a local authority-run caravan and mobile home site, Four Houses Corner.Earlier today we sought a -hour extension to their custody and this was granted at Reading magistrates’ court.”Meanwhile, police are also concerned for the safety of the victims of the burglary that Andrew was called to.Extra security measures are expected to be put in place for those victims.A source told The Sun: “The care home and house beside the crime scene were not targeted in a burglary that night.The residents didn’t even realise something had happened until the police turned up.”PM Boris Johnson has described the killing of Andrew as a “mindless and brutal crime”. He was the first police officer to be killed in the line of duty since PC Keith Palmer, , was stabbed to death by Khalid Masood in the Westminster terror attack in .Meanwhile, a fundraising page set up by Andrew has been flooded with donations since his death.

But there is now no prospect of Yellowhammer’s national emergency. By Halloween, we will be ready to go.There will be no public demand for bird-spotter Ken Clarke to volunteer as caretaker PM “once I find out what the Devil’s going on”.We now have TWO Magic Grandpas!

Corbyn will do nothing, either as Labour leader or — heaven forbid! — as PM to stop us leaving.By contrast, Speaker John Bercow will “fight with every breath in my body” to stop Parliament being shut down so Britain can slip across the Halloween deadline and out of the EU.This egomaniac, known as The Poison Dwarf, is the most powerful figure in Westminster — and the most dangerous.His ambition is to go down as the most famous Speaker in House of Commons history.His hero is said to be illustrious predecessor William Lenthall, who four centuries ago backed Parliament against King Charles I, triggering the Civil War which cost Charles his head.This time, though, it will not be Parliament against the Crown. It will be rebel MPs versus the democratically expressed wishes of their own voters.Boris Johnson will not resignhe loses a confidence vote. He will call a general election immediately after Britain has left the EU on October .There is talk about a challenge to the Supreme Court but judges are unlikely to intervene against a PM executing the will of the people. Only the Queen could stop him — and there’s no chance of that.Would Bercow take this clash to the bitter end, sending in troops to drag Boris out of Number Ten — and providing a springboard for a Tory election landslide It is hard to know what goes on in the heads of fanatical Remainers.Whatthey get their own way, delay Brexit and leave a humiliated UK swinging half-in, half-out of the EU, coughing up a £billion lump sum and paying £bn a year for the privilege Imagine the bomb-site political landscape after a Parliamentary lynch mob sabotages the wishes of .m voters.We would be looking at another civil war, Mr Speaker.Brussels and Remain diehards need to wake up.

Not for a moment did they envisage having to act on it.The letter was — like almost everything Mr Corbyn has ever said or done — about posturing rather than acting. The Labour leader spent  years as a backbencher before his elevation to being Leader of the Opposition.During those three decades he achieved precisely nothing.Had he not been elected leader, the few people to have been aware of his existence would have known him as a minor fringe MP who hung out with terrorists and racists.The sum total of his contribution to politics as a backbencher was to have proposed  Early Day Motions, the parliamentary equivalent of tweeting.Topics which he considered worth his time included “seal genitalia”, “Disney children’s pyjamas” and an MI proposal to use pigeons as flying bombs.Mr Corbyn’s natural disposition is to tear down, to criticise and to oppose.He could not even bring himself to support his own party when it was in power, voting against the last Labour government  times.There is not a single piece of legislation that owes anything to his contribution.This is the context in which his and Labour’s seemingly incoherent stance on Brexit — one day against another referendum, another day for one one day for Brexit, another day for Remain — must be seen.He is uninterested in the mechanics of a concrete solution. He has no real views on the details of Brexit or even how we get there.For Mr Corbyn, Brexit is a means to an end — which is as a vehicle to power.That is why, for example, he has on  occasions instructed Labour MPs either to abstain or to vote with the Government on Brexit, rather than attempting in any serious way to force the Government to change course, either over the type or Brexit on offer or a second referendum.He wants Brexit.He and his coterie of revolutionary socialists believe that leaving without a deal will be chaotic and that in that chaos Labour will be swept into office.But that, by definition, requires Brexit both to happen and to be chaotic.Most of his party take a dferent view — most are Remainers — so every so often the Corbynites view it as tactically wise to offer the appearance of wanting to work against the Government’s version of Brexit.Hence yesterday’s letter. But it is all meaningless posing. In her speech yesterday rejecting Mr Corbyn’s demand that she support him as PM, Jo Swinson hit the nail on the head.She said: “In my first week as leader of the Liberal Democrats I called on Jeremy Corbyn to table a vote of no confidence in the Government and I asked him to table it before summer recess, because that was the only way to be sure we could hold an election before crashing out on the st of October.”You do not have to share Ms Swinson’s opposition to Brexit to accept that her analysis is spot on.Mr Corbyn refused to table such a vote of no confidence at the end of July. Had he actually wanted to avoid No Deal, he would have done.There was every chance Boris Johnson’s new government would have lost and we would now be in the middle of an election campaign.Whatever the outcome of that election, we would not — as we are now — be spending time analysing the prospects of a so-called government of national unity or looking at cynical letters written by the Labour leader.Mr Corbyn and his allies doubtless think they are being extremely clever, riding two horses at the same time.But his problem is that every time he opens his mouth, the unsuitability for office becomes ever clearer. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It shows a transformation in the approach, that Boris Johnson is willing to leave on a fixed date with no question of extension.“It’s the do-or-die pledge in black and white. It’s not merely symbolic. Once it’s signed that’s it, the UK is leaving.”MPs voted to repeal the European Communities Act of , legislation that brought Britain in the EU, with a majority of  votes in September this year.In doing so they pushed through the European Union Withdrawal Act  - which will be put into effect when Barclay signs the commencement order.This is legislation designed to bring into force the whole or part of an Act of Parliament which may have been previously delayed.Boris Brexit plan is said to have enraged Tory rebels, frustrated because they cant legally stop the order being signed.Tory Remainer Dominic Grieve is set to challenge the order by reversing it retrospectively, Guido Fawkes reports.Meanwhile Sajid Javid is in Berlin today for the UK governments first meetings with Berlin.Finance minister Olaf Sholz tweeted: Good meeting today with my new UK colleague @sajidjavid. We discussed #Brexit and future cooperation. The EU stands united and is ready for all scenarios. The best and only way for an orderly withdrawal is the negotiated #Brexitdeal.BoJos message to Brussels comes as a fresh civil war erupts among the Conservatives after rebels vowed to work with Jeremy Corbyn to stop No Deal.Eurosceptic Tories were outraged after Remainers including Dominic Grieve, Oliver Letwin and Caroline Spelman - along with independent Nick Boles - wrote to the Labour boss yesterday.The letter said they had a common priority to work together to prevent No Deal Brexit and they welcomed his invite.And they added: We would be happy to meet with you as well as colleagues from other opposition parties whenever convenient in the weeks before Parliament s.But they insisted they wanted to discuss the dferent ways that this might be achieved - in a hint they wouldnt back him to be PMit came down to it.The letter was the most positive reaction to Mr Corbyns call, which was rejected by all sides of the political spectrum.But Tories reacted with fury at the idea that their own side was talking to the Opposition at all.Iain Duncan Smith told The Sun: It’s contemptible than anyone would talk to an anti Semitic Marxist about possibly forming a government.And he wrote in thetoday that trying to stop Brexit would be the true betrayal.The thought that anyone would listen to this man, who stood on a manesto in  to deliver on the vote to leave the EU while opposed to a second referendum, but who now declares he is in favour of a second referendum, is ludicrous, he wrote.The message to those like Mr Hammond who want to block Brexit and to those who would do deals with Mr Corbyn to block Brexit is this: leaving with no deal isn’t a betrayal of the British people, but trying to stop it is.Mr Corbyns plot to take power as a caretaker PM to delay Brexit again and call a fresh election has been slapped down by most of the opposition MPs - who said they will refuse to work with him.The Liberal Democrats, Greens, SNP and Plaid all agreed they wanted to work together to stop a No Deal Brexit, but poured cold water on his demands to be installed in NoBoris Johnson is brought down.New Lib Dem boss Jo Swinson said this morning that he doesnt command support right across the House of Commons, and he has not been much use, frankly, on the issue of Brexit."},{"url":null,"title":"michael gove says no deal brexit dossier is worst case scenario and leaked by disgruntled former minister","story":"Published by The Sunday Times, the documents warn Britain will be hit with a three-month meltdown at its ports, a hard Irish border and shortages of food and medicine - but Kwasi Kwarteng, in charge of Brexit, dismissed it as playing into Project Fear.According to the documents petrol import tarfs would inadvertently lead to the closure of two oil refineries, while protests across the UK could require signicant amounts of police resources in a no-deal scenario.They also warn Gibraltar could face delays of up to four hours at the border with Spain for at least a few months.A senior Whitehall source told the newspaper: This is not Project Fear - this is the most realistic assessment of what the public face with no deal.These are likely, basic, reasonable scenarios - not the worst case.However, when asked about the dossier, Minister Kwasi Kwarteng told Skys Sophy Ridge on Sunday: I think there is a lot of scaremongering around and a lot of people are playing into Project Fear and all the rest of it.Weve got to prepare for No Deal.In fact the previous prime minister created DExEU and she said that the mandate of DExEU last year, last summer, was to prepare for no-deal...Now weve got a new Prime Minister who is very much focused on that and the scale and intensity of those preparations are increasing and we will be fully prepared to leave without a deal on October .According to reports, the leaked documents surfaced before Boris Johnson - who has made his enthusiasm for a No Deal Brexit clear - actually became Prime Minister.The dossier reveals:Meanwhile Downing Street has reportedly blamed Philip Hammonds camp for leaking the secret documents.The blame comes just days after the Prime Minister unleashed a scathing attack on remainer Philip Hammond.In a letter the Prime Minister slammed the former chancellor for damaging the national interest in his attempts to stop No Deal.Jonson also warned remainers that foul play could could push the nation even closer to a No Deal Brexit as member states would refuse to negotiatethey felt Britain’s withdrawal could be stopped.And Michael Gove, the Cabinet minister responsible for no-deal planning, also tried to play down fears today.He claimed the cross-government paper for a no deal Brexit - codenamed Operation Yellowhammer - was a worst case scenario.The Brexiteer tweeted: We dont normally comment on leaks - but a few facts - Yellowhammer is a worst case scenario - v signicant steps have been taken in the last  weeks to accelerate Brexit planning -

Thats why we want a deal.But it is also the case that the UK government is far more prepared now than it was in the past.But a former head of the British civil service, Lord Bob Kerslake, who described the document as credible, said the dossier lays bare the scale of the risks we are facing with no-deal Brexit in almost every area.He added: These risks are completely insane for this country to be taking and we have to explore every avenue to avoid them.Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney said, in a tweet, that Ireland had always been clear a hard border in Ireland must be avoided.The leak comes as Boris Johnson prepares to travel to Berlin to meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday, before going to Paris to meet French President Emmanuel Macron the following day.Mr Johnson has repeatedly vowed to leave the bloc on Halloween with or without a deal - and pointed the finger at the anti-democratic EU for pushing the UK towards a No Deal by refusing to negotiate.After more than three years of Brexit dominating EU affairs, the bloc has repeatedly refused to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement which includes an Irish border insurance policy that Johnsons predecessor, Theresa May, agreed in November.Mr Johnson will tell Mrs Merkel and Mr Macron there must be a new Brexit deal when he makes his first trip abroad as PM.Details of the PMs travel plans emerged as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn reiterated his call for MPs to work together to prevent a no-deal Brexit.Mr Corbyn, who set out his plan to be installed as a caretaker prime minister last week to stop the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal, said his proposal is the most democratic way to prevent a no-deal."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/health-news/\" class=\"t-s-border-color t-p-color\"\u003eHealth News\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"swiper-button-prev t-s-background-color__before t-p-background-color swiper-button-disabled\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"icon icon-arrow-left icon-arrow-left-white t-p-background-color\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"swiper-button-next t-s-background-color__before t-p-background-color\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"icon icon-arrow-right icon-arrow-right-white t-p-background-color\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/section\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"main-content\" class=\"main-content-wrap theme-main has-section-nav \" tabindex=\"-1\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"billboard\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"advert-wrapper advert-wrapper--billboard\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"billboard\" class=\"dfp-ad\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003csection class=\"sun-container__article-section theme-news\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"sun-row sun-container__home-section--breaking\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"col sun-col-6\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"teaser-item teaser__video teaser-item--breaking\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"teaser__image-container\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"teaser__copy-container\"\u003e\u003cheader class=\"article__header\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article__strapline\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003csection class=\"article__headline-section--offset article__headline-section\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"article__kicker t-p-color\"\u003eCRUISE CONTROL \u003c/span\u003e\u003ch1 class=\"article__headline\"\u003eTom Cruise moves his family into his luxury Scientology apartment block ‘to stop them leaving cult like Katie Holmes’\u003c/h1\u003e\u003c/section\u003e\u003c/header\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article__meta article_standard article_isFeaturedVideo t-p-border-color\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article__name-date\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article-slug article-slug--article-page t-p-background-color\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"article-slug__copy\"\u003eExclusive\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article__author\"\u003e\u003cul class=\"article__ul\" itemProp=\"author\"\u003e\u003cli class=\"article__author-list t-p-background-color__before\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"article__author-name t-p-color\"\u003eChris White\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cul class=\"article__time\"\u003e\u003cli class=\"article__published\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"article__datestamp\"\u003e18 Aug 2019,\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"article__timestamp\"\u003e 21:58\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli class=\"article__updated\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"article__datestamp\"\u003eUpdated: 19 Aug 2019,\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"article__timestamp\"\u003e 1:55\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"bc-video-6074230396001\" class=\"brightcove brightcove--is-featured \"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"lazyload brightcove__holder\"\u003e\u003cvideo data-account=\"5067014667001\" data-is-featured=\"true\" data-player=\"default\" data-video-id-pending=\"6074230396001\" id=\"video_60742303960","title":"tom cruise katie holmes scientology apartment california","story":"The actors three sisters Cass Capazorio, Lee Anne Gillotte and Marian Henry have all purchased apartments at The Skyview, Florida, property records show.The Church dedicated condo is situated just yards away from its global headquarters in Clearwater.They now live on the third, fourth and fth floors, while their -year-old brother has got the eighth and ninth floor, two-story penthouse.We can also reveal that Cruise has hoovered up two other apartments on the second and third floor respectively -

It was a sunny August evening when the hospital rang to say they had a liver for her.An ambulance was sent to collect her, racing through the streets with blue flashing lights. ‘I walked down to the theatre holding my mum and dad’s hands.aposI said, “Don’t get upset, I’m just going to say goodbye now – but I’ll see you when I wake up.”aposI think that was the first time I’ve ever seen my dad upset,’ says Shelley.‘I was in theatre for eight hours, and unconscious for three days afterwards.’ Waking up with a stranger’s organ in her body was an odd feeling.   ‘It was bittersweet,’ she says.‘Obviously I was very pleased to have a new chance at health, but it was strange to know someone had died to save my le.aposI wrote a letter to the donor’s family to say thank you, but I never heard anything back. aposAll I know is that he was a -year-old male who died in a car crash.’ Instant connection At first, Shelley recovered well, but six months later, in January , her body began to reject the liver.‘I take medication every day to stop my body rejecting the organ, but sometimes your immunity gets low and you start to reject it.aposSo I found myself in hospital once again, hooked up to a drip of antibiotics.’ It was there that Shelley met Wayne, a -year-old lt engineer. Like Shelley, Wayne had already gone through a liver transplant in , in his case after inflamed bile ducts led to organ damage. But Wayne’s body had rejected the new liver, and he was awaiting a second transplant. ‘We got chatting in the TV room, and something just felt right,’ says Shelley.‘I was wearing a vest top and pyjama bottoms and my hair was a mess, but he was in PJs too.aposWe hit it off right away and began having dates in the day room, and taking walks to get coffee together.aposHe was just such a nice, caring bloke, and so easy to talk to.’ A few days later, Shelley had recovered enough to be discharged.But when she went to say goodbye to Wayne, she found him fast asleep.Thinking quickly, Shelley scrawled a note on his bedside table wishing him luck with his transplant and asking him to stay in touch.  A week later, she received a call from his son Jack, who she’d never met before.‘He told me that Wayne was about to go in for his operation,’ she remembers.‘I told Jack I’d be thinking of him, and asked him to call me when he recovered.’ A few days later, Wayne called and asked her to visit him at King’s College Hospital, London, and Shelley happily hopped on a train from Folkstone.From that moment on, Shelley and Wayne were inseparable. ‘When I had the transplant, I thought my chances of finding love were behind me,’ she says.‘I was left with a large scar from the operation and felt very self-conscious about my stomach.aposI’d been through so much with my illness, I thought I would never find someone who would understand.’ In , Wayne and Shelley went on a cruise around the Mediterranean.‘We were just in a jewellery shop, trying on rings, and I saw one that I really liked,’ she said. ‘I carried on looking, but when I turned around, Wayne was down on one knee with the ring.aposHe asked me to marry him and I said yes right away.’ The happy couple got married in .aposIt was a wonderful day with friends and family, including Wayne’s grown-up children Jack, , and Charlie, .They even invited doctors, nurses and the receptionist from the ward where they met.Just like the way they met, their honeymoon was unusual: a trip to the Transplant Games, where Shelley competes each year for darts and bowling, while Wayne competes in badminton.Shelley even won a bronze medal. Forever grateful Wayne and Shelley both have check-ups every six months, and see the same consultant. They always attend appointments together, and doctors can’t believe how they met.‘We always get lots of smiles when we go for our check-ups,’ says Shelley.‘People love hearing the story of how we met.aposWe bonded over the big scary operations we’ve both had, and because we both know what the other is going through, we can look after one another.aposIf Wayne gets ill, I know how to look after him, and he’s always caring for me.’ The couple are both now in good health, though have to be extra vigilant with their health.The donors who lost their lives so they could live are never far from their minds.‘Every year on the anniversary of our transplants, Wayne and I go out for dinner and raise a glass to the lost ones,’ says Shelley.‘Wayne has also written to his donor’s family to tell them how grateful he is.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"ex professional footballer ended up","story":"NewsEx-professional footballer ended up homeless and popping  pills a dayTyrone Kirk, , has opened up about how his le fell apart following the death of his dad and marriage breakdownShareCommentsByCharlie Wilson:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsFormer footballer Tyrone Kirk has opened up about his struggles \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA former professional footballer has revealed how his le collapsed after he ended up homeless and drawn into crime. Tyrone Kirk, who played for Scunthorpe United before trials at Manchester City, Sheffield United and St Johnstone, appeared in court last week and admitted stealing perfume. He later told Scunthorpe Live he became addicted to painkillers following the death of his father and the breakdown of his marriage. He also said he had hoped to be sent to prison so he could get the help he needs.

It all started going downhill when my father died. After that, I became depressed - it was around that time I got into taking Tramadol.

He said: Alcohol just wasnapost my thing - it never has been, but I needed something at that point, I canapost really explain it. I ended up on painkillers. Taking them just helped me escape from everything I guess. I became extremely addicted to them. It was an awful, awful time in my le. I wanted to get help from a professional but I was ashamed. I was embarrassed. Being a professional footballer at a young age, I have pride in myself, you know  I thought I could get through it on my own.    It got to a stage where I was just taking them as a cry for help I think, I needed to come off them, but I was just so low that I probably didnapost care. I needed to get help and Iaposm glad I did. Coming off the Tramadol was the beginning of me turning my le around. Tyrone says his we helped him through that dficult time and was very supportive. However, he claims while he was recovering to get over his addiction, he discovered his we was having an affair. He chose to walk out of this home and having nowhere to turn to, lived on the streets. It was in this time in which he committed offences to get off drugs and, on a previous occasion when he was given an eight-month prison sentence, had asked to be jailed. Last week he appeared in court and admitted stealing perfume from Debenhams in Scunthorpe in May.   "},{"url":null,"title":"funniest joke edinburgh fringe festival","story":"NewsFunniest joke of Edinburgh Fringe Festival revealed - and its about a vegetableA vegetable pun was chosen as the best joke at this years Edinburgh Fringe Festival, in ScotlandShareCommentsByCraig SimpsonMatthew Dresch:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video olaf-falafel-wins-edinburgh-festival-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe best joke at the Edinburgh Fringe has been named as a vegetable pun which beat the comic competition.

These days, far from flying by the seat of their pants as their predecessors did, it is a hi-tech profession. But even with the RAF’s new £million F-B Lightning stealth fighters – the most advanced and ­expensive weapons system in military history –there is a problem, incredibly, the solution is the same as with your phone... just turn it on and off again. Flight Lieutenant Bally is the star of new ITV documentary Fighter Pilot: The Real Top Gun, which goes inside the cockpit to reveal the intense training these brave men and women undergo to fly the new jewel in the RAF’s crown.    However, his first encounter with the plane at a training base in South ­Carolina in the US did not go to plan – he couldn’t start the plane. The jet has a sophisticated security system to keep out the enemy with its radar-evading stealth technology, but it’s so secure that sometimes its own pilot cannot log in. Bally’s instructor, a US Marine by the name of Chandler, explains: “It’s a process we call ‘cold iron’. “Essentially it’s like pressing ‘control, alt, delete’ for a computer. Because the jet is a big computer, we shut it down and restart it. Hopefully that clears up any hiccups , and we can go from there.” THERE are only eight frontline female fighter pilots in the UK. Danielle, known as Danners, , hopes to join the Lightning squad. But first she has to pass a gruelling course at the RAF’s academy in North Wales. Like Bally, she does not liken herself to Maverick. She said: “I don’t see myself as the stereotypical kind of alpha-male fighter pilot. They’re very confident and very outgoing. That just hasn’t been me.” Before training to fly the Lightning, Danners, from the Midlands, was a Flight Lieutenant in the  Naval Air Squadron. She decided to join the Navy after having a flight in a glider on a school trip. She says: “That’s when the bug hit for me.”   Raring to go, Bally – his nickname – has to wait for Chandler to fix the problem before he can fly the jet for the first time. “I was thinking, ‘this is absolutely typical’,” he says. “But we’re talking about something which is the cutting edge of military technology. “Everything’s got to be set up in the right order for it to work and one of those beeps or squeaks might not happen in the right order and you might have to restart it again. “Switching it off and on fixes most things!” And then he’s away at speeds of up to ,mph, which would terry the rest of us. “There’s certainly no fear, some nervousness, which heightens the senses a little,” he says.  “One of the first things you do on that first trip is to go ­supersonic. When you break the sound barrier, which you can do in a climb at ,ft, all the aircraft does is wallow a little from left to right and then everything s­tabilises again. “And that’s it – it’s smooth as anything. It’s an ­incredible experience. The manoeuvrability and ­performance is eye-watering. It is phenomenal the climb rate, the speed, the ­performance in the turn, it is fantastic.” Bally serves in the RAF’s legendary  Squadron – the Dam Busters – and was a Tornado jet pilot for four years before qualying to the fly the Lightning. So, how much of a Maverick – the character Tom Cruise plays in  hit film Top Gun – is the dad-of-two  “I didn’t want to upset Tom Cruise, but I think the only thing we have in common is height! Certainly not money or good looks,” the -year-old laughs. “Growing up Top Gun was one of my favourite films. But no, I think Maverick would actually be in jail in real le or at the very least, he wouldn’t be flying fast jets anymore. Maverick is not what we’re after in real fighter jet pilots!” Do the real top guns sit around quoting the film to one another   “No we actually do not,” he says ­defiantly. “I think there’s an unwritten rule that you’ll be fined a crate of beersyou quote it to anyone!” It was during a walking holiday in the Lake District when he was a lad that Bally, who grew up in Scotland, realised he wanted to become a fighter pilot. “I’m one of those lucky people that is really following a dream doing this job. I remember walking through the lakes and on the hills I’d hear that roar of a jet. “One time a Harrier flew over my head. The aircraft was inverted and pulling down into a valley over the ridge we were walking down. I looked up and I could see the pilot looking down on me. I thought, ‘Wow I would love to do that’.” Before flying the Lightning, Bally served in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria in a Tornado fighter jet. “It can be hard,” he admits. “Flying on ops is long sorties, punctuated by moments of extreme adrenaline and a requirement to be absolutely on top of your game, which is really challenging after a long period of flying.  “In that moment, when you’re being asked to carry out ops, you’re focused on carrying it out to the best of your ability and doing it utterly professionally. “That is crucial. We need to make sure we don’t make a mistake and don’t end up affecting an unintended target.” It’s not a job for the faint-hearted and he says it’s important to deal with the reality of war once he’s got two feet back on the ground. “You wouldn’t be humanyou didn’t think about it. It’s important to be able to reflect on those things and that you come to terms with that.” The front line isn’t the hard part, he says, but being away from his we and two young children is tough. “It really is painful being away from them for so long at times. Being apart is dficult and my we bears the brunt of that. It’s a team effort, she’s hugely supportive and thank goodness for her.” "},{"url":null,"title":"more sugar chocolate bars ever","story":"NewsSugar levels in chocolate bars soar despite vows to cut them to slash obesityThe Government has called on manufacturers to reduce sugar in chocolate % by next yearShareCommentsByAmy Coles:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsOn average, Cadbury and Nestle have increased sugar by more than % since , researchers found \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSugar levels in popular chocolate bars have soared – despite promises to slash them to fight obesity.

Before her body was found, Noraaposs family had told police they believed she must have been abducted due to the severity of her debilitating brain condition holoprosencephaly - which left her with a smaller than average brain - and meant she would not go anywhere alone”. But Malaysian police - who last night tried to downplay the meeting with the mediums - announced on Thursday there was no evidence of criminality after it was revealed Noraaposs autopsy had found she died after suffering intestinal bleeding, probably caused by starvation and stress.

He was pictured after the billionaire had left the property – which victims described as being full of pornographic and bizarre ornaments – with another female who looked to be in her teens, shivering in a thin jumper while he wore a thick coat. The footage was shot in December , a day after the infamous image of Andrew with Epstein in the city’s Central Park, following his jail release. The park photo embarrassed Buckingham Palace as the Duke of York faced calls to explain why he had not broken links with his disgraced pal. And Buckingham Palace has been quick to deny claims two of Epstein’s alleged victims have made against him since.    But the new footage of Andrew at Epstein’s lair has piled pressure on him to finally come clean about their friendship. One question being asked is how the bizarre features in Epstein’s New York home did not seem to ring alarm bells. Visitors to the £million, nine-storey Manhattan property, which included a steady stream of young women, said it was as weird as Epstein himself – who talked of having his penis ­cryogenically frozen and seeding humanity with his DNA. The entry foyer where Andrew stood to wave off the brunette was decorated with rows of framed articial eyeballs. Close by hung an oil painting of ex-President Bill Clinton in red heels and the semen-stained blue dress that Monica Lewinsky wore when she performed a sex act on him. A chandelier had a le-size female doll hanging from it and his bathroom had prosthetic breasts on the wall so he could play with the nipples while he bathed. A creepy chessboard featured customised figurines modelled on his female staff, apparently dressed suggestively. Behind Epstein’s desk was a  painting by Kees van Dongen called Femme Fatale, showing a woman cupping her exposed left breast.    And another large painting showed Epstein himself in a prison surrounded by barbed wire and gun-toting guards – which he said was “to remind me I could go back to prison any time”. But Andrew apparently brushed off all these indications about Epstein, as he did when others asked him. In a  Vanity Fair article about his relationship with the pervert, a friend of the pair was quoted as saying: “I remember when Andrew and Jeffrey became friends. “Jeffrey had Andrew put on a pair of sweatpants for the first time. He had him wear blue jeans. It was Jeffrey who taught Andrew how to relax. After Jeffrey was convicted, I phoned Andrew and told him, ‘You cannot have a relationship with Jeffrey.’ And he said, ‘Stop giving me a hard time, you’re such a puritan.’  “Our conversation descended into a screaming match and Andrew said, ‘Leave me alone, Jeffrey’s my friend, being loyal to your friends is a virtue’.” Depraved Epstein died in custody nine days ago, aged , while being held on child sex-trafficking charges. His death has been ruled a suicide but this is still being disputed. He had faced trial next June,  years after he was jailed in Florida. In a sweetheart deal in  he admitted procuring an underage girl, aged , for prostitution. He got just  months. An alleged victim, aged , and her parents claimed Epstein molested her at his mansion in Palm Beach, where bathrooms were stocked with soaps shaped like male and female genitalia. Since the  Central Park photo emerged, two of Epstein’s alleged victims have accused Andrew of impropriety. “Sex slave” Virginia Giuffre, then Roberts, claimed she was “lent out” to the Duke for sex on three occasions – one of them in London. And Johanna Sjoberg had alleged that he groped her breast at Epstein’s New York home when she was . Ms Giuffre and Ms Sjoberg made their allegations against Andrew as part of a  Florida court filing. But a judge threw out the claims and ordered them struck from the record as “immaterial and impertinent”. Days before Epstein was found dead, a huge legal dossier containing the lurid allegations was unsealed.  Andrew’s lawyers reiterated their denials, saying: “It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is  and without foundation.” Buckingham Palace also said in  that “any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue”. But despite the repeated denials of wrongdoing, Andrew and the palace have yet to explain the photo of him with his arm around Ms Giuffre, then , in London in  – and why he did not sever his ties with Epstein once he was a ­registered sex offender. Andrew, , was introduced to Epstein in the s by British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, the daughter of the late, disgraced ­newspaper owner Robert. The -year-old was allegedly his fixer for young girls but she denies all claims and has never been arrested. Records detailing flights by Epstein’s private jet reveal that in May , Andrew flew to Palm Beach with him and Maxwell. A month later, Epstein and Maxwell are believed to have attended a bumper royal birthday bash at Windsor, marking Andrew’s th, Princess Anne’s th, Princess Margaret’s th and Prince William’s th. That autumn, Andrew was a guest at a Halloween “hookers and bondage” party in Manhattan, where Maxwell dressed as a prostitute. And in December that year, the Prince hosted a birthday party for Maxwell at Sandringham, which Epstein attended. All three then went to Thailand to celebrate the New Year. Other encounters between Andrew and Epstein are believed to have taken place at the Queen’s Norfolk estate and a dinner in Saint Tropez.

the sides prepare for cup tie","story":"Dundee host Aberdeen in the Betfred Cup on Sunday and, eventhe Dons have had a few early season problems, it’s fair to say anything other than a win for them would be a shock.On the back of relegation, James McPake’s Dark Blues are finding their feet after a major overhaul of the squad during the summer.It means they go into this tie as major underdogs, though history does tell us this is a competition in which Dundee are capable of upsetting the odds.Tonight Tele Sport looks back at a couple of occasions when they have – and some others when the result has been true to the form book.While unlike the present format, this tie was over two legs, it was similar to this clash in that Dundee had just been relegated at the end of the previous season.Aberdeen were at the peak of their powers under Alex Ferguson and, as reigning champions, a bigger knockout tie for them was a European Cup meeting with Liverpool around the same time.That they went out of that competition to the team that would eventually win it was no great surprise but losing to Dundee was.After a draw at Dens in the first leg, the feeling was Donald Mackay’s team were heading to the Granite City hoping for little more than to keep the score respectable.In the end, however, a battling performance saw them hold their own and progress to the semi-finals thanks to a Cammy Fraser strike.Dundee would go on to make the final before losing to city rivals United on a historic day at Dens Park.The only time the north-east rivals have faced up in a national final and it was Aberdeen who lted the trophy with a comfortable Hampden victory.Once again, the pair met with Dundee, under Jim Duffy, out of the top flight but going into the tie on the back of a fine unbeaten run that saw them riding high in the First Division and making the final.For those of a Dark Blue persuasion, however, it quickly became a day to forget as their team didn’t really show up.An effort from former Dens favourite Billy Dodds had Aberdeen ahead by the break and, when Duncan Shearer added a second right at the start of the second half, it was all over bar the shouting.Although Dundee were again in the second tier, with the backing of Aberdeen-based businessman Callum Melville, their strong line-up was always going to provide a stern test for the visiting Dons.So it proved as, despite losing experienced goalkeeper Rab Douglas through injury in the first half, Jocky Scott’s team pulled off the result of the round by winning in extra-time.Goals from Eddie Malone and Craig Forsyth had the home team apparently cruising but a double from Michael Paton saw the proceedings heading into extra-time.As the game ebbed and flowed, one of those Melville-backed signings, a young Leigh Grfiths, came up trumps with the winner.The last time the teams met in a League Cup tie saw Dundee still recovering from a second period of administration that had seen the team almost fold the previous year.Having performed a miracle in keeping the team in the First Division in the   season, boss Barry Smith was looking to pull off a shock at Pittodrie.They battled hard to give him the scalp he wanted but, on the night, came up just short.A tight tie was decided as early as the th minute when home attacker Darren Mackie grabbed the only goal."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44701759-1-240x180.jpg

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

They also make for an excellently contrasting pair.From Mendelssohn’s exuberant opening bars, we are swept through music that is complex yet captivatingly, joyously melodic throughout, while Enescu’s is moody, breathlessly dramatic and, in parts, simply volcanic.Guest directed by Marianne Thorsen, SE will explore the specic charm of seeing a small group of musicians performing live. With fewer instruments, the fabric of the music becomes more tangible, subtle shts in mood may have a new-found presence, and pieces you think you know well might offer surprising new colours when heard live. With fewer musicians on stage, it is easier to follow each inidual path and witness the beautul alchemy of eight artists creating something together.Thorsen is an acclaimed soloist and passionate chamber musician. Former leader of the Nash Ensemble, she regularly performs with Norway’s Trondheim Soloists, one of the founding ensembles of The Bridge network and festival.The first half of the tour, which is called Chamber Notes, will call at Crear Studio, Kilberry, on August , followed by a performance at Mull Theatre, Tobermory, on August  before moving on to Inverness and Dundee.Other Scottish dates, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, are programmed for February .PIC:Marianne Thorsen. no_aMarianne Thorsen"},{"url":null,"title":"pipe band travels to worlds in hairstyle","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +styleviaYOURTWITTERNAMEHERE\" title\"Tweet this\"TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAll roads lead to Glasgow Green this weekend as the World Pipe Band Championships are held in the city.Mid Argyll Pipe Band will be heading to  compete in the Grade A arena, with realistic hopes of bringing home a trophy.And, for the second year running, Icon Hairdressers in Lochgilphead has sponsored a band bus to the championship.Pipe Major Craig Lang said: #We are very grateful to Icon Hairdressers for their generosity, and we look forward to a good world championships at the weekend.#The worlds will be the band#s penultimate competition of the year, with Cowal Games to follow in Dunoon at the end of August.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

We knew it would last forever, but forever had its day.The Twin Peaks-inspired Love Dilation is as dark as it is atmospheric.But it is perhaps the utterly engrossing simplicity of Imprints that makes it so special. While McAndrew has the harmonic range, Smalls almost monotoned meanderings, accompanied by the backing vocals of Grant Pringle and Cameron Jack, creates the rawest of emotions.Concluding the new EP is the orchestral art-song, A Theory of Everything. Built around a single, beautully menacing chord, which apparently symbolises the background radiation in our universe, the finale discusses the search for discovering a unying theory of everything.To quote Small from Imprints, As you travel through space, you are displaced, imagining time. You exist like a plant, you bloom and you grow, then wither and die. But the one card you play, genetically, is always an ace. For the imprints you leave, have changed the fabric of time and space.If there is any justice in the supersonic space-age future, Electron Masss four EPs will hopefully have changed the fabric of

at Barrel Law, near Hawick.In September, plans for an poundm wind farm were rejected by Scottish Borders councillors.The proposal would have seen seven turbines, of up to m in height, erected on land to the north-west of Roberton, near Hawick.The company behind the plans, Germany-based ABO Wind, then submitted an appeal to the Scottish Governmentrsquos planning and environmental appeals ision .As part of that appeal process, the DPEArsquos appointed reporter Elspeth Cook held a hearing at Forman Hall, Roberton.However, the hearing was simply to clary and define legal terms and certain technical standards in order to help inform Ms Cookrsquos decision.For example, one point of contention between Scottish Borders Council and ABO Wind is whether or not the combined appearance of Barrel Law and the existing wind turbines at Langhope Rig will create a lsquolandscape with wind turbinesrsquo or a lsquowind turbine landscapersquo, as per the legally-defined definitions.The councilrsquos position is that a distance of between -km is required in order to maintain the current landscape type in the valley, but ABO Wind suggest the turbines should be less than km apart, as they state that spreading out the two turbine sites would actually make the landscape look more saturated as the wind turbines would effectively cover a larger area.Furthermore, they state that a greater distance between the two developments would push the Barrel Law turbines outside of the topography which makes wind farms viable in this area.Appearing as part of ABO Windrsquos  of representatives, land and development consultant James Welsh told the reporter: ldquoIn our opinion we preserve the distinct identity of the two groups.ldquoThere are examples of wind farms being approved with similar distances between them but still being accepted as being clearly separate wind farms.ldquoTo insist on a greater separation would increase the effect of a cumulative effect between them.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning consultant, Dr Guy Wimble, said: ldquoI donrsquot dispute that they are identiable as separate elements, my issue is the effect of the wind farms on the landscape, and recognising that they are two dferent wind farms not one development.ldquoThe proximity of them makes this appear more of a wind farm landscape rather a landscape with wind farms.ldquoWhile I accept that separating the developments would make the wind farms seem more spaced out, by putting them closer yoursquod increase density.John Campbel QC, appearing on behalf of a group of objectors called Barrel Law Action Group, said: ldquoIf you pull the wind farms apart then clearly you increase the area of cumulative effect.ldquoIf you pull them together, yoursquore going to increase the cumulative effect just by sheer numbers, and you lose the ability to discern the two as distinct entities.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, appearing in his capacity as Scottish Borders Councilrsquos executive member for planning and environment, told the hearing: ldquoIt seems to me that the guidance allows for developments in this area but doesnrsquot necessarily promote it.ldquoNo one is disputing that the two wind farms would be separate, wersquore working to find out what degree of separation would be appropriate.Mr Welsh responded: ldquoIf you increase to a km distance it will push all m turbines outwith the area that has been identied as having the appropriate topography for this type of development.Ms Cook also sought clarication on certain technical points, mostly surrounding tables and figures contained within ious reports submitted by the appellant and the local authority."},{"url":null,"title":"art-thou-shakespeare-cyclists","story":"BORDERS

We anticipate Levenseat will determine the best routes over the coming weeks.An SBC spokesperson added: ldquoThe number of trips to the waste transfer station is largely in line with trips to the previous landfill site, and signicantly less than could have been generated by an integrated waste management facility at Easter Langlee.ldquoAs part of the planning application which was approved in November , the council committed to improving the road network through additional street-lighting, better signage, localised road widening and removal of trees and vegetation, all of which have taken place.ldquoThe council was not able to define a route during the planning process as the procurement exercise had not been completed and therefore SBC did not know the end destination or the preferred route.ldquoThe new residual waste contract will see the majority of the waste treated to produce a refuse derived fuel ndash to generate heat and electricity ndash as well as recover materials which can be recycled.ldquoThe closure of the landfill site and opening of waste transfer station will also see a reduction in harmful greenhouse gases from landfilling the waste and we believe it will also result in an improved recycling performance."},{"url":null,"title":"innerleithen-set-17th-annual-music-festival","story":"INNERLEITHEN is ready to rock this weekend as it welcomes musicians, dancers and performers to the towns th annual music festival.The StRonans Hotel and Live  Local at the Vale Club have put together a jam-packed programme of bands overthree days.And the Church of Scotland, Tweedside Hotel, Masons Club and the Union Club are all set to host a number of events.The music kicks off on Friday at pm in the St Ronanrsquos Hotel with the Redwood Rejects, at pm with Fin Price at lsquoLive  Localrsquo and at pm with Sparky  The Choirboys at the Tweedside Hotel.On Saturday, alongside the full programmes of bands around Innerleithen, the town is packed with events, starting with the St Ronanrsquos Silver Band coffee morning.Afterwards, the band will be continuing their eight-hour sponsored play out and about in the town.At the Church of Scotland therersquos concerts galore with The Taylor Family  Friends, Borders piper Matt Seattle accompanied by guitarist Donald Knox, and superb Innerleithen-born singer-songwriter Tommy Ashby.Over at the Masons, the regions favourite cover band The Derivatives are appearing, while Rory Speirs is at the Tweedside.There will be something for all the family to enjoy, with a wide selection of workshops, including beginnerrsquos ballet and line dance with the Fiona Henderson School of Dance, as well as singing, belly-dancing and an introduction to ukelele.There will also be an opportunity to learn more about the town on a historical walk with local experts from the Innerleithen Community Trust.Sunday sees the music continue over at the Church of Scotland, with a concert by leading Scots folk singer Christine Kydd, supported by the Borders Gaelic singing group lsquoTurasrsquo and Folksters.And to round off the weekend, therersquos informal music sessions at the Gordon Arms and the Corner House hotels.One of the festivals organisers, Robin Dempsey said: ldquoWe are really excited that we have possibly our biggest ever line up, with around  performances and events on the programme, spread over eight venues.ldquoThe music festival is truly encouraging local talent in the community and it is great to see so many locals and visitors coming together to share their love of music.ldquoWhat has really helped this year is support from our new sponsor, private development group, Whiteburn, who are currently regenerating the former Caerlee Mill site in the town.

Despite the great effort, the match ended in a - defeat.Jack McNab played a blinder over the weekend with smashing runs on both days.Coaches commented: #This has been a fantastic opportunity for the team and the Edinburgh Cup set out and proved exactly what we wanted to achieve and that was to sample experienced teams at -a-side.#We learned a lot from the weekend and are chuffed to say the team did the town proud during their first proper transition to the -a-side game where the Us have secured a place in Glasgow and District Youth Football League nd ision.#Fundraising efforts for the trip included Helen Gilchrist running a children#s quiz, a full day#s spinning by squad members in Campbeltown Coop, a successful bag pack in Campbeltown Tesco, a very successful tombola and baking stall at their own festival, generous donations from the Coop  and Laggan Community Council, a sibling of one of the Tarbert players holding a coffee morning in her local nursing home, the Kinloch Bar running ious football cards and a darts charity event along with generous donations from parents and grandparents.The Us appreciate every penny raised to get them to the tournament.Leftover funds went towards a framed photo of the team, by the Edinburgh Cup photographer, for each player plus player of the tournament gts which the coaches decided should be awarded to Jack McNab and Imogen Todd, who displayed some excellent saves throughout the festival, and a small keyring for coaches Rhys Blair, Dougue Renton and Robert Todd.Organisers would also like to thank Mairi MacMillan and Robert Graham for accompanying them on the trip, all the fundraisers, CDJFA for supporting their efforts and also Kintyre Sports Council for the use of the bus.#We wish the Us all the best in their first year of the Glasgow League who secured strip sponsorship from local businesses Donald Mclean contractors and Munch.#Photographs show pictures of the team, yellow T-shirts purchased through fundraising and one in their red strips and one of CDJFA player Jake McEachran who played for Port Glasgow on Saturday."},{"url":null,"title":"competition heats up on stronvaar green","story":"The tournament was well supported by the two local clubs and others from mid-Argyll and beyond and the round robin sections of four matches were keenly contested.The semi-finals featured two triples from CBC, Argyll BC and Vale of Leven BC, and these resulted in a final between Campbeltown’s Steven Dickson, Neil Maguire and Hugh Newlands and Vale’s Colin McIntyre, Grant MacLeod and Robert Scott.A good crowd gathered around the green to watch the match and saw the Vale trio take control with MacLeod the stand-out performer gaining the shots that mattered to give his team a decisive win.President Bobby Dalziel thanked Archie and Tracy for their generous sponsorship of the event and invited them to present the trophy and prizes."},{"url":null,"title":"pupils stay cool to catch late winner","story":"Campbeltown Pupils applied the perfect finish to their pre-season preparations with a hard-fought win over Rhu.Having been regular visitors to the Caledonian League side’s summer tournament, winning the competition in , the one-off match was played in a good spirit, but it was the Pupils who found their ruthless streak to snatch a win in the closing minutes.Rhu, fielding a team with plenty of height and energy, featuring several former youth players from Dumbarton FC # and former teammates of Pupils’ playmaker Donald McCallum # threatened early on.At the other end, though, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils had first-half chances, with Scott Souden and youngster Calum McKillop both having one-on-one opportunities, but their efforts were stopped by the Rhu keeper.The second half exploded into le on the hour mark as former Sons youth Callum Scott made his mark for Rhu, turning inside his marker to curl a classy left-footed finish beyond stand-in goalkeeper Ellis Robertson.Undeterred, the Pupils searched for an equaliser, and were given the opportunity minutes later when a Rhu handball in the box was penalised by referee Thomas d’Alessandro.John McCallum, playing as sweeper in a back three with Fraser Wylie and Ross Souden, stepped up to send the keeper the wrong way and make it -.However, after a lapse in concentration, the Pupils conceded a second goal, a cleverly guided header from a near-post corner evading Robertson in goal.Then, with the -degree heat and high humidity making the game hard work for both teams, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils rallied to equalise.A sweeping move involving midfield trio Keith Mitchell, Stuart Crossan and Donald McCallum found Scott Souden, who made no mistake when bearing down on goal, lashing a right-foot shot past the Rhu keeper, to the delight of his teammates and the clutch of Campbeltonians making the long journey to spectate.Then, in the dying seconds, after seeing shots blocked at their own end, thanks to some vital interventions from Robertson, the Pupils stole a winner when midfield substitute Finn Scott was teed up by Scott Souden to slot the ball home low beyond the Rhu keeper, ensuring the visitors completed pre-season unbeaten.Pupils manager Campbell Robertson said: ‘The conditions were tough, but the boys played really well, and our shape was good too. We would like to thank Rhu Amateurs for their excellent post-match hospitality.’Meanwhile, the Pupils’ centenary season officially starts tomorrowwhen they host Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star at Kintyre Park, in the SAFL’s aptly named Centenary Cup, with a pm kick-off.And with two more Saturday group matches to follow in August, firstly away to Dunoon and then at home to Tarbert, the Pupils will look to continue their dazzling pre-season form once the competitive action begins.Photograph:"},{"url":null,"title":"simply the best for james","story":"James was + after nine holes and then proceeded to put together an excellent back nine to finish on +.Meanwhile Donald had gone to + n the front nine only to fall back on the inward nine and finished on +.Result: , James Williamson +  ,  Donald Brown +  ,  Bill Brannigan +  ,  Sandy Watson +  , Ken MacMillan +  , Robert Cook  +."},{"url":null,"title":"letter trying to keep everyone happy","story":"We, as the private landowners, have endeavoured throughout the years to make this historical area  as fully accessible to the general public as possible.Our use of introducing a few sheep to graze down the grass over certain months of the year is our preferred method but often, when summer visitors appear, we find the animals get frequently disturbed and distressed with human contact , and very often remove them in busy months to avoid any upset.The larger access gate is frequently left wide open, leading to constant rounding up of the livestock and  posing a danger to the passing road users, with even the odd complaint about our animals ‘deposits’  around the Footprints area coming into the equation too.Changing climate conditions have ensured that bracken and other plant species have increased in volume as every year passes and with worry about the decreasing insect population and visiting dogs perhaps being harmed by ingesting sprayed grass, we have never used any chemical solutions to help keep the undergrowth at bay.Strimming has been used on occasions  but this, too, has produced complaints from the public about the unnecessary removal of wild flowers and plants that provide food for the visiting bird and butterfly population.Sign posts are often needlessly torn down and often used to fuel beach fires and barbecues, with even the old, fragile, stone dyke surrounding the area being constantly clambered over,  rather than using the access gate, causing stones to be dislodged and even the wall being  deliberately dismantled, in order to use the stones to construct fire pits for outdoor cooking.In short, we’ve found there are never any easy answers when it comes to trying to keep everyone happy.Yours,Catherine Barbour,"},{"url":null,"title":"top artist jolomo finds inspiration on his doorstep","story":"The latest exhibition by John Lowrie Morrison, which opens on Saturdayat the Archway Gallery in Lochgilphead, concentrates on paintings of Crinan and Knapdale, landscapes found within a few miles of his Tayvallich home.Although John’s work is now sought out by collectors all over the world, he continues to exhibit every August at his #local# gallery # this will be his th solo exhibition at the Archway.

It is an intimate world, personal and subjective, the world of our thoughts and feelings. Children live in it quite naturally, but as adults we tend to withdraw from it.#I use high-key expressionist colour to express how I feel about the landscape.#I’ve been painting the area around me now for over  years, and the more I paint Knapdale, the more intensely I use light and colour to express my emotions for the landscape.#John worked for  years as an art teacher at Lochgilphead High School, then in art education with Strathclyde Region before leaving work to paint full-time in .His distinctive colourful landscapes quickly made him one of the Scotland’s most successful painters, with celebrities such as Sting, Madonna, Simon Le Bon and Gregor Fisher collecting his work.Wilma Meikle, who owns the Archway Gallery with her husband Iain, said: #We’re delighted that John has supported the gallery for all these years. His exhibition is always the highlight of our year and the new paintings are amazing.#It’s also really nice to have a show which is relevant to this area.

This is standard, legal practice. Safety is our number one priority when arranging home to school transport.The spokesperson added: ldquoWe are working with colleagues across the council and in schools to ensure that all pupils who have been issued with a bus pass are on the transport providersrsquo lists and to improve access to the school transport timetables.ldquoWe recognise that this may have caused uncertainty for parents, carers and pupils.ldquoOur staff and the transport providers will continue to work closely together to manage the transition to these new arrangements.Councillor Craig Hoy, ward member, said: ldquoI was relieved to get clear reassurance from council staff on the issues of vehicle safety and the safety of children travelling from Gford and outlying areas to Knox Academy.ldquoItrsquos clear that there were communications problems which impacted parents and pupils. Managing this sort of process is never easy, but the council and operators should try to learn from this experience before any future changes to bus operators or routes."},{"url":null,"title":"lightning-strikes-house-east-lothian-drenched-storm","story":"Torrential rain led to flooding in many parts of the county, with floodwaters just minutes away from flowing into homes before subsiding just in time.In Prestonpans, the police and fire service rushed to Dolphingstone View after a two-storey terraced house was struck by several bolts of lightning, causing a ruptured gas main and a fire in the roof at pm on Saturday evening.Fire engines from Dalkeith, Tollcross, Musselburgh and McDonald Road in Edinburgh were called out to the scene, along with police.Amanda Milne lives next door to the house that was struck by the lightning.She told the Courier: ldquoThe strike set fire to their attic and also the gas box that we all have outside our front doors.ldquoWe knew when the lightning struck that it hit something nearby as it lit up the sky and went out with a huge bang louder than the rest of them.ldquoOur power went off straight away and at that point it was quite scary, especially with a petried toddler and dog.Amandarsquos partner, Murray McKeown, took her and -month-old Ollie to his motherrsquos house as they were evacuated from their home when the fire engines arrived.She added: ldquoMy partner got us in the car and drove us somewhere safe until the firefighters put the fire out and the gas men had done their checks.

I think for many parents who have childcare challenges,there can be a real sense of relief as the summer holidays end, and to some extent I feel that myself.The pressure to fill six weeks with entertainment and activities, and go on holiday, can be immense, especially on a tight budget. For some children too, the holidays can be a dficult time and school can offer them ato some familiar routine.However, I remember the impending dread I felt when I was a child in the final days of the summer holidays. I hated the back to school adverts on TV as they heralded the end of free days playing on the rocks at the Pans shore, and of loosely defined bedtimes.So I was glad that our youngest daughter Skye was looking forward to school as she enters P. She met friends she hadnrsquot seen in weeks this morning and smiled as she said hello to George the lollipop man.She seemed slightly anxious as she waited in line in a new place, but the friendly manner of her new teacher visibly lted her mood and she went in with a smile, unknowingly tracing my childhood footsteps and those of her big sister.But then as I walked home, I was suddenly overwhelmed with anxieties: money worries, work worries, deadlines, bills etc. It seemed asduring the holiday period I had consciously decided to put such thoughts aside, to just enjoy the family time. Now was the pay back, we had ed to lsquorealityrsquo.But then I suddenly remembered a tale a fellow storyteller had told me many years ago. It just popped into my head and it spoke to me as I wandered back. And the truth in the story was the antidote I needed in that moment. And so I will share it with you in case you may one day find you need it:There was once a weaver who was weighed down with worries. He had so many things to do, so many responsibilities he looked into the future with dread. His worries kept him awake at night, which of course made his worrying worse during the next day. It was a vicious cycle.Then one day, he was sitting at his loom working and his worries got in the way. He couldnrsquot concentrate and he made mistake after mistake. He cursed and this was heard by an auld guidewe who happened to be passing by his window.ldquoFir whit reason dae ye curse at yer loom son, is there nae joy in yer work  she asked.The weaver looked up, feeling ashamed: ldquoIrsquom sair sorry fir ma words. Itrsquos just that as I work I think aboot orsquo ma troubles.The old woman nodded in understanding. She knew about troubles herself.ldquoAye, she said with an understanding nod, ldquotroubles can fair get ye doon.Then she paused and thought for a moment. She could see in the weaverrsquos face that he was riddled with anxieties.ldquoCan I show ye something that will tak ye awa frae yer work fir only a few minutes The weaver was happy to have a break so he left his loom and came outside.ldquoDae ye hae a bucket  asked the guidewe.ldquoA bucket ldquoAye a bucket, tae put some water in, she explained.The weaver fetched his bucket, wondering what the old woman was going to do with it.She took it to the well and filled it with a little water.ldquoNoo son, I dinnae kenthis will be tae heavy fir ye tae hold up.The weaver laughed: ldquoOrsquo course itrsquos no too heavy, fir ye only put a wee drop orsquo water in it.So the woman asked him to prove this by holding up the bucket with arms outstretched. The weaver had strong arms because of his work and held the bucket before him without any effort.ldquoAh, said the guidewe, ldquosae itrsquos nae tae heavy.ldquoIt isnae heavy at arsquo, replied the weaver.The old woman smiled: ldquoIn that case, keep haudin it afore ye like that fir  minutes. He wondered why she was asking him to do this, andshe was just trying to make a fool of him. But he was also intrigued and knew her to be an honest old soul, and so he did as she asked.After a few minutes of holding the bucket in front of him, it began to feel much heavier. After five minutes, his arms began to ache and soon they began to shake. The pain began to spread to his back as he desperately tried to keep the bucket in position.ldquoIs  minutes no over yet  asked the weaver desperately.ldquoIf the bucket is now tae heavy fir ye, put it doon son.He was reluctant to admit that the bucket was now too heavy to hold and so put it down.ldquoThe water got heavier son, didnrsquot it ldquoThe water wasnae heavier, protested the weaver, ldquoye just made me hold the bucket for tae lang.ldquoSae the water did get heavier, no in itself, but for you!The weaver looked confused and the guidewe continued.ldquoWater can get heavierye haud it ower lang afore ye, evenitrsquos just a wee drop. Yer worries are like that water, son. I am sure that they are many but ye mak them much heavierye try tae haud them in yer thochts arsquo the time.She smiled at him: ldquoTry an put the bucket doon as often as ye can,ye ken whit I mean. Dinnae mak it heavier than needs be. When ye need tae, haud it, but no arsquo the time.ldquoIn fact, she added while raising a pointed finger, ldquohauding it arsquo the time gies ye pain and paralyses ye. Yersquoll hae nae ability left tae empty the bucket.And so the old woman wandered off, leaving her words with the weaver. He looked down at the bucket. He lted it again and held it in front of him. It wasnrsquot as heavy now as before, but still had the same amount of water in it. She was right, water can get heavieryou hold it for longer, even though itrsquos the same weight.He chuckled to himself and watched the woman as she waddled down the street.ldquoThank ye! he called out.He ed to his loom. This time he whistled and sang as he worked. He enjoyed his creation and made no mistakes, for he had put his bucket of worries down for a while.Later they would still be there, but they might seem lighter and easier to manage now that they had stopped paralysing him with anxiety.And so that was the story. And as I arrived home, I realised that although I needed to deal with lots of things, I wasnrsquot going to give my worries more weight by holding them constantly in my thoughts.Itrsquos really

According to them, to use the term ldquofree spins casinos must genuinely offer free games with no strings attached, such as wagering requirements. The old, standard spins are to be referred to as ldquobonus spins instead.When Free Spins Are Not Truly Free SpinsThere are several occasions when free spinsarenrsquot free. Any spins which come with wagering requirements, for instance, breach the concept of being truly free. Wagering requirements, also known as playthrough rates, denote that a player must wager whatever they win a specic number of times before they can withdraw those funds.Wagering requirements are common in deposit bonusesbut shouldnrsquot be included in any offer which proclaims itself to be free.Free Spins With No Wagering RequirementsFortunately, the new regulation issued by the UK Gambling Commission, Swedish Gaming Authority and others are aiming to fix this issue. True free spin deals should come with no hidden terms and no strings attached.

Last October, the SNPrsquos Joanna Cherry mooted a ldquodemocratic event would suffice iethe SNP simply won the most Scottish seats at a general election, independence would follow.Having had their bid rejected, Mr MacNeil and Mr McEleny are now trying a dferent route tabling an amendment to an accepted conference motion on devolution.It says a ldquopro-independence electoral victory shall be a mandate from the people of Scotland to commence independence negotiations with the UK Government,Westminster refused to grant the Scottish Government the power to hold a second referendum.:SNPs Jeane Freeman must inject urgency into -month superhospital probe to protect patientsYet the First Minister wants any decision by Scotland to break free from the UK to be fair, legal and decisive, which was the basis of the  vote as per the Edinburgh Agreement.She insists on the back of the Holyrood vote in , she has a mandate to hold a second referendum and has earmarked the latter part of next year to hold it.But there is one big problem: London says no.If the polls are right ndash two recent ones put the Tories  points clear of Labour ndash then should Boris Johnson make good his promise to lead Britain out of the EU in daysrsquo time, the chances of a snap general election are high. The Prime Minister will be banking on the backers of Nigel Faragersquos Brexit Party swinging behind the Tories and giving him a working majority. The Tory manesto would doubtless again include a line about refusing Ms Sturgeonrsquos desire to hold a second independence referendum.Mr Johnson, just like Theresa May before him, will not agree to one because he does not believe the SNP Government has a mandate it does not have a Holyrood majority and, until it does, all bets are off.The Tory Government can do this because Westminster remains the constitutional authority.The PM, given the turmoil of Brexit, needs a new battle on another front like a hole in the head, so will keep saying no. Indeed,the Tories were to win a snap election in November, the next general election would not be due until late .So, is there anything Ms Sturgeon can do to get round this constitutional impasse  Possibly.:Jeremy Corbynrsquos plan to be caretaker prime minister receives further blowUnionist MPs have spotted a potential albeit circuitous route, which is causing some of them a deal of concern.To get to her desired destination, the FM needs that parliamentary majority in Edinburgh to knock aside Whitehallrsquos argument that the SNP administration does not have a mandate.But the next Holyrood election is not until . So, a second referendum next year is impossible, right  Wrong.Section  of the  Scotland Act has two ways to facilitate what is known as an ldquoextraordinary general election in Scotland. The first looks impossible having a two-thirds majority of MSPs to call a new poll. This would mean getting most Labour MSPs to back the idea which will not happen.The alternative route, however, would involve Ms Sturgeon resigning her role.There would be a month to find a new FM. But with the pro-independence Greens, the SNP has an overall majority at Holyrood and so could block anyone filling the role. An extraordinary general election would, therefore, follow. And,Ms Sturgeonrsquos gamble paid off, the SNP would get its majority in the Scottish Parliament.One could argue this is an extremely risky action because there are no guarantees the FM would secure a parliamentary majority.ButBritain faces either a bad or a no-deal Brexit outcome with all the negative consequences people fear would follow, she might, in extremis, have to consider all possibilities, including the ldquonuclear option of collapsing her own government.If she got her new mandate, Ms Sturgeon could turn around to Mr Johnson and say: ldquoGive me my referendum.Last week, even staunch Unionist David Mundell, the former Scottish Secretary, conceded that it would be \"hard to push back\" against a second polla Holyrood election was ldquofought explicitly on the issue of another referendum and then there is a majority of nationalist parties for it.The interesting reference was ldquonationalist parties. At the last Holyrood election the SNP and Greens stood on dferent s butthey were to come together to put indyref front and centre ndash as they presumably would in an extraordinary general election to force another poll ndash then the chances of getting that nationalist majority would be so much higher.In terms of time under this unorthodox route,the FM resigned at the start of , her desired second chance poll could indeed take place in the autumn of next year.One Conservative MP noted that by collapsing her government, the SNP leader would ldquooptimise her chances of having a second poll. ldquoIf she gets a majority, I couldnrsquot see how the PM could refuse another independence referendum.A Liberal Democrat MP also raised concerns at the prospect, stressing: ldquoThis is why itrsquos so important to stop Brexit, so we donrsquot allow it to break up the UK.An SNP MP said the option of Ms Sturgeon resigning to force a snap Holyrood election was an ldquointeresting route to get to indyref.ldquoShe might do it, he declared, noting: ldquoThe more unreasonable the UK Government is, the better. And they are being fantastically unreasonable at the moment. Something has to give.However, a senior Nationalist close to the SNP leader said while she was well aware of the Scotland Act option, it was ldquonot in our thinking. At the moment.A UK Government source was dismissive. ldquoIf Nicola Sturgeon launched a cynical attempt to engineer another referendum, it would go down extremely badly with the majority of Scots, who do not want one in the foreseeable future.Of course, evenMs Sturgeon were to win a majority in a  extraordinary general election in Scotland, Mr Johnson could dig in his heels, raise his nose and simply say no.And, indeed,he were to win a snap UK general election on a manesto of rejecting indyref until November  at the earliest, he could simply respond to the SNP leaderrsquos demand by saying: ldquoTough.

They said: ldquoThis is a hot dog for grown-ups.People queueing at the food truck certainly agree. ldquoWersquove taken a lot of our inspiration from street food and the trend towards hand-crafted food and drink products that have a bit of a story behind them, Drysdale continues. ldquoWersquore trying to position our hot dog along the same lines as a gourmet burger that you might see on menus everywhere nowadays.While Brigston  Co will continue to set up shop with the food truck at events such as music festival and agricultural shows, the firm is starting to build traction in pubs and restaurants including Innis  Gunn outlets in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dundee and St Andrews. Caterers can buy the hot dogs via wholesalers across Scotland, andyou want to buy them to cook at home you can order them online from Campbellrsquos Prime Meats.ldquoWersquore in the early stages of expanding the brand, explains Drysdale. ldquoTherersquos just the two of us so we donrsquot want to overstretch then struggle to meet demand plus wersquove worked hard to get the product the way we want it and we wonrsquot compromise on quality.

Not surprisingly most of them are to do with the music. There are the ordinary tour nights, some nights better than others, and then there are the nights when the song and the set steps out of normal touring routine and connects in a very powerful way. The energy, spiritual resonance and audience interaction hit the heights and it all becomes a very intoxicating symphony.One particular highlight for me will always be performing our Gaelic song An Ubhal As Airde on Top Of The Pops. That show was so iconic and such a major part of le, growing up as a kid in the s, and the thought back then that I would be part of a group not just performing on the show, but performing a song in Gaelic language, would have been totally preposterous.Rory MacDonaldIrsquoVE always considered band and audience to be one and the same and never experienced the sense of being up on stage, detached.

It resonated across the ocean of faces, most too far to see. It was palpable. Dig deep, Bayne, you owe this to your band mates, to everyone who played their part on the journey. For those we loved but are no longer here. For those we love who are.If there was ever a way to play a swan song, this was it.

Last year, that number had risen to more than ,, with  under the age of  and predominantly using the drugs to enhance their looks.The demand is so high that a second specialist steroid clinic has now opened in Edinburgh.John Campbell, the manager of the Glasgow clinic, said that social media, combined with a rapid rise in the number of gyms and the normalisation of cosmetic surgery has all contributed to the increase in young people using IPEDS like steroids and tanning agents.He explained: ldquoIt is a combination of things, like cosmetic procedures and cosmetic surgery being easily available, and the interest in gyms and improving physical fitness. There are now gyms everywhere.ldquoThe majority of people coming to us now are using IPEDs for image-enhancing purposes.ldquoThey want to become more appealing to the opposite sex when theyrsquore out partying, clubbing. Its maybe people who donrsquot have a lot of experience regarding food and nutrition or training in the gym.According to research into the use of IPEDs among young Scots, around half of young people using the drugs said social media had influenced their decision.The survey, by youth charity Fast Forward, also found that a third of users were women.In  think-tank Credos also looked into body image perceptions and influences in young men, finding around half cited celebrities as having an influence on how they feel about themselves.Their report said: ldquoRespondents went on to suggest that celebrity and social media culture promotes unrealistic body types which skewed young menrsquos self-image and led some to consider IPED use to achieve extreme body goalsAnother study on boys aged - found they wanted to ldquobe in boy bands and attract girls by building bigger bodies.While steroids are the most commonly-used IPED, others such a tanning agents are used, mainly by women, to keep themselves bronzed.Also known as the lsquoBarbie drugrsquo, the chemical is a synthetic version of the natural melanocyte-stimulating hormone, which increases the production of skin-darkening pigments.It is no longer sold legitimately and medical professionals have warned against using it, but many people have just resorted to buying supplies on the black market and online.It has also been linked to the chronic fatigue condition Fibromyalgia.Campbell has seen a worrying increase in people who have developed body dysmorphia, commonly associated with eating disorders, directly linked to their IPED use over the past decade.He said: ldquoWe are seeing people coming in who are developing this body dysmorphia as they go along. Irsquove lost count of the number of guys sat across from me maybe  stone, and they say lsquoI donrsquot know whatrsquos going on, I feel asIrsquove lost an inch off my arms, a couple of poundsrsquo.ldquoThey have very real fears about stopping use. If you dig deeper and ask how many times a day they weigh themselves, they say five or six times, they take scales to work. It is very compulsive behaviour.ldquoIt has similarities to eating disorders in that way.

But do we even care According to a recent report from Awin , four out of  of us donrsquot, most predicting the imminent demise with almost one in three saying they never visited the high street, the overwhelming number simply shopping through the internet.Community land ownership: is it fit for purpose And while the respondents may have been untypical of the average shopper, there is plenty of evidence that consumers have voted with their fingers.Each year more shops close than open in the UK, with an average of  a day pulling down the shutters permanently, clothes shops and pubs the biggest casualties.Woolworths, Toys lsquoRrsquo Us, BHS and Comet are gone. Debenhams, under siege by new House of Fraser owner Mike Ashley, completed a pound million refinancing deal with a programme of up to  store closures.At a retailersrsquo summit in March in Edinburgh, Stuart Moncur of estate agent Savills chimed another death knell, warning that some towns will lose shops as the impact of online shopping and out-of-town retail parks continues to bite.ldquoWe have got to accept that there are locations which will not be a retail hub moving forward. We have got to accept that we have far too much retail [space], he said.ldquoTown centres are about convenience. Beyond that, there will be no need for retail.Opinion: Why community ownership is essential for the future of rural ScotlandThis was underlined by Katherine Mackintosh, managing director of Robertson Regeneration and Property. ldquoWe have to learn that there is a hierarchy and there are places that arenrsquot going to be the same in the future, she said.ldquoWe need to understand better whateach place has, rather than everybody thinking they have to have the same shops and deliver the same thing.Sowe are looking for something convenient and dferent, for inidually-tailored solutions, what do we do Blitz town and city centres  Rebuild  Plant trees, grass and plants Well,yoursquore the Scottish Government yoursquoll commission a national review and put out a Town Centre Action Plan with quite a number of plans but not much action.A report about further reports, talking about asset audits, working with private capital, cultural and environmental organisations, supporting community-led activity, and quite a lot of bureaucratic gobbledegook about ldquoworking with public-sector bodies to model ways in which communities can take occupation of public buildings when they are no longer required by the public body.Yoursquoll have had your town hall, but wherersquos the cash This action plan was published in  and also promised a community empowerment act, which was delivered in .It promised quite a lot, from participation in public decision-making, the involvement of supporters in football clubs, giving community bodies the right to ldquorequest to buy, lease, manage or use land and buildings belonging to local authorities, Scottish public bodies or Scottish ministers ndash these assets having been identied and listed .Opinion: landowners are not the enemy in community buyouts debateBut as with so many grand plans to save our struggling town centres, the benefits are glaring in their absence.What about the asset transfer provision, which required every local authority to publish an annual report setting out the numbers of asset transfer requests received and their outcomes This came into effect in June last year.A comprehensive report has yet to be published but from a cursory survey there appear to have been few requests ndash none in South Ayrshire for example ndash with a smattering in councils outside the central belt ,  in Glasgow and, in Edinburgh, there are only two published, for Ravelston Park Pavilion and the old St Johnrsquos RC Primary School in Portobello.Wersquore hardly seeing the mass transfer of public buildings into community hands.If therersquos one thing everyone agrees on, whether a major retailer or a small shop still gamely clinging on, itrsquos footfall.Thatrsquos punters passing by, or not passing and buying.Many town centres become dreich, stark, empty and potentially dangerous when the shops close and the night closes in.We spent decades planning and carrying out the wholesale removal of huge swathes of the population ndash now we need them back.There has to be much more city-centre living, which the Scottish Government has recognised but is constrained by both finance and UK regulations in mounting a massive programme of city-centre council and affordable housing.Inidual councils have been selling off land, almost exclusively to private developers who have their own timescales and their priorities donrsquot appear to be redeveloping in the heart of towns and cities.A UK Government-commissioned report last year under Sir John Timpson, the man who heads the shops where you get your keys cut and shoes repaired, recommended, again, a community-focused solution.He called for an ldquoupside-down approach, empowering local communities to plan future high streets and city centres around centres where social and leisure facilities sat alongside retail units and housing in what he described as ldquocommunity hubs, which hardly answers the here and now.Yet another report earlier this year by the Centre for Cities think tank mapped UK cities with the strongest city-centre economies and identied their common features.These had fewer shops but were supported by ldquoknowledge-based office jobs ndash such as those in marketing, finance and law ndash which created a market for restaurants, bars and other leisure activities to thrive on the high street.This may be an ambition to strive for but it is not practical for today or tomorrow. The think tankrsquos chief executive, or soothsayeryou prefer, Andrew Carter, predicted that ldquofuture city centres are likely to look very dferent to today.He said: ldquoWe must remember that a successful high street is the result, not the driver, of a successful city economy and take a more holistic approach to regenerating city centres ndash including allowing councils to access infrastructure funding as well as money set aside for high-street regeneration.ldquoInstead of trying to replace failed shops with more retail, investors and policymakers should focus their strategies on making struggling city centres attractive places to do business and spend leisure time ndash not just to shop.Which doesnrsquot answer what you do about the bleak and benighted town centres in places like Kilmarnock or Cumbernauld today.Outside Scotlandrsquos major city centres more than one shop in five is empty. Most of these will be owned by the countryrsquos largest and most profitable property companies.Theyrsquore forever going on about what business charges are doing to their businesses.Why donrsquot councils double, triple or quadruple the rates on empty properties, assign a notional, community-operated rental figure to them and,rented out at that figure, give the incoming business substantial relief for a period Itrsquos not a cure but it would be an avenue for small, local operations to have a prominent location and outlet.Why not organise concerts and events in the shoping centres in the evenings In the s, a scheme called Mirasallowed borrowers to get up to % off in the first year, declining subsequently to zero.Could we not have a similar scheme for small business rent relief Why not redefine council tax house valuation bands, which were fixed in , to hit the richest and bring in additional government revenue I know itrsquos a strong word, but cowardice is the answer. No government, of whatever political colour, is willing to tithe the rich and upper middle-class home owner.If yoursquove ever tried to shop in Londonrsquos Oxford Street, or indeed in parts of Glasgow city centre, you often do it choking in diesel fumes from buses and lorries.Forget about congestion charges and ndash fruitless ndash monitoring of emissions. Why not look at banning all vehicles during the day from town and city centres, with only essential services and deliveries permitted in the early hours and in strictly defined lanes Then we could truly green our city-centre environment with banks of trees and plants, canopies, daises , entertainment and street theatre.There is no perfect solution.

The quango found as few as , owners ndash from Highland lairds to state forestry enterprises ndash own some % of Scotlandrsquos rural land, around  million hectares.The Scottish Government has said something like % of the country as a whole is in the hands of large private estates. Another .% belongs to the state, in one guise or another.Previously, the now Green MSP Andy Wightman had calculated that fewer than  people owned half of all land in private hands.Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen and the Duke of Buccleuch ndash the biggest private landowners ndash each own more than , acres, thought not in single blocks.Some of the names might have changed, a foreign billionaire replacing a Highland clan chief or a TV star selling up to a merchant banker. But the basic proportion of ownership, campaigners say, has not changed for decades.Landowners do not have to be bad for that to be a problem, Hamish Trench, chief executive of the Scottish Land Commission, said back in March. ldquoThat is an unhealthy position to be in, he concluded. Britainrsquos monopolies quango told the SLC there could be grounds for breaking up such concentrations of ownership, including by state entities like the Forestry Commission.But it is not for the want of trying that ownership has changed so little. Because there is another kind of owner, still a relatively new kind: the community collective.Around % of Scotland belongs to a community land company. The first estate to be bought out was in Assynt, in western Sutherland, in .There followed dozens more. Prizes, over the years, included the isolated peninsula of Knoydart, the island of Eigg and the woods of Rhubodach on Bute.After devolution, successive governments in Edinburgh have sought to help communities to take over land, with money, and law. That has not always gone down well.In , the then Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition secured legislation under which communities got the legal right to buy land when it went on sale. Conservatives voted against the move. Right-wing tabloids were furious: it was, the refrain quickly went, a ldquoMugabe-style land grab.This line ndash that reforms were reminiscent of the gangs of black farmers who seized the property of white farmers under the Zimbabwean strongman ndash was to thrive.It was repeated again in  when a new government, now the SNP, suggested further reforms.William Astor, Lord Astor, the father-in-law of the then prime minister, David Cameron, wrote a polemic in The Spectator using the same ldquoMugabe land grab line. The Conservative peer owns a chunk of Jura through a trust based in the Bahamas.Rhetoric did not stop the SNP getting through a new reform act in . This one would, in theory, give the government the power to force an owner to sell up to the community.Its headline new power has still to be enacted. The Scottish Land Commission, in its report back in March, recommended the use of such powers, including a public interest test on whether large landholdings should face compulsory dismemberment.And so the debate has raged, with a community buyout movement on one side and resistant landowners, represented by the lobby Scottish Land  Estates, on the other. To outsiders, it looks like a war of attrition.The SNP has stressed community land buyouts are not a panacea. Many, after all, have struggled.Debaters have been coy. Few want to say out loud that some communities lack human capacity. Given the size of some places ndash whether small islands or sparsely populated giant estates ndash it is probably unfair to expect them to have all the skills required to run community businesses. Nor should they be expected to. That is why there are ndash and must be ndash support mechanisms in place.Some buyouts suffer acrimonious fallouts. Some fail to deliver, as we report today on Bute. Other schemes face a legacy issue. What happens when a few champions of a buyout retire, or die  How do small communities plan and ensure a continuity of quality, accountable leadership.Humans are human. And, of course, large private estates do not necessarily deliver either. However, given some of these projects have received large sums of public money, we must ensure there is full and proper scrutiny.The Land Commission and policymakers also want to encourage more smaller estates and farms, more job-creating agribusinesses. The official mantra is that a balanced ownership is needed.There will always be rows over policy. But ndash given the frailty of some of our remotest communities ndash has the time not come to take stock of land buyouts Whatever the theoretical merits, are we sure we are getting enough of them right  And how do we ensure that we do "},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-community-ownership-essential-future-rural-scotland","story":"Equally unsurprisingly, Scotlandrsquos landed elite donrsquot see that as a problem, saying itrsquos land use rather than ownership that matters. However, that ignores an inconvenient truth ndash that land ownership is crucial in determining how land is used. The ldquoland question is therefore ultimately one of power. Who has it, how it is exercised, and in whose interests.Addressing inherent power imbalances in concentrated land ownership as a matter of social justice helps explain why community ownership is so high on Scotlandrsquos land reform agenda. Despite great progress, community ownership still accounts for under % of our land.Comment: Is it time to put our struggling town centres out of their misery Thatrsquos not nearly enough ndash especially in light of a recent Scottish Land Commission report on issues associated with large-scale and concentrated land ownership. Itrsquos a sobering read, documenting fear of repercussions for ldquogoing against the landowner in evidence provided by research respondents.Fear, the commissionrsquos report states, ldquorooted firmly in the concentration of power in some communities and the perceived ability of landowners to inflict consequences such as evictions or blacklisting for employment contracts on residents. This, let me remind you, is taking place in Scotland now, not in some long-ago feudal past.The Highlands and Islands have long been seen as bastions of the community land movement. Itrsquos no coincidence that % of all community-owned land is in the Western Isles. These community buyouts have been used as an antidote to decades of what might at best be described as benign neglect under private ndash and in some cases, state ndash ownership.In places like west Harris, community ownership is helping reverse population decline and providing affordable housing, economic development, local facilities and environmental improvement.The challenge now is to ensure that community ownership is increasingly seen as normal, not only in the Highlands and Islands but in our lowland and urban places too. Most immediately therersquos a need to ensure that the community right to buy land to further sustainable developmentcurrently being consulted on by the Scottish Government offers a genuine prospect of delivering more land into community ownership where it is in the public interest to do so.Community land ownership: is it fit for purpose Itrsquos vital also to secure a political commitment that the Scottish Land Fund, which allocates poundm annually in support of community land purchases, will continue to operate after the  Scottish Parliament election with at least the same level of funding in place.In the longer term itrsquos incumbent on policymakers to ensure the community ownership agenda is hard-wired into general public policy. That requires political imagination to deploy legislative, fiscal and informational policy levers in ways that enable community ownership to deliver sustainable outcomes for people throughout Scotland.Dr Calum MacLeod is policy director of Community Land Scotland@CalumMacleod"},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-landowners-not-enemy-community-buyouts-debate","story":"Community buyouts come in all shapes and sizes ndash and no two are the same.Since devolution, there has been signicant legislative interest in community buyouts and land reform ndash and this has often encouraged polarised opinions and headlines which have sought to portray private ownership and community ownership as being at opposite ends of a spectrum, with community ownership as the panacea.The reality isnrsquot quite as black and white ndash well managed, privately-owned land and property makes as valuable a contribution to Scotland as community ownership. Our long-held position ndash and that of the rural businesses we represent ndash is that there is room for all forms of land ownership in Scotland ndash private, public and community. All have a signicant role to play in creating thriving communities in rural and urban settings.We continue to support community buyouts on the basis of willing seller, willing buyer, and in the case of neglected and abandoned land we have supported the introduction of enforced sale. It is important to remember that community ownership isnrsquot an end in itself ndash how the land and property is managed post-acquisition will determine what benefits are delivered.Community land ownership: is it fit for purpose Much of the media and political attention has focused on high-profile buyouts such as Eigg or instances where communities have sought to use change of ownership to deal with concerns about how land is being managed. However, these represent just a small proportion of the transfers of land and properties to communities which have been going on for years ndash from sports facilities and woodland to land for housing and wholesale transfers of islands and estates.One such case is Annandale Estates, owned by SLE chairman David Johnstone, which transferred Gallow Hill ndash an area of woodland near Moffat that was already being accessed for recreational use ndash to a community body in . These are the sorts of buyouts which fly under the radar but often have a fruitful local impact.Having a greater influence on decisions affecting land and properties is often cited as a reason for communities pursuing a buyout, but we believe the last decade has seen a real step-change in engagement between landowners and local communities leading to increased understanding of aspirations and creating opportunities to work together to deliver a shared vision for their area.Finding the money to purchase land or property is only one step in the community ownership journey. The challenges faced by those owning and managing land and property in Scotland are often the same regardless of what type or size of owner you are.Comment: Is it time to put our struggling town centres out of their misery At SLE, a major part of our role is supporting owners of all kinds on issues such as planning, ersication, infrastructure, implications of Brexit, addressing climate change ndash the list is endless. We also provide advice on opportunities for land managers ndash and again these are very similar for both private and community owners.There is more that connects private and community owners than ides them, and it is unfortunate the media and political narrative can often pit one against the other.

These included areas with houses, roads, restricted areas due to military or political reasons, as well as terrains not suitable for wind power generation.Turkey, Russia, and Norway have the greatest potential for future wind power density, according to the study.Large parts of Western Europe were also considered ripe for further onshore farms because of favourable wind speeds and flat areas.Peter Enevoldsen, assistant professor in the Centre For Energy Technologies at Aarhus University, said: ldquoCritics will no doubt argue the naturally intermittent supply of wind makes onshore wind energy unsuitable to meet the global demand.ldquoBut even without accounting for developments in wind turbine technology in the upcoming decades, onshore wind power is the cheapest mature source of renewable energy, and utilising the dferent wind regions in Europe is the key to meet the demand for a  percent renewable and fully decarbonised energy system.Mark Jacobson, Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford University, America, said the study would allow better planning across Europe.He said: ldquoOne of the most important findings of this study ndash aside from the fact it concludes the European onshore wind potential is larger than previously estimated ndash is that it facilitates the ability of countries to plan their onshore wind resource development more efficiently, so easing the way for commitments by these countries to move entirely to clean, renewable energy for all purposes."},{"url":null,"title":"focus-past-glasgows-dark-era-revealed-haunting-images","story":"Laundry flutters on lines strung across dank alleys that would rarely,ever, capture the sun. A child in what seems to be a bowler hat tucked over his ears clutches a jug in his arms almost as big as he is, and a curious face juts through a tenement window, perhaps anxious to see what the man with the camera might be doing in a grim Glasgow close.These evocative images are among hundreds of Glasgow scenes captured by th-century photographer Thomas Annan, as he meticulously recorded a city undergoing social and structural changes intended to help end the squalor and deprivation, and usher in a new way of le.Many of Annanrsquos photographs shed light on the east endrsquos harsh past, where slum le came to an early end at an average age of just  and the stinking closes and wynds harboured homes crammed with dozens of people sharing the most basic of living conditions.Other images cast light on the effort to raise the cityrsquos living standards ndash such as the pivotal waterworks project that fed clean water from Loch Katrine to the heart of the city.The photographs and Annanrsquos remarkable work is now set to be explored at a sold-out event organised by the Alexander Thomson Society, which is to be held at the Kelvin Hall later this month.According to art historian Anne Lyden, of the National Galleries of Scotland, who will present the event, Annanrsquos fascinating images reflect a time long gone but also serve as a reminder that modern le is not immune from challenges and a constant need for the city to evolve.ldquoAnnanrsquos photographs are interesting because they are a moment when change was already starting to happen in the city, she says. ldquoHe started work in , two years after the Glasgow City Improvements Act and the earlier Police Act were bringing about change and trying to improve conditions.ldquoThere was improved lighting and sanitation. However, the city fathers decided it would be better to completely demolish and start over again.As a result, many of Annanrsquos images show closes and tenements that would go on to be razed, with families displaced and new buildings erected in their place.Some, however, such as an image of the Saltmarket taken in  from Bridgegate, feel almost familiar, save for the eerie figures that line the cobbled street, many with their unsmiling faces turned to the photographerrsquos lens.Many of Annanrsquos photographs, a signicant number of which capture the overcrowded heart of the city, were commissioned by the Glasgow City Improvement Trust with the distinct aim of recording ldquoOld Glasgow before it was demolished.ldquoThe photographs demonstrate the challenges of a shting city and how urban planners have to constantly evaluate what is available for a changing demographic, adds Ms Lyden. ldquoWhen Thomas Annan was documenting these parts of Glasgow, there was a huge movement of people from the north of Scotland and Ireland coming to the city. At one point there were , Irish people living in that area.ldquoSimilar issues are being dealt with today in terms of managing housing stock.Annan took scores of photographs of old closes, tenements and wynds at a time when the compact city centre was home to more than , people. But his work also shed fascinating light on the cityrsquos industrial heritage, including images of work to dredge areas of the Clyde and of grand houses also facing demolition for new housing schemes and roads ndash just as the grim closes were being destroyed to make way for improved accommodation.The extraordinary clarity of many of the -year-old images, taken at a time when photography was still in its infancy, are testament to Annanrsquos technical skill, adds Ms Lyden.ldquoHe was incredibly skilled. The clarity in his images is because he was working with glass plate negatives. He was able to capture a tremendous amount of detail and was able to use dferent processes that he had travelled to Vienna to achieve the rights to use.ldquoHis photographs are evidence of a time past, but also reflect a lot of the same issues that we are dealing with today.Anne Lyden on Thomas Annan is at the Kelvin Hall on Wednesday, August ,at pm."},{"url":null,"title":"reversing-march-time-horology","story":"The watchmakerrsquos art faded with the arrival of quartz and battery-operated timepieces. Digital technology and more recently the continual buzz and beep of smartwatches replaced the traditional mechanical watch, with its skeleton of minuscule screws and intricate moving parts.Even the sprawling Timex factory in Dundee, which at its peak employed more than  people making timepieces to send around the world, couldnrsquot survive the march of time.But times have certainly changed, it seems the gentle art of making wristwatches is now enjoying an albeit small but still remarkable Scottish-led revival.In a workshop at Glasgow Green, ten handmade watches a week are being laboriously crafted, each featuring a prized enamelling technique typically only found in a very select few high-end watchmakersrsquo in Switzerland and Japan.Surrounded by shelves heaving with jewel-coloured enamelling powders, one of horologyrsquos trickiest creative processes ndash the making enamel watch dials in the lsquogrand feursquo tradition, and the task of constructing each watch by hand ndash is being undertaken with painstaking attention to detail.As a result, anOrdain watches with their richly coloured enamel dials ndash made by laying glass powders onto a blank copper disc, firing at high temperatures to melt the powder, cooling it and then firing over and over again to reach the required depth - are flying from his Glasgow workshop.Incredibly, hersquos found some are almost instantly sold on the second-hand market for twice their original four-figure price.One of the beauties of the enamel technique is the depth of colour that comes from multiple layers of glass. ldquoThe melted glass will never, ever lose its colour. It is much better quality than a painted dial that you canrsquot get anywhere , he says.ldquoThere are so few people in the world that can do this, and no-one involved in watchmaking expects a Scottish company to be doing it.But itrsquos not the only Glasgow watch studio seeing rising demand. At design studio Instrmnt in Parnie Street, design team Pete Sunderland and Ross Baynhamrsquos Swiss-movement timepieces have broken into the Japanese market ndash home to some of the biggest watchmaking brands in the world such as Seiko, Citizen and Casio.While celebrities may seek out expensive designer brands to showcase their wealth, Mr Sunderland says others are shting towards a more low-key and unique style statement.ldquoA lot of people are buying watches that donrsquot have that obvious branding they want people to have to ask what brand of watch they are wearing, he says.The firm is now preparing to expand beyond its quartz collection to include traditional mechanical watches and is eyeing the South Korean market.Even the lsquoheritagersquo end of the market appears to be thriving. Alness-based pocket watch business Dalvey has seen such demand for its classic timepieces soar to such an extent that it has recently revived production of classic Albert pocket watch chains, a throwback to the businessrsquos Victorian roots.Mr Heath believes demand for classic wristwatches is being partly driven by people turning away from technology and the constant lsquopingrsquo of text, email and step counters emanating from mobile phones and smartwatches.ldquoPeople are looking for something that will last forever ndash there are very few things in le that are used so much but will be there after you are gone. Itrsquos a very reassuring thing to have, he said.ldquoThey donrsquot have apps or make noises, so you can go for a walk and your watch isnrsquot vibrating, telling you to check emails or texts.The art of grand feu enamelling in watchmaking is carried out by only a tiny handful of highly sophisticated watchmakers in the world because of the highly precise nature of the work and time taken to produce each piece. They include Hermes, which recently launched a grand feu enamel version of its classic Slim DrsquoHermes watches, which instantly added almost pound, to the price tag.In the case of anOrdianrsquos watches, each .mm dial consists of several layers of glass which must be delicately sanded to absolute perfection ndash the slightest kink or warp is discarded. The challenge of conquering the technique took Heath and his team of enamellers almost three years to perfect.The watches are then carefully constructed by one of Scotlandrsquos few watchmakers who, bizarrely, learned the craft by taking a British Horological Institute distance learning course while working as a picker in Amazon.Alan Burtoft of the British Horological Institute says there appears to be a sht in how many consumers are choosing their watch, boosting the once disappearing art of the watchmaker.ldquoWe have seen a steady increase in interest in people looking to learn about watchmaking and clockmaking.ldquoIt may be because people are realising you can make quite a good living from repairing clocks and watches, but there also seems to be a resurgence in interest in mechanical timepieces.ldquoIt could be that people are just fed up with novelty and lsquothrowawayrsquo watches and want something that they can keep."},{"url":null,"title":"queen-attends-church-service-aberdeenshire","story":"She arrived at Crathie Kirk, near Balmoral Castle, on Sunday morning, along with the Earl and Countess of Wessex, who are known as the Earl and Countess of Forfar while in Scotland.Members of the royal family are currently spending their summer holidays at their estate in the north-east of Scotland, as is tradition.The small Church of Scotland parish kirk is their regular place of worship when they are at Balmoral."},{"url":null,"title":"jihadi-jack-parents-condemn-javid","story":"Jack Letts was  when he left his Oxfordshire home to join the Islamic State terror group in Syria in .Letts, who held dual UK-Canadian nationality, was jailed after Kurdish forces captured him as he tried to flee to Turkey in May .The -year-olds parents, John Letts and Sally Lane, told Channel  News the British Government was \"shirking responsibility and passing the buck off to the Canadians\".Mr Letts, , told the broadcaster: \"Justice doesnt seem to be able to happen here.\"I thought British citizens had certain rights.

They want people to love living and working around the farms but they also know it can be dficult to retain staffthere is hardly any accommodation and what there is, is ropey.Among the new tenants in the Wester Ross Fisheries homes will be young graduates, attracted to Ullapool partly because there was good accommodation to go with an interesting job.These are just the sort of people to help revitalise remote rural communities that the Scottish Government wants to attract.After all, it is only going to be with young people living and working in Scotlandrsquos fragile rural areas that these places are going to have a proper future.One young graduate, working on the salmon farm off the Isle of Muck, says there are also other problems which affect people in the islands, problems most people in urban Scotland donrsquot understand.ldquoTherersquos no such thing as popping to Tesco for a pint of milk, she said.There is no shop on Muck so all food has to be brought over by boat. It is the same for fuel, which means there has to be good organising and stockpiling, plans which go awry when the ferries donrsquot arrive.Then there is broadband. Many of Scotlandrsquos salmon companies have pioneered the installation of superfast internet connections, often using fibreoptic cables, for remote communities.Last year, Scottish Sea Farms worked with broadband provider HebNet CIC to install superfast cover for the residents of the remote Knoydart peninsula and Loch Nevis.Mowi has done the same across the small isles of Muck and Rum, moves which have gone a long way to winning over communities, many of whom are enthusiastic supporters of the salmon companies because they seem to be the only ones putting in the infrastructure.On Rum, for instance, Mowi paid for the installation of a pontoon for visiting yachties with an honesty box at the end. The money collected was then given to the school, to fund trips off the island for the pupils.On all the islands where they farm, salmon companies regularly use their boats to help out, bringing building materials from the mainland and even acting as an ambulance service, taking islanders to the mainland for medical help.Scotlandrsquos salmon companies are prepared to step in and provide housing and broadband and other services to remote communities ndash they have certainly shown that.There is obviously a frustration within salmon companies that this responsibility is landing on their shoulders, but there is also a feeling that this is part of the contract they have with local communities, helping out wherever they can.Hamish Macdonell is the director of strategic engagement at Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10292374.jpg?type=article-full","title":"olaf-falafels-joke-top-fringe-funnies","story":"In the past, it has been won by japes about hedgehogs, wry observations on picking a password and one-liners about hoovers.And now Swedish comedian Olaf Falafelrsquos zinger about vegetable-related Tourettersquos, ldquoI keep randomly shouting out Broccoli and Caullower - I think I might have Florets, deemed the funniest joke at the Fringe.:Lonely Planet top  -Edinburgh Fringe is UKs star attractionEach year TV station Dave sends out its experts in search of the festivals best line, before subjecting their picks to a public vote.The Edinburgh Festival is one of the biggest cultural events in the worldOlaf Falafels line received backing from  per cent who deemed it the top tickler after it was nominated from his show Itrsquos One Giant Leek For Mankind.With the goal of finding the wittiest one-liners, an expert  of ten judges was recruited comprising the UKrsquos leading comedy critics.After touring and scouring hundreds of venues and shows at the renowned Edinburgh Festival Fringe Festival, the  submitted their favourite six jokes, listed without naming the comics behind each one, to a vote of , Brits.:Helen Bauer wants to make a scene with first Fringe performance#Winner Olaf Falafel is a surrealist comedian and illustrator.

There will also be more accountability with proposals for citizens’  and a delivery board.However, the strategy only provides a broad overview of the direction the government is taking, rather than a detailed action plan.Michael explained: “It sets out the direction we will be travelling in for the next  years, with the clear intention that this will not sit on a shelf gathering dust.“The delivery plan, which will be released when the strategy is finalised, will be updated every year to see how much progress has been made on the objectives.“That plan will contain far more detail on what we, as a government, plan to do to meet our targets.”While the government will, of course, lead the way, every Scot has a part to play in the strategy – particularly when it comes to our climate.Michael said: “Scotland has the most ambitious targets for tackling climate change in the world.“The Climate Change Bill, currently before the Scottish Parliament, includes an increased ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with a net-zero emissions target by .“Transport is currently the largest contributor to Scottish emissions.“This will be tackled through a range of actions including an ambition to phase out the need for new petrol and diesel cars and vans by .“We will promote and design our transport system so that walking, cycling, public and shared transport are promoted ahead of private car use.“However, we also need to help people make the transition to lower carbon travel – to walk or cycle for short journeys,they are able to, or use public transport ahead of single driver car journeys.“That will not only help to reduce car emissions, which are currently responsible for the most greenhouse gas emissions, but will also help people become more active, improving their health and well-being.“There is no doubt in my mind that our climate is changing. The Beast from the East ably proved that.“It cost the UK economy at least £ billion per day as gridlocked roads and no trains or buses meant many workers were unable to get into work.“We are experiencing more severe winter weather, coupled with summers which are hotter and wetter.“That should serve as a real wake up call to us all that we need to change our behaviours now.“Government has a major part to play but we each also have a personal, inidual responsibility to take action to ensure we minimise the impact that we’re having on the environment.“We have to get this right for future generations, given the impact it could have on their lives.”Michael admits that it may be a struggle to wean people away from their cars.For the car remains the dominant mode of transport in Scotland. In ,  per cent of all journeys were made either as drivers or passengers in a car or a van. This was up from  per cent in  and  per cent in .The proportion of single occupancy car trips also shows an increasing trend. The figure of  per cent in  compares with  per cent in  and  per cent in .But with  per cent of Scotland’s greenhouse gas emissions caused by transport, and cars being responsible for the lion’s share, our love affair with the car has to change.It’s for that reason the Scottish Government is moving fast to rid our streets of petrol and diesel cars.The move to electric cars by  – the most ambitious target in the UK – should help meet the emissions target.It has also recently introduced low emission zones in Glasgow city centre, with Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen set to follow.However, with bus trips also in decline, the government has a major job to do in persuading people to change their habits.Michael said: “We need to encourage people to make greater use of public transport.“That, in turn, will help reduce congestion in our cities and towns – as well as reducing emssions.“A double decker bus can take up to  passengers while occupying little more road space than a single car.“Bus use generally has been in decline since the s for a number of reasons, one being longer journey times caused by congestion on the network.“If we can tackle that, people will be more inclined to travel by bus once again.”Technology, both existing and yet to be dreamed up, will also have a role to play.Michael added: “The rail electrication project proves what we can do – we need to be ready and able to introduce new technologies.“However, what people want today and in  years is the same– linking people and places in ways that are reliable, affordable and safe.“Our strategy will be a catalyst for change. “By focusing on our priorities and delivering the outcomes, Scotland will have a transport system that demonstrates to the world that it is open for business.”The strategy opened for public consultation on Wednesday, July , and will close on Wednesday, October .The consultation team will be going out to train and bus stations across the country in the coming weeks to guage public opinion.Members of the public are also being encouraged to have their say online.Visit consult.gov.scot transport-scotland national-transport-strategy to have your say.

Orkney already generates more than enough renewable energy to meet the needs of our community.

Please feel free to contact us with any questions by phoning  ,# said those involved.A spokesperson for the project went on to say: “A huge thanks to all the landowners who have helped us by agreeing the essential land access we need to get started. With their support together we can protect Orkney’s unique wildle for future generations.”The traps will be laid around  metres apart in preferred stoat habitat, which may include some road verges. They will be checked regularly by the project staff.The Orkney Native Wildle Project is a partnership between Orkney Islands Council, Scottish Natural Heritageand RSPB Scotland. Following three years of development generous support for the project has been provided by, the Heritage Lottery Fund and EU Le, providing a combined grant of £. million for the duration of the five-year project.Stoats are native to the UK Mainland but not to Orkney, where they were first recorded in .

Residents need to be registered to take part in any future elections.Dennis Stevenson, the electoral registration officer for Orkney and Shetland, said: “It’s important that residents respond as soon as they can, so we can make sure we have the right details on the electoral register for every address in Orkney.“If you’re not currently registered, your name will not appear on the form. To make sure you can have your say at future elections, simply check the form you receive and respond as soon as possible.“All responses can now be made online and we would encourage householders, where possible, to use this method rather than ing the form in the post.”People who have changed address recently are particularly encouraged to keep an eye out for the form and check the details.Research by the independent Electoral Commission indicates that recent home movers are far less likely to be registered than those who have lived at the same address for a long period of time.Across the UK,  per cent of people who have been at their property for more than sixteen years will be registered, compared to  per cent of people who have lived at an address for less than a year.Further information about registering to vote is available on the Electoral Commission website at https:www.yourvotematters Any residents who have any questions can contact the Electoral Registration Office at  Broad Street, Kirkwall.

Labourrsquos Wes Streeting told PA the money would have been better spent on public services.He said: ldquoEvery single penny spent on this advertising campaign to prepare for the self-inflicted damage that is Brexit would have been better spent on policing, schools and the NHS.ldquoBrexit is already costing us dearly and we havenrsquot even left yet.Independent MP Heidi Allen also criticised the cost, saying taxpayersrsquo money was being ldquowasted on desperately attempting to sell a catastrophic no-deal to the public when it ldquocould have been spent on school books, medicines or stretched local authorities.ldquoWhat kind of government prioritises spending on persuading the public that the harm of a no-deal is a price worth paying ldquoBut it wonrsquot work.

And you know what  She is absolutely right.What we need more than anything , as Boris lets us teeter on a no-deal clf edge, is someone who will put the country first. We need consensus.We need politicians to sit around the table and start talking common sense. The clock is ticking, and we need to make progress fast. The truth is that quite a few of us at Westminster have been trying to do that for the past year.Groups of Liberal Democrat, Labour, Conservative, even SNP MPs have been meeting regularly to work on common ground and an approach which puts the country before inidual party interest.Jeremy Corbyn has not been part of those discussions.: Jo Swinson ‘daft’ to oppose Jeremy Corbyn plan to stop no deal Brexit, says Nicola SturgeonFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereIndeed, for most of the past year I could not have told you where the Labour frontbench stood on Brexit. Were they for it  Against no-deal  Supporting Remain  We all know their policy descriptor has been ‘constructive ambiguity’. I would agree with half of that statement, and it is certainly not the word ‘constructive’.There have, of course, been Labour and former Labour MPs who have been more than happy working to find a common route forward. One of them was Chuka Umunna. And former Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston was another who was prepared to search for that consensus.Signicantly, both of them now sit as Liberal Democrats. They will be joined on the yellow benches after recess by Parliament’s newest MP, Jane Dodds.She was the Lib Dem victor in the recent Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, when Remain parties worked together to put the country’s interest before that of our inidual parties. Which brings me back to exactly what the country is crying out for: consensus.This past week Jo Swinson argued that what we need now is a vote of no-confidence to replace this Boris-led administration with a government of national unity.In her first major keynote speech since becoming leader, she laid out the case that the Prime Minister’s determination to leave on  October “do or die” is utterly irresponsible.She described a no-deal Brexit as bad for the NHS, bad for the rural economy and bad for our family of nations in the United Kingdom.: Jeremy Corbyn: ‘It’s not up to Jo Swinson to decide next PM’And she said that to be certain of preventing that no-deal outcome we need a successful vote of no confidence in Johnson’s administration.Then, within  days we need to install a temporary cross-party government with an alternative Prime Minister who has the confidence of the House and will stop a no-deal Brexit.We are facing a national emergency and we need an emergency government to resolve it. What she didn’t say, and what caused an immediate angry reaction from the left, is that Jeremy Corbyn should be that alternative Prime Minister.The reason for that is simple: he does not have the numbers. He is unable to command the support of enough MPs across the House to make that happen.Of course, Nicola Sturgeon has said that her MPs would support Jeremy Corbyn – just a week after his sidekick John McDonnell made it clear that a future Labour government would be happy to see another independence referendum in Scotland.But where there is reticence to back a party leader who has found it dficult to command the support of many of his own MPs throughout this parliament.It would need Conservative MPs to back a man they have already failed to find a compromise with on Brexit. Would they not all be more likely to back someone seen to be above party politics Which brings me back to Ken Clarke and Harriet Harman.Surely either of them, or perhaps another political grandee, has the reputation and respect to galvanise Tory rebels, Labour Remainers, Liberal Democrats, SNP, Plaid Cymru, Caroline Lucas and the independents.It does have to be all of them, because that is the only way that it can succeed. AndMr Corbyn genuinely wants that to happen surely even, he can see that he should agree to someone  leading it.This should not be about personalities, or inidual parties, but about finding a way that actually works. Don’t get me wrong. If Mr Corbyn can somehow overcome the past two years and suddenly command cross-party support in the House and successfully steer us away from the clf-edge, I would be happy.But so far, I see no prospect of that, and we do not have time to wait and seehe can. The clock is ticking, and we are getting ever closer to that clf-edge.We need that vote of no confidence, we need that unity government and we need to take this back to the people to be sure of what they really want.Most of all we need to avoid the no-deal that would be so disastrous for all of us. In pursuing that solution Jo Swinson and the Liberal Democrats have only one red line. It has to be a proposal that can work.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"lesley riddoch a modern highland clerance is being hidden behind a population boom in inverness","story":"The Highlands population boom is happening in its cities and towns, masking on-going problems, writes Lesley Riddoch. There’s plenty of good news for the Highlands and Islands.Visitor numbers are up. Orkney leads the sht to electric cars and renewable energy. And now, Spain Greece and Croatia are so impressed with Highland and Islands Enterprisethey plan to set up similar growth-creating quangos of their own.Why  Because the Highlands has reversed centuries of population decline to regain its ’s total of , folk - and these southern EU member states believe HIE and its predecessor the Highlands and Islands Development Board are largely responsible.Now it would be churlish not to express delight that the “basket-case” Highlands have proved doubters wrong. HIE and more particularly the HIDB have indeed pump-primed much of that economic development and the University of the Highlands and Islands, with its digital learning and dispersed campuses, has been another positive development.But it would be mistaken to presume the job-creating quangos have single-handedly produced a miraculous pan-Highland population increase - as I think they would be first to admit. It would be wrong to presume population growth is happening beyond Highland towns and cities like Inverness, Aviemore, Nairn, Dingwall, Fort William, Oban, Kirkwall, Lerwick and Portreewrong to presume that the region’s age profile is irrelevant and absolutely wrong to think the  population total is as good as the Highlands and Islands can get.While the population of Highland towns is growing, more remote areas are facing a modern clearance as short-term lets for tourists replace long-term leases for locals, empty glens, thanks to Scotland’s archaic land ownership patterns, the loss of East-European seasonal labour thanks to Brexit, the impending impact of tarfs on agricultural produce and public transport cuts. It would be troublingthe decision to use HIE as a role model by Mediterranean states, gave the impression that all’s well in Highlandand prompted Scots to question the need for urgent action to stop another generation of young Highland Scots giving up and moving out. Yesterday, a Sunday newspaper spent five pages questioning the success of community landownership in Scotland on the basis of one problematic forestry scheme on Bute. Is this really the Highlands’ biggest issue  What’s needed is a wider perspective. Firstly, urban growth can easily conceal the hard fact that half an hour down the road, “remote” Highland and Island communities are really struggling.Last year a report by the James Hutton Institute predicted the working age population in Scotland’s rural areas will plummet by a third by , pushing communities in remote corners of the Highlands and Islands into a “spiral of decline.” It found “sparsely populated areas” - defined as those more than half an hour away from a town of , folk - account for almost half of Scotland’s land mass, but just . per cent of Scotland’s population. These places are projected to lose more than a quarter of their population in the next  years, with Western Isles, Argyll and the Southern Uplands among the worst affected. Yet the picture is so dferent in the Highland capital. In , the population of Inverness was ,. In  it was almost ,, with a quarter of the Highland population living in or around it. So, let’s call a spade a spade. The Inverness Black Isle Nairn corridor is doing well - picking up southerners looking for the best quality of le in the UK and young Highlanders pushed out of more remote glens - not because land there is irredeemably infertile and fit only for use as a grouse moor, rich man’s playground or re-wilding but because centuries of paternalistic ownership mean there’s no available, affordable land, therefore no affordable housing and therefore no feasible way for younger folk to take advantage of the jobs and business opportunities that absolutely do exist. Planning presumptions all too often mirror that man-made, unnatural emptiness. So, let’s think again about the levels of population we should expect in the Highlands and Islands and reconsider the date chosen to illustrate the scale of the present population surge.The s saw the Highlands on its collective knees after seventy years of clearance and widespread starvation as a result of the potato famine. Is this a suitable benchmark for the carrying capacity of the scenic, energy-rich, culturally-vibrant region today We should be comparing and contrasting the Highlands and Islands not with the region’s own broken past but with the thriving present of its neighbours - like Tromso, the capital of Arctic Norway. Situated on an island amidst barren fjords, it lies more than a thousand miles north of Inverness. Yet the population of this truly remote city matches the Highland capital with , folk. Arctic Bodø has . residents, Alta , and sub-Arctic Trondheim a whopping , residents.The relatively high population base of remote Northern Norway has been achieved not by the actions of specic quangos, but by the fact Norway escaped feudalism, therefore has the largest and most erse number of inidual landowners in Europe and land prices that are a fraction of those demanded for the tiny parcels available in Highland Scotland. Folk in Northern Norway were also aided by the abolition of nobility in , the nationalisation of rivers for hydro power straight after independence and a long tradition of ultra-local democratic control which prompted investment in light industry.Let’s be clear. Scotland’s community buyouts have boosted highland and island populations and provided jobs with secure, affordable and properly insulated homes in remote areas where private owners miserably failed. The problem is that rural Scotland cannot be fixed, acre by acre, or buyout by buyout. Community control delivers speedy relief for the communities able to jump hurdles and take over control, but places a strain on volunteers and leaves Scotland’s highly dysal systems of land ownership and distant democratic control unchanged and intact. So, let’s imagine what the Highlands might look likeHolyrood and Westminster politicians were as bold as community activists, delivering the modern equivalent of the Crofting Acts, or the high rates of taxation that prompted one-fth of Scottish land to be sold in the s or Tom Johnston’s hydro-electric revolution in the s.The Highlands urgently needs release from outdated feudal structures to grow sustainably. Governments not quangos can deliver.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"the scotsman says any future independence referendum must pose the right question","story":"Doubtless, it is a development that will frustrate supporters of independence but we believe the Electoral Commission is correct to intervene in discussions over the staging of a second referendum on Scotland#s place in the UK.The elections watchdog’s insistence it must be allowed to assess the question that would be asked may prevent First Minister Nicola Sturgeon from staging the quick-fire referendum she desires but recent experience tells us a careful approach to such votes is essential.The commission – which has also proposed a y timeframe for the staging of any second referendum – has called for a series of changes to Scottish Government legislation, paving the way for Indyref. Perhaps the most problematic issue is the proposed wording of any referendum question. The Scottish Government has proposed the commission should not, where it has previously been involved in assessing the question asked of voters, have any further input. This would mean the First Minister could simply ask the same question – should Scotland be an independent country  – as in . However, the commission ruled out a Yes No question in ’s EU referendum, insisting a question to which the answer was either Leave or Remain was more balanced.The Scotsman will take no position during a future independence referendum campaign but it is our view that such a vote must be scrupulously fair, with the wording of the question giving no advantage to either side. We are also in favour of the commission’s proposal for greater controls over campaign spending and tougher powers to deal with any breaches of financial limits. It is clear that regulation of spending during the EU referendum was not as strict as it should have been and damaging ‘grey areas’ were allowed to develop.Nicola Sturgeon and her supporters hunger for a referendum in the next year. The chances of this happening were always going to be slender. The Conservative Government has, after all, repeatedly made clear its opposition to a second vote on independence.The First Minister may see the opportunity to make political capital from this latest apparent road block but we hope she, and all political leaders, will engage with the Electoral Commission to ensure that – should it take place – the next referendum on Scottish independence is scrupulously fair.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"mice droppings and mould found at michelin starred the kitchin in edinburgh","story":"According to the Scottish Mail on Sunday, The Kitchin, which opened in Edinburgh in , was also criticised for having too few sinks.The newspaper said a council report on hygiene warns the famous chef to clean up his restaurants act.The restaurant, where tasting menus charge up to £ a head, was awarded a Michelin star in , and has held onto it ever since.City of Edinburgh Council inspectors reportedly visited the restaurant in June. - Football riot kills three and injures , including former Celtic playerThe documents, which the paper obtained under Freedom of Information laws, show the chef was informed that follow-up checks would take place.The letter reads: \"An inspection of the above premises was carried out on June  , when the following contraventions were noted.

The Electoral Commission has also set out a year-long timeframe for holding a second vote on leaving the UK that appears to make the First Minister’s hopes to stage a poll late next year increasingly forlorn.The Scottish Government has published legislation at Holyrood to pave the way for a second referendum but the commission calls for a series of changes to be made in key areas, including the proposed question, in a submission to Holyrood’s constitution committee.The watchdog warns: “The Electoral Commission must be required to assess any referendum question proposed in legislation, and set the commission’s views before the Scottish Parliament, regardless of whether the commission has previously published views on the question proposed.”What question will be put to voters has been contentious since the ReferendumsBill was published in May. The bill said that,the proposed question had already been assessed by the commission, it should not have to be assessed again. This would exclude the commission’s involvement in the same question as  – “Should Scotland be an Independent Country ”The commission has since ruled out a Yes No question in the Brexit referendum, instead recommending a Remain Leave question. This was found to be more balanced after fresh evidence was taken.A change from Yes No to a Leave Remain question could damage the pro-independence movement, with the Yes campaign widely seen as having been successful in conveying a positive message in .In its submission to MSPs, the commission says: “At any referendum it is essential that voters can easily understand and answer the question and any statement which precedes it on the ballot paper.“The intelligibility of the referendum question is fundamental to voters’ ease of understanding and participation in the referendum and underpins the legitimacy of the outcome.”Although not obliged to accept the recommendations of the commission, it would be politically dficult for the SNP to forge ahead with plans for a second referendum without the endorsement of the independent elections watchdog. The Scottish Government would also need authorisation from Westminster through a Section  order to stage a second referendum. It may be that a future UK government inclined to grant a Section  order would withhold it until the Electoral Commission’s views are respected.Ms Sturgeon’s hopes of staging the referendum late next year were undermined by a timeframe of at least nine months set out by the commission. This would include a -week period for the watchdogto assess the question and provide a view on it before legislation or regulations are passed. The legislation should also be passed six months before the final ten-week referendum period, when rules around campaigning and spending apply. It suggests time is running out on Ms Sturgeon’s preferred timeframe of late next year for a second referendum, with the legislation itself yet to be formally passed at Holyrood.There are also concerns over the risk of foreign companies using UK subsidiaries to fund referendum campaigns in Scotland with money that comes from outside the UK.The commission wants better information about campaign spending recorded by participants, and powers to impose fines of £, instead of the £, proposed in the bill.A Scottish Government spokesperson said the legislation makes “specic provision” for the involvement of the commission to consider the proposed referendum question. The concern centres on “repeat testing” of questions that have already been found to be intelligible. He added: “It will be for Parliament as a whole to decide and vote on these matters – both the proposals in the bill and in any regulations made under it – and we will of course listen to all views put forward.“ The  referendum question was proposed by the Electoral Commission and provides clear precedent for a simple, straightforward and understandable question.”Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, said the Scottish Government must respect the views of the elections watchdog.She said: “If MSPs press ahead with the bill, it is vital that this important recommendation from the Electoral Commission is actioned.”“Should we ever be in the situation where Scotland’s place in the UK is subject to another referendum, to ensure that it is carried out fairly and the result is respected by all, the wording of the question must be looked at again by the Electoral Commission in all circumstances, includingthe question proposed is the same as in .”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"snp defends caledonian macbrayne ni payments to 1 000 seafaring staff","story":"The Scottish Government says the use of offshore crewing firms in the ferry industry is #accepted practice# after it emerged that state-owned giant Caledonian MacBrayne had avoided paying an estimated # million in National Insurance for employees who are seafarers.CalMac Ferries is wholly owned by the Scottish Government and operates the Clyde and Hebrides ferry service.

Neils grandmother is in the centre of the centre row.He said: “A good friend of mine owned a bar in Dromore, she gave me an old bottle that said ‘ginger beer’ on it. It was meant as a joke because I’m ginger, but it ended up starting a fascination with bottles.“I started looking into where the bottles were made and background to them.“My original intent was to collect a bottle from every county, but soon I found out there are a lot of bottles out there, probably  known bottles. They are very dficult to find. I would hunt through antique shops, flea markets, auctions and that type of thing. You also pick some up by word of mouth or even dig them up from an old dump site.“My collection ranges from Coleraine to Cork, but a number of local bottles have eluded me. I am aware of bottles from Lurgan, Portadown and Banbridge but am yet to locate these. In particular, the Crystal Mineral Water company in Banbridge produced some fantastic stoneware bottles and it would be the pinnacle of my collection to add one of these.” The bottle from the Crystal Mineral Company in Banbridge that Neil would love to add to his collectionExplaining the history of stoneware bottles, he said: “They were produced during the Victorian era, late s, early s, and were all hand made. No two bottles are the same due to the processes involved, but the minor flaws are what add to their charm. “Historically stone bottles were gradually replaced by mass produced glass bottles, the result of which is that many of these were buried in landfill sites or dumped in rivers and canals and can be dficult to locate.”Neil added: “I’ve always had a big interest in local social history, these stoneware bottles are part of it. I have been working hard in documenting the past so that it can be preserved for future generations. “I have amassed a collection of local items, everything from clocks to water pumps, but there are a few items that I have struggled to find. I am keen to locate any stoneware bottles from Banbridge and anything relating to the Dunbar McMaster spinning mill in Gilford.”He said: “I was born in Gilford into one of the mill workers houses owned by the Dunbar McMaster company and my family were historically mill workers there. I have a fantastic photo of my grandmother working in the mill taken during the Coronation in . I am seeking anything relating to the mill and its history such as receipts, packaging or advertising or even furniture.”Neil commented: “I am part of a local history group, who meet regularly to discuss past events and places and we regularly showcase items so that they can be shared by all.“I would really love to put on an exhibition in Banbridge and that’s probably where this is going.”Open Day raises over £, Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Sadly Neil’s we Kate doesn’t share his enthusiasm for artefacts from the past: “She thinks it’s a load of junk, she’s a minimalist.”If you can help Neil add to his collection email him at neilreid@gmail"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed the 20 ni sights on lonely planet s ultimate uk travel guide","story":"The Giant#s Causeway has been ranked as the UK#s third best tourist destination by respected travel guide Lonely Planet, finishing ahead of attractions such as Hadrian#s Wall and London#s Tate Modern art gallery.For the first time Lonely Planet has picked its  most unmissable experiences and hidden gems across Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands to form its ultimate UK travel hitlist.Titanic Belfast was also ranked in the top  UK destinations by Lonely PlanetIn total,  sights and experiences in Northern Ireland feature in the list which was unveiled today, including the Crown Liquor Saloon in Belfast, Rathlin Island and Londonderry’s walls.Out of the score of attractions only one is in Co Armagh , while none of the sights in Co Tyrone feature in the Lonely Planet must see list.Welcoming the news, Niall Gibbons, CEO of Tourism Ireland, said: “The inclusion of  Northern Ireland experiences and attractions – including the Giant’s Causeway at number three – in Lonely Planet’s ‘Ultimate UK Travelist’ is good news and will surely help to inspire GB travellers to put Northern Ireland on their holiday wish-list. “It is another well-deserved accolade for all of these attractions, which provides Tourism Ireland with a great hook to continue to promote Northern Ireland as a ‘must visit’ destination.”Lonely Planet’s VP of Experience, Tom Hall, said: “Lonely Planet’s Ultimate United Kingdom Travelist brings together the UK’s most compelling sights and experiences, ranging from world-class museums and giant cathedrals to rollicking festivals, inky lochs and tiny pubs. “We’re thrilled to name the Giant’s Causeway one of the UK’s very best sights - alongside many other wonderful experiences in Northern Ireland including spotting puffins and seals on Rathlin Island and riding a boat through Co Fermanagh’s Marble Arch Caves.”Giant’s Causeway is described by Lonely Planet as “timeless” and “unrepeatable” and is beaten only by the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and London’s British Museum.The Ultimate UK Travelist is available at a cost of £..

While helping families move out of the burned streets of Clonard, Gerald, a member of the Fianna youth, was shot dead by on Waterville Street, not far from his Colinward Street family home. During the Scarman tribunal, an acting superior of Clonard Monastery spoke of how he had given Gerald and three others hit by shotgun blasts the last rites. Gerald was taken to the Royal Victoria Hospital where he was pronounced dead at .pm. The tribunal concluded he had been shot by a Protestant gunman. Speaking to the Andersonstown News Gerald’s -year-old mother Nellie spoke of how her second oldest child was born on the Feast of St Gerard and how much he loved fishing, birds, motor racing and bikes. “I remember when Gerald left school, he went to St Thomas’, he got himself a job in a factory in Northumberland Street. I remember he was working in it around three weeks and he came home and said ‘Mummy, the boss wants to see you.’ The first thing I asked was ‘What have you done ’ I went down and the man praised Gerald, how much of a good, clean worker he was and told me how much he had in common with his own sons. He told me how he wanted Gerald to go to the Tech come September but that Gerald had told him how he wanted to join the Irish Merchant Navy when he came of age. I saidthat’s his wish I can’t hold him back.”Nellie spoke of how on August   she had gone out to look for Gerald as he hadn’t come home.Telling how fraught the roads around Kashmir, Falls and Albert Street had become as violence flared around her and her son Jim as they looked for Gerald. “I remember Gerald came in around am that night and went to bed. I got up the next morning to go to work, I worked in C#A as a cleaner and I turned on the news. It was saying about Patrick Rooney, Trooper McCabe and the fella, the bus driver from Ardoyne who had been killed. I came home later that day and Gerald was in the house with his friend. I said to him ‘Waren’t you in work ’ He said ‘Mummy, there is no work, it’s gone, it’s away.’ He went straight out again and that was the last I saw him.”Nellie said she went out to look for Gerald as trouble continued to flare and found herself at the City Hospital. “I remember the Sister on the ward brought me into the office and I said to her that I was looking for my son. She went out and came back and I will always remember how she said ‘No mother, he’s not here, there’s only a boy of around  in Musgrave.’ I said that’s him, that’s Gerald. “Gerald was a big lad, he had it in the shoulders, he had a big frame and he wore a size  shoe. I remember later a priest being on the other side of the street from our house, he was wearing a heavily beaded vest, a beret and a stick and said ‘Mrs McAuley your son has gone to Heaven,’ then he turned on his heel and walked away.”Following Gerald’s death Nellie recalled her feelings: “You’re here and you’re not here. About six weeks after Gerard was buried we were invited up to the old Felons at the side of the cemetery and that night they had a colour party come on the stage and said that night that Gerard was in the Fianna from  years old. Looking back on it Gerald asked me could he go away for a week with the boys out of school. I remember he said he needed five shillings and could I give it to him. He said he needed an enamel plate, cup, mug and even then the penny didn’t drop. I brought him down to Millets and we got the plate, everything. The fella in the shop said he would need a wee container to carry his eggs in and we got that as well. Soon after he came in to say ‘Mummy I’m awful sorry some of the boys couldn’t get their money and couldn’t go.’ I don’t know how long after that then he did go.”  years on from the anniversary of Gerald’s death on Thursday, Nellie reflected how she “wasn’t ing right” half a century ago.” “I never had any hatred. Gerald died on the Feast of the Assumption, August , that’s Her day, he was taken on Her day and that’s the way I looked at it.” A wreath-laying ceremony for Gerald McAuley will take on Friday, August  at .pm in Bombay Street Memorial Garden.

From  stylish bedrooms, a stunning bar with an extensive drinks and cocktails menu and even an eye-catching garden and bridal suite, the Lansdowne has it all.As for grub, the Lansdowne caters for diners from AM to PM and a recent Thursday lunchtime visit for myself and two colleagues offered us the chance to sample some dishes from their lunch menu.The menu is made up of light bites, small plates and main plates so your choice depends on just how hungry you are and how much time you have. We were greeted and shown to our table by their new yet welcoming staff and joined for lunch on this occasion by co-owner Jim McLaughlin who took little time in doing the work for us by selecting some of his favourite and most popular dishes from across the lunch menu. Jim’s background is in food, so we had no hesitation he would deliver the right goods to the table.It wasn’t long before our huge selection of grub arrived in front of us and left us with the question, where to begin We were served three main plates – the larger courses on the Lansdowne lunch menu. First up was the simple yet classic Chicken Caesar salad – a generous portion of sliced chargrilled chicken mixed in with maple-cured bacon lardons, baby gem lettuce, garlic focaccia croutons and lashed with parmesan shavings drizzled in Caesar dressing. Often known as the not so healthy salad option for dieters, it would have been rude not to try this classic and spoonful after spoonful, the smorgasbord of flavours really came out. The next main plate was the duck confit, served on a bed of sweet potato mash, green beans with a dash of herb butter and red wine jus. For me, it was quite the standout dish and as a duck lover, it hit all the right spots from the crispiness on the outside to the easily torn-off meat on the inside, all brought to le by the sweet potato mash and red wine jus.The last of the main plates was my colleague’s definition of heaven – a huge pot of steamed mussels in garlic and white wine cream and served with rosemary and red onion focaccia bread. A massive lover of all things fish, the silence at the table was noticeable as she made her way through the portion, which, priced at just £, could easily be shared amongst two.Also served up on this lunchtime occasion was a selection of small plates which are proving the most popular choice od customers, according to Jim. Small plates are exactly what they say on the tin and take a form similar to Spanish tapas, meaning they are ideal to share. Customers can choose  for £,  for £ or  for £ so whether you want a nibble over a drink or simply can’t choose and need to try a few, the world is your oyster at the Lansdowne.For me, the stand-out small plate was the crispy pork belly with a layer of caramel apple sauce. Pork belly is one of my favourite things and, having previously worked in a Chinese restaurant, I am all too familiar with it and this did not disappoint.Another triumph was the firecracker chicken wings, served with a blue cheese dip. The wings were a perfect combination of a fiery wsoon overtaken by the wonderful dip – I would highly recommend.The brie also deserves a paragraph to itself because it was simply mouth-watering. A crispy shell was soon followed by the delicious melted delight that is brie but the dish was really taken to the next level by the homemade blackcurrant gel and it is not dficult to see why it is the most popular side dish order, according to Jim.Also served to us on small plates was the crispy beef: large chunks of beef brisket which were cooked to perfection and beautully seasoned with pickled carrot and a tastebud tingling Asian dressing which ensured the beef inside the crispiness was moist and melting.The deep fried salt and chilli squid was equally as good and something I also adore – well, anything salt and chilli really. The squid was fresh, fried expertly and served with a napa salad, harissa mayo, coriander and sesame seeds, it would put some Chinese restaurants’ attempt at the dish to shame.The small plates were a huge success on our visit and enjoyed in the impressive surroundings of the stylish bar, for me it was exactly how ‘bar food’ should be – in fact, it was on another level. I cannot wait to try some of the other small plates which include spicy Italian meatballs, crab bruscietta and sweet potato bhajis. The main plates were mighty fine too and maybe with a cocktail or two the next time. I am already looking forward to planning my next lunchtime visit to the Antrim Road’s famous stalwart. The Lansdowne is back with a bang – and so is quality food in North Belfast.The Lansdowne Hotel Antrim Rd, Belfast, BT EFTel:    www.thelansdownehotel"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38414673.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/8560983-_Read-Only_.jpg","title":"brexit election a unique chance to alter course of uk history says corbyn","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr Corbyn will say a general election could lead to a change on the scale of  or , warning that things \"cannot go on as they were before\". Last week his plan to be installed as a caretaker Prime Minister to prevent a no-deal Brexit failed to win the support of Tory Remainers and the Liberal Democrats, who he would need on side to succeed. But he will tell the Pen Green Childrens Centre in Corby that Britain faces even greater problems than crashing out of the EU, and will say that a Labour Government would offer the \"real change of direction the country needs\". Mr Corbyn is expected to say: \"While Brexit is the framework of the crisis we face, the problems facing our country run much deeper. \"A general election triggered by the Tory Brexit crisis will be a crossroads for our country. \"It will be a once-in-a-generation chance for a real change of direction, potentially on the scale of  or . Things cannot go on as they were before.\" Accusing the Conservatives of having \"failed our country\", he will say Boris Johnson and his \"hard right Tory Cabinet have direct responsibility for the Tory decade of devastating damage done to our communities and the fabric of our society\". He will add: \"However the Brexit crisis is resolved, the country faces a fundamental choice. \"Labour offers the real change of direction the country needs: a radical programme to rebuild and transform communities and public services, invest in the green jobs and high tech industries of the future, and take action to tackle inequality and climate crisis. \"The Tories have lurched to the hard right under Boris Johnson, Britains Trump, the fake populist and phoney outsider, funded by the hedge funds and bankers, committed to protecting the vested interests of the richest and the elites, while posing as anti-Establishment.\" Mr Corbyn will go on to say: \"Labour believes the decision on how to resolve the Brexit crisis must go back to the people. \"Andthere is a general election this autumn, Labour would commit to holding a public vote, to give voters the final say, with credible options for both sides, including the option to remain.\" Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly said: \"Jeremy Corbyn has done all he can to frustrate delivering on the referendum result. This is a cynical attempt to seize power by a man who would wreck the economy, is soft on crime and wont stand up for Britain. All Jeremy Corbyn offers is more dither and delay. Only Boris Johnson and the Conservatives can provide the leadership Britain needs and deliver Brexit by October , whatever happens.\" Yesterday, Business Minister Kwasi Kwarteng played down suggestions that there could be an election campaign ahead of October . \"I dont think anyone is talking about calling an election, theres a lot of speculation about things like a government of national unity and all the rest of it,\" he told Skys Sophy Ridge on Sunday. \"I dont see that as a way forward. In order to have a general election lots of things have to happen which, I think, in my opinion, are unlikely to happen but well have to wait and see. \"The main focus of this Government is to deliver the referendum and to leave on October .\" "},{"url":null,"title":"leaking of operation yellowhammer attempt to undermine eu negotiations foster","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The businesses in Portglenone are delighted as its brought a lot more people into the town.\"It doesnt take that long to sow the seeds,\" said Damian, who works at the local DLF Seeds company and knows what it takes to bring the field to le. \"It was just a couple of hours of walking up and down shaking the fiddle, but after that its out of your hands as to whether everything comes good.\"This year Damien and Karen, with their three children Cara , Ryanand Therese , have crafted another masterpiece. Visitors are greeted by scenes reminiscent of a Monet impressionist painting with a touch of Van Gogh, all on the edge of Seamus Heaney country.\"We live in a very green country with lots of rolling meadows, but people seem to like a splash of colour too. Its dferent and we like to think its a very romantic setting,\" said Damien. \"We had three marriage proposals in the field last year, wedding parties coming for photographs, plenty of fashion photo shoots, buses stopping off on tours of the country and, of course, plenty of photographers. There were also a couple of music videos filmed.\"The families who have come along are getting back to nature. Its so good that people are getting out into the fresh air and appreciating natural beauty. Kids are running around the path spotting butterflies.\"Thats an added bonus this year, with a neighbour lending an extra acre-sized field where Damian has created the perfect haven for butterflies, and when work commitments allow, he is only too happy to take visitors on a guided walk through the wildflowers.\"Its worked so well,\" he said. \"Were getting plenty of guests! \"Weve seen some of the rarer types, like painted ladies and peacocks. Youd almost think they were looking at you as the patterns on the wings resemble eyes. Its lovely to see them coming into their natural habitat.\"Obviously were relying a lot on the weather, but its been warm enough so far this year to allow the sunflowers to come out. They are a tropical plant, so heavy rain can take its toll, but theyve survived so far andwe can manage to get a couple of decent sunny days, even more of them should come out. Were at around % right now, and they thrive on direct sunlight.\"Karen and her kids, plus an army of young people from the town, have all been roped in to keep the meadow in tip top shape, and she expects the field to be open to the public for the next few weeks.\"Obviously theres a limited time span for when the sunflowers are in bloom, soanyone does want to take a stroll through, forget all about everyday le and lose themselves in a natural world, the next two to three weeks will be the best time to experience it,\" she said.\"In the meantime, were only too happy to have people as our guests, bring a picnic or a flask of tea and enjoy it while it lasts.\"This year, Damien and Karen are raising money for Macmillan Cancer Support. Entry is £ or £ for  to -year-olds. Under s go free.

a catastrophic collapse in the nations infrastructure,\" the Times reported.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Prime Minister Boris Johnson The report outlines the fall-out that Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal would cause to Northern Ireland.It says: \"On Day  of No Deal, Her Majestys government will activate the no new checks with limited expectations model on March , establishing a legislative framework and essential operations and system on the ground, to avoid an immediate risk of ato a hard border on the UK side.\"The model is likely to prove unsustainable because of economic, legal and biosecurity risks.\"It notes that EU tarfs on goods entering Ireland \"will severely disrupt trade,\" forcing some businesses to close or relocate.\"The agri-food sector will be hardest hit, given its reliance on complicated cross-border supply chains and the high tarf and non-tarf barriers to trade.\"Disruption to key sectors and job losses are likely to result in protests and direct action with road blockades.\"Price and other dferentials are likely to lead to the growth of the illegitimate economy.\"This will be particularly severe in border communities where criminal and dissident groups already operate with greater freedom,\" the document warns.Michelle O’NeillResponding to the Sunday Times report, Sinn Fein deputy leader Michelle ONeill said: “A no deal Brexit will mean economic apartheid on the island of Ireland and the biggest risk to the economy in a generation with manufacturing and agri-food sectors becoming the hardest hit.“Staying within the single market and customs union, safeguarding the Good Friday Agreement, protecting business, jobs and the all-island economy and citizen’s rights remains paramount for the majority of the people of the North, and across Ireland.“The British Government is dealing with the North of Ireland and the peace process as though it’s a commodity and it is a reckless, dangerous approach to take and one which must be opposed by the EU , US Congress and those who value the progress of the past  years in Ireland.”However, Michael Gove, the Cabinet minister responsible for no-dealing planning, said the document represented a \"worst-case scenario\" and that very signicant steps have been taken in the last three weeks to accelerate Brexit planning.Meanwhile, the leaked report said up to  per cent of lorries using the main English channel crossings \"may not be ready\" for French customs, meaning disruption at ports would potentially last up to three months before the flow of traffic improves.\"The file, marked \"official-sensitive\" — requiring security clearance on a \"need to know\" basis — is remarkable because it gives the most comprehensive assessment of the UK’s readiness for a no-deal Brexit.\"After more than three years of Brexit dominating EU affairs, the bloc has repeatedly refused to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement which includes an Irish border insurance policy that Johnsons predecessor, Theresa May, agreed in November.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Angela Merkel Johnson will this week tell French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel that the Westminster parliament cannot stop Brexit and a new deal must be agreedBritain is to avoid leaving the EU without one.The British prime minister is coming under pressure from politicians across the political spectrum to prevent a disorderly departure, with opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn vowing this week to bring down Johnsons government in early September to delay Brexit.It is, however, unclearlawmakers have the unity or power to use the British parliament to prevent a no-deal departure - likely to be the United Kingdoms most signicant move since World War Two.Opponents of no deal say it would be a disaster for what was once one of the Wests most stable democracies. A disorderly orce, they say, would hurt global growth, send shockwaves through financial markets and weaken London’s claim to be the world’s preeminent financial centre.Brexit supporters say there may be short-term disruption from a no-deal exit but that the economy will thrivecut free from what they cast as a doomed experiment in integration that has led to Europe falling behind China and the United States."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I think it reflects well on the school, the pupils and the standards set by staff.\"Mr Skelton said the league table \"shows the success of the grammar school system\" and he added: \"Pastoral care is a massive part of it. We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

In recent times, many of our young and our most highly educated citizens have emigratedCharlie FlanaganDe facto partners of Irish citizens will be allowed to apply for permission to reside in the country before they travel to Ireland.“Pre-clearance will provide greater certainty for people considering or planning on moving back home to Ireland with their non-EEA de facto partner,” Mr Flanagan said.He said he wants to ensure there is a “clear and simple” path for those who want toto Ireland.“I hope this will encourage more people to come home. In recent times, many of our young and our most highly educated citizens have emigrated,” he said.“They may have wanted to further their careers, make more money, or simply to experience the wider world. While away, some have met le partners and perhaps even started their own families. “We want to show these people that Ireland is ready to welcome them home and that we will provide a clear immigration and labour market pathway for their de facto partners.”The change means the immigration situation of de facto partners will be more akin to non-EEA spouses and civil partners of Irish citizens.Under the previous system, the application process for de facto partners could only begin after their arrival in the state and may have taken up to a year to complete.Now, once pre-clearance has been granted, applicants can arrive and register with the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Serviceimmediately, and will have access to the labour market straight away.The new process addresses one of the key recommendations of the Indecon Report, Addressing Challenges faced by ing Irish emigrants, and is part of an ongoing INIS customer service improvement plan.Full details and further information on the revised arrangements, including the criteria for obtaining pre-clearance, are set out on the INIS website www.inis.gov.ie"},{"url":null,"title":"gp surgeries in england ordered to stop halfday closing","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

AUTOCROP h bpanews_ff-ef-e-bb-dd_EmailAn Iranian supertanker hauling  million dollarsworth of crude oil that the US suspects is tied to a sanctioned organisation has begun moving away from Gibraltar, marine traffic monitoring data showed late Sunday..pushThe trail left by GPS data on Marinetraffic, a vessel tracking service, showed the Iran-flagged Adrian Darya , previously known as Grace , moving shortly before midnight.The tanker slowly steered south east toward a narrow stretch of international waters separating Morocco and the southern tip of the Iberian Peninsula.The vessel had been detained for a month in Gibraltar for allegedly attempting to breach European Union sanctions on Syria.Gibraltar authorities rejected an eleventh-hour attempt by the United States to reseize the oil tanker, arguing that EU regulations are less strict than US sanctions on Iran.The vessel’s next destination was not immediately known.Iran’s ambassador to Britain, Hamid Baeidinejad, had earlier announced on Twitter that the ship was expected to leave Sunday night.The tanker’s release comes amid a growing confrontation between Iran and the West after US President Donald Trump pulled Washington out of Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers more than a year ago.Shortly after the tanker’s detention in early July near Gibraltar, Iran seized the British-flagged oil tanker Stena Impero, which remains held by the Islamic Republic.Analysts had said the Iranian ship’s release by Gibraltar could see the Stena Impero go free.Gibraltar’s government said Sunday it was allowing the Iranian tanker’s release because “the EU sanctions regime against Iran – which is applicable in Gibraltar – is much narrower than that applicable in the US”.In a last-ditch effort to stop the release, the US unsealed a warrant Friday to seize the vessel and its cargo of . million barrels of light crude oil, citing violations of US sanctions as well as money laundering and terrorism statutes.US officials told reporters that the oil aboard the ship was worth some  million dollars and that it was destined for a designated terror organisation to conduct more terrorism.The unsealed court documents argued that Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps are the ship’s true owners through a network of front companies.Authorities in Gibraltar said Sunday that, unlike in the US, Iran’s Revolutionary Guard is not designated a terrorist organisation under EU, UK or Gibraltar law.The Iranian ship was detained while sailing under a Panamanian flag with the name Grace .As of Sunday, it had been renamed the Adrian Darya  and had hoisted an Iranian flag.Workers were seen painting the new name on the side of the ship Saturday.Iran has not disclosed the Adrian Darya ’s intended destination and has denied it was ever sailing for Syria.The chief minister of Gibraltar, Fabian Picardo, said he had been assured in writing by the Iranian government that the tanker would not unload its cargo in Syria."},{"url":null,"title":"man finds 50yearold message in bottle sent from","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

After he trained as an architect and engineer, he was apprenticed to the Derry building firm of George and Robert A. Ferguson. He later set up his own practice in the city and at a young age was responsible for large projects in Omagh, Coleraine and other towns.Amongst the projects he oversaw in his native city were the Corporation waterworks at Creggan and was he was also associated to the layout of Foyle College grounds for building purposes. But amongst Barkers main projects was designing a shirt factory for David Hogg and Charles Mitchell at Sackville Street in Derry. He had also been heavily involved in the project to build the new Presbyterian |Church at Burt, Co Donegal in the mid-s.Constructed in , Hogg  Mitchell’s shirt factory almost immediately won a highly lucrative contract when it became the supplier of shirts for the British Army during the Boer War . The company founded the ‘Old England’ line of shirts which later became the globally known ‘Peter England’ brand. It continued to manufacture shirts in Derry until the s and the façade of Barker’s building still exists today as the building was converted into an apartment block in .Tragedy struck William Barker when in late  he fell off a horse and never recovered consciousness before his death at the young age of  on May , .He left a widow, Maryand three children-Mary Violet Barker, Thomas McCurdy Baker and William Alexander his namesake at his home at Orchard Street in the centre of the city.While William Snr undoubtedly left his professional mark even at such a young age on his native city, it was his son Thomas who lived a truly fascinating le having borne bearing personal witness and suffered as a result of one of the most decisively brutal acts of the Second World War.Thomas McCurdy Barker was born in , was a Presbyterian minister and a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin. He was the first full-time secretary of the Irish Christian Movement, the convenor and organiser of the  conference ‘Ireland’s Hope’, the proceedings of which he edited, and from the s a missionary and professor of New Testament Greek at Mukden in the Chinese province of Manchuria.The Second Sino-Japanese War was fought between the Republic of China and The Empire of Japan between July  and September . China fought Japan with the aid of the Soviet Union and the USA, but after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour in  the conflict became immersed in WWII and a result became the largest conflict in Asia during the twentieth century.The war between China and Japan was the result of a decades long Japanese imperialist policy to expand its influence both politically and militarily in order to secure access to raw materials, food and labour.Internecine warfare in China also provided strong opportunities for Japan who viewed Manchuria as almost limitless supply of raw materials, a market fot its manufactured goods and a protective buffer against the Soviet Union in Siberia.Japan invaded Manchuria in September  after what bacame known as the Mukden Incident. It was an event staged by Japanese military personnel as a pretext for a full invasion.On September , Lieutenant Suemori Kawamoto detonated a small quantity of dynamite close to a rail line owned by Japans South Manchuria Railyway near Mukden. The explosion was so weak that it failed to destroy the track, but it was enough to allow the Imperial Japanese Army to accuse Chinese dissident with causing it and as a result they invaded and occupied Manchuria, establishing a puppet state called Manchukuo after five months of incessant fighting. The Japanese even installed Chinas last Emperor, Puyi as the ruler to try and lend legitimacy to thwe situation.The invasion of the whole of China came six years later in July  when Chinese and Japanese troops exchanged fire in the vicinity of the Marco Polo Bridge-an access route to Bejing. As the conflict became merged into WWII, the Japanese began imprisoning people in concentration camps and amongst these was Rev Thomas McCurdy Barker who was incarcerated for the duration of the war at Nagasaki.On the day of the U.S nuclear strike on August ,  the population of Nagasaki was estimated to be ,. There were , Japanese residents, , Korean residents, , conscripted Korean workers, , Japanese soldiers,  conscripted Chinese workers and  Allied POWs.A Boeing B- Superfortress plane called Bockscar, commanded by Major Charles Sweeney, took off just before dawn carrying a plutonium bomb code named Fat Man.The initial target was the city of Kokura, but it was obscured by cloud and smoke, so the Americans turned their attention to their secondary target-Nagasaki. But, it too was covered by cloud. Running short of fuel, the plane encircled the city several times and it was decided to use radar to drop the device. But, at the last moment the cloud cleared and the bomb was dropped on the citys Urakami Valley-midway between the Mitshubishi Steel and Arms plant in the south and the Mitsubhisi-Urakami Ordnace works in the north.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe plane had arrived over Nagasaki at .am and just under a minute after it was released it exploded at .am at an altitude of approximately , ft.

The attack came three days after the first nuclear bomb had been dropped on Hiroshoma, but the Nagasaki device was more powerful than the first bomb but because the city was surrounded by hilly terrain there was less damage.In , another Irish prisoner who also witnessed the bombing of Nagasaki. This was Dr Aidan MacCarthy, a medic in the RAF from County Cork who wrote: “Then there followed a blue flash, accompanied by a very bright magnesium-type flare which blinded them. Then came a frighteningly loud by rather flat explosion which was followed by a blast of hot air.“Some of this could be felt even by us as it came through the shelter openings, which were very rarely closed owing to poor ventilation.“We all genuinely thought, for some time, that this was the end of the world.”Amongst his fellow prisoners was a community of Catholic nuns to whom in the absence of a priest Rev McCurdy ministered to every day-an act which was later recognised when he received thanks from Pope Pius XII when he learned of the Derry mans actions after the war.Also there was Ann Barker, the Rev Thomas second we, who as a medical doctor also practised her profession during her imprisonment at Nagasaki. Her expertise is credited with helping her husband continue to live a rich le in his later retirement despite the effects that the bomb had on his physique.Lilian McCombe was a school teacher at the Presbyterian station at Mukden where she had lived and worked since .In  she wrote: “That chapter of my le closed with the attack by Japan on Pearl Harbour on December , . From that date, I with some  other colleagues were under Japanese jurisdiction. The greater part of the intervening years were spent in internment camps in the cities of Kobe and Nagasaki.“After a non-stop voyage of around three weeks via the Pacic Ocean, I was welcomed in the USA by my brother James, staying several days with the family there. The old Queen Elizabeth, then a troop ship brought me to Southampton, next day to be greeted by my family and later, by a host of friends!“Following a period of ing health, I was eventually led back into teaching until retirement age was reached.”The horrendous experience of imprisonment and a nuclear attack however did not appear to dissuade Rev Barker from giving up on his mission or other duties in Manchuria. Thomas, also it seems had the ear of the Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, Mao Zedong. And, despite the all encompasing rise of communism in China, he was allowed to continued teaching up until  when the leader of the Peoples Republic of China could no longer guarantee his safety-but Thomas Barker remained in contact with Mao Zedong up until shortly before his death.The cleric was -years-old when he ed to Ireland and was appointed as minister to the Presbyterian Church in Donegal town in  where he remained in service until .In recognition of his missionary service and his undoubted capabilities as a pastor the Church made him Moderator of the Presbyterian Church between - and his alma mater, Trinity College made awarded him an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree.

Further details of these will be made available on trafficwatchni when required.The spokesman continued: ldquoIn order to help ensure the safety of road users and road workers, the public is asked to comply with all temporary traffic restrictions and to drive with care when travelling through, or in the vicinity of, the works. Pedestrian access will be maintained at all times.ldquoThe Department has carefully planned these road works and traffic management arrangements to minimise any inconvenience, however, road users should expect some delays and allow additional time when planning any journeys.The spokesman added: ldquoCompletion of the scheme by November  is dependent on favourable weather conditions.

By working with the Downpatrick Property Trust, we are able to regenerate this building to provide a commercial interest and much needed guest accommodation in the heart of the town.Breenrsquos Corner is the third project to be undertaken by the trust.It previously developed and later sold Maghinis House in Irish Street and also developed Britches Close in English Street as commercial and office accommodation.The trust also invested pound, in the Breenrsquos Corner buildings when they were bought and refurbished as residential accommodation in .The last of the residential tenants vacated the building several months ago and it has remained unoccupied.Current commercial clients which occupy ground-floor shops are not included in the development.The trust, which is chaired by Fergus Kelly, was described treasurer Mal McGrady as ldquoa community developer of the last resort which gets engaged when there is no private interest in developing a building or the cost of renovation would make development prohibitive for any private investor.He said: ldquoWe are excited by the new concept that Stephen Magorrian and Denvirrsquos proposed to us.ldquoThis concept is a win-win both for Denvirrsquos as it gives extra accommodation while bringing back this property into use which is beneficial to the townrsquos tourism offering.Mr McGrady said that the project was important to Downpatrick town centrersquos continued development.ldquoAt present this buildingrsquos external facade is an eyesore, particularly for traffic entering the town centre.ldquoWe will have the facility to provide an extra  beds in the town centre which will help provide accommodation for people on golf tours, bike tours, casual visitors and bus tours who stop at the St Patrickrsquos Centre and Down Museum and we believe that this will help regenerate the town centre, he added.The development, which is designed by JNP Architects and is being carried out by Keelryan Developments Ltd, of Newcastle, intends to provide affordable, contemporary guest accommodation to appeal to tourists and visitors who wish to stay in the town.Mr Magorrian said the Horatio Group would be responsible for the interior fit-out of the rooms and suites which would be leased from DPT and marketed by Denvirrsquos on its website and other hospitality sites such as Air bnb.ldquoI want the guests to be totally surprised when they come into the accommodation as it will be totally dferent to the exterior, he remarked.ldquoGuests can either walk the few metres around the corner to breakfast at the inn or enjoy a breakfast hamper provided by Denvirrsquos made up with items from local suppliers..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/10280778.jpg","title":"bandstand john garrity","story":"How long have you been performing Where do you perform What is your favourite song to play and why What has been your biggest gig to date Who are your major influences Do you write your own songs  What inspires your songwriting What would be your dream gig Best moment as a musician so far What is the most unusual venue you have played What is your lsquogo-torsquo encore song Whats the best thing about performing Do you always perform solo or do you also play with a band How would you describe your sound Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He told how the troops were initially welcomed in Catholic areas with cups of tea. How the mood changed and soldiers, who numbered , at their peak, tried to constrain terrorists and sap their will.Sir Robert was speaking at a major commemoration to mark the half centenary of deployment, alongside ex servicemen and politicians including DUP leader Arlene Foster.The problem though is that only the converted seem to be listening. No matter how patiently the merits of the army during that time are cited, no matter how many times the statistics of the dead are underlined, no matter how easily the lie of widespread collusion is disproved by the small number of IRA deaths, a hostile narrative on the role of the UK advances..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Not only that, but the whole process of legacy seems to be panning out the way that so many human rights and academics and political pressure groups want it to pan out: of a baseline in which state forces and terrorist are seen as having equal culpability and equal amounts to answer.Meanwhile the security forces are being judged to a sub criminal standard in which the lower burden of proofmakes it much easier for hunches to find their way into formal findings. This is an outrage. While Saturday’s ceremony was appropriate and uplting, such occasions are separate to the major legal and political battle that will be necessary to counter the lies and distortions of terrorists and their apologists.As an elementary first step, the British government must make clear to the IRA that its relentless lawfare in legal actions will not only be resisted but matched in funding to help terrorist victims get redress in the civil courts.Wallace Thompson: Our parades are above all Protestant parades and we must stay dignied and be true to Protestant principles Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingThese are all the mobile speed camera locations in Northern IrelandPolice urged to act over lsquoIRA imageryrsquo at paradeBody found in Nora Quoirin searchAppeal for dashcam footage after four arrested on suspicion of attempted murder outside NI barUpdated: Major NI road closed in both directions following RTC -

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We learn about the Romans, World War Two, the American Civil War at school, but most people have never been taught about the history of their own country.ldquoWe have more castles than any other country in the world per square mile, and thatrsquos something worth celebrating.Fonmon Castle is a rarity among Welsh castles, uniquely well-suited to creating interactive events like jousting, workshops, Renaissance and Steampunk fairs, and many more.ldquoFonmon Castle is one of the few Welsh castles that is still lived in, explained Mr OrsquoHenessey. ldquoIt has remained within two families since it was built by the Marcher Lords during the Norman invasion.ldquoIt recently it was sold to a very friendly couple and they headhunted me in order to help them turn the castle around, to open it up to the public and help teach people more about Welsh history.ldquoTheyrsquove basically provided me a blank cheque.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When it’s  degrees outside, in a car it can reach an unbearable  degrees within the hour.“We are delighted to be working with Local Authorities to raise awareness of the dangers of this and to try and prevent the heartbreak and distress caused when a much-loved family pet suffers, or dies, because they have been left in a car on a summer’s day.”Dogs Trust advise thatyou see a dog in distress in a hot car, call your local Animal Welfare Officer who will liaise with the PSNI to organise the rescue of the dog. This will help ensure the dogs can be removed from the car as quickly as possible, in a safe and legal manner.Signs of heat stroke in dogs include heavy panting, excessive drooling, vomiting, being drowsy and uncoordinated and collapsing. Dogs Trust advise that to help a dog in this condition, place them in the shade, pour small amounts of tepid, not cold, water onto their body, help them to drink small amounts of tepid water and once their breathing has settled, call the nearest vet.You can find out more about caring for dogs in the hot weather on the Dogs Trust website at https:www.dogstrust.org.uk news-events issues-campaigns

Editor John Mulgrew looks at the numbers, the analysis and the once household names no longer with us The tattered corner of the Ulster Business Top  list from  probably isn’t the worst way to analogise the then state of the Northern Ireland economy, and a precursor to what was around the cornerWe’ve come a very long way in a decade, and while there are some big and familiar names on the  Top  list, there are firms which have fallen off it entirely, and resigned to the history books post-recession.In former editor David Elliott’s intro to the magazine, it references the fact that most of the accounting periods in the list were just as the downturn was starting to gather pace.Economist John Simpson, writing in the edition, says the “big recession of  and  did not impact evenly across the economy, and recovery will be best seen as a sequence of dferent proportions”.There are some positive things to take from it – including a large glowing image of Victoria Square, which in the more than  years since it opened in the heart of Belfast has become part of the retail fabric of the city.Topping the list at the time was Viridian Group, which owned Northern Ireland Electricity and now includes Power NI as a subsidiary, with turnover of £.bn. However, it made a loss of £m during that period.Second on the list is a business familiar to many. Quinn Group, headed by Co Fermanagh businessman Sean Quinn, posted turnover of £.bn for the year ending    but incurred a loss of more than £m during the same period. There have been enough column inches written about the business in the years since then to fill many a book – and they have.Among those no longer on the list is developer David Patton  SonsLtd, Armaghdown Creameries Ltd and Ballyrogan Holdings.Many others on the list have since been acquired by some of the now giants in their respective industries.Moy Park is an interesting one. Back then it was still a large player in the poultry sector with turnover of £m.Those fortunes have evidently changed dramatically since then, as the company has held the top spot on the list for the last eight years, and now posts big profits and turnover of £.bn.Meanwhile, WR Barnett is on the  list in position , with a turnover of £m and pre-tax profits of £m. In the last  years, it has climbed the list to comfortably take the number two spot with sales of almost  times that of those a decade earlier.As far as employment goes, it was Tesco topping the list in , followed by Bombardier – which at the time had a workforce of around , people – with Royal Mail and Queen’s University following in third and fourth position.A lot has happened in the years since that list. The economy has slowly but surely gotten back on its feet. Growth has been gradual, and in the last year or so has been sitting at around %, while employment levels and unemployment levels are at their respective positive record levels. However, we are amid the most challenging time for business in a generation and some of the signs, and whispered conversations, are far from positive. As I write this, we still sit on the precipice of whether we secure an agreement on Brexit, or shuffle off the edge without a parachute.
