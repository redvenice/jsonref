We used to be able to walk along the footpath where there was just a chain link fence so you could see the lake the laurel trees in their garden.\u0027Now there\u0027s that 7ft high fence blocking our view of the garden, which is outside their boundary and is not at all in keeping with the local area. It\u0027s offensive.\u0027In a letter to the local council, neighbour Laura Lauro wrote: \u0027I strongly object to the fence it is much too high, it has been erected without permission, without consulting the people living in the area very obstructively on the footpath, narrowing it considerably and with no consideration for the historic value of the footpath and completely ignoring the gloomy effect it has on it.\u0027Another resident, Julia Russell, added: \u0027The new fence has blighted the landscape. Most importantly, it narrows and darkens the footpath to such an extent that children and dogs are at risk from cyclists suddenly appearing from around the bend.\u0027In another letter of objection, neighbours known only as Mr and Mrs Aubury wrote: \u0027Whilst we fully understand the applicant\u0027s desire for privacy, the fence as it stands negatively affects the view from our property.              The row centres on a 130ft-long wooden fence (pictured) erected next to a footpath that runs along the side of Burton\u0027s home which ramblers say narrows the path and blocks out light         The wooden fence, erected in September, next to the Thames (pictured) has replaced a chain link fence to keep out prying eyes of walkers using the path and looking into the garden          The new fence at the property was put up without planning permission which was sought retrospectively two months later and now been granted despite protests by the local council         The grand property (pictured) was once owned by Bonham-Carter\u0027s ancestor Asquith, the prime minister who took Britain into the First World War, where he lived until his death in 1932 \u0027This fence materially affects the character and appearance of this part of the conservation area. The fence has replaced a previously green meshed wire fence which blended with its surroundings and effectively demarcated the boundary.\u0027While another neighbour added: \u0027I used to be able to walk along the path with my friend side-by-side but now one of us has to walk behind the other.\u0027The path narrows as it bends round and you can find yourself quite close to the banks of the river.\u0027The fence was put up last year to protect the owner\u0027s privacy and prevent walkers using the footpath that runs alongside the house from looking into the garden.It was put up without planning permission which was sought retrospectively two months later.And despite complaints from ramblers and neighbours to the property planning permission has now been granted.They also conceded that although the new fence had been built in front of the old one and reduced the width of the footpath, there was no legally-recorded width for the path.Case officer Kerry Street said in her report: \u0027Given the distance of the fence to the nearest properties, and the river that separates them, there will be no detrimental harm to these properties through either loss of light, overlooking or over-shadowing.         Bonham Carter 54, and Burton were together for 13 years before they split. The actress is now dating toy boy Rye Dag Holmboe who is 32, pictured looking loved up in London\u0027s Primrose Hill\u0027Given the relatively small change in the position of the fence compared with the previous fence, and relative to the width of the path itself, officers do not consider that safety has been compromised.\u0027Edward Scissorhands filmmaker Burton, 60, bought the Grade II listed home five years after meeting actress Bonham-Carter, with whom he has two children.It was on the lawns of the property that her ancestor Asquith, the prime minister who took Britain into the First World War, entertained Winston Churchill, Lloyd George and the Aga Khan.And it was on the backwater of the Thames, that Asquith, known as \u0027The Sledgehammer\u0027, found escape from weighty pre-war politics, and where he mourned the death on the Somme of his son, Raymond.Asquith, prime minister from 1908 to 1916 and the leader of the last Liberal government, bought the 18th century Mill House along with neighbouring Wharf Mill, where he lived, in 1912.Asquith so loved the area - his biographer Roy Jenkins said it played a \u0027great part\u0027 in his life - that he chose to die there, and asked to be buried in the churchyard rather than Westminster Abbey.His widow sold the property in 1932. Its owner for 30 years before being sold to Burton, Jane Stevens, served as lady-in-waiting to the late Princess Margaret, who was also a close friend.More recently Johnny Depp is believed to have sought solace there with his friends Bonham-Carter and Burton following the bitter fallout from his orce from Amber Heard.Bonham-Carter and Burton split in 2014 after 13 years together. But they remain friends and both spend time at their country home with their children Billy, 15, and Nell, 11.During their time together the couple famously lived in London next door to each other in leafy Belsize Park, North London, saying that their relationship was \u0027enhanced by knowing we have our personal space to retreat to\u0027.Burton\u0027s representatives declined to comment when approached by Mail Online.A housekeeper said by neighbours to live at the period property said, \u0027no thank you\u0027 when approached by Mail Online for a comment.Diane Hamshere, who is named on the planning application, also declined to comment when approached by Mail Online. "},{"url":null,"title":"Germany calls escalation explosive Iran U S tension","story":"Share this article Washington tightened sanctions from the start of May, ordering all countries and companies to halt all imports of Iranian oil or be banished from the global financial system. It has also dispatched extra troops to the region to counter what it describes as Iranian threats.Iran has responded with a threat to increase its enrichment of uranium, though said last month it was still complying with the deal. On Monday, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas became the most senior Western official to visit Iran since the new war of words erupted last month between Washington and Tehran.\u0027The situation in the region here is highly explosive and extremely serious,\u0027 Maas told a news conference alongside Iran\u0027s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif. \u0027A dangerous escalation of existing tensions can also lead to a military escalation.\u0027         Tehran has set a July 7 deadline for European powers to guarantee economic benefits it was promised as part of the nuclear pact before America withdrew, or else it will stop complying (pictured, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas meets with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani)In his meeting with Maas, President Hassan Rouhani blamed the United States for the soaring tension and called on the European signatories of the deal to \u0027resist the economic war on Iran imposed by America\u0027.\u0027This war ... will never be beneficial for any country and the Iranian people will resist these pressures and bullying behaviours,\u0027 Iran\u0027s state TV quoted Rouhani as saying.Zarif said Iran would cooperate with the European Union to save the deal. \u0027Reducing tension is only possible through stopping the economic war by America,\u0027 he said. \u0027Those who wage such wars cannot expect to remain safe.\u0027Maas called on Iran to avoid an escalation and stick to its commitments from the nuclear deal. Otherwise, Tehran would risk further isolation on the international stage and more instability in the region, Maas warned in an interview with ZDF television, broadcast shortly after his return to Berlin on Monday evening.Amano said he was worried about increasing tensions over the nuclear issue. He added he hoped \u0027that ways can be found to reduce the current tensions through dialogue. It is essential that Iran fully implements its nuclear-related commitments\u0027 under the deal.In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said the IAEA findings showed \u0027that Iran is going in the wrong direction and it underscores the continuing challenge Iran poses to international peace and security.\u0027Washington\u0027s European allies opposed its decision last year to abandon the nuclear deal, reached in 2015 between Iran and the United States, Germany, France, Britain, Russia and China. They have promised to help Iran find other ways to trade, although with no success so far. All major European companies that had announced plans to invest in Iran have since called them off for fear of U.S. punishment.Iran says the Europeans have not done enough to provide it with alternative ways to trade.         The Iran nuclear deal was designed to prevent Tehran getting enough highly enriched uranium to make a nuclear bomb, while still pursuing its goal of nuclear energy (file image)\u0027We have not seen any serious measures taken by the Europeans in the past year despite their fairly good political stance,\u0027 Rouhani said.Maas said there were limits to how much help the European countries could provide.\u0027We want to fulfil our obligations,\u0027 Maas said during his news conference with Zarif. \u0027We cannot work miracles, but we will try to avert a failure\u0027 of the nuclear deal.France, Britain and Germany have set up a special-purpose vehicle called Instex, designed to allow payments to Iran that would legally bypass sanctions. It has yet to be launched.It is a new instrument and not straightforward to put into effect, Maas told reporters, adding: \u0027But all the formal requirements are in place now, and so I\u0027m assuming we\u0027ll be ready to use it in the foreseeable future.\u0027Washington has denounced the European plans. Diplomats say the system is unlikely to have much impact on commercial business with Iran but could be used for humanitarian transactions that are permitted under U.S. sanctions.The State Department\u0027s Ortagus said the United States would not support any payment mechanism that allowed countries or businesses to conduct transactions with sanctioned Iranian entities.Washington says the nuclear deal should be expanded to cover other issues including Iran\u0027s missile programme and its role in wars in the region. European countries argue that while they share those concerns, it would be harder to address them without the nuclear deal in place.Iran has ruled out any negotiation over its ballistic missile programme and its activities in the Middle East, where Tehran has been involved in proxy wars with Saudi Arabia for decades.

The call for an end to the misuse of non-disclosure agreements – deals in which workers who complain are paid off in return for agreeing to stay quiet – was made by the Commons’ women and equalities select committee yesterdayThree Appeal judges ruled that any publication of his name and the nature of the complaints should be suppressed as to do so would break NDAs which the staff had signed. They had told their stories to the Daily Telegraph. But shortly afterwards, former Labour Cabinet minister Lord Hain named him in the Lords under protection of Parliamentary privilege.In February, a judge disclosed Sir Philip had spent more than £1million paying lawyers in the case and faced costs of £3million. And over recent months, he has been facing fresh problems. Last week, he hired a top US lawyer to fight claims he ked pilates instructor Katie Surridge up to ten times at the Canyon Ranch retreat in Tucson, Arizona, in 2016.

When they arrived at the Rosen Inn International in Orlando they were told that their rooms were not booked out for them for another two days.The family feared the worst, but the hotel allowed them to stay overnight if they paid £100 each per family for a room - which they were hoping to redeem if they could sort the situation out with the holiday reps before 10am the next day. Mr Williams said: \u0027We just want some answers. It was disgusting. My wife, my children, my mother-in-law - all they did was cry. It was horrible. That night at reception, not knowing if we had a room, the kids were really scared. They were also knackered.\u0027 The family complained about the rooms which they said were covered in dust, with blood on the bedsheets.           As well as having to share beds, the family found blood stains on the sheets (pictured above) For the Williams family, and the others, the situation was far from ideal.There were just two three-quarter sized beds in the shared room. This meant their 12-year-old daughter Alise, Ruby, seven, and Oliver, five, had to share one bed.What exacerbated matters was that the original hotel the families had been booked into, which was changed before the holiday because of potential noise issues, was a self-catering suite, but the hotel rooms the families were staying in had minimal facilities, which meant they had to eat out more often.         The family complained about the state of their hotel room, and said there was dust on the floor (above) Mr Williams said he thought that added another £1,500 to the cost of his immediate family\u0027s holiday.He said the first couple of days were spent trying to sort out the issue with the holiday reps, who were very helpful at the resort. But that meant they missed out on the first days of their two-week pass to the Disney attraction.Eventually the family was given a temporary bed for the room. The representatives also provided the families with vouchers for activities, but they found out those were generally available elsewhere anyway.An attempt to be moved to another hotel failed, as they were told all the similar hotels were booked up.But the final straw was when the families were coming to the end of their holidays and found out they should have had vouchers to cover their breakfast, but these hadn\u0027t been provided and they had paid for their breakfasts. A Thomas Cook spokeswoman said: \u0027We\u0027re very sorry for the inconvenience caused to... all the family at the beginning of their trip to Florida. We recognise we made a mistake with the hotel booking and we\u0027re investigating the issues raised. In resort, we did everything we could to try and put things right, including offering meal vouchers. We have contacted Mrs Hibbs and we hope to be able to resolve this.\u0027After the initial mix-up with the accommodation Thomas Cook said no further complaint was made in resort.

And Cook\u0027s diminutive comedy partner, Dudley Moore.The pair would pace round the garden writing sketches, trying out jokes and, increasingly, rubbing each other up the wrong way as Moore sought Hollywood success while Cook embraced a quiet life with triple vodka and orange for breakfast.It was at a Perrin\u0027s Walk party that a dripping wet Cook greeted his guests by explaining he had just jumped into the koi carp pond after setting his trousers on fire while lighting candles.         Perrins Walk is a charming private mews and is perfectly located for the Hampstead Village lifestyle, according to a recent listing         Dudley Moore and Peter Cook standing in the backyard of the famous party house Cook\u0027s daughters Daisy and Lucy, from his first wife Wendy, occasionally lent a hand. \u0027I remember asking Keith Richards what he\u0027d like to drink. \u0027Whisky!\u0027 he commanded,\u0027 Daisy said. \u0027As I returned with a glass, he looked at me blankly and said: \u0027I meant a bottle.\u0027When an admiring Ronnie Wood asked his host who the waitress was, Cook sharply responded: \u0027That\u0027s my daughter — hands off!\u0027Cook himself welcomed a steady stream of women. Indeed, it was here, hidden in a suitcase upstairs in the master bedroom, that second wife Judy Huxtable spied on her husband, trying to catch him in flagrante.If she\u0027d been pushed to the edge, it was no surprise. For Cook had a voracious appetite for women and was not the sort to let a little detail like wives — three of them, to be precise — get in the way of a bit of extracurricular fun.         Peter Cook and his wife Judy Huxtable. Cooked lived in the party house from 1974 until his death from a gastrointestinal haemorrhage in 1995, aged 57         Everyone who was anyone seems to have partied at Perrin\u0027s Walk — the Pythons Stephen Fry, David Gower, Dave Stewart, the Rolling Stones. And Cook\u0027s diminutive comedy partner, Dudley Moore (pictured together)Over the years, he bedded a vast array of beauties including President J.F. Kennedy\u0027s wife, Jackie, and her sister, Lee Radziwill.When famous women such as Germaine Greer visited, he would flirt furiously. He also whisked Hollywood actress Raquel Welch and Bond Girl Ursula Andress out for the evening, leaving poor old Judy shell-shocked, at home.Peter Cook, the son of an economics adviser to the government, was brilliant, funny and original.He was at Cambridge at the same time as future Tory grandees Michael Howard, Leon Brittan and Kenneth Clarke and knew them all vaguely.\u0027They were all so self-important at 20, that you\u0027d have thought they\u0027d have grown out of it. But no . . .\u0027 he said.

For two decades, everything they did shone. Their sketch revue, Beyond The Fringe, with Alan Bennett and Jonathan Miller, was a hit on both sides of the Atlantic. Cook and Moore then cemented their partnership with the BBC TV series Not Only . . . But Also.They were superstars who slept with endless women and, in Cook\u0027s case, drank far too much.They finally went their separate ways after a world tour in 1974. Moore was drawn to the Hollywood lights, while Cook headed back to Hampstead where two years\u0027 mail awaited. He refused to open any of it.In fact, he never opened any mail ever again. Instead, he focused on a life of shambolic indolence punctuated by lavish parties. With the royalties pouring in from 20 years of performances, he didn\u0027t need to work — and that was fine by him. He was, he once said, \u0027born to be on holiday\u0027.

But he quickly started a relationship with Lin Chong, who worked as a secretary for Lownes and lived just 200 yards from Cook. She took one look at the state of his house and decided they should be a \u0027two-home\u0027 couple. In turn, he promised to limit his lovers to his two favourite girlfriends. Somehow they made it work.Cook adored his home and spent a lot of time in his sitting room, reading every newspaper, chatting with his neighbour, George Weiss, who recorded hundred of hours of their meandering conversations.At night, he\u0027d call radio stations, putting on different personas. For two years, for example, he managed to fool thousands of listeners by calling a phone-in show pretending to be a Norwegian fisherman called Sven who was pining for his fish.But there were terrible lows. In 1986 he was given a car for his birthday and promptly crashed it into a police car while over the limit. The following year, he ended up in a newspaper kiss-and-tell story by a former girlfriend, alleging group sex at Weiss\u0027s house.          Keith Richards, Peter Cook (1937 - 1995), Ronnie Wood, Dudley Moore (1935 - 2002), and Dave Stewart at the release party for the uncut version of \u0027Derek and Clive Get the Horn\u0027Meanwhile, his daily drinking escalated to three bottles of wine, a bottle of vodka and numerous glasses of strong lager a day.No one seemed to mind, because the drunker he got, the funnier he became. Of course, his health suffered.Many people said he\u0027d failed to fulfil his potential. But he didn\u0027t care. For Cook was utterly uninterested in projecting the \u0027right\u0027 image, claiming that he lost all ambition by the age of 24.\u0027I might have some regrets but I can\u0027t remember what they are,\u0027 he famously commented.After he died, Lin finally moved into Perrin\u0027s Walk — and couldn\u0027t bear to change a thing.

The young talent featured includes photographer Rhea Storr, whose work looks at mixed-race identity growing up in Yorkshire Scots band Young Fathers fashion designers Martine Rose and Grace Wales Bonner and Jenn Nkiru, who worked on Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s Ape Shit video. It all begins with Zak’s father, Horace Ové, who was the first black British person to direct a feature film, 1975’s Pressure, about a black British teenager and the racism he experiences. Zak hopes this exhibition – which includes some work never seen by the public before – will provide a reassessment of his father’s legacy. “I’m really excited that the public will be able to see my father’s work again or perhaps discover it,” he says. “He was such a pioneer of his time.”The fact that Ové is not more widely known is symptomatic of the endemic lack of ersity in the arts, something that may now be changing. This exhibition follows Tate Modern’s Soul of a Nation last year, about art in the United States’s “black power” era, and Wales Bonner’s A Time for New Dreams showcase at the Serpentine Sackler gallery in January, which featured the work of black creatives including Liz Johnson Artur and Ben Okri. Forrester, who began making art in the mid-1970s, acknowledges that there has been a shift from his experience as a young artist. “When I was a student at Central Art School and the Royal College of Art, there were no black students in my year, and few black artists in the college as a whole,” he says. “There was also no evidence of black artists in commercial galleries. This is beginning to change.”Music has been a world where black British artists have had more freedom. Producer Bovell is contributing pieces he has collected over a 45-year career, working with the Slits, Janet Kay and poet Linton Kwesi Johnson. He says that working on the exhibition made him reassess his achievements. “It made me think about how important my work is and what a journey I have had,” he says, “and it made me think that everything I have done is good.” Bovell was born in Barbados in 1953 when it was still a British colony, but settled in London, making music from the late 60s. “The expression of black Britishness is seen in many walks of life,” he says. “I am one of the statistics that made something of the last 40 years.” Bovell is curious about the next generation in his lineage. “There are some exciting youngsters coming through,” he says. “I can only been proud to think that I’m maybe one of the giants upon whose shoulders they stand.”With so many contributors, there is space for myriad expressions of black Britishness. Ajamu provides a different point of view. The photographer is best known for his Fierce series, portraits of “young LGBT people from second-generation black British backgrounds, and those born and raised in the Caribbean and Africa”. He says: “Black British identity is multidimensional. It’s not just about the usual suspects: race, sexuality and gender. It’s place, class and much more besides. I was born and raised in Huddersfield that would be a very different experience from Halifax, Leeds or Dewsbury.”Ajamu has shown his Fierce images in London’s 800-year-old Guildhall. “It is an amazing space, with pre-Raphaelite paintings everywhere, very British,” he says. “This puts young black and brown people, not generally seen as part of that conversation, in the dialogue.” Arguably, this exhibition’s Somerset House venue, another rarified address, has a similar resonance. “This exhibition reflects unadulterated black pride,” says Ové, “with the freedom to fill in all the blanks, where we didn’t exist before.”Get Up, Stand Up Now is at Somerset House, WC2, Wednesday 12 June to 15 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/629be7c70003799910ca71e18fd9acaac78c1de4/0_217_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe15eeb67563e21f22ee14bf0ac8fc44","title":"words from the wall adam thorpe review","story":"Adam Thorpe is a longsighted poet, at home with the ancient and the modern, and with an extraordinary field of vision. In this first-class collection – which repays rereading – he turns a searchlight back to the ice age (in Bolzano, Italy) and to ancient Rome (where he walks in the shoes of Suetonius) and looks back, too, at the English language. In Lingua Franca, he relishes Anglo-Saxon roots – language as a vehicle for history: “The frost and fog of Danelaw, its oafs and their knives  staggered from the Saxon hog snuffling in its barn,  dung-daggled, furrowing through acorns  in the winter wood. And ice, yonder.” He reminds us that contemporary speech is made up of souvenirs: “Every time we open our mouths  it rushes out in a skein of colour:  entwined ghosts.” He describes himself as a ‘blithe scrivener” but must intend this ironically, for his poems are undeceived and sometimes bleak, even though pepped up by his wry wit.If the English language is blighted as “slaughterers pound up the sand”, the English countryside is being similarly blasted, its meadows “silenced of their quivering lyra,  the tiny throats bunged with whiffs  of cancer and formaldehyde.” Nature is victim to a “chemical sacerdotage”. (sacerdotage is, I guess, his coinage – the “dotage” appropriate in context).…I would like a hutof bamboo with nothing insidesave a hearth, some hens, the breezeblowing through. Thatwould be enough. A cooking pot.And the only stuff on the shelvesa heap of corn cobs,drying in the smoke.Equally sympathetic is Unperson, about meeting a retired (and, naturally, nameless) Radio 3 announcer who has been sacked. It is a charming portrait of a fellow with the “build of a stork” met on a walk – an “organised hike”. Thorpe strides lightly through the poem, describing his memories of listening to Radio 3, in supportive homage to his walking companion:The long, serious silence of Cage.I tell him how I miss his voice, evenafter all these years: lying in bedor cross-ankled in front of the grate,struggling with an essay or a poem.Spreading toast. Doing nothing. Lifein England, before everything wentfor hire or askew.Toast may get a brief mention but it is ice that is Thorpe’s favoured element and that makes multiple appearances in this collection. But how long can anything be put on ice – including poetry itself? He considers mortality in outlandish forms: a cat’s undisturbed skeleton in a London church (Unburied), the uncanny remains of an ice man (Fit for Purpose), the abandoned corpse of a whale in Iceland (Beached). And there is a moving poem (Hoping) about his mother’s last days, in which he casts her as Hamm and Clov from Beckett’s Endgame. It is a poem that demonstrates how much can be achieved by not overdoing it: the nailfile does so much of the work.Sometimes Thorpe’s vocabulary can detain you (he is to language what a botanist is to flowers). Reading The Alarm, I had to look up gryke (fissure between blocks of limestone), vambrace (piece of armour for the forearm) and plackart (I’m still not sure what it means). It is encouragingly clear that language will not dwindle on Adam Thorpe’s watch. But what will survive of us – if his poems are to be believed – is nothing as consoling as love.• Words from the Wall by Adam Thorpe is published by Jonathan Cape (£10).

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Good news from JayZed, who has been rereading Ghost Wall by Sarah Moss:I thought I should check and see whether it really is as brilliant as I thought it was on first reading. Reader, it is. As is so often the way with rereading, I found it even more impactful second time around, and felt really quite shaken and upset as the story reached its climax.Don DeLillo’s story collection, The Angel Esmeralda has made HaveOneOnMe3 feel almost as intoxicated as a would-be Prime Minister:Nothing surprising here for those who love Uncle Don’s work, but it’s extraordinary. Every single line of his prose is like a crystal, in terms of its beauty, purity, and design perfection. Reading him almost literally makes you high, his sentences are that brilliant.Little Boy by Lawrence Ferlinghetti has swept up Eamonn Barrett:A lovely flow of consciousness from the grand old man of American poetry. It takes a little getting used to but once you surrender to it, it sweeps the reader along. Such a nice respite from the current news, that’s for sure!“What a great read,” says MsCarey, after finishing Gull by Glenn Patterson:It’s the eye-popping story of how John DeLorean (acclaimed American car engineer, experienced corporate manager, charismatic showman and hustler-in-waiting) realises his dream of making a stylish, affordable (it was to retail at $12,000) sports car for the American market.Patterson does a remarkable job of taking the mass of raw material and shaping it into a proper novel. Real life characters mix with invented characters so well that you can’t see the join… There is also no grand tone. It’s not polemical, farcical or, thank the lord, earnestly outraged. Having shaped his narrative, Patterson lets the story speak for itself and it is the reader who will feel outrage, disbelief, hilarity as she works through the novel.Children of Ruins by Adrian Tchaikovsky has pleased SackTheJuggler:The book (so far) has a similar structure as the earlier one, with separate storylines which will presumably unite at the end. In one thread, human engineers discover that the planet they have been sent to terraform is already teeming with life. In the other, a joint human-spider expedition encounters strange aliens. There’s a lot of good stuff about how the humans and spiders attempt to communicate more effectively with one another, and the difficulties of communicating at all with entirely alien species. Enjoyable “sense of wonder” SF.I know that the title is enough to put some off, but I’d highly recommend it not just as a microcosm of Soviet society, but as a wise and perceptive encapsulation of the contemporary human condition, warts and all. The protagonist, Kostoglotov, remains a hero of mine. The bravery of standing up for decency when surrounded by chicanery, deceit and toadyism strikes a particular chord in these dystopian times.“I am slowly working my way through 1491 New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus by Charles C Mann,” says BeachBumble:It’s an extremely well researched book yet written in an easily understood style. It covers all of the Americas, north, central and south, and paints a startling picture of complex highly populated nations with cities, cultures and histories at least as sophisticated as those in the old world, and their remarkable impact on their environments. Be prepared to have all your assumptions about native Indian life completely turned upside down!Finally, following last week’s discussion of Jack Kerouac and On The Road, Vicc recommends Off The Road by Carolyn Cassady, about her life with Neal Cassady, Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg:It is a fascinating book. Her writing is witty and honest. There are points where you want to shout “just leave him” but when we’re young we don’t usually have that perspective. When I read On the Road, Cassady struck me as someone who’d annoy the hell out of me. Reading his wife’s account of life with him, I still think so.I can dig that.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

Cities and the Waseda Chronicle investigate these ‘homes for solitary death’by Makoto Watanabe, Kazuhiro Tsuji, Robert Hongo and Hideaki Kimura. All photographs by Taishi SakamotoKazuyoshi Otsuka didn’t talk to his neighbours much. They knew he worked for the Shochiku movie studio, where the directors Akira Kurosawa and Yasujiro Ozu achieved global renown. They knew he was a costumer, because he used to complain to them about having to argue with famous Japanese actresses over whether their outfits clashed.They also knew he moved into the Atago apartment blocks, a huge housing complex in the suburbs of Tokyo, in 1971, the year after they were built, with his wife and two sons. The Japanese economy was officially booming, and Otsuka was a fashionable man about town, partial to wearing a neck scarf and buying his coffee beans from a specialty store, even if he otherwise kept to himself.In 1989, he was struck by a subarachnoid haemorrhage that left him paralysed in his left hand and leg. Some time after he was discharged from hospital and returned home, his wife and children left. Alone, he took to sitting on a bench outside the apartment building. Though he didn’t much discuss it with the neighbours, he once admitted he regretted how life had turned out. “I’m sorry,” he said.Unable to walk far, Otsuka relied on a meal service. One day, two years ago, his regular delivery man recalls Otsuka being in worse shape than usual. Three days later, there was no answer at the door.The delivery man informed the police, who arrived at Atago with the fire department, climbed a ladder to the third floor and broke through the window into the room. Otsuka had been spitting blood, and died alone.No family members came, and nobody claimed his body. The municipality cremated him and placed his remains with a local temple. Otsuka’s nameplate is still on the metal door of his apartment, above a mailbox slot now sealed with tape.Toei Atago Complex is a sprawling set of five-storey apartment blocks in Tama City in the Tokyo suburbs, about 30 minutes on the express Keio line from Shinjuku station. The complex rings a hillside and and contains 1,894 units across five blocks – one of hundreds of similar social housing developments that dot the seemingly endless Tokyo outskirts.Many Japanese know the Atago complex as the setting for Whisper of the Heart, an animated film from Studio Ghibli written by the legendary Hayao Miyazaki that topped the domestic box office in 1995. The romantic film depicts the lives of junior high school students whose imaginations are transported through writing stories to each other.As Japan\u0027s capital enters a year in the spotlight, from the Rugby World up to the 2020 Olympics,  Cities is spending a week reporting live from the largest megacity on Earth. Despite being the world\u0027s riskiest place – with 37 million people vulnerable to tsunami, flooding and due a potentially catastrophic earthquake – it is also one of the most resilient, both in its hi-tech design and its pragmatic social structure. Using manga, photography, film and a group of salarimen rappers, we\u0027ll hear from the locals how they feel about their famously impenetrable city finally embracing its global crownThe number who live in social housing, meanwhile, is higher still by far: approximately two-thirds of the residents of blocks like Atago are over 65. Tokyo’s social housing blocks are becoming de facto retirement homes.That is a problem for a number of reasons, not least that they weren’t designed for this purpose. The Atago complex was built on a hill, and is accessed by sloping ramps. It has five floors, but there are no lifts, only stairs. Many weaker residents find navigating this terrain very difficult. There are no shops to buy food and newspapers, and no hospital clinics or pharmacies within easy access.Nor are there enough children, teenagers or young couples to keep the atmosphere lively and to drive demand for services and commerce. The last supermarket serving Atago closed in 2001. The nearby elementary school, Tama City Nishi Atago, which opened in 1976 and hit peak attendance of 714 children in 1982, saw its intake fall to 64 students before it finally closed its doors for good in March 2016.Toshio Matsumoto, 70, an officer of the Atago housing committee, says it isn’t just death that dampens the mood at Atago: “The people who come after the deceased are also grey, and the elderly will not be rosy in the future unless they get young people into the complex.”“The only thing I enjoy every day is to drink and smoke,” one 73-year-old man says. He worked in a fresh fish store when he was young, and has lived alone in Atago since he lost his mother 18 years ago. “My feet are lame and I have a cane. Three years from now, I’ll be dead.” He turns and walks away, slowly climbing with his cane up the inclined path towards the buildings.“I guess I’m not alone after all,” jokes Kaichiro Tanaka, 73, who also lives by himself at Atago. He drops by the community centre, Atago Kaede Kan, every day to chat and smoke cigarettes. Once a week he and his friends gather to sing their favourite songs at karaoke.He makes the best of what is a difficult life: Tanaka relies on his pension, which specifies less than 1,000 yen per day for food. “You can’t live like that,” he says. In 2007, his wife’s kidneys began to fail her, and for three years he tended to her bodily needs while she was confined to bed. After her death, the only relative he now sees is his daughter, who meets him once a year at his wife’s grave. She has never visited his apartment at Atago.“Hey, look over there,” Tanaka says, gesturing with his eyes at the lounge in the community centre. “If you think, ‘Hmm, that person hasn’t been here lately,’ it’s commonly the case that they’re dead.” Last summer, when passing the apartment of one of his neighbours on the same floor, he noticed a strange smell. He reported it to the police, who confirmed that the woman had died in bed. Tanaka can’t remember her name. He only knew she was about 80.In the mid-1990s, however, a shift in housing policy had major and perhaps unintended consequences. In an attempt to stimulate the housing market, the government tried to guide the young generation of workers away from public housing and into private housing. It revised the Public Housing Act, making public housing more accessible for elderly or disabled people, and setting strict requirements for younger people who lived there: if your income exceeded a certain threshold, you would be evicted. If you refused, you were charged rent – at twice the market rate.And it has turned public housing into a kind of ghetto for poor and elderly people who rely on pensions and can’t afford private rents.It also forces young adults to leave home once they get a job. A four-person family cannot stay in public housing if they earn more than 4.47m yen (about £32,000), which means that even a part-time job sometimes means moving away from home. The parents stay behind, and the demographics tick another notch older.Yet another unintended consequence is that Tokyo’s social housing blocks have become the focal point for a phenomenon that has obsessed the national media: kodokushi, or “solitary deaths”. About 20 people died alone at Atago in 2018.While the Tokyo government does not disclose information on inidual cases of solitary death, figures show that 501 people died alone in public housing blocks like Atago last year – more than one a day – and 2,344 over the last five years.“Solitary deaths are increasing,” confirms Matsumoto. He says the problem started to worsen about 12 years ago. It is almost common now, he says, and residents who live alone are haunted by it.The Atago community association has taken steps to fight back against loneliness. Its Omushibi Project invites residents to make rice balls together, and every summer there is a dance for the Bon festival.The Tama municipality, too, is helping. It signed an agreement with 29 local delivery companies that provide services to Atago – such as newspapers or bento lunch boxes – to watch over elderly people. The companies agree to notify the authorities if they don’t receive a response at the door.In response to requests from Atago residents, there is also now a “mobile supermarket” that sells food from a car, coming three times a week at 10.30am for 40 minutes.The moves are arguably more than token, but with so few young people living in the units there is a limit to the social and commercial activity that can be sustained. When younger generations do move in, the income restrictions mean they are often low-income single mothers – whose childcare and work commitments mean they rarely have time to join in community activities.“I have a sense of crisis,” says Takamoto Komachi, director of the Tokyo politan Housing Management Division. “I want to prevent solitary death as much as possible.”Komachi says the Tokyo government is starting to consider efforts to reduce loneliness, such as improved patrol systems and collaboration with the welfare department. In 2012, staff began making regular visits to social housing complexes to check in on elderly residents and confirm their safety.Mitsunori Ishida, a sociology professor at Waseda University who studies the changing demographics of Tokyo’s social housing blocks, says: “The people who leave are strong, while those who remain, and the new people who move in, are socially vulnerable. There is a contradiction: although elderly people living alone need the mutual support of the local residents, there is a shortage of community.He adds: “If residents of collective housing are erse, the concentration of welfare problems and creation of community ought to improve. We need a lot of support from the local government and the social welfare council. “That help may be a while coming, but it is rising up the political agenda. In April this year, the opposition Japanese Communist party voiced its concern in the House of Representatives construction committee. “As a result of this reform, we have no young dual-employed couples” living in public housing, said one member. “Yet even now, public housing is ageing – and it will only get worse.”As for Tanaka, he is determined to remain cheerful. He used to say hi to his neighbour who died, even though she didn’t respond. “Maybe she didn’t care about socialising with her neighbours as she got older,” he says. “Nobody can imagine themselves in 20 years. So it is important to enjoy oneself at least in this moment, right now. People ask, ‘Are you worried about lonely death?’ I am prepared.” Cities is live in Tokyo for a special week of in-depth reporting.

Wasn’t this once the ‘competent party’?Imagine that some Rip Van Winkle, in a coma since 2010, suddenly wakes to look around and see what’s happening as the Tories choose our next prime minister. He’s an acute social observer, so he starts to check the facts of this decade and is shocked by what he finds. Wherever he looks, whatever he checks, he finds the scars of austerity are all around – and he assumes that’s what the candidates will confront.Talking to staff from his hospital bed he hears of 100,000 unfilled vacancies for overstressed NHS staff, with 2 million more people on hospital waiting lists. What kind of aftercare will he get, he asks? Not much, they say, with 1.4 million fewer frail people getting any social care, due to local councils stripped of half their funds.Children are hungry, he finds, as the threshold for free school meals has risen steeply. He checks the Institute for Fiscal Studies site and cries, Good grief! Pay has stagnated, and incomes still haven’t caught up with a decade ago, unknown since Napoleonic times. Good God, he exclaims when he finds four in 10 children are living in poverty, the highest proportion for 60 years. He doesn’t recognise the term “food bank”, but he finds there are now more than 2,000, catering for a million hungry families. Why? He checks what happened to social security, and sees the gigantic size of benefit cuts.Look, he tells the patient in the next bed. For the first time in our lives, longevity is falling not rising: a year has been cropped off his life while he slept. Worse, infant mortality has risen for the past two years – something unknown in his lifetime. The number of children in care has doubled, as cutbacks in social workers mean there’s no one to help families before they reach crisis.When Van Winkle first woke, he had been eager to find out what brave new world of social progress had sprung up in his absence. Depressed, he turns on the bedside TV. On the news channel he finds an array of press conferences for prime ministerial candidates. He watches them strut their stuff in interviews, and follows their self-promoting newspaper articles. The word Brexit at first puzzles him, but then appals him as he pieces together the mighty political catastrophe that has befallen the country. Boris Johnson as frontrunner makes him yearn to fall back into a coma. He notes the rank hypocrisy of Gove snorting coke and the next day writing a bombastic anti-drug column in the Times. But even that seems less outrageous than Johnson’s sociopathic knack for cheating, lying and misleading voters, mysteriously forever invulnerable.Gove will abolish VAT, swapping it for a lesser sales tax. “I value every inidual. I want everyone to be the author of their own life story” – which sounds as if that means no one should expect help from the state for anything. Esther McVey would also purloin the £39bn owed to the EU, to spend on a public sector pay rise. Only Matt Hancock and Rory Stewart eschew the fairyland of competing tax cuts. As for Brexit, whether it’s “Ready to Lead” with Gove or “Ready for Raab”, this is all dreamland Brextasy.Van Winkle sinks into gloom at candidates’ familiar boasts that Britain will rule the waves again. These ministers, responsible for every aspect of British life, seem utterly oblivious of the mountain to climb just to get back to 2010, yet promise everything “world class” and “world beating”. “I want to make Britain walk tall in the world again,” proclaims Hunt. “I want to make us the fastest growing most dynamic, pro-business, pro-enterprise, hi-tech economy in Europe.” The Brexit reflex is just another twitch of the old imperial fantasy, Van Winkle notes. Why can’t our politicians express a dignified patriotic love of country without world-class bragging that only makes us look absurd in our current state?Gove does it too: “With Brexit, this can be the best country in the world.” He promises to “make Britain the best place to live, learn, raise a family, achieve your potential, and start and run a business”. Is that restoring benefits, raising school spending to our competitors’ level, repairing social care and health – while cutting taxes too? In fact-free mode, Gove boasts how many schools he improved.By now Van Winkle is weary of the backstories paraded: fish-dealer father, bus-driver father, time in care, rambling in Afghanistan, running a business. Who cares? Just start with tax and spend numbers that add up. Wasn’t this once the competent party? Which of them will admit the state into which they have plunged the country? All are clueless as to what it would take to repair.Pondering so many tax cuts, Van Winkle wonders what other public services could be sliced away? He is glad to see he is not alone: Paul Johnson, IFS guru, has blown the whole lot of them to kingdom come, totting up their billions of spending and billions of tax cuts, appalled they have “no fiscal strategy”, no “seriousness” – leaving treasury heads banging on their desks. Van Winkle’s head aches and he calls for pain relief."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c8ffa76af8a27831ab2870d18ca1c73bed994b9/272_90_1538_922/master/1538.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64b4945ae67768983f97938a3826f695","title":"kylie jenner handmaids tale party tasteless arwa mahdawi","story":"The Kardashian scion completely missed the point of Margaret Atwood’s dystopian novel, but the small-screen adaptation seems to revel in violence against womenPraise be, ladies. The world may be a dismal place at the moment, but Kylie Jenner is here to remind us that there is a bright side to everything – even torture, rape and oppression. The 21-year-old reality TV star and cosmetics mogul recently had the bright idea of throwing a Handmaid’s Tale-themed party for one of her BFFs. The book and TV show may be a downer, but, hey, the bright-red gowns look great on Instagram! Guests sipped “praise be vodka” and “under his eye tequila” cocktails while taking selfies – and completely missing the point of Margaret Atwood’s dystopian novel.Jenner’s bash, which she shared on social media (naturally), has prompted a backlash. It does seem remarkably tone-deaf to treat The Handmaid’s Tale like a hilarious joke when the US is becoming more like the fictional Gilead by the day. If you think that is an overdramatic comparison, just take a look at Alabama, which recently became the latest state to pass an extreme abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest. Not only does the bill force women to have their rapist’s babies, but Alabama law means the rapist can get parental rights and sue for custody. Meanwhile, any doctor caught performing an abortion could get 99 years in prison.While I think we can agree that Jenner’s party was in poor taste, getting outraged about it seems hypocritical. Is dressing up as a handmaid for fun really so much worse than watching the TV adaptation, which seems to revel in violence against women and has been described as “torture porn”? I am not sure it is. In any case, there is not much use in getting outraged, considering that all publicity is good publicity for the Kardashian-Jenner clan. The attention Jenner’s party garnered may even encourage her to stage a sequel. A glow-in-the-dark Chernobyl-themed party, perhaps? Got a feeling that might make the internet go nuclear."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e693f85bca3afd3ed3a1431529568fa673b3dbc/0_44_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bba2bcadff8cc4c4c620fa657857637","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of sunny","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘sunny’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘sunny’.Share your photos of what sunny means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 12 June at 10am.

Once the heartland of London’s rave scene, they’re now home to new boutiques and flagship stores. With a focus on craftsmanship, sustainability and conscious consumption, you’ll find design that challenges the status quo and products made to last. From fancy pants to unisex streetwear, sun-drenched LA style to seriously chic wet weather gear, here are eight stores you’ll definitely want to drop into – and dwell.Beija LondonFounded by sisters Abbie Miranda and Mazie Fisher, Beija London is on a mission to revolutionise the way we buy underwear and swimwear. Every elegant, sculptural design comes in three sizing categories, from wire-free bralettes to full support, created to fit and celebrate AA-G cup sizes without ever compromising on style. Having gathered a cult online following, the brand’s first bricks and mortar store is as coolly minimalist as its lingerie, with abundant greenery and plenty of space for fittings. In fact, Beija’s approach is such a breath of fresh air that it almost feels as good as taking your bra off at the end of a long day. Almost.18montroseWith a roll call of labels including Stone Island, Maison Margiela, Rick Owens, Yeezy and Alexander Wang, concept store 18montrose is leading the way in unisex design. Technically, Coal Drops Yard is its third UK outlet (the boutique retailer also has stores in Glasgow and Nottingham), but this is their only London presence, and with more than 450 sq m of space, this is a temple to contemporary streetwear that goes way beyond the hype. The perfect place to get your kicks, and everything else that goes with them.Form\u0026ampThreadEthical, sustainable, sewed by fairly-paid workers in Portugal and packaged in biodegradable materials, everything at Form\u0026ampThread is transparent.

Born in the Suffolk town of the same name, this thoroughly British brand has been making quilted gilets and jackets since 1969. The swinging 60s might be long gone, but this premium outerwear has stood the test of time. Whether you’re after an ironic city twist on rural style or just something warm and stylish to walk the dog in, all emphasis here is on quality, comfort and durability. They even offer a repairs service.LPOLWife and husband team Katy Bell and John Maskell graduated from Central Saint Martins in 2006, so it’s fitting that their shop and studio is now based in Coal Drops Yard, only a stone’s throw from the world-famous art school. LPOL’s sleek totes, rucksacks and satchels are all crafted with a zero-waste philosophy every scrap of leather is reused to make prototypes, wallets or bag tags.

Stocking some of the biggest and coolest names in adventure wear, from pastel Patagonia anoraks to Blundstone boots and portable coffee makers, it’s a one-stop shop for happy campers, urban hikers and all that lies between. While the first Outsiders Store opened in Liverpool, the Coal Drops Yard boutique finds the retailer a second site in the heart of the capital, and home to a beautifully curated selection that’ll have even the most fashion-devoted Londoner yearning for a style excursion beyond zone five.TwiinIf you’ve ever crushed on that photo of Farrah Fawcett on a skateboard, Twiin is a must-visit. London’s first LA-inspired concept store, influenced by similarities between the two cities’ style tribes (we’re flattered), the store stocks a mix of luxe contemporary and vintage pieces. While the furnishings are mid-century, the ethos is pure 2019: socially-conscious brands, golden lighting and Instagram opportunities all over the shop.

Garment production has doubled in the past 15 years, with £140m worth of clothes a year ending up in landfill – and it’s a situation shoppers are very mindful of.And, in these times of digital overload, we’re rediscovering the joy of a bricks-and-mortar experience. Forward-thinking new retail districts are reimagining the traditional high street, putting an emphasis on storytelling and craftsmanship with stores for customers to spend time in. Coal Drops Yard is one such destination. As the name suggests, the warren of Victorian brick viaducts was originally built to house coal. In the 1990s, the warehouses became a new home for the clubbing scene, and now the area has reinvented itself once again as London’s most progressive shopping and restaurant district, home to a new crop of fashion and lifestyle brands encouraging shoppers to practise a more mindful kind of consumption.Tracey Neuls, a cult footwear designer who has been producing handmade shoes for the past 19 years, is just one example of a craftsperson pushing for conscious consumption. Each new design is sculpted by Neuls in clay, then produced by a Portuguese atelier using Italian leather from ethical tanneries. In her Coal Drops Yard boutique, shoes hang from the ceiling on ribbons, to be admired and encircled like mini works of art.“The rise in disposable fashion is having a wonderful knock-on effect of creating a new shopper who is more interested in quality than quantity,” explains Neuls. “Excess and choice are being replaced by emotive purchases that people intend to have around for years. We have customers who have described our shoes that they bought some 10 years ago as if they were talking about their pets – with the same attachment and love.”Neuls’ philosophy is shared by her Coal Drops Yard neighbour, leather goods brand LPOL. Founded by husband and wife team Katy Bell and John Maskell, they put responsible material sourcing and zero waste at the centre of everything they do. “As designers, we’re concerned with three things: fabric, form and function,” they explain. “The sole aim is to combine them effortlessly, sustainably and desirably in the best traditions and progression of our craft.”Meanwhile, clothes that haven’t found such long-term relationships (yet) are welcomed at Boutique by Shelter, where secondhand garments get a new lease of life. Furnished with salvaged materials and stocked with a covetable pick-and-mix of designer, high street and vintage donations, all at a fraction of the original price. But the store’s appeal goes far beyond bargains – it’s a community hub, a volunteering scheme, a source of vital funds to end homelessness and a way to tackle fashion’s waste problem.The new wave of conscious consumption doesn’t only mean caring for the planet it’s about the human impact, too, supporting businesses that strive to do good on both sides of the counter, and this is reflected in Coal Drop Yard’s retailers. Form\u0026ampThread champions fair pay for its factory workers Beija London strives to make more inclusive underwear, designed for women of all sizes with comfort and empowerment at heart and design practice and community space STORE Store addresses social imbalance within art, design and architecture by hosting creative courses for the general public, with a special focus on creating new opportunities for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.Trying harder is something we could surely all be doing. But while responsible shopping is just that – a responsibility, to do our due diligence and look a little harder at our habits – it’s not to say it shouldn’t be a pleasure, too. Neuls feels that the secret to more conscious shopping is foregoing trends and following your instinct. “If you shop with the view to invest in footwear that doesn’t go out of fashion, that makes you feel confident and makes you smile, then you are on the right track,” she says. And that’s an emotional investment as much as a financial one.In fact, most sustainability champions agree that it’s positivity – not guilt, shame or scary statistics – that drives the best trade. Make people feel bad about themselves, and they seek solace in a high street binge. But make us feel good about ourselves, and we’ll make good choices. The Coal Drops Yard approach might just be the future of shopping – do it slowly, and do it in style.To find out more about Coal Drops Yard’s carefully curated offerings, head to coaldropsyardshop-eat-drink"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1f1a0139c4acae8fbaa0c00279c1ce7b370a727/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4cebc09472be637110780c868e925a52","title":"kx marks the spot how kings cross became londons newest creative neighbourhood","story":"With the arrival of shopping and dining district Coal Drops Yard, King’s Cross has cemented its place as one of London’s most exciting destinations – for work and playMove over Shoreditch, make way Marylebone high street, fashion and design has found a new home in the capital: King’s Cross. Formerly known as the badlands of the city, the area has now transformed into a lively neighbourhood.Following the , who moved into the music and art hub Kings Place in 2008, the legendary fashion and design school Central Saint Martins, which counts Alexander McQueen and Stella McCartney among its alumni, took up residence in neighbouring Granary Square in 2011. More recently, big cultural players including Google, the House of Illustration, Universal Music, the Knowledge Quarter and Time Out have also arrived – bringing with them more people, ideas and creativity.But King’s Cross is far from “all work”. Making use of the Victorian brick viaducts that once held London’s coal store, the bright and airy 20,000 sq ft Coal Drops Yard has taken on a new life as a shopping and dining nirvana. The impossibly stylish redesign – undertaken by the award-winning King’s Cross-based architect, Thomas Heatherwick – is topped off with an already iconic “kissing roof”, which will soon be home to Samsung’s new flagship store.And hang out they do. King’s Cross, which is home to one of the capital’s main railway arteries and the Eurostar terminal at St Pancras, has always been busy with people passing through but, now, it’s a destination in its own right.Already home to an enviable collection of foodie hotspots and cultural highlights – from the KERB food market that sets up for lunch service in Granary Square three days a week, to the nearby British Library and Wellcome Collection, both just a short walk away – when Coal Drops Yard arrived in October 2018, it was seen by many as the icing on the cake. Home to more than 50 stores and restaurants, many of which are young, independent businesses, every archway is filled with thought-provoking products and tantalising flavours.When it comes to fashion, Coal Drops Yard is definitely adding to the conversation, with a unique and eclectic range of brands and boutiques from a three-storey Cos store (which doubles a space to celebrate the art and design that inspires their clothes) and stylish Fred Perry outlet, to independent boutiques such as S120 and Form\u0026ampThread, and menswear heavy-hitters, Universal Works, to name but a few.“We’ve always envisioned King’s Cross as a microcosm of the city – it’s a erse community where people live, work, study and socialise,” explains Anna Strongman, partner at Argent. “In Coal Drops Yard, we’ve aimed to create a unique destination that connects all types of visitors through our combination of shops, restaurants and a vibrant year-round cultural events programme.”With so much change taking place in such a short space of time, it’s fair to say the area’s blossoming into a creative neighbourhood has taken some people by surprise. “When I first moved to London almost seven years ago, I wouldn’t have imagined King’s Cross would be considered a ‘fashion hub,’” says Central Saint Martins alumni and 10 Magazine’s fashion and features assistant, Helena Fletcher.Not everyone is as shocked by the area’s metamorphosis, though. “Generally, when creative industries move into a space in any city, that space then becomes desirable over time,” explains Adam Murray, fashion lecturer at Central Saint Martins.For Henry Graham, creative director and co-founder of Wolf \u0026amp Badger, which has a three-storey concept store in the main yard, Coal Drops Yard is a destination that really stands out from the competition. “In what is an increasingly homogeneous retail landscape, the King’s Cross Central Limited Partnership should be applauded for their courage in proactively seeking out innovative and unique fashion and lifestyle retailers, all of whom, through their stores in Coal Drops Yard, bring a new experience not only to the immediate area but London as a whole,” he says.To discover more about Coal Drop Yard’s unique stores, restaurants and packed diary of cultural events, head to coaldropsyard"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d69e444ee2358370a4b35574f44acc04bae2542/354_311_4830_2898/master/4830.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=705d037244c3b8774ec89a2288a0f488","title":"drop it like its hot style inspiration from londons new home of cool","story":" At Coal Drops Yard, creativity is all around you, from the architectural juxtaposition of old and new to the contents of the stores and the people who work in them.

There are far too many children who have ended up in youth custody who had speech and language problems at school.”Urban areas tend to spend more than rural areas. Local authority spend per child is highest in London, at just over £7 per pupil, with the south-east just behind at a little under £6. It is lowest in the east Midlands, which spends 34p, and the West Midlands (90p).Generally, CCGs fund the bulk of spending on SLT. The north of England has the highest CCG spend per child at just under £18, followed by London, at just over £17. The lowest CCG spend per child is in the Midlands and East NHS region (just over £10) followed by the south of England (just under £14).A government spokesperson said: “As part of the NHS’s long-term plan, we are working to improve support for children and young people, including considering how to ensure we have the right numbers of speech and language therapists to meet demand.“We are boosting local early-years services with £8.5m to help establish best practice and are providing £50m to develop more high-quality school-based nursery provision for disadvantaged children, £26m to set up a network of English hubs and a national training centre, and £20m on the professional development of early-years practitioners – ensuring every child can thrive.”James Bowen, director of policy at the National Association of Head Teachers, said: “Children’s early speech and language skills are the foundations upon which all future learning is built. If children fall behind in the early years, it can prove difficult, often impossible, for them to catch up later, even with additional help.“Early intervention is key, but schools are finding it harder and harder to access specialist help from speech and language therapists, as both school budgets and local authority budgets are cut.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/886ae714dbd04de7c8dd57d2f1cf344dc12adf46/0_434_7597_4559/master/7597.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=325ecef03f9edfa3681a4c81a8150d3f","title":"universities condemn catastrophic plan link fees graduate pay augar","story":"Academics say Augar proposals could damage arts degrees and lose Britain its creative edgeAcademics are warning it would be “despicable” if the government went ahead with recommendations to cut funding for some arts and humanities degrees on the basis that they don’t net big salaries for graduates.Last week the prime minister’s commission on post-18 education funding called for a cut in university tuition fees from £9,250 to £7,500 a year. The review, chaired by former equities broker Philip Augar, said the government should make up the funding gap, which vice-chancellors say will amount to around £1.8bn. In addition, it called on the government to adjust support for different subjects to reflect the economic and social “value” of degrees, and how much they cost to teach.This proposal has sparked alarm in institutions with a heavy bias towards arts and humanities subjects, where graduates are less likely to earn high salaries early in their careers.Dr Jason Scott-Warren, a lecturer in English at Cambridge University, says: “The idea of measuring the success of degrees by graduate earnings is despicable and we can only hope that future governments will abandon this market logic.”He adds: “It ought to be obvious that some degree courses are designed as feeders for particular forms of employment while others exist to nurture intelligence, to push the boundaries of our understanding and to make human lives worth living.”Male graduates also don’t see any major salary benefit by age 29 if they studied subjects such as English and philosophy, agriculture, psychology, languages and history.Kate Williams, the television historian and author, says: “It is wrong to value jobs by how much we get paid. If we are really saying the only jobs that are worthwhile are in banking or high-level accountancy, I find that bizarre and ridiculous.”Williams, a professor of public engagement with history at Reading University, who made the popular Royal Wives of Windsor series, says: “Many history graduates retrain as lawyers and earn a huge amount of money. But others just love history. They want to become curators and work in museums, or heritage, or television or teach history. None of those jobs will mean starting out with a big salary.”Nigel Carrington, the vice-chancellor of the University of the Arts, which includes Central Saint Martins and the London College of Fashion, warns that if fees are cut and money isn’t put back into arts and design courses there will be “catastrophic effects” for some universities. He says his colleges would be forced to take fewer UK students and more international students, who pay higher fees.He adds that institutions outside big cities might find it harder to attract more foreign students to stay afloat. “There are arts schools outside London that will be devastated,” he says.The Augar review does at least acknowledge that a course’s value can be measured in ways besides cash returns, Carrington says, but the education secretary, Damian Hinds, shows no such nuance. “He focuses explicitly on early career earnings as the primary marker of value for money and has appeared specifically to focus on art and design. Presumably the intention is to reduce the number of students studying subjects in areas like the arts. That is very worrying.”Carrington adds that the new salary data overlooks the fact that many arts graduates will freelance in the early years of their career, and freelance salaries will never match those in permanent employment.Megan Grinham, a third-year fashion student at Norwich University of the Arts (NUA), says that when she chose her course she was far more interested in pursuing her passion than in how much she would earn.Grinham, whose high-vis fashion range was paraded on stage at London Graduate Fashion Week this month, says: “You can’t base value on salary. Why don’t they look instead at all the new ideas we are creating?”She adds: “The creative arts are sometimes looked down on, but my family and friends know it isn’t an easy ride. In my final year I’ve been in the studio from 9am til 9pm every day and worked at weekends. I’ve loved every minute of my degree and learned so much about all aspects of the fashion industry.”Prof John Last, the vice-chancellor of NUA, is “saddened” by the funding review’s failure to see the strategic importance of creative subjects. “The creative industries are now calculated to contribute £100bn to the UK economy. That’s not a lightweight degree option,” he says.“We are a nation that celebrates our Oscar winners and our big names in fashion, but we don’t ask where they came from. If that education pipeline is broken we will be poorer as a country.” One head of a Russell Group university adds that there is no guarantee that even high-cost subjects will be properly supported after any fees cut. “The obvious danger is that the Treasury will decide that £1.8bn would be better spent elsewhere. There is a massive danger that the difference will not be made up.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7879c0cb46b90a99d6e514978ffbd597d8b6cade/0_51_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e6a5a36c1520436a7f28168c5101268","title":"could the cycle to work scheme start an ebike revolution","story":"New guidance on £1,000 ‘cap’ means more expensive ebikes are available as part of schemeOver the weekend, new guidance on the Cycle to Work scheme was announced by the Department for Transport (DfT), making it clear that ebikes are eligible for it. This clarification could encourage a new demographic on to two wheels, and provide huge benefits to disabled and elderly people.The scheme is a complicated but well-used salary sacrifice scheme in which employees can get bikes, tax-free, via their employers. It starts with a year-long loan, which most people extend until the bike is worth so little they can “buy” it for a nominal sum or extend the hire for a percentage of the bike’s value. (After five or six years, HMRC considers a bike to have a negligible value).At present, employers and bike shops can administer the scheme, and it was widely believed that a £1,000 cap existed on the cost of the bike and equipment as part of the arrangement. The new minister for cycling, Michael Ellis, says that was always a misunderstanding as it applied only to bike shops and employers who are not registered with the Financial Conduct Authority – usually small independent ones.The larger bike shops, it turns out, could always have included more expensive bikes in the scheme, and the DfT says this weekend’s announcement was just to clarify that. Given Cycle to Work is now 20 years old, it’s about time.So why is this important?The “cap” would have excluded most electric cycles and non-standard cycles, such as those for people with disabilities, which tend to cost more than £1,000. Electrically assisted bikes work by giving you a boost as you pedal, via a battery-powered motor. They are limited to 250w, and a top speed of 15.5mph. Most people see the main benefit of this clarification as being for the uptake of those bikes.The UK is behind this trend – just 70,000 ebikes were sold in the country last year.People like ebikes because they make longer commutes easier, you can pedal further in normal clothes without getting sweaty, they give you a boost up hills (it’s like someone pushing the bike when you’re pedalling). They’re also great if you’re a little out of shape and want to get active – or if you have knee problems, or are just getting older. A survey by the disabled cycling charity Wheels for Wellbeing found one in five disabled cyclists uses some form of electrical assistance when they cycle.Last autumn, while cycling home one rainy night, I got chatting with a man who had weighed 32 stone (203kg) , and after bariatric surgery switched from moped to ebike on his 11-mile commute – each way – to help keep the weight off. He is lucky to live near an excellent protected cycle route, which we rode along as we chatted. He loves the new wheels, which only take him five minutes longer than the moped, and help him maintain his fitness.According to research based on commuting patterns, widespread ebike use in the UK has the potential to shift more than one in four work trips to cycles – if we also build safe cycle routes. That could clearly have a massive impact on air pollution, congestion and people’s health.Staff in specialist ebike shops I’ve spoken to say many customers aren’t switching from normal bikes but from cars, and public transport. They are fed up with traffic jams, and getting wise to the fact ebikes are cheaper, healthier, often quicker – and more fun. People talk about the “ebike smile”, and shops are selling them with this in mind – focusing less on groupsets and weight and more on what you’ll use it for. Full mudguards, a rack and a basket? No problem.Ebikes save people money, too. An Evans survey of 2,000 commuters estimated that by switching from car, bus, tube or train to ebikes, commuters could save an average of £7,791 over five years.I ride a normal bike, but last year I was lent an ebike. I rode it to the theatre one balmy night, a 20 mile round trip, in heels and a skirt. I would normally have taken public transport. It was a revelation. No sweat, no stress, and I barely noticed the fierce headwind. If more people had good quality bike routes, it’s easy to see the transformative impact the combination could have on those who don’t ride already.Cycle to Work is great for employees but self-employed people, those who are out of work or retired people will not be able to take advantage of it. As disabled people are more likely to be out of work or self-employed, a government expansion of the scheme to include these groups could be transformative.But the most important impact this clarification may have is to help more people realise cycling is something they can do too – ebikes open up cycling to everyone, showing it’s not just for the fit and the brave."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf579c0772731b9eb50dcb567527341cf7c6f03d/0_422_6334_3800/master/6334.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=865e0ed70eb6601259b33614962d05ca","title":"forget fast fashion slow style pioneers on the clothes theyve worn for decades","story":"As consumers grow tired of cheap, disposable items and ‘haul culture’, six people tell the story behind the piece of clothing they’ve cherished longestA peek in the average British wardrobe will confirm that we are living in increasingly throwaway times. The popularity of “haul culture”, the ubiquity of Primark on high streets and the rise of ultra-low-cost online retailers has got the British public hooked on fast fashion. But it is entirely unsustainable. We send £140m of clothing to landfill every year in the UK, much of it made by workers scratching a subsistence wage in poor conditions in countries such as Cambodia and Sri Lanka. And the environmental cost is ruinous: the fashion industry is the world’s second biggest polluter, after the oil industry.There is, however, evidence that this era may be drawing to a close. It is estimated that the secondhand or resale market could be bigger than fast fashion within a decade as we become more aware of the social and environmental impact of cheap clothes. And the slow-fashion movement – encouraging people to buy ethically made items of clothing sparingly, repair them when necessary and keep them for life – is growing in popularity. Here, we asked  readers if they were slow fashion pioneers and to share the much-loved items that have been in their wardrobes for years.I was ridiculously shy when I was younger. When I went to art college in 1988, I realised I needed to come out of my shell so made a real effort to make friends.One day, a student called Mike invited me to a fashion party. It was brilliant fun. Lots of people were staying over, so I did, too, but the next morning I reverted to being shy Sunita. When I left, everyone burst out laughing at this weird girl Mike had invited.The next time I saw Mike I didn’t know what to say, so I said: “I love your dungarees.” He told me I could have them and I’ve worn them ever since. I adore them.I met my husband, Simon, at college. We’ve been together for 30 years and married for 26. After we’d been dating for two weeks, he took me to meet his family. I wore the dungarees because I was nervous – I come from a culture where most of my cousins had arranged marriages – and I felt as if I could hide in them. Dungarees are workwear, so they never go out of fashion, and these ones are good quality. I normally wear them when I’m doing DIY or painting. Every time I pop them on, all the memories of my life with Simon come back. I guess you could say they’re my happy dungarees.In 2016, I was in Brighton, visiting my cousin for the day. We went vintage shopping in the Lanes. I saw this dress and felt drawn to the print – it was a strange feeling. I didn’t have much money, so I tried it on and then left the shop to think about it. I called Mum for advice. She said: “That sounds really similar to a dress that I had once and gave away.” I decided to buy it, just to show her. I sent her a photo and she replied: “Oh, my God. It’s the dress.”She had been given it by a friend who had bought it in the 1970s in Dublin. It’s by a designer called Susan Small. We found a photo of my mum wearing it in the 1990s. When I saw it, it triggered something in my memory. I was pretty sure I’d seen a dress like it on eBay, so I went into my watched items and there it was: same print, same designer, but a slightly different version. It turns out my mum had actually owned two of the dresses and given them both away. It’s a crazy coincidence.I was drawn to the dress because of deep-rooted nostalgia. My mum always wore those types of dresses when we were kids. When I realised the connection, it felt meaningful. A lot of my love for vintage fashion comes from her. In the photo, she’s wearing the dress with a pair of Hobbs shoes from 1989, which I also have. So now I have the exact same outfit.When I was at university, my bedroom was so cold in the winter that I would often find ice inside the windows. My mum said: “I’ll knit you a jumper.” That was 37 years ago, and that jumper has stayed with me throughout all the highs and lows of my life.In its heyday, it was really warm and fluffy. I’d wear it when I was studying and I couldn’t afford to put the heating on. It’s not so fluffy now, but it’s only in the past year that I’ve had to start patching it up. I asked my mum if she could repair it. She had a go, but said it was beyond her – she didn’t have the time and patience, or the wool. It’s funny to think it will have only cost her a few pounds to make and that it has lasted this long. If I were to buy a jumper like it, it would cost a lot more, and likely wouldn’t last. Fashion these days changes so quickly. I see people updating their look all the time, and I think how big is your closet? When I was younger, I used to go walking a lot and my socks would always go into holes. My mum said to me: “You know, there’s a company that makes indestructible socks?” When I bought them, from HJ Hall, they looked like normal socks to me. But, 28 years on, I’m still wearing them. I wore them on my wedding day. I don’t think I consciously decided to keep them as a keepsake, but the longer I had them, the more they felt like a memory of the day. They’re like a talisman – I’ve had them all the time that we’ve been happily married. Indestructible socks equal an indestructible marriage.I treasure things that I’ve had for some time, and these socks fall into that category. Other generations of socks have been and gone, but when I open my drawer, they’re always there: a reliable presence in an unreliable world.I bought this dress on Cuba Street in central Wellington when I was 25. There was a stall selling tie-dyed batik outfits. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw this incredible ultramarine blue. I thought: “That will be easy to wear in summer.”After I bought the dress, I met Scott. He lived in Auckland and, as I lived in Wellington, we had a long-distance relationship for a while. Scott and I both had stressful jobs so we loved to take weekends off and travel around New Zealand. The dress quickly became associated with holidays.Later on, Scott would come home from a stressful day and say: “I’ve had enough.” So we’d chuck a few things in a bag and off we’d go. I’d always bring the dress because if it got crushed or crumpled, the creases would fall right out. Whenever I’d prepare for a trip, Scott always checked to make sure I’d packed it. He liked the colour.Scott wanted to explore the world and we started taking longer trips. In 2000, we spent six months travelling around Central America and the dress came with us. I could wear it hiking or at the end of the day when we went for a beer and a meal. It was just a simple thing: I didn’t have to worry what I looked like because the dress was bright and cheerful, and that’s how I felt. When I look at photos from that trip, I see a young woman, madly in love, looking at the man she loves without a care in the world and her life stretching before her.Before Scott died of pancreatic cancer in 2017, he asked me to scatter his ashes at Cape Finisterre in Spain. It was a special place for Scott – we had travelled there in 2008. In Roman times, they thought Cape Finisterre was the end of the world. Scott liked that. So I packed the dress, flew to Spain and tipped the bugger off a cliff, just like he wanted.Scott and I always saw ourselves as a great love story. He used to tell me that he loved me without measure or restraint. The dress represents all the times we had together. But it’s just a scrap of fabric, really. When I bought it, I didn’t think any of that. Now, when I come home from the farm and I’m tired, I have a shower and put it on. It still fits, although it’s a bit more snug now and a little worn, but it’s as bright and blue and happy as it ever was.I grew up on a hill farm in Dartmoor, the youngest of three children. I used to wear my siblings’ hand-me-downs, but I loved dressing up. My grandmother gave me these 1930s evening gowns and I’d wander around the farmyard with them dragging in the mud.When I was 17, I went to art school in Plymouth. I used to spend a lot of time vintage shopping – I loved the hunt. This Edwardian jacket was the first vintage piece I ever bought. I’d wear it with patched-up old Levi’s, or over a dress. It was an exciting time: I was just heading out into the world and everything seemed possible.After I finished my degree, I met an older man who was very interesting, but also abusive and controlling. He would often tell me what I could and couldn’t wear. The only way to escape was to throw some clothes in a bag and run away with my son, which is how I found myself a single parent in the mid-1980s. Money was tight and I had to sell my vintage clothing collection to make ends meet. But I couldn’t bear to sell the jacket. It was a bit of the old me, from before I met him. It held the memory of my younger, flamboyant, art-student self.I wore the jacket when my husband and I got married, on Dartmoor, in 1995. I had to wear it, because it had seen me through good times and bad – and my wedding was a particularly special and joyous time for me. Even though the jacket’s looking a bit tatty now, I still wouldn’t part with it. I moved to New York in the 1970s as a student before getting a job at New York University. I saw this suit in the window of a shop on 8th Street and it just yelled to me that I had to buy it. Because I’m so tall and thin, it can be hard for me to find clothes, but when I tried it on, it fitted perfectly.I was living it up at the time. I had a very fulfilling job, a good social life and I’d go out to the disco. It was one of the happier periods of my life. I grew up in Scotland, but I’d been courageous and taken myself to the US. Things had worked out for me and I was very grateful. The suit was a symbol of how I’d built the life for myself that I wanted. If I could go back in time to that period, I’d whisper to myself: “You’re doing great. Just keep it up. It’s going to be wonderful.”I’ve had the suit since I was 28 and I’m reluctant to get rid of it because I’d never be able to find one like it again. It’s as good as new – I still wear it occasionally, although not as much as I did in the 1970s.As I get older I grow less attached to material things. I throw things out because I want to make my life leaner. It’s just a few things and a few people that are really valuable that I hold on to – the others fall off the edges and I let them go."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7eec05b78efaa7bda9ceeb73f596cc0b71ba98b/0_0_2880_1728/master/2880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b93f7a15205ffb779578865fb1c98d4","title":"how we made dazed and confused richard linklater wiley wiggins","story":"‘When the studio head realised I was directing, he thought, “Oh no, it’s going to be one of those arty, jerk-offski movies.” I still have PTSD thinking about it’I thought the 1970s sucked. Dazed was supposed to be an anti-nostalgic movie. But it’s like trying to make an anti-war movie – just by depicting it, you make it look fun. I wanted to do a realistic teen movie – most of them had too much drama and plot but teenage life is more like you’re looking for the party, looking for something cool, the endless pursuit of something you never find, and even if you do, you never quite appreciate it.An experimental version of the film had been floating around in my head between 1989 and 91 – just four guys driving around in a car busting mailboxes to ZZ Top. I really did that one night in this little town in south Houston with a friend by the end of the evening we had driven 138 miles and never left the city limits. But I quickly realised I wanted to represent different points of view. I wrote a long first draft in about a month. We leapfrogged about 30 other projects that were in development at Universal.There were very few teenage movies at the time, so every young actor was clamouring to be in it. We cast in New York – where I met Parker Posey – Los Angeles and Austin. Wiley Wiggins was the big find there. He was a 15-year-old with all the bad habits of a grad student: smoking cigarettes, hanging out at coffee shops, my kind of guy.I made the actors mixtapes of music their characters would listen to. The girls got a lot of Joni Mitchell Mitch, Wiley’s character, was at the cooler end of the 70s, glam and prog rock – he would be the first guy to buy the Ramones. I wanted it to look like it was shot in the 70s, so I didn’t use Steadicam. Stylistically, it was trying its best to look like one of those drive-in movies.Improvisation was one of the things that made the studio nervous, but it added a lot of additional humour to Dazed and Confused. Not everyone picks up on the vibe of what you’re trying to do, though. There was one actor, Shawn Andrews, who wasn’t exactly rocking and rolling with the rest of the cast. So I switched things around to expand Matthew McConaughey’s role instead.After shooting was over, I went to Los Angeles for the finishing touches. The studio put me up in soulless corporate accommodation. I didn’t think I was going to be there for long, but I realised they were doing this psy-ops thing on me, trying to wear me down. People seemed to really enjoy the screenings, but then their ratings on certain aspects were always lower than executives thought they should be, which confirmed their fears that I had made an art film. They wanted me to put in modern music – or reshoot. But I didn’t take any of their dumb ideas.The film made $8m on a $6.9m budget. I never made a penny off anything to do with it – I waived most of my rights to pay for the soundtrack. I don’t think it’s my best movie, but it represents a rite of passage for the “busters”, the end of the baby-boom generation. I also enjoy people who weren’t even born then liking the film. It tells you there’s something about teenagedom that never changes.I was sitting outside Captain Quackenbush’s Intergalactic Espresso House on the Drag in Austin when Anne Walker, the co-producer, gave me a casting-call leaflet. I was excited because it said it was the same production team as Slacker, which I had seen five times. Rick was a nice, personable guy who didn’t seem like a real adult. The night before we started shooting, everyone went to the Hole in the Wall bar to play pool. I tried to play it cool with Nicky Katt and the guys who were going to beat me with paddles as part of the film’s freshmen initiation scenes, but the first thing I did was shoot the cue ball off the table. It was a very close-knit cast and a lot of great relationships were formed. Most people were staying in the Radisson hotel, but I was a local kid who still lived at home. So I only heard about their off-hours shenanigans – going to gun ranges, taking mushrooms and rafting down the river.I dropped out of school shortly after the film was shot, so I didn’t experience the full blast of recognition. But it was a slow burn: it played for five years at the same theatre Slacker had played at. People would come up to me with preconceived notions – that I was big-headed, or wanted to smoke weed with random strangers in broad daylight. At the same time, it has opened so many doors for me that I wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world. It was important for me, especially at that time in my life when I was a little bit of a fuckup."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd4585336371b332b9e35f382a369a76015f4be0/0_745_4933_2959/master/4933.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1564bc4f03a9e0aae1eac4a549fec28a","title":"true grit john wayne 1969 henry hathaway","story":"Released in the same year as The Wild Bunch and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Henry Hathaway’s western was defiantly old-fashioned in comparisonThe year 1969 was a true inflection point for the American western, a once-dominant genre that had become a casualty of the culture, particularly when Vietnam had rendered the moral clarity of white hats and black hats obsolete. A handful of westerns were released by major studios that year, including forgettable or regrettable star vehicles for Burt Reynolds (Sam Whiskey) and Clint Eastwood (Paint Your Wagon), who were trying to revitalize the genre with a touch of whimsy. But 50 years later, three very different films have endured: Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Wild Bunch and True Grit. Together, they represented the past, present and future of the western.In the present, there was Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, the year’s runaway box-office smash, grossing more than the counterculture duo of Midnight Cowboy and Easy Rider, the second- and third-place finishers, combined. George Roy Hill’s hip western-comedy, scripted by William Goldman and starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford, turned a story of outlaw bank robbers into a knowing and cheerfully sardonic entertainment that felt attuned to modern sensibilities. Sam Peckinpah’s Wild Bunch predicted a future of revisionist westerns, full of grizzled antiheroes, great spasms of stylized violence, and the messy inevitability of unhappy endings. A whiff of death from a genre in decline.By contrast, True Grit looks like it could have been released 10, 20 or 30 years earlier, and with many of the same people working behind and in front of the camera. Its legendary producer, Hal B Wallis, was the driving force behind such Golden Age classics as Casablanca and The Adventures of Robin Hood, and his director, Henry Hathaway, cut his teeth as Cecil B DeMille’s assistant on 1923’s Ben Hur before spending decades making studio westerns, including a 1932 debut (Heritage of the Desert) that gave Randolph Scott his start and seven films with Gary Cooper. And then, of course, there’s John Wayne as Rooster Cogburn, stretching himself enough to win his only Oscar for best actor, but drawing heavily on his own pre-established iconography. It was, for him, a well-earned victory lap.True Grit may be defiantly old-fashioned and stodgy when considered against the films of the day, but it’s also an example of how durable the genre actually was – and how it would be again in 2010, when the Coen brothers took their own crack at Charles Portis’s 1968 novel and produced the biggest hit of their careers. What would be more escapist than ducking into a movie theater in the summer of ’69 and stepping into a time machine where John Wayne is a big star, answering a call to adventure across a beautiful Technicolor expanse of mountains and prairies? The film has much more sophistication than the average throwback, but the search for justice across Indian Territory is uncomplicated and righteous, and the half-contentioushalf-sentimental relationship between a plucky teenager and an irascible old coot grounds it in the tried-and-true. The defiant message here is: this can still work!And boy does it ever. Kim Darby didn’t get much of a career boost for playing Mattie Ross, a fiercely determined and morally upstanding tomboy on the hunt for her father’s killer, but every bit of energy and urgency the film needs comes from her. When Mattie’s father is shot by Tom Chaney (Jeff Corey), a hired hand on their ranch near Fort Smith, Arkansas, she takes it upon herself to make sure he’s caught and dragged before the hanging judge. Whatever emotion she feels about the loss is set aside, limited to a brief crying jag in the privacy of a hotel bedroom, and she’s all business the rest of the time. When the Fort Smith sheriff doesn’t seem sufficiently motivated, she seeks out US marshal Cogburn (Wayne), a one-eyed whiskey guzzler who lives alone with a Chinese shopkeep and a cat he calls General Sterling Price.The odd man out in their posse is a Texas ranger named La Boeuf (Glen Campbell), which Wayne and everyone else pronounce as “La Beef”, as part of his instinctual disrespect for Texans – and, really, anyone who fought for the Confederacy during the civil war. (La Boeuf makes a point of saying he fought for General Kirby Smith, rather than the south, which suggests a sense of shame that stands out in our current age of tiki-torch monument protests.) The chemistry between the three is terrific, despite Campbell’s limitations as an actor, because it’s constantly changing: Rooster and La Boeuf are sometimes aligned as mercenaries who see Chaney as a chance to take money from Mattie and from the family of a Texas state senator that the scoundrel also shot. Rooster comes to Mattie’s defense when Le Boeuf treats her like a wayward child and whips her with a switch, but the tables turn on that, too, when Rooster’s protective side holds her back.Wayne called Marguerite Roberts’ script the best he’d ever read – she was on the Hollywood blacklist, which made them odd political bedfellows – and True Grit has nearly as much pop in the dialogue as the showier Butch Cassidy. Mattie gets to turn her father’s oversized pistol on Chaney, but language is her weapon of choice, delivered in such an intellectual fusillade that her adversaries tend to surrender quickly. (A running joke about the lawyer she intends to sic on them has a wonderful payoff.) The three leads exchange playful barbs and colorful stories, too, with Rooster ragging on La Boeuf’s marksmanship (“This is the famous horse killer from El Paso”) or spending the downtime before an ambush sharing the troubled events from his life that have gotten him to this place.There’s a degree to which True Grit is a victory lap for Wayne, who gets one of his last – and certainly one of his best – opportunities to pay off a career in westerns. Yet Wayne genuinely lets down his guard in key moments and allows real pain and vulnerability to seep through, enough to complicate his tough-guy persona without demolishing it altogether. It may not have the gravitas of Clint Eastwood in Unforgiven, but it’s the same type of performance, the reckoning of a western gunslinger who’s seen and done terrible things, lost the people he loved, and seems intent on living out his remaining days alone. Without the redemptive power of Mattie’s kindness and decency, True Grit is about a man left to drink himself to death."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c42977e6987e4eec63b3b375a31b4e69549a841d/0_379_4728_2838/master/4728.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d11d403942aa92cb44ed56ac1ca1ec1c","title":"womens world cup fans preview tournament","story":"France are ready.

France can crumble under pressure. But there shouldn’t be much of a problem winning Group A if we play well against Norway.Keep an eye out for… our playmaker Gaetane Thiney. There’s plenty of young talent in the squad, but a lot of France’s creativity will go through one of the veterans of the team. NaomiMy Super Falcons… could not have wished for a worse draw. France, Norway and South Korea should be too strong for us.I have a feeling… Nigeria will cause an upset or two. If that happens we should be able to progress with France to the knockout rounds.Opposition defenders will… be run ragged with the skill and pace of Asisat Oshoala and Francesca Ordega. They can provide the necessary inspiration. Ifeanyi Andrew IbehThe mood in Norway is… quite relaxed. We should progress from the group and lay to rest the ghosts of the horrible Euro 2017 campaign. A win over Nigeria will lift optimism.Our best player is… not playing. Ada Hegerberg’s decision not to play for the national team continues to create debate. A negative interview just before the tournament hasn’t been received particularly well. It’s not what is needed just now.The team will do well if… they stick together as a group. And if winger Caroline Graham Hansen finds some inspiration. IdaMy hope is… getting through the group. Quarter-finals has to be a realistic aim.My husband… is supporting his home team Germany. And, with England as a third choice, I’m bound to be cheering on a finalist, right?I’m looking forward to watching… Ji So-yun. If she finds form she can inspire this team towards the early knockout stages and beyond. Heejung ChungGermany can… end up anywhere from a group exit to winning it.I got hooked on women’s football during… the 1995 World Cup in Sweden. Manuela Goller was in goal and current coach Martina Voss-Tecklenburg was also in the team. But let’s not talk about Germany’s final defeat to Norway.I love to watch… goalkeeper Almuth Schult and Dzsenifer Marozsan. She knows French football very well.

People are finally taking an interest.The national team… won’t be anywhere near the favourites, but they can definitely be a surprise package.A good result would be… getting to through to the knockout stages.Our most skilful players is… Our captain and midfielder Amanda Sampedro. Under her leadership we have talent and motivation to do something big. Javier Perez Before the tournament I am… Nervous. We have a great team but go into the World Cup on a massive losing streak. We don’t seem able to string good games together.Australia have… the best squad we have ever fielded in a tournament. We may have lacked consistently lately but on our day we are very strong on paper. Maybe saving the best for when it matters?Our smartest player is… Sam Kerr. She’s smart off the ball and creative on it. Her goal scoring ability will be a key factor too. I’m very excited for her. KatieOur team is… Not in the nicest place right now after nine defeats in a row. The coach has been criticised for putting players out of position and it’s just not working.My hopes rest on… my country’s love of football. The sport is in our DNA. I believe and hope our love for the game will make a difference on the pitch.It will be sad to say goodbye to… Brazilian legends Marta, Formiga and Andressa Alves. They are true icons for a lot of young girls in Brazil. They broke many gender barriers, but have never been able to win the World Cup. This year I hope it gets to be a really special one for them, and for us. Isabella QueirozFor Italy to be at the World Cup is… already a result. Italian football has not been very kind to the women’s game. Just look at the comments made by the Italian football association not so long ago.We can thank… our biggest league clubs for keeping the women’s game moving. The standard of the women’s game has increased dramatically.We stand no chance against… Brazil, but I’m more confident of frustrating Australia and beating Jamaica.Our most inspirational player is… our captain Sara Gama. The symbol of what women’s football can be in Italy if we get our act together. Riccardo TeslaI expect… a decent showing in the group games at our first ever Women’s World Cup, but I would also be surprised to see us go any further.A lot of our hopes rest on… our strong and fast striker Khadija “Bunny” Shaw. And I hope goalkeeper Sydney Schneider has packed her gloves. She will be extremely busy. Dennis JonesThe country hopes that... the team will not be in France just to make up the numbers. There is little expectation and that might work in our favour.The main target will be... not ending up pointless. And learning from the experience. Women’s football in Argentina is miles behind other competitors and I fear this might show in the games. We need to show spirit.Getting through the group would be... an absolute miracle. Just look at what we’re up against. England and Japan will surely be too strong, and Scotland will be tough too. I just can’t see it. We should be content with a gracious exit and three committed performances. EzequielI really hope Japan will… go all the way to the World Cup final. It would be their third in a row. But the semi-finals is the minimum requirement.The mood in Japan is… optimistic. There’s a lot of love for the national team here and anticipation is clearly building.The country lacks… strong female role models in sport. As a teacher in Kawasaki I see sport in school clearly being the domain of boys. I hope that a positive tournament can raise the profile of women’s football further and will have a knock-on effect in promoting women’s sport.This could be the tournament for… Yui Hasegawa to shine. The midfielder is on the verge of a breakthrough and this could be her summer. Gareth BellEngland should… top their group easily. The only real competition will come from Japan.The real test will come… in a quarter-final. That would potentially be against host nation France. After that things would get more and more difficult with an unbeatable looking USA in a potential semi. You never know what might happen though. This is football after all!I’m looking forward to seeing… Nikita Parris. She has been superb in the run-up to this World Cup. Hopefully Fran Kirby can recreate the magic from Euro 2017. And I’m excited to see what playing for American teams has done for Toni Duggan and Jodie Taylor. Maybe they have some insider knowledge! Esme CowardWe would do well to… avoid any thrashings in the group stage. Argentina should be beaten, but England and Japan look far too strong.I’m proud of… how we have continually improved for the past seven years. Just being at a World Cup is progress, and reward for lots of hard work.We have a world class player in… Kim Little. Missing the Euros two years ago cost us, and it will be great to see her play a key role in a major tournament. Erin Cuthbert also has a good eye for goal. Jen WattCameroon will… once again try and be competitive but fail to get out of the group.The second round can be reached if… Michaela Abam, Gabrielle Onguene and Alexandra Takounda have the tournament of their lives. Elume RaymondOur success is built on… our defence. We’ve only conceded one goal in eight matches so far in 2019. The centre-back partnership of Kadeisha Buchanan and Shelina Zadorsky has been rock solid.Our downfall is definitely… a lack of goals. We’ve only scored eight goals in those eight games and three of them came in a friendly victory over Mexico. There’s certainly quality going forward, with the likes of captain Christine Sinclair and Manchester City’s Janine Beckie, but they have struggled to create and finish chances.The odds of getting out of the group stage are… favourable. Cameroon and New Zealand are must win games, and if we can deal with the Dutch duo of Miedema and Mertens defensively, then we’ll have a chance of topping the group. But only if we find our scoring boots.Our defensive qualities will get us… to the quarter-finals. A repeat performance of 2015 is on the cards. Being solid at the back can only take you so far. Jithvan AriyaratneWith a bit of luck… the semi-finals or even the final can be in reach. Last week’s 3-0 win over Australia has proven that Oranjeleeuwinnen can match any opponentI started playing football… when I was four years old. I was the only girl at a club with over 600 boys.In the summer of 2017… the streets were coloured orange. The women’s success at Euro 2017 was the definite breakthrough of the women’s game in the Netherlands. Suddenly the media couldn’t get enough of them. Maybe we have another extraordinary summer before us?Keep an eye out for… Netherlands’ attacking style. Danielle van de Donk can both create chances and finish them and Jackie Groenen captured the nation’s heart two years ago. She’s outstanding on the ball. SophiaFootball has… made some serious inroads in New Zealand in the last couple of years. It’s not all about rugby anymore.The Football Ferns will see this World Cup as… a hugely challenging tournament. Having to face Canada and the Netherlands in the group stage is cruel.What I like about this team is… its balance. There’s plenty of quality in the ranks. I’m picking them to get out of the group. But to do that we need to make sure Cameroon is not the only team we beat. Aaron AlexanderWe have… an outside chance of making the second round. Getting something against USA will be tough, but if the stars align for us we might get a draw against Sweden. Beating Thailand is possible, but they have a minor advantage of having won a World Cup game before. Four points should be our goal.The team looks… hungry. All the media attention is focused on the shenanigans of the men’s team prior to Copa America, so I think that has helped ease any pressure on the women’s team.The star of the team is… our goalkeeper Christiane Endler who plays for PSG. She will have some busy moments, but I hope we don’t see her too often. Alvaro ValenzuelaWe should… reach the second round without any problems. But the games in the knockout stages should be more evenly matched.A realistic ambition is… the quarter-finals. Then we’d have to squeeze past Germany or the USA. It will be interesting to see how we fare against them in the group game. That should give us an idea of where we are at.My local club IK Sirius… has been represented by both Sweden’s Nathalie Björn and Canada’s Allysha Chapman. It will be fun to watch them in France on the big stage. A shoutout to Brazil’s Marta too, who I hope bows out in style. David EkstrandOur squad depth… is unmatched by any other team. That’s why I believe the trophy will be ours again. I had the opportunity to be at the World Cup final in 2015 and it was the most amazing sporting event I’ve ever been too.All of the 23 team members… would start for any of the other nations in the tournament.Our defence is not… Fort Knox but they will still be a match for most attackers in the World Cup. Plus our offence will be incredible from start to finish.The shirt I bought for the tournament… has Julie Ertz’s name on the back. She’s a force to be reckoned with in midfield.

Such treatment was driven primarily by security requirements but Lyon’s Bronze is accustomed to the VIP treatment.Not that being acknowledged as the world’s best right-back is stress free. “There was no pressure at the last World Cup and that was enjoyable,” Bronze said. “Four years ago, when we got to Canada, Alex Scott was our first choice right-back and nobody knew who I was. Now, though, people have an expectation of me. But the great thing today is that I’m used to performing on the biggest stages.”She and Nikita Parris shone down the right flank as England deconstructed Scotland in an impressive first half before succumbing to a mixof fatigue and slight complacency in the heat of the second period. “It wasn’t the ideal performance but in the first half we played extremely well,” Bronze said. “But the second half has kept us on our toes, striving to improve – and you can’t ask for anything more than to win your first game in the tournament.“It felt really good to be out there. When I was younger I used to get a few nerves but not now – and the encouraging thing was we had a few young players who showed no nervousness. That’s encouraging.”The same could be said of her partnership with Parris, who operated wide on the right in Nice. It is a double act likely to be reprised at Lyon next season after the latter recently followed in Bronze’s footsteps and swapped Manchester City for the French champions.“Nikita can be as good as she wants to be, that’s the truth,” Bronze said. “She has all the attributes she needs to be one of the best strikers in the world, she has been showing that all season at City. She’s been prolific, she’s got an eye for goal, she’s tenacious and she has the speed and energy. We’ve got a really good partnership we enjoy playing together.”Phil Neville believes Jill Scott can continue playing until she celebrates her 40th birthday and maintains that one of the oldest but fittest players is “irreplaceable” at this World Cup.“Jill was sensational in the win against Scotland,” said England’s coach. “With her size, her quality, her energy up and down the pitch, she’s irreplaceable.”Scott shone in central midfield as Shelley Kerr’s side were beaten, playing a key role in suppressing the usually destructive influence of Kim Little and Caroline Weir. “Our game plan was about Jill getting up the pitch and robbing the opposition, which she did time and time again,” said Neville. “Weir and Little are Scotland’s best players and our pressing suffocated them really well.”At 32 Scott dictated such containment manoeuvres. “Jill can play until she’s 40,” said England’s coach.”Her and Lucy are always quickest on the bleep test and the other fitness tests we do. She never misses a single training session. If you ask her to drop out of one she goes mad at you. She’s built like a marathon runner, that’s why she’s so fit.Indeed the young Scott was a schoolgirl cross-country champion on her native Wearside before switching to football after joining Sunderland Ladies. Neville has no doubt she can continue to star for both England and Manchester City for some time to come.“Yes, there will have to be times when we rest Jill but her energy levels are frightening,” he said. “She is one of our best and she knows how to play the game that’s why she’s still got another two or three tournaments left with me. Nowadays 32 is a young age for a midfielder.”He senses his old Manchester United team-mate Roy Keane would have approved of Scott. “JIll’s a throwback to the days when players went down injured but got up without moaning,” said Neville. “She wins every tackle, every header, she slides into everything. She’s infectious, she’s got real quality and she’s a coach for me on the pitch.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33c95fa99b439ed1ac5ef2f7a75a71d5d71b8819/0_80_2480_1487/master/2480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=332c315c6f55d9e8682a36e06501ca6b","title":"daniel james manchester united swansea huge prospect","story":"Graham Potter is not the sort to get carried away but as the questions about Daniel James kept coming, and the realisation that everyone had witnessed something special started to sink in, even Swansea’s manager was sounding like an excited supporter. “There were a few instances, not just the goal,” said Potter, smiling, almost laughing, “and it’s just off-your-seat stuff, like ‘wow’.”It was February, FA Cup fifth-round day, and the best way to describe James that afternoon is unplayable. Three Brentford players were booked for bringing him down and Ezri Konsa received a red card for a professional foul on the Wales international, who was involved in three of Swansea’s four goals. Including that goal: 84yds covered in 8.48sec, with a ball at his feet, and three Brentford players trying, and desperately failing, to keep up.Although the Liberty Stadium was half empty on that Sunday afternoon, a much wider audience was taking note. The goal – six touches from the edge of his own penalty area to the back of the Brentford net – made him an internet hit. As for the football industry, Potter accepted there and then that, if James left in the summer, it would be for the Premier League.Incredibly James had been minutes away from joining another Championship club on loan less than three weeks earlier, in a deadline-day deal with Leeds that was described as ludicrous by some of those involved and would have led to Swansea picking up next to nothing until June. Swansea belatedly saw sense – Huw Jenkins, who would resign as chairman a few days later, was not alone in realising the plug needed to be pulled – and James returned to south Wales.At the time James was devastated. His family live in South Cave, in east Yorkshire, and playing for Leeds, who were chasing promotion under Marcelo Bielsa, was an attractive proposition. Little more than four months on James may well reflect that the collapse of that move was a blessing in disguise. There is, after all, no guarantee he would have gone on to turn in the sort of displays for Leeds that prompted Manchester United to part with £15m and make him their first signing of the summer.It was during the second half of the season at Swansea that James, with the Leeds fiasco pushed to the back of his mind and confidence flowing, really started to take his game to another level. The potential has always been there – James was a hugely promising Wales youth international when Swansea signed him from Hull as an academy player for £72,000 in 2014 – but getting an opportunity at first-team level took time and there were setbacks along the way.Less than two years ago James returned from a loan spell at Shrewsbury without kicking a ball. He had undergone a minor operation shortly before and, with that in mind, the move was probably not well-timed. Others close to James question whether he was suited to Paul Hurst’s style of football. Either way, it is hard not to smile at the headline on a Shropshire Star article in August 2017, shortly before James’s loan move came to a premature end: “Paul Hurst calls on Shrewsbury loanee Dan James to get up to speed”.That was not a problem last season in more ways than one. James, who had been mulling over joining Yeovil on loan in August, was told by Potter that he would get a chance at Swansea, and by October the youngster was starting to make a big impression, not least because of that breathtaking pace. He is not just lightning quick when he has space to run into but explosive from a standing start over short distances. Defenders never know whether to get tight or drop off.If that FA Cup tie against Brentford put James on the map, Stoke’s visit in April may well have taken him in the direction of Old Trafford. He scored another wonder goal that night – Ryan Giggs, the Wales manager, was applauding in the stand – and Stoke finished with nine men after two players were sent off for fouling James. Once again he was unplayable. “It was one of the best inidual performances I have ever seen as a fellow player,” Joe Allen, the Stoke and Wales midfielder, said this week.While James’s speed is something to behold, there is work to do to refine other areas of his game and United supporters may need to be patient in that respect. His finishing can be erratic – he scored six times last season for Swansea but could easily have ended up in double figures with a touch more conviction in front of goal – and the final ball was not always in keeping with what went before it. That said, there were clear signs of improvement towards the end of the season, particularly with his crossing, and it is also worth remembering that we are talking about a player who is only 21 and has made 42 appearances in senior football for club and country.In that sense it feels as though James has come a long way in a short time, yet the journey that takes place away from the limelight is overlooked by many, though not by everyone. When Swansea Under-23s travelled to Hull in February, shortly after that barnstorming performance against Brentford, Kevan and Elaine James turned up to thank the Welsh club’s coaching staff personally for the part they played in their son’s development – a nice touch.Sadly, desperately sadly, Kevan died suddenly last month, not long after the wheels for the transfer to Manchester United were set in motion. DJ, as he is known to his friends and teammates, posted a heartfelt message on his Instagram account a few days ago, describing his dad as his inspiration and promising to make him proud. Kevan was already that and more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6df95f17daa7b2b088a741b684c27a4ad139157b/0_147_2944_1766/master/2944.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a1592a15fdb5b53ad9aea7840ccbb52","title":"england spurs half fit harry kane nations champions league","story":"Club and country must ease the burden on the striker who was rushed back from injury for the Champions League final and then unnecessarily taken to PortugalWith one minute gone in England’s Nations League play-off game in Guimarães, Harry Kane did something brilliant. Jordan Pickford launched a hard, flat pass from his own six-yard box. Kane saw it coming, crept back along the line of the centre circle, then executed a kind of cushioned capoeira‑roundhouse layoff into the path of Jesse Lingard.Lingard waited a beat, scanning his options. Kane made the choice for him, surging on ahead, pointing where he wanted the ball, then dinking a brilliantly conceived back-spun chip over Switzerland’s Yann Sommer and on to the crossbar.It turned out to be something of a chimera. By the end of his 74 minutes on the pitch that sequence remained Kane’s only shot and two of his 29 touches of the ball. He played quite well in a deathly game. Even in his rust-caked post-injury mode Kane is an underrated passer, crosser and link man.But then his levels have remained very high. Even in a horribly interrupted 12 months since the World Cup Kane has three goals in seven England games, 22 in 39 overall, and should, aged 25, be coming into his career-defining pomp.Except there is of course an anxiety here, a feeling of something vital being drained. Kane is an unusually high-mileage, high-end centre-forward, a footballer who has been burning through his peak years with a zeal that borders on recklessness This is both a physical and a tactical issue. There have been five serious ankle injuries since the first in September 2016. The Transfermarkt website lists Kane as missing 184 days of football over those 33 months. Perhaps the greater regret is that it wasn’t more. Each time Kane limps away only to return ahead of time and looking sluggish when he does. So it goes on. Play, stop, rush, repeat.“Time to rest up and come back refreshed for next season,” Kane tweeted after England’s penalty shootout win, a standard player cliche that has a deeper resonance. For Kane this is a summer off that should have begun in May, a process of long-term recovery that would have benefitted from missing the Nations League and the Champions League final, neither of which gained much from his presence.These are vital months for the best English centre-forward of his era, not to mention a kind of jumping-off point. There are two points here. First is the fear of Rooney-drift. How many years, was it, that Wayne Rooney continued to wrestle his way around the England attack even in tangible physical decline? Partly owing to awe stasis, the class system in English football that makes celebrity and the idea of “respect” so hard to overcome and partly because of a dearth of talent elsewhere.England and unfit centre-forwards: it is a familiar tale from Keegan to Shearer to Owen. Kane seems to have fast-forwarded himself into this role ahead of time. Blink a few times and it’s not too hard to imagine him playing ponderously in midfield, taking the penalties and corners. Spare us, Gareth. Spare us the horror.Against this it has been part of England’s process of renewal to be agreeably ruthless. Right now Kane is the only real automatic pick left, the only player who gets in the team half-fit sole survivor of the tradition of the leader, legend, talisman, trench-dweller, chest‑beater that has blighted many a promising England era.It is to be hoped this policy is up for review. If only because there is plenty of evidence that Kane should not be a first choice if he’s not fit, a player for whom peak conditioning is utterly vital.The energy and running power Kane put on in the early Pochettino years have been the chief element in his transformation from a promising Championship loanee . At his best Kane has three main elements: great movement, crafty link play and the ability to score all kinds of goals. The last two of these all come directly from the first. Take away the movement and every other element is diminished. Kane stops being Superman and becomes the post-Kryptonite Clark Kent, energies drained, touchingly mortal.There is of course a team element to this as well. Speed is vital to the way the better teams attack, just as an England front three with Raheem Serling and Jadon Sancho on the flanks is so much more menacing without a clogging presence in the centre. England looked good with Marcus Rashford at centre-forward in the first half against the Netherlands in Guimarães. With Kane running narrower patterns in the second half the game came closing in, the Dutch defenders unafraid to play a high line and swarm around the ball.Similarly Tottenham would, with hindsight, have been better served using the speed and movement of Lucas Moura or Son Heung-min in the centre against Liverpool in the Champions League final. The return of a half-fit, single-furrow Kane had already coincided with their stumble in the spring, a period that saw Kane himself win only five of his last 14 games and fail to score in a league win since January.Kane will surely come again with time to heal and re-set. Almost exactly a year ago he was scoring his 19th goal for England in his 27th game en route to the World Cup Golden Boot, having scored 90 times in his last 97 games for club and country.But changes are needed. Tottenham must sign an adequate like-for-like replacement, or risk making Kane’s peak years the chief casualty of stadium-austerity. England, meanwhile, should resolve to play him only when fully fit.Ankles are particularly tender joints. Every strain takes a little more away, drains a little extra twang and snap and flex. There is a duty of care to fight this process, to dish up a few more of those peak years and to acknowledge the truth that a half-fit Kane is no more than half a Kane at best."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec0740db393df0349bddd35fdac209816e93a3ed/0_308_3648_2189/master/3648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=122b0a7194720fee92e846765aeb8b25","title":"e3 2019 biggest news xbox bethesda ubisoft nintendo square enix","story":"As day three of the E3 video game conference begins, here are the biggest stories from Xbox, Bethesda, Ubisoft, Square Enix and moreWe are in a transitional period for video games: new console technology is right around the corner, but most of the industry’s big players aren’t quite ready to show their cards. Sony has removed itself and the PlayStation from this year’s E3 conference, leaving Microsoft to take centre stage on the first day of this year’s event.Microsoft announced the next Xbox console, Project Scarlett, albeit with maddeningly few details beyond rather abstract technical specifications. It will be on sale towards the end of 2020, and forms one half of Microsoft’s video game strategy – the other half being a cloud-powered service that lets you play Xbox games anywhere, on any screen. Halo Infinite will be a Project Scarlett launch game – but will also be playable on Xbox One.At a Final Fantasy-themed concert, Square-Enix announced that a reimagined, modern-looking version of one of the best-loved Japanese games of all time, Final Fantasy VII Remake, will be out on 3 March 2020.Cyberpunk 2077 was one of the most-anticipated games going into this year’s E3, and developer CD Projekt Red capitalised by busting out Keanu Reeves to promote it at Microsoft’s Xbox press conference. The game is out on 16 April 2020 and Reeves plays a prominent character.Gears of War 5 also got a release date, 10 September 2019, alongside a mildly distressing new trailer showing protagonist Kait struggling to keep hold of her sanity.Speaking of Microsoft’s Xbox press conference, the company showed around 60 games in the course of 90 minutes. Among the most interesting-looking were Bleeding Edge, a competitive brawler from multi-Bafta-winning developer Ninja Theory Wasteland 3, a post-apocalyptic strategy role-playing game with a wicked sense of humour Microsoft Flight Simulator, an eerily realistic return to PC gaming roots a new Blair Witch horror game Spiritfarer, described as “a cosy management game about dying” Twelve Minutes from Annapurna Interactive, a thriller in which you get stuck in an infinite time loop after a romantic evening goes wrong and Way to the Woods, a game about magic deer set in a post-human world. Microsoft has also acquired Double Fine, a San Francisco studio known for its quirky adventures.Bethesda also announced two interesting new games: Deathloop (think Groundhog Day but action-themed) from the makers of Dishonored at Arkane, and Ghostwire: Tokyo, an intriguing Japanese horror adventure. Doom Eternal, the publisher’s big release this year, will be out on 22 November.We’ve had a first proper look at Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, a single-player Star Wars game from Respawn (makers of Titanfall). The footage has pretty much everything you’d want from a game based on the world’s most popular space opera: flashing lightsabers, a ginger Jedi, freedom of movement, Forest Whitaker and frequent flashes of humour.It was confirmed that George RR Martin and Dark Souls director Hidetaka Miyazaki are collaborating on a new FromSoftware game: Elden Ring. There’s been almost no actual information about it, but the trailer shows the same themes of flame and decay that have characterised Miyazaki’s other work, albeit in a much more western-fantasy-looking context. It’s certainly not as dark as Bloodborne.Ubisoft showed an impressive range of games at is conference on Monday, kicking off with Watch Dogs Legion – a futuristic dystopian crime game set in a totally broken post-Brexit London. You can take control of any Londoner, from grannies to teens, in an effort to build a resistance against the extremists, surveillance capitalists and corporations that have taken over. And you can hijack black cabs. This is being directed by Clint Hocking, of Far Cry 2 fame, so there’ll be no “but we’re not trying to say anything political!” nonsense from this. It looked really impressive, the first serious challenge to Grand Theft Auto in a while. It’s out March 6, 2020.Ubisoft also announced a new team sports game, Roller Champions, based on roller derby a new, beautiful-looking, Breath of the Wild-inspired mythological game from the creators of Assassin’s Creed, Gods and Monsters and the next Rainbow Six game, Quarantine, which will be a 3-player co-operative shooter where the enemy is a scary and little-understood pandemic.Square Enix’s closely-guarded big announcement was its new Avengers game, which is being developed in Canada. It’s both a single-player and a live multiplayer game, letting players take control of Captain America, Black Widow, Thor and Iron Man to indulge in superheroics together. The characters don’t bear the likenesses of the stars that portrayed them in the movies, and the plot is distinct from the Marvel cinematic universe. It’ll be out 15 May 2020.A big surprise from Square Enix’s conference was the news that we’re getting a Final Fantasy VIII remaster.

Her family’s shack was poorly lit and smelled of fumes. “Electricity was only for whites,” says Rasmeni, 37.This changed when the African National Congress took office in 1994 and began a sweeping programme of service delivery. Within a few years, Rasmeni’s neighbourhood in Khayelitsha, an informal settlement on the outskirts of Cape Town, had been hooked to the grid.“Everything,” Rasmeni recalls, “was so bright.”But now a series of price hikes by the national utility, plagued by corruption and mismanagement under the ANC, is making electricity unaffordable for many of South Africa’s people, pushing millions back into energy poverty, undermining more than two decades of progress and posing a range of health and safety risks.“We’re going backwards,” Rasmeni says, sitting outside the small shack where she now lives with her three children. “It’s like we’re living in the past.”The price hikes are part of an urgent strategy to revive the utility but have placed a growing burden on consumers, particularly those who cannot afford to supplement with renewable energy.“Failure at the macro level is deepening inequality,” says Lauren Hermanus, the founder of an energy consultancy called Adapt.“A privileged minority will be able to take care of themselves,” Hermanus adds. “People who can’t will be incapacitated.”“We are worried as a community,” says Thandiwe Nyaba, a single mother who works as an informal trader in Khayelitsha. “If this carries on we will use electricity for lights only.”Five years ago, she says, she could buy a month’s electricity for less than about £8. The same amount now lasts less than two weeks.High-voltage power lines cut through the area of Khayelitsha where she and Rasmeni live, a crowded section of government houses and shanties backing onto a national highway. Thinner cables, many of them illegal connections by shack dwellers, spider between the homes.Paraffin is one of the leading causes of poisoning among South African children and a severe fire hazard. Each year, thousands of people are left homeless by fires in informal settlements. A fire last December destroyed hundreds of houses just three kilometres from where Rasmeni lives.“If people are swapping to paraffin and open flames, inherently the risk will increase,” says Dr Richard Walls, head of the Fire Engineering Research Unit at Stellenbosch University.Two years ago, Rasmeni began using the fuel as she was no longer able to afford electricity for heating. Her youngest son, aged three, suffers from asthma, wheezing painfully when fumes fill the room. “It looks like he’s going to die,” says Rasmeni, who often rushes him to the nearest clinic for treatment.On a recent night they caught a taxi there but were turned away – crippling power outages, another symptom of Eskom’s malaise, had struck Khayelitsha.“We think of the electricity crisis purely as impacting business and the economy, but there are widespread impacts on people and their health,” says Dr Atiya Mosam fromWits University School of Public Health.“There’s two issues,” Mosam explains. “Paraffin and other fuels are harmful to communities, while having no electricity has other negative health consequences.”These ranged from power failures affecting patient care at hospitals to blackouts making neighbourhoods less safe at night, “increasing the burden of injury and violence”, Mosam says.“Energy is supposed to support socioeconomic development – if it isn’t, you have to reform the system,” says Jesse Burton, an energy researcher at the University of Cape Town. In May, the ANC won national elections, although suffered its worst-ever showing at the polls. South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has pledged to root out corruption and revive state enterprises like Eskom, but faces fierce opposition from a rival faction within his party.Rasmeni still remembers the 1994 elections, when her parents rose before dawn to vote. “They were voting for change,” she says, “and when electricity came we saw the change.”This year, for the first time, she chose not support the ANC. “You see how we’re living,” she says. “Why must I vote?”In her kitchen is a large electric oven that she has not used in two years. A two-burner gas stove is balanced on top of it. “I used to be able to bake or make roasts,” Rasmeni says, her gaze falling on the appliances. “It feels like being robbed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eaeb273c771bb0cbd63ec924f554023bf1d05484/0_239_5256_3154/master/5256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9a438186d2b650597fd2a96a6918abf","title":"ndas routinely used cover up mistreatment work mps say","story":"Commons report warns gagging orders allow unlawful behaviour to continueAllegations of unlawful discrimination and sexual harassment at work are being routinely covered up by employers through secret non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), a report by MPs has warned.The increasingly widespread practice enables perpetrators to carry on mistreating others and prevents victims from discovering or supporting other complaints, according to the Commons’ women and equalities committee.The MPs’ strongly worded report said difficulties in pursuing claims through employment tribunals – where legal aid financial thresholds have rendered legal advice largely unaffordable – meant staff often felt they had little choice but to reach a confidential settlement prohibiting them from speaking out.The use of NDAs to prevent those who have signed them from providing evidence to police inquiries or court proceedings was specifically condemned. “There is clearly potential for NDAs to be negotiated, drafted, andor enforced in ways which may amount to perverting the course of justice,” the report said.NDAs are legally drafted contracts under which employers usually agree to pay departing employees rather than resist a claim at a tribunal, meaning allegations of unlawful discrimination are subject to “routine cover-up” and not properly investigated, MPs said.Maria Miller, the Conservative former culture secretary who chairs the committee, said: “It is particularly worrying that secrecy about allegations of unlawful discrimination is being traded for things that employers should be providing as a matter of course, such as references and remedial action to tackle discrimination.“After signing an NDA, many iniduals find it difficult to work in the same sector again. Some suffer emotional and psychological damage as a result of their experiences, which can affect their ability to work and move on. There is also the financial penalty of losing a job and bringing a case against an employer.“Organisations have a duty of care to provide a safe place of work for their staff and that includes protection from unlawful discrimination.”The committee has urged the government to ensure NDAs cannot prevent legitimate discussion of allegations of unlawful discrimination or harassment and wants it to stop their use in covering up allegations of unlawful discrimination.Some witnesses told the committee NDAs allowed employees to move on with their life and career quickly and quietly, without the stress of going to tribunal. Others suggested confidential agreements delivered higher payments than might be awarded at a tribunal.Joeli Brearley, the founder of the organisation Pregnant Then Screwed, which supports mothers facing workplace discrimination, told MPs there was no incentive for employers to settle without confidentiality.Another problem the report highlighted was that online publication of tribunal judgments had increased the risk for claimants of being blacklisted by future employers. It suggested this was a significant barrier to potential claimants bringing discrimination claims.“We are particularly troubled by the suggestion that ethnic minorities may be disproportionately disadvantaged by the online reporting of tribunal judgments,” the report added.On legal advice, it said: “We are concerned by the lack of affordable legal advice available for employment discrimination cases … The government should review legal aid thresholds and monitor the effect of the changes it is making to improve access to legal aid.”The committee called on the government to begin a programme to raise awareness among employers and employees about how to handle grievances fairly and effectively, including signposting to relevant guidance and support.It also suggested ministers should consider requiring employers to investigate all discrimination and harassment complaints regardless of whether a settlement is reached.The report also called on the government to legislate to require employers to provide, as a minimum, a basic reference for any former employee confirming they worked for that employer and the dates of their employment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96624dfa687d87a05f16c5cd2fbc3a7468e1abe7/0_74_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73cdeb9f63cd2eafe0ab2a35ed9fc95a","title":"bbc confirms plans to make over 75s pay licence fee","story":"Three million households expected to lose right to free licence next June The BBC has confirmed plans to make most over-75s pay the TV licence fee, arguing that it is the only way to avoid closing channels and making substantial cutbacks.Millions of households will have to start paying £154.50 a year from June 2020 for the right to watch live television and access the BBC’s iPlayer service.Research from the House of Commons Library found that 3 million households would lose their free TV licence as a result of the decision. The BBC has said it will continue to provide TV licences to over-75s who can provide evidence that they claim pension credit, a means-tested benefit designed to help older people.However, up to 1.3 million families who are entitled to receive pension credit do not claim the benefit, according to official government figures, suggesting many poor households will be hit hard by the change.Charities including Age UK have said some elderly viewers will be pushed into relative poverty by the decision, with concerns over whether older viewers will be able or willing to prove they are receiving benefits. It is also likely to result in the criminal prosecution of elderly Britons who do not or are not able to pay.“It’s a massive hardship for millions of people,” said Claire Enders of Enders Analysis. “The really vulnerable won’t apply for this benefit – the disabled and lone females do not apply for benefits. And that will be true for this as well.”The policy of free TV licences for the over-75s was introduced in 1999 by the then Labour chancellor, Gordon Brown, with the cost met by the government, which paid the BBC to provide the service.However, in 2015 the Conservative government, guided by George Osborne, struck a deal under which the subsidy would be phased out by 2020, with the broadcaster having to shoulder the cost of free TV licences.The government later gave the BBC responsibility for deciding what to do about the benefit, meaning any unpopular decisions on charging over-75s had to be made by the BBC rather than ministers.A consultation was launched at the end of 2018, with the BBC arguing that many over-75s were increasingly wealthy and it could not afford the cost of providing them with a service for free.The corporation argued that the £745m annual cost of maintaining the status quo would have taken up a fifth of its budget, equal to the total amount it spends on all of BBC Two, BBC Three, BBC Four, the BBC News channel, CBBC and CBeebies. The BBC estimates that the new proposal will cost it £250m a year, requiring some cuts but no channel closures.The BBC director general, Tony Hall, said the decision to means test the free TV licence would protects those most in need, adding: “This has not been an easy decision. Whilst we know that pensioner incomes have improved since 2000, we also know that for some the TV licence is a lot of money.“I believe we have reached the fairest judgment after weighing up all the different arguments. It would not be right simply to abolish all free licences. Equally it would not be right to maintain it in perpetuity given the very profound impact that would have on many BBC services.”Hall also said the licence fee settlement should never again be agreed in secret. He said: “The last two settlements have been made in the dark and without proper consultation. It is vital that future decisions are evidence-based and made after proper consultation and scrutiny. We need to find a better way.”The BBC is battling to maintain its main source of funding while also remaining relevant to younger viewers. The average age of a BBC One viewer is now 60-plus, meaning many people who consume the broadcaster’s content are currently viewing it for free.Both the 2015 and 2017 Conservative manifestos pledged to maintain free TV licences for the over-75s, although the party has since dismissed the latter pledge as a mistake.The BBC decided to announce the change on a day when multiple Conservative leadership candidates formally launched their campaigns, turning the issue into a potential issue in the leadership race, as hopefuls compete for the votes of older Tory party members.The shadow culture secretary, Tom Watson, said he would continue to fight the decision, drawing comparisons with Boris Johnson’s proposed tax cuts for high earners.He said: “You cannot means test for social isolation.

Both my children work, so I am on my own all day. I have very poor balance thus cannot walk, and I no longer drive, so the TV is company for me. My hearing is poor so I cannot rely upon the radio. The combination of pictures and sound keep me in touch with what is going on in the world. When I began drawing my pension 33 years ago, I thought I had plenty. Over time my pension has not kept pace with inflation, so I have to be particularly frugal. I would probably have to say no to purchasing a TV licence. Evelyn, 98, WokingHaving reached the age of 75 last year it now looks like the benefit I derive from the free licence will be short-lived. Given the choices available to the BBC I think they have gone for a pragmatic least worst option. The real culprit here is the Tory government after its decision to load the BBC with the cost of the benefit created by Gordon Brown as one element in a government budget package intended to help those less able to provide for themselves.  is right to highlight the fact that while the government-initiated removal of the free TV licence is now going ahead, Boris Johnson is promising an increase in the higher-rate tax threshold to £80,000. You couldn’t make it up. Robert, 76, BuckinghamshireMy wife is old enough for us not to pay the licence fee but in June 2020 we will have to start paying. I believe this is the right decision for us as we can well afford to pay the fee as we both have index-linked pensions. It makes sense that only pensioners on pension credit should receive the benefit but I feel sorry for those pensioners whose income only just exceeds the pension credit limit and those who are entitled to pension credit but do not claim it. Every effort should be made to encourage those who are entitled to claim pension credit. Tom Misselbrook, 70, HerefordshireOf 37 countries surveyed in a 2017 OECD review it was reported that Britain was at the very bottom of the state pension league table. Pensioners, many of whom live in isolation, rely on television as their only contact with the outside world. Free TV licences for the over-75s must be retained as one part of a caring and compassionate social system. George Osborne’s decision to make the BBC responsible for what should clearly be a responsibility of government was, and remains, totally unjustifiable. The government must be made to accept that it cannot subcontract its social policies. Haydn Richard Watkins, 82, HampshireI am single, living on a fixed personal pension. This charge if introduced suddenly will only just be covered by the increase in my statutory state pension. Whilst accepting that the money has to come from somewhere, I do feel that the government has welshed on the original deal and at best should phase it in over a five-year period. James Underwood, 81, WiltshireI’m disgusted, to say the least, as the BBC programming is so much repeats that I rarely watch the BBC channels but I will still have to pay for licence. I like watching sport but the BBC is getting less coverage of sporting occasions, especially rugby. I am an 81-year-old widow, living alone. I live in a development of flats with neighbours of a similar age, and many residents are unable to go out, so TV is a lifeline. Those of us who have saved for our retirement are again being made to lose out.

Here she reveals the best tracksWith its urgent pace and aim to “make it to the border of Mexico”, Cross sums up the exhilaration of escape so essential to yacht. The power of the genre lies in the longing, so it’s most effective when heard in a landlocked location a million miles away from the nearest marina. Since aspiration crosses class, it doesn’t matter whether one’s home turf is the country club or a trailer park: listening to this song has the same effect – it nurses that ache for freedom.A YR hallmark is “upbeat-downbeat”: an approach that folds life’s bittersweet complexities within happy-snappy musical flourishes. A great example of upbeat-downbeat is this Doobie Brothers classic, showcasing the misplaced optimism of a wounded romantic. Singer Michael McDonald is in full fuzzy-throated throttle. Those are his BVs on Ride Like the Wind, and on any number of Steely Dan tracks, including …The frisson of yacht rock derives from its blend of bourgie feelgood bounce crossed with a shiver of thwarted desire. Steely Dan self-deprecatingly called their work “funked-up muzak” but, lyrically, there are none more acidic than these egghead jazzbos with tales of grown-up screw-ups. Thanks to LA’s session musician elite, Hey Nineteen is polished to a sheen, but the narrator’s regretful realisation that he is too old to mack on teenage girls makes for uneasy listening.Generally, female musicians didn’t focus their talents on the yacht genre: its palette was too limiting for the era’s sophisticated female artists beyond a song or two. In 1975, Mitchell made what’s considered “accidental yacht rock”. This chilly saga of tarnished love concerns a woman trapped in a big house and a loveless marriage. Mitchell made the misery of rich people seem glamorous, creating “dark yacht” in the process.By the time the 1980s rolled around, black musicians had reclaimed the surging soul and quiet storm of yacht that was rightfully theirs. Artists such as George Benson, Lionel Richie and Raydio raised the bar by turning this “funked-up muzak” into a dance party. Ironically, an anthem called Africa turned out to be helmed by a clump of the whitest dudes going. With its questing lyrics and triumphant chorus, it became a blockbuster smash for the ages, proving that yacht rock is for ever.I Can Go for That: The Smooth World of Yacht Rock begins Friday 14 June, 9pm, BBC Four"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/810bf175750ae8cd3981e454c3490d9f1c96423a/0_200_2969_1782/master/2969.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48f9b55f7daf3eff51e721d7d546389b","title":"philharmonia denoke salonen bittersweet metropolis weimar republic review","story":"Royal Festival Hall, LondonThe first of the Philharmonia’s Bittersweet polis events focused on Berg, Hindemith and Weill but felt like a banquet without a main courseFourteen years – that’s how long the Weimar republic lasted, yet that period of feverish cross-pollination between “high” and “low” art left an imprint that belies its brevity. Bittersweet polis, the Philharmonia’s new mini-series – Part 1 now, Part 2 in September – will touch on film and cabaret too, but its opening event was straightforwardly music-only. That’s unless you count the lighting scheme, which soaked the organ pipes on the back wall in washes of colour, from Valentine’s-card crimson to cool twilight blue – a low-key addition, but anything that introduces a sense of theatre to the standard concert-going experience has to be a good thing.Berg features strongly on the series programme – as does Hindemith, whose neo-classical Concerto for Orchestra followed in a 12-minute splurge of tricksy solos and fully flexed orchestral muscles. It was bracing, even if the performance lacked the last coat of varnish. The orchestra sounded more stylish in the Suite from Weill’s Threepenny Opera, with Jason Evans’s muted trumpet slouching impeccably through Mack the Knife too bad each movement lasted only a few minutes.• Weimar Berlin: Bittersweet polis season runs at the Southbank Centre, London, until 29 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4b6fe6bad95ff753b3ab03affc21cc38aea2599/68_219_3940_2364/master/3940.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b75aee4c6d68b44df341e04abe8c319a","title":"un ballo in maschera review opera holland park","story":"Holland Park theatre, LondonRodula Gaitanou’s finely sung and acted production reimagines Verdi’s opera as a noir-ish thriller with supernatural overtones The second production of Opera Holland Park’s season is an ingenious staging by Rodula Gaitanou of Verdi’s Un Ballo in Maschera. Updating the work to the 1940s, Gaitanou reimagines it as a noir-ish thriller with supernatural overtones, which, despite occasional eccentricities, carefully sustains the opera’s ambiguous mood of tragedy, irony, passion and wit.It opens in a fencing school, where the ceremonies of practice thinly disguise underlying violence, and Gustavo (Matteo Lippi) and his would-be assassins are initially indistinguishable amid the thrusts and parries of swordplay. Amelia (Anne-Sophie Duprels) has become an artist and sculptor, working on a bust of Lippi, while fending off the attentions he piles on her when her husband Anckarström’s (George von Bergen) back is turned. Her artwork, however, soon becomes a tacit reminder of the metaphysical forces that control the protagonists’ lives, since we later discover a portrait of Rosalind Plowright’s self-dramatising Arvidson on an easel in the Anckarströms’ house.Gaitanou’s deftness of touch falters a little in act two, however, which she sets not at the foot of the public gallows but in a creepy-looking hospital where Amelia has come for drug treatment in the hope of purging her unwanted feelings for Gustavo. It is splendidly sinister, but the medical imagery doesn’t quite square with the charnel-house atmosphere (“where crime and death are coupled”, as the libretto puts it) that Verdi was seeking here.The production is beautifully acted and sung. Lippi, warm and generous of tone, finely captures Gustavo’s charm, humour and fecklessness. Duprels sings with a formidable intensity that compensates for the occasional moment of shrillness in her upper registers. Von Bergen, meanwhile, delivers an entirely convincing portrait of a mild-mannered man slowly turning to violence after being broken by suspicions of his wife’s adultery. Plowright’s Arvidson, got up like Gloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard, is all frayed majesty and hauteur, while Alison Langer makes a fine Oscar, with her silvery tone and precise coloratura. Matthew Kofi Waldren, meanwhile, conducts with passion and sensitivity. The choral singing is outstanding.• In rep at Holland Park theatre, London, until 29 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16c038b3343f60a337d1919666693e9361c2fe32/0_81_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6fe1d01267831760d87ab5b86207dd6","title":"are peers asleep on the job investigating the house of lords podcast","story":"Investigative journalist David Pegg and data journalist Pamela Duncan have spent the last four months examining the House of Lords.

His comments were a direct counter to Corbyn, who had earlier called for MPs not to publicly attack staff or the shadow cabinet.That comment from Corbyn led several MPs to shout, “She’s sitting next to you” and point to shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, who was demoted from her usual slot standing in for Corbyn at PMQs after she criticised the party’s Brexit policy on election night.In his speech before the interventions, the Labour leader said the party must unite to take on the “dangerously damaging policies” of the Tory leadership candidates, including tax cuts that will benefit the richest, attacks on abortion rights, and a “race-to-the-bottom no-deal Brexit”.He said Labour was committed to working cross-party to stop no deal. “To break the Brexit deadlock, we need to go back to the people. Let the people decide the country’s future, either in a general election or through a public vote on any deal agreed by parliament,” he said.One Corbyn ally said they had been taken aback by the tone of the criticism. A Labour source called the meeting “robust”, but said it had not been worse than previous meetings.“Clearly, there are very strong feelings about Brexit and how it should be handled, both in the Labour party and the country – and among Labour MPs. That’s no secret at all,” the source said.“We are in a period of heightened polarisation on Brexit, and that is why Jeremy is trying to find a way that reflects our conference policy and that brings the country together. We are listening to the views of members and our MPs … The PLP is very passionate, and that’s what we would expect.”Corbyn’s comments about ending the criticism of staff were taken to refer to Karie Murphy, his chief of staff, who was criticised in leaked emails for her apparent handling of two harassment complaints, one against senior Labour aide David Prescott and another against Pete Willsman, a member of Labour’s ruling national executive committee who has since been suspended over allegations of antisemitism.Jess Phillips, the chair of the Women’s PLP, told the meeting the revelations were shameful. “If you abuse women in the Labour party and they’re a friend of yours, they get away with it,” she said, according to MPs in the room. Corbyn robustly denied that was the case, saying she should not have suggested that.MPs also expressed alarm that Corbyn’s opening speech failed to mention the investigation into antisemitism in the party that has been launched by the Equality and Human Rights Commission.The party’s handling of antisemitism cases was compared with the automatic expulsion of the former spin doctor Alastair Campbell for admitting he had voted Lib Dem in the European elections. Labour MP Wes Streeting suggested this was a double standard.Labour’s new Peterborough MP, Lisa Forbes, apologised to MPs at the meeting for liking Facebook posts that referred to “Zionist slavemasters”. But MPs including Margaret Hodge said Forbes had failed to address another aspect of the complaints, her signing of a letter criticising the adoption of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism.Forbes said she had written to Jewish community groups and hoped to meet the Board of Deputies and the Jewish Labour Movement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a1a2b055b76f404eb8f864584c655761b905f79/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a984937e3e0b51cf76351233151fc2a","title":"eu view of tory leadership candidates deeply critical say sources","story":"Boris Johnson viewed as Trump-like figure while Dominic Raab accused of ‘making things up’The EU has been on a Brexit break since the UK secured a six-month delay to its departure. With Theresa May soon to leave 10 Downing Street, Brussels is tuning in to the Westminster drama of the Tory leadership race – with both amazement and exasperation.“People in Brussels are fed up that the political class in the UK has gone a little bit crazy,” Jean-Claude Piris, a former head of the European council’s legal service said. British politicians seemed to have gone “on holiday”, since gaining the extension, he added.For the EU, the bookies’ favourite Boris Johnson, is a Trumpian figure whose disputed claims and bombastic rhetoric played a major role in plunging the UK into what is seen in Brussels as the Brexit nightmare.The former foreign secretary is remembered for his early 1990s stint as Brussels correspondent of the Daily , where he made his name mocking EU regulations, promoting what the European commission calls “Euromyths”. He achieved wider prominence for his claims during the EU referendum campaign. “He lied a lot to the British people,” said in 2016 the then French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, said in 2016.“The idea of Boris Johnson in the European council is probably quite abhorrent to some EU leaders,” an EU source said. “Boris is known in foreign policy circles, certainly not respected. He’s also seen as part of a wider Trump world and no one wants that.”The EU’s most senior civil servant, Martin Selmayr, once described a Johnson premiership as a “horror scenario”, classing him with Marine Le Pen and Donald Trump.Many EU insiders think the chances of no deal have increased, with the Tory party expected to choose a Brexiter prime minister.“For me it is very clear the odds of no-deal Brexit are more than half and clearly if Boris Johnson becomes prime minister the odds will go up again,” said Philippe Lamberts, a Belgian MEP and member of the European parliament’s Brexit steering group.Another favourite, Dominic Raab, is held in low-esteem in Brussels. During his four-month tenure as Brexit secretary, he lost trust of his EU counterparts. “He was seen to be working against his prime minister and making things up,” the first EU source said.The European commission recently accused Raab of making “fraudulent” claims and spreading “pure disinformation” in a campaign video about the views of its secretary-general, Selmayr, on the future of Ireland.Responding to unfavourable reports from Brussels, Raab told the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show that it “probably tells you that I was doing my job in terms of pressing them hard and making sure that Britain’s interests were resolutely defended”.Candidates deemed compromise choices at Westminster have also inspired mistrust in Brussels. The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is reported to have struck a different tone on Brexit with his EU counterparts than the public stance he takes in the UK. “He gave a very different impression than what he is suggesting now,” an EU diplomat said. More recently, Hunt has toned down his views on no deal, warning it would be “political suicide”.EU officials expect Tory candidates will be falling over themselves to prove their hard-Brexit credentials, following the party’s poor showing in the European elections, where just four of its MEPs were elected and Nigel Farage’s Brexit party won the most votes. “The Tory party will be in survival mode and … will have to regain credibility as the party of Brexit,” another EU source said.The environment secretary is to pitch himself as a “unity candidate” capable of attracting leavers and remainers, as he formally declared his candidacy saying: “I believe that I’m ready to unite the Conservative and Unionist party, ready to deliver\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspand ready to lead this great country.” But robust Brexiters in particular dislike the fact that he stayed loyal even in the final days of the crumbling May regime.The health secretary remains a relative outsider, but the longer the race goes on, the more he gains ground for the seemingly basic virtues of\u0026nbspbeing apparently competent\u0026nbspand broadly similar to a normal human being, albeit a particularly energetic one. A concerted effort\u0026nbspwould probably require\u0026nbspan image consultant.The former immigration minister and chief whip\u0026nbsp was behind the controversial \u0027go-home\u0027 vans when working under Theresa May at the Home Office.

But even with her staunch Brexiter tendencies, she would be seen as an outsider.The former work and pensions secretary, who\u0026nbspquit last year\u0026nbspover May’s Brexit plans, has\u0026nbsplaunched her own\u0026nbspin-party campaign groupleadership vehicle called Blue Collar Conservatism, promising to make the party more amenable to voters in deprived communities – mainly through a promise to deliver a strong Brexit and policies such as erting much of the foreign aid budget to schools and police.Few things say “would-be leader in waiting” like a kitchen photoshoot with your spouse, and the former Brexit secretary duly obliged\u0026nbspwith this imageawash with tasteful pastel hues. He formally launched his bid\u0026nbspin the Mail on Sunday. Among the more core constituency of Conservative MPs, Raab has been pushing hard, as has his semi-official\u0026nbsp“Ready for Raab”\u0026nbspTwitter feed.The cabinet’s most recent arrival – Mordaunt’s promotion to defence led to Stewart becoming international development secretary – certainly has the necessary\u0026nbspambition and self-belief, plus a privileged if unorthodox backstory covering Eton, Oxford, a senior role in postwar Iraq and a bestselling book about walking across Afghanistan. He remains an outsider, not least because of his remain tendencies and slightly 2010 view of compassionate Conservatism. He\u0027s become a social media darling and been endorsed by Ken Clarke, but his reputation as \u0027Florence of Belgravia\u0027 may hinder him.For many, the leadership race is an unedifying fight for power, while the clock ticks down remorselessly to Brexit day on 31 October.More governments are coming round to the tough position of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who argued against a long extension on the grounds that Brexit would become a damaging and distracting burden for the EU.Donald Tusk, the European council president, helped persuade member states to back a longer extension, which he urged the UK not to waste.“We were definitely on the other side of Macron,” the diplomat recalled. “Now I think Macron was right. We were wrong. Tusk was wrong.”Asked about the Tory contest last month, Tusk said there was “nothing promising” in “the state of affairs in London”.Many in the EU would support an extension for what is known in Brussels as “a democratic event”, meaning a general election or a second referendum.Without that, Piris thinks EU leaders could say no to a further extension. “But even if they say yes. What would happen? There is an inability to solve this question in the House of Commons.”He stresses the Brexit conundrum is not down to an inidual Tory leader. “It is a question of the political system of the UK being unable to answer to such a unique event in the life of the nation.”Lamberts warns that nothing will change for May’s successor, as the EU will refuse to reopen the withdrawal agreement, including the Irish backstop. “Anyone who steps into Downing Street will face exactly the same constraints. Saying you want to renegotiate this agreement is nice and well, but it won’t happen,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a91b41c7d3b317a7bd340782b3990f1aae1d6167/564_194_2659_1596/master/2659.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2d3605954bfc950e5a76d28eb2a7ec6","title":"matt hancock refuses to rule out staying in eu after 31 october","story":"Tory leadership candidate says rivals making false promises as MPs will block no-deal BrexitThe Conservative leadership challenger, Matt Hancock, has refused to rule out extending Britain’s membership of the EU beyond October, but insisted he could secure a time limit to the backstop from the EU that would pass parliament.The health secretary said his rival candidates who had pledged to leave – deal or no deal – by 31 October were making false promises because parliament would block any no-deal departure.He said the outcome would be a general election, which would be a “catastrophe for my party and extremely damaging for the country”.Hancock claimed his plan for renegotiation was detailed, “unlike some of the other candidates”, and would involve first putting a deal to parliament that included a backstop with a time limit, to prove to the EU27 that it could pass.

But even with her staunch Brexiter tendencies, she would be seen as an outsider.The former work and pensions secretary, who\u0026nbspquit last year\u0026nbspover May’s Brexit plans, has\u0026nbsplaunched her own\u0026nbspin-party campaign groupleadership vehicle called Blue Collar Conservatism, promising to make the party more amenable to voters in deprived communities – mainly through a promise to deliver a strong Brexit and policies such as erting much of the foreign aid budget to schools and police.Few things say “would-be leader in waiting” like a kitchen photoshoot with your spouse, and the former Brexit secretary duly obliged\u0026nbspwith this imageawash with tasteful pastel hues. He formally launched his bid\u0026nbspin the Mail on Sunday. Among the more core constituency of Conservative MPs, Raab has been pushing hard, as has his semi-official\u0026nbsp“Ready for Raab”\u0026nbspTwitter feed.The cabinet’s most recent arrival – Mordaunt’s promotion to defence led to Stewart becoming international development secretary – certainly has the necessary\u0026nbspambition and self-belief, plus a privileged if unorthodox backstory covering Eton, Oxford, a senior role in postwar Iraq and a bestselling book about walking across Afghanistan. He remains an outsider, not least because of his remain tendencies and slightly 2010 view of compassionate Conservatism. He\u0027s become a social media darling and been endorsed by Ken Clarke, but his reputation as \u0027Florence of Belgravia\u0027 may hinder him.Hancock told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme his plan had the support of David Lidington, the de facto deputy prime minister, and that Brussels was open to the change.“It is eminently deliverable by 31 October. Once you have a majority in the House of Commons things can move quickly,” he said. “This isn’t about opening the whole withdrawal agreement – this is about a time limit on the backstop. The EU have the opportunity at the October European council to agree to that addendum.”Hancock repeatedly argued that Brussels would concede despite its previous position. “They nearly proposed a time limit on the backstop before but they didn’t think the prime minister would be able to get it through the House of Commons. That’s why it’s important to show you can,” he said.Three more leadership candidates will launch their campaigns on Tuesday: Rory Stewart, Andrea Leadsom and Mark Harper. The final two, Boris Johnson and Sajid Javid, will launch theirs on Wednesday, before the first round of voting by Tory MPs on Thursday.Leadsom, the former leader of the house, will present herself as an “optimistic yet realistic Brexiteer” who would pursue a “managed exit” from the EU, involving leaving with no deal but with some small side deals in place to prevent disruption – an option the EU has explicitly ruled out.She will also promise to declare a climate emergency and a major expansion in housebuilding. “Our party has thrived in the past when it has governed as a champion of the people, providing freedom of choice and opportunity, a strong economy and global leadership,” she will say at her launch.Harper, the former chief whip, is expected to present himself as a clean skin who has not served in the Theresa May administration.Although he has said he will not rule out a no-deal Brexit, like Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt, he has said he will not be bound by the 31 October deadline, after which both Johnson and Dominic Raab have said the UK will leave with or without a deal.At his launch, Harper will say that functioning government “can only be enforced by someone who hasn’t been party to what has been called the ‘worst example of ill-discipline in cabinet in British political history’.”All 10 candidates will take part in private hustings the vote, with the first round taking place on Tuesday night.Overnight, Stewart accused some of his rivals – including Johnson, Javid, Raab, Gove and Hunt – of reckless tax and spending offers totalling £84bn which he said risked undermining the party’s reputation.“We simply cannot make spending and tax cut promises that we can’t keep,” he said. “We cannot criticise Jeremy Corbyn for reckless spending pledges if we start doing the same ourselves. Cheap electoral bribes could cost us dear.”Stewart’s campaign said Raab had pledged £38.2bn in tax cuts, including raising the national insurance threshold, scrapping stamp duty on homes under £500,000, and a 5p cut in the basic rate of income tax. Johnson’s widely criticised plan to cut the taxes of higher earners was said to cost £14.1bn.Johnson’s pledge came under fire from Gove, who said the “one thing I will never do as prime minister is to use our tax and benefits system to give the already wealthy another tax cut”. He also used his leadership launch to tease Johnson about his withdrawal from the contest in 2016.On Tuesday, the former defence secretary Michael Fallon, who has endorsed Johnson, said he hoped the contest would not focus on personalities.“We’ve all got to work together afterwards. There’s a wide range of candidates but I hope we can agree to leave some of the personal stuff out of this … in the end we have all got to rally round, support the new prime minister, bring the party together again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c294f6f3798076dde740139dcdaa4fa20b5b6196/0_294_3797_2277/master/3797.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=695499495592c8dfab75a1b3851cb7cf","title":"tory leadership campaigns hancock claims early commons brexit vote could lead to eu offering backstop concessions live news","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including three more Tory leadership candidates launching their candidatesScotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon is in Brussels this morning for meetings with Jean-Claude Juncker and Michel Barnier after making a speech at the European Policy Centre in which she will insists that the people of Scotland have “shown that they comprehensively reject Brexit and want to remain as a European nation” according to their voting in the recent EU elections.The  reports this morning that Jeremy Hunt has refused to provide Foreign Office support for Sturgeon’s visit, because of concerns that she will be using to trip to promote Scottish independence. Scottish government sources this morning have downplayed the story, suggesting it has more to do with Hunt’s Tory leadership bid and pointing out that they have their own officials in Brussels to facilitate meetings.Regardless, the manner in which Sturgeon is received in Brussels will be interesting to note: it is certainly the case that, since the UK’s referendum, the tone in which Scotland - and the prospect of Scottish independence and subsequent re-joining of the EU – has softened. Significantly, the Spanish government has said it would not veto a fresh application from an independent Scotland – it was adamantly against it during the 2014 independence referendum, no doubt with an eye to its own internal tensions over Catalonia. Sturgeon herself is known to be highly respected for her stance since the referendum.Q: What would you say to persuade Dominic Raab to call himself a feminist?I will post a summary soon.Q: What lessons did you learn from your unsuccessful run in 2016?Leadsom says she did not see it as unsuccessful. She came second.If she makes it into the final two this time, she definitely will not withdraw.As for lessons, she says she has learnt to stay positive, to put the country first and to never say “as a mother”.Q: You wil need at least 16 MPs backing you to get beyond the first found of voting. If you only have 16 MPs, will you back out?Leadsom says, of all the candidates, she is the one who will not be withdrawing in any circumstances.Leadsom says she is not proposing a no-deal Brexit. She is proposing a managed no-deal.But planning for no-deal, the government can minimise disruption, she says.Q: A lot of the Brexiters who backed you in 2016 are not supporting you now. So why should people back your campaign?Leadsom says she is a candidate with a workable plan.Leadsom is now taking questions.Q: Would you cut taxes?Leadsom says the government already has a series of statutory instruments on the books that it cannot get through the Commons because they would raise charges.So tax reform is not possible in this parliament, she says. She says she is a low-tax Tory, but tax changes would have to wait until after a general election, she says.Leadsom says her ambition if for everyone in “our great country” being able to fulfil their potential.She says she is offering herself as an optimistic but realistic Brexiter, with a range of transformative policy ideas.Leadsom says she went to a state grammar school. The head had high expectations of the girls. Her ambition to become an MP was encouraged by the school. She organised a debate on the importance of the nuclear deterrent.Leadsom says she worked in finance for 25 years. That taught her that you can find the very best and the very worst in capitalism.She saw how reckless borrowing led to the financial crisis.This gave her the realism and cynicism that taught her the need for regulation.Leadsom says she wants to explain who she is.Whens she was four, her parents orced. For the next four years her mum brought up her alone. She says there was no help for single parents then. That taught her how important state help can be.Leadsom says she would appoint a police chief to address the knife crime problem, reporting directly to the home secretary.She says more money for schools and policing would be her top priorities in the spending review.Leadsom says recognising the “climate emergency” would be a priority for her.As PM, she would set up a unit to chart a path towards a zero-carbon future.She says she wants more people to be able to keep more of their income.On housing, she says she wants to tackle high rents, and enable an “explosion” of self-build homes.She says she would set up a cross-party commission to come up with proposals on social care, to take the party politics out of this issue.She says families need more support. There would be more help in the first 1,000 days.And she would pilot the local provision of holiday meals for children who go hungry during the school holidays.Leadsom says our democracy underpins faith in politics. So we have to restore faith in democracy, she says.She says extraordinary opportunities are opening up to people.To unite the country, we need to show a compassionate vision, and play a leading role on the world stage.Andrea Leadsom is speaking at her leadership launch now.She says the UK has a bright future outside the EU. It needs a leader who is decisive, but compassionate, she says.She says leaving by 31 October is, for her, a “hard red line”.Other issues have not received the attention they deserve because of Brexit, she says.It was uncomfortable at times, she says. But she stayed because she thought it was the right thing to do.And she was able to get things done as leader of the Commons - addressing bullying, Palace of Westminster restoration, and tackling John Bercow, the Commons Speaker.(Eh? It is not clear what Leadsom is referring to. She has had plenty of rows with Bercow, but done nothing to constrain his power, which he is exercising more pro-actively than any Speaker in modern times.)More from the Leadsom launch.Andrea Leadsom, the Brexiter former Commons leader, does not seem to be expecting a huge crowd at her launch, PoliticsHome’s John Johnston reports.Good morning. We have got three more Conservative leadership candidates making formal campaign launches today, although all three are very much longshot candidates: Andrea Leadsom, Mark Harper and Rory Stewart. But, first, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, who launched yesterday, has been doing interviews this morning giving details of his plan to deliver Brexit. An early Commons vote would be crucial, he told the Today programme.Hancock said that he expected the new prime minister to be “tested” in the Commons in the final week of July. If he was Tory leader, he would hold a vote on his Brexit plan, he said.The new prime minister is in place by 22 July. As prime minister I would propose to put my plan, which I have already published, to the House of Commons, in principle, immediately and therefore show the European Union that this plan is deliverable through the House of Commons.That’s in principle. There’s a whole load of legislation that needs to follow, but we need that once you have a majority in the House of Commons, things can move quickly. After all, the legislation to stop no-deal last time went through in a week.Hancock said getting the Commons to vote in favour of his plan would be crucial to unlocking an agreement from Brussels. When it was put to him that the EU would not accept limits to the backstop, he rejected this.Not true. They have said that they are open to changes to the political declaration, which is about the future. And they nearly proposed a time limit on the backstop before but they didn’t think that the prime minister, Theresa May, would be able to get it through the House of Commons.This is why it is important to show that you can get it through the House of Commons in principle, and therefore open up the European Union to turning ... already their legal position is the backstop has to be temporary - what I am requesting of them is that they turn that into a longstop. And that is deliverable.Do you know why? Go to motive. How do you successfully negotiate? You successfully negotiate by understanding the motives on the other side. And on the other side the motivation for us to leave by 31 October, so that Brexit doesn’t in their view cast over into their new commission - that incentive is strong.Hancock has been described as having the most realistic Brexit plan of all the more prominent candidates, although that is quite a low bar. But readers will remember that a Commons vote in favour of the Brady amendment did not help Theresa May unlock a deal in Brussels. Later we may get some response from the EU, because Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, is speaking at a Politico Europe event.Here is the agenda for the day.8.30am: Theresa May chairs a political cabinet. At 9.30am there will be a normal cabinet meeting.9.30am: Andrea Leadsom, the former Commons leader, launches her leadership campaign.10.30am: Mark Harper launches his campaign.3pm: The Conservative 1922 Committee holds its first hustings, in private. The candidates speaking today are, in order: Michael Gove, Jeremy Hunt, Dominic Raab, Harper, Leadsom and Sajid Javid.3pm: Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, speaks at a live event with Politico Europe’s Florian Eder. There is a live stream here.5.30pm: Rory Stewart launches his campaign at a rally.Also, Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, is in Brussels today where she is meeting EU leaders and giving a speech.

Never in the history of cricket had it happened thrice in a single week but increasingly high-scoring has come to seem commonplace, assisted by powerplays, fielding restrictions, multiple new balls and countless technical and physical improvements and innovations.In 1,322 ODI innings in the 20 years following the first ODI in January 1971, despite many of them lasting 60 or 55 overs, the score of 300 was reached only 22 times (that is once every 60 innings) by the time the sun set on 11 May, and despite none of them lasting more than 50 overs, there had been 24 scores of 300-plus in 2019 at a rate of one in five.The transformation of the one-day game has been long and meandering but the search for the first ODI of the recognisably modern style, the very first game in which runs were scored at the kind of rate that was once considered superhuman and is now considered almost quotidian, is not impossible. The surprise is that even in a sport as obsessed with precedent and history as cricket, the game that best fits the bill has been practically forgotten.Even at the time nobody took much notice. It must have seemed like a wild anomaly, the last fixture of Sri Lanka’s 1986-87 tour of India and so perhaps explicable as a few demob-happy sportsmen getting out of hand at Mumbai. When India Today published a summary of the tour at the end of January 1987 its final game was not even mentioned, the entire series dismissed as an experience that “could at best be regarded as batting and bowling practice for the Indians”.When Reuters, in its report on the match, sought an adjective to describe Sri Lanka’s run chase the best it could come up with was “gallant”, while Wisden went with “brave”. This was after the team became the third in the history of ODI cricket, after West Indies’ wild thrashing of India in Jamshedpur in 1983 and the Indians themselves that very morning, to score at seven-an-over-or-above across an innings lasting more than 30 overs, and the first to do it batting second (something that next happened in 1997, and then again in 2006).India would have to wait another nine years before they first scored 300 or more off 50 overs that day they scored 299 off 40. In the four previous ODIs in the series 1,357 runs had been scored at 4.40 an over in the final fixture 588 runs were scored at 7.35, with Sri Lanka making 289 for seven off their 40.This was the first game in the history of ODI cricket in which two teams batted their full allocation of overs while scoring a run a ball or more. At that point the only vaguely comparable matches were India’s in Lahore on New Year’s Eve 1982, which was rained off after the 27th over of India’s innings, Pakistan’s against New Zealand in Faisalabad in November 1984, which was turned into the first Twenty20 international because of a morning downpour, and England’s against India in January 1985, the first international cricket match in Chandigarh and a game that would probably have been cancelled due to an overnight thunderstorm were it not for the fact that – in the words of the ’s Matthew Engel – “a total abandonment in conditions that had improved into bright sunshine would probably have caused a riot, and the teams knew what was good for them”.They got 15 overs each and “the game that resulted was inevitably one of slogs, snicks and leg-byes, with little dignity and less art cricket for people who do not like cricket much”.With Indian attention turning to the imminent visit by Pakistan, whose first ODI was 10 days away, everyone seemed too busy to notice that history was being played out in front of them. They saw a first one-day century from the 23-year-old Mohammad Azharuddin (like his second and his third, he got 108). It was the second time an Indian had scored a century at more than a run a ball, after Kapil Dev’s unbeaten 175 against Zimbabwe at the 1983 World Cup, when India were on their way to the trophy and Zimbabwe, having beaten Australia in their first game, were engaged in what amounted to little more than an extended victory lap.Kris Srikkanth’s 27-ball 46 was the first innings by an Indian opener at a strike rate above 150 (the next eight entries on the list are all Sachin Tendulkar). Sri Lanka’s Roshan Mahanama was 20 years old, 12 games into a 213-match ODI career and had never scored more than 26 runs, or any total at more than a run a ball by the time he was run out at Mumbai he had smashed 98 off 91 (though India won, Mahanama was the man of the match).Asanka Gurusinha was 21, playing the 14th of this 147 ODIs, and hit 52 off 34 balls at a strike rate of 152.94, an innings without equal in his career (he averaged a strike rate of 60.88, rising to 73.62 when he scored 50 or more). Kapil Dev, bowling off a shortened run-up and at reduced pace with his thigh strapped, went at 7.55 an over, the fourth-worst figures of his 225-game ODI career (in terms of economy it was also Madan Lal’s second-worst display, Ashantha de Mel’s second-worst and Ravi Ratnayeke’s fourth-worst the spinner Shivlal Yadav, nine days before his 30th birthday, went at 7.40 an over and never played another ODI such was the chaos that the Sri Lanka spinner Don Anurasiri never bowled at all).With Sri Lanka 34 runs from victory and on course to achieve it, De Mel was bowled by Kapil, bringing Ravi Ratnayeke out to partner the unrelated Rumesh Ratnayake, and Ravi’s puzzlingly pedestrian contribution of five runs off 11 balls proved decisive. The tourists ran out of time still 11 runs from victory. Despite Ravi’s efforts this was the only time in the 20th century that both teams in a match of 40 or more overs had ended their innings with a run rate above seven (by contrast, it happened four times in England matches between the start of 2019 and the start of the World Cup). The game’s place in history was secure, even if its place in memory, it seems, was not.• This is an extract taken from the Spin, the ’s weekly cricket email.

No one was expecting her to speak out like that.” One Labour MP’s response after Marie Rimmer, an ally of Jeremy Corbyn, was among those tearing into their leader last night. “People who worked with you for years are turning away from us,” Rimmer told Corbyn, as MPs aired grievances over harassment complaints in the party, the European elections, antisemitism and Brexit. She declared that “the leadership is not there” on the party’s Brexit policy. One MP said afterwards it had been Corbyn’s “worst meeting in his time as leader”. Corbyn had opened the meeting by telling his parliamentary party: “To break the Brexit deadlock, we need to go back to the people. Let the people decide the country’s future, either in a general election or through a public vote on any deal agreed by parliament.”In the Tory leadership race, Andrea Leadsom, Mark Harper and Rory Stewart are due to launch their campaigns today. Contenders have continued to set out their stalls but as far as the frontrunners go, Brussels doesn’t like what it sees. Michael Gove has sought to rescue his campaign from the controversy over his cocaine admissions, declaring he hopes to go down to the line against Boris Johnson while Jeremy Hunt has pitched himself as the only one “serious” enough to deliver Brexit and run Britain.Postcard lead in cold case – Detectives investigating the murder 35 years ago of Shelley Morgan, 33, outside Bristol have appealed for information about two old postcards of beauty spots. Morgan disappeared on 11 June 1984 after heading towards Leigh Woods to sketch and take photographs. Children found her body that October in a wooded copse in Backwell Hill. The body had stab wounds and there was evidence the attack was sexually motivated.The tear-off postcards are from a calendar sold by a Bristol hospice charity in the 1980s or 1990s. One shows a view of the river Avon from near the woods where Morgan had been heading the second is the view of a church from Backwell Hill. Avon and Somerset police say they cannot spell out how they may fit in with the investigation.Silent mistreatment – Allegations of unlawful discrimination and sexual harassment at work are being covered up by employers through secret non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) that allow bosses to go on mistreating others, MPs have warned. Their report says it can amount to perverting the course of justice, and that legal aid financial thresholds mean staff often feel they have little choice but to reach a confidential settlement. Joeli Brearley, the founder of the organisation Pregnant Then Screwed, which supports mothers facing workplace discrimination, told MPs there was no incentive for employers to settle unless they received confidentiality. The Commons’ women and equalities committee has called for MPs to take action. “After signing an NDA, many iniduals find it difficult to work in the same sector again … There is also the financial penalty of losing a job and bringing a case against an employer.”Vatican gender missive – A backlash has begun after the Vatican launched into the debate on gender ideology, publishing a document called “Male and female he created them” and citing what it calls “an educational crisis”. The document notes “challenges” rising from gender theory which “denies the difference and reciprocity in nature of a man and a woman and envisages a society without sexual differences, thereby eliminating the anthropological basis of the family”. It is to be distributed internationally across the Catholic educational system.Forever fashions – The Briefing owns this one unkillable Dickies shirt that has been a faithful companion on impromptu dinner outings since the year 2004.

Stock photograph: ReutersMore than 570 plant species have disappeared in the past 250 years - twice the number of birds, mammals and amphibians recorded as extinct, a new study has found.Scientists at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and Stockholm University carried out a global analysis of plant extinction records to come up with the figure.The research, published in the journal Nature, Ecology \u0026amp Evolution, brought together data from fieldwork, literature and herbarium specimens to show how many plant species have gone extinct, what they are, where they have disappeared from and what lessons can be learned to stop future extinction.The study found that 571 plant species have disappeared in the last 250 years - four times more than the current listing of extinct plants.The figure is also more than twice the number of bird, mammal and amphibian species recorded as extinct - a combined total of 217.Dr Aelys M Humphreys, assistant professor at the Department of Ecology, Environment and Plant Sciences at Stockholm University, said: “Most people can name a mammal or bird that has become extinct in recent centuries, but few can name an extinct plant.“This study is the first time we have an overview of what plants have already become extinct, where they have disappeared from, and how quickly this is happening.“We hear a lot about the number of species facing extinction, but these figures are for plants that we’ve already lost, so provide an unprecedented window into plant extinction in modern times.”The scientists found that plant extinction is happening as much as 500 times faster than ‘natural’ background rates of extinction - the normal rate of loss in earth’s history before human intervention.The scientists found the highest rates of plant extinction to be on islands, in the tropics and in areas with a Mediterranean climate.DestructionThe research suggested that the increase in plant extinction rates could be due to the same factors that are documented as threats to many surviving plants - change of land use resulting in the fragmentation and destruction of native vegetation, particularly range-restricted species.Dr Eimear Nic Lughadha, co-author and conservation scientist at Kew, said: “Plants underpin all life on earth, they provide the oxygen we breathe and the food we eat, as well as making up the backbone of the world’s ecosystems — so plant extinction is bad news for all species.“This new understanding of plant extinction will help us predict (and try to prevent) future extinctions of plants, as well as other organisms.“Millions of other species depend on plants for their survival, humans included, so knowing which plants we are losing and from where will feed back into conservation programmes targeting other organisms as well.”Plants species which have disappeared include the Chile sandalwood, a tree that grew on the Juan Fernandez Islands between Chile and Easter island, and was heavily exploited for its scent.Another is the St Helena olive, first discovered in 1805 on the island of St Helena in the South Atlantic.One lone elderly tree survived until 1994 and two more were propagated from cuttings, but they succumbed to a termite attack and fungal infections in 2003. -

Image: iStock.Clare County Council is seeking to rejuvenate the visitor facilities at the Cliffs of Moher which it says are “rather overwhelmed” by the numbers arriving at peak times.The council said the Cliffs of Moher Visitor Experience, which opened 12 years ago at a cost of €30 million, now “strains to be fit for purpose” and is at capacity between February and the end of October. It said the infrastructure and arrival facilities at the current centre, which is largely underground, were originally designed to accommodate 400,000 visitors a year but now the numbers arriving has risen to 1.5 million a year and is projected to rise to almost 2 million a year by 2025.It said the visitor centre - made up of retail, caférestaurant and interpretative facilities - “is a victim of its own success”.“The existing systems are now sub- standard and make increasingly difficult the delivery of a world class visitor experience,” a tender document states. In the document, the council says visitors to the current centre “are put off by queues at all service points, toilets and restaurant. “At times visitors may not be able to gain entry to the visitor centre due to the crowds.”The council is seeking consultants to prepare a masterplan for the visitor centre.“The challenge is to deliver a world class visitor experience utilising best practice visitor management and environmental management principles to ensure the future of the natural assets is safeguarded and conserved as well as minimizing any adverse effects on the quality of life for those who live in the area,” the tender documents state.

Photograph: Constantina PeppaReutersThe hefty vote for opposition party New Democracy (ND) in Greece’s local and European polls has precipitated a general election scheduled for July 7th. It had been anticipated for some months, as the government of Alexis Tsipras’s Syriza inevitably lost support in the face of continuing austerity.But austerity is not the only issue on which the campaign will be fought. There are subliminal as well as obvious topics aggravating both the state and its electorate, with more than 500,000 new voters, including 100,000 17-year-olds.In addition to the economy, international issues will feature. The North Macedonia name deal reached earlier this year, ongoing relations with Balkan neighbours, and Greece’s place in an EU increasingly disturbed by populism and nationalism are all matters for a discriminating electorate. With Albania and North Macedonia poised to begin EU accession talks, and Turkey’s chances diminishing, Europe’s southeast, with Greece as its most significant region, is a hot potato.More likely, we will hear empty rhetoric from all sides, half-truths, insinuations, and meaningless slogans, as well as, on the government side, blatant handouts, which began last month to no avail.The major indictment against Tsipras is that he has failed to honour his commitments to the EU and IMF: the radical measures they demanded in order to reboot the economy have largely gone unheeded, resulting in credibility fatigue.Reasons for optimismAt least in 2015 Syriza and Tsipras offered reasons for optimism: reforms, transparency in government, reduction of the national debt and the elimination of the austerity programme.Successive governments of ND and Pasok had allowed a financial crisis to develop, partly due to the perceived need to westernise not only the economy but also Greek society itself. The mistakes they made were cultural and social as well as administrative and statistical when they told lies to Europe they were also deceiving themselves and the Greek people.Tsipras found a way to insert Syriza into the credibility gap between them, spinning his own narrative, which has now been demonstrated to be equally misleading. The fact that he achieved nothing in the area of reform is not necessarily a reason for rejecting Syriza, since no other party is capable of implementing changes without a paradigm shift in political thinking.None of the party leaders can actually offer any realistic programme to alleviate the economic crisis which remains central to most people’s lives. Moreover, the incoming government will have to deal with new faces in Germany and the EU who will affect Greece’s fortunes, and who may be even less friendly towards Greece than their predecessors.For his part, ND leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis is not only lacklustre but, as the scion of a political dynasty that helped to create the crisis, he is anathema to voters who will not tolerate “more of the same”. When he announces that ND will maintain “the ethos and style” that distinguishes his party, voters understand this as “conservative elitism”, rather than Tsipras’s “socialist elitism”.The only transparent thing about Mitsotakis is that, whatever he says, you can see right through him. By contrast, as a political manipulator, Tsipras has made opacity a fine art.Sole achievementTsipras’s only positive achievement was to resolve the name dispute with North Macedonia, but the “triumph”, as it has been called, was not his own: he was coaxed into it by the EU and the UN, and even then he was pilloried by Mitsotakis for betraying the national heritage.Despite a nine-point lead in last month’s elections, ND would most likely take 140 seats in a general election, 11 short of an overall majority, making coalition inevitable. Mitsotakis’s options will depend on the fate of smaller parties, which come and go in parliament depending on whether they achieve the 3 per cent of the national vote necessary to elect MPs.Neither the hardline communists (KKE) nor the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn are a potential coalition choice, leaving ND looking at Kinal (Movement for Change), the new centrist party that has risen awkwardly from the ashes of ND’s old rival, Pasok.While the electorate may smile more on Mitsotakis than on Tsipras, Greece’s economic situation will remain dire for the foreseeable future. The fact that this is only a mirror of its graver social and cultural situation is given little overt consideration but exercises every citizen.The central, unspoken issue in this upcoming election, as in every poll since the foundation of the state, is Greece’s role and status in the Balkans as a country that is ethnically and culturally related to both east and west, to such a degree that it can never be said that it belongs exclusively to either. Above all, Greece needs not only politicians, whom it has in abundance (about 10 million of them), but statesmen, of whom it has none."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/17/TELEMMGLPICT000147339863_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"judges given new expenses policy telegraph discovers judiciary","story":"The Ministry of Justice approved expenses including shampoo and crockery.  Lord Chief Justice, Lord Ian Burnett, pictured, claimed for multiple journeys to and from his homeMinistry of JusticeThe judiciary are to be given a new expenses policy after The Daily  found that Britain\u0027s most senior judges have claimed for crockery, shampoo and a taxi to transport ceremonial robes on taxpayer-funded expenses.Expenses data released under the Freedom of Information Act shows how some of the most high-profile members of the judiciary in England and Wales have had claims for everyday items as well first-class trains approved, even though they receive a salary of at least £180,000.At present, judges are encouraged to follow the expenses policy for Ministry of Justice (MOJ) civil servants, and the judiciary has also set out specific guidance relating to travel, accommodation and relocation....To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletMinistry of JusticeTory leadership race latest: Andrea Leadsom leaving the European Union by Oct 31 is my \u0026#39hard red line\u0026#39 Find out which Conservative leadership candidate is right for you with this quickfire quizFour bodies found as salvage crews lift capsized Hungarian tourist boatConservative leadership contenders: Who are the Tory candidates hoping to become the next Prime Minister?Comment: Britain is being dangerously complacent about the return of HizbollahSingaporean er survives 80 hours adrift at seaComment: The next PM must address the disturbing impact of social media on the vulnerable youngJeremy Hunt refuses Foreign Office support for Nicola Sturgeon Brussels visit \u0026#39to talk up independence\u0026#39Comment: The Tories aren\u0026#39t ready for someone as downright Machiavellian as Michael Gove to be leaderDiverse Gardeners\u0026#39 World presenting team is a good thing even if it\u0026#39s less work for me, says Carol KleinLeonardo Da Vinci\u0026#39s Salvator Mundi \u0026#39being kept on Saudi crown prince\u0026#39s superyacht\u0026#39British base jumper \u0026#39dies in Italy after leaping from 3,000m mountain in Dolomites\u0026#39 Hundreds of North Korean public execution sites identified by rights groupUK weather: Sinkholes force closure of M25 as deluge prompts flood warnings across BritainNew York helicopter crash: Pilot  killed in fiery accident on top of Manhattan skyscraperChoosing a nursery could be more important than school when it comes academic achievement, study findsMPs call for ban on sex harassment gagging orders in wake of Sir Philip Green allegationsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"expenses podcast lone campaigner took whole parliament","story":"Journalist and freedom of information campaigner, Heather BrookeTucked away in the back of New Labour’s 1997 manifesto is a promise.

gardeners world presenting team good thing even less","story":"The Gardeners\u0026#39 World presenting team, pictured in 2018Carol Klein, the BBC Gardeners’ World presenter, has said she is happy to have less airtime to make way for black and disabled colleagues.The programme has been revamped in recent years to make the presenting team more erse. A consequence is that some veterans of the show, including Klein, have less to do.“Monty Don is still the kingpin, but they wanted to change the format, partly to be more inclusive: to have someone in a wheelchair, someone who’s black,” Klein explained.“That’s happened across lots of TV and I don’t resent it at all. I think it’s a good thing,” she told Radio Times.Flo Headlam, a former charity worker who took up gardening professionally in 2012, became the programme’s first black presenter in 2017 and has said: “The response has been very positive. Obviously I’m a black woman and they’ve never had a black woman on the programme before, so it’s a breath of fresh air.”Mark Lane, an award-winning garden designer, is the first disabled presenter on Gardeners’ World. He was diagnosed with spina bifida in his 30s after struggling for years with back pain, and began using a wheelchair after a car accident left him requiring more spinal surgery.He has said: “I feel very proud of my achievements and love the fact that most of the time new clients don’t even know that I am in a wheelchair. That means I am being judged on my work, rather than on who I am.“I love meeting people - whether they’re gardeners or community groups - and I love visiting gardens that I may never have got around to seeing. I also think it’s great that someone with a disability is now showing others that gardening can be done.”“Hopefully, iniduals like myself can show broadcasters that disabled people can do a lot of things, rather than just being a token gesture.”Carol Klein is one of the show\u0026#39s longest-serving presentersA BBC spokesman said: “The Gardeners’ World presenters and experts are all chosen for their horticultural knowledge, and we are proud to have such a erse mix of talent on the programme.”Klein, asked for the secret to her longevity, replied: “I think they just don’t dare give me the sack! I’m 73 and I’ve been doing gardening TV for going on 25 years so I was quite old when I came into it.”She is also presenting two shows on Channel 5, Great British Gardens and The Great Garden Challenge.A decade ago, her future on Gardeners’ World appeared to be in doubt when she was passed over for the lead presenter role in favour of Toby Buckland, despite having more experience on the show. Fans complained, accusing the BBC of sexism.She said at the time: “Many viewers assumed that I’d turned down the job but in fact I was never offered it. Had I been asked, I would have loved to have done it and I think I could have done it very well, but I was never in a position to say yes or no.

You feel fins, you feel bites, you feel something move and rub against your leg. It comes on and off. The problem is that, when you think about it, you fear losing your leg or losing an arm,” he told The Straits Times, in his first interview about his harrowing ordeal in May.Mr Low’s nightmare began when the weather suddenly turned during a ing trip and his boat sank in high waves near Tioman island, off the east coast of Malaysia. As water poured inside the vessel, Mr Low only had time to grab a life buoy and his backpack, which contained his passport but no supplies. Mr Low was winched to safety from a ship in the South China Sea“I was not really scared as I felt that someone would come and save me. I’m religious,” said Mr Low, who later explained that his Christian faith and the desire to see his wife and three children again gave him the willpower to survive the harsh conditions that followed. Although he alerted friends to his predicament, rough seas and darkness prevented an early rescue as strong currents carried him out further.After 40 hours at sea, Mr Low was forced to remove his clothes as they were chafing painfully against his badly sunburnt skin. Parched and vomiting from ingesting salty sea water, he began to hallucinate that someone was holding his hand and taking him to a grocery store to buy Coca-Cola. He heard voices urging him to let go of his flotation device. Mr Low had lost his glasses when the boat sank and could only make out colours in the sky, but as the sun set in the evenings he mustered the will to carry on, telling himself: “This is the most beautiful sunset. I want to see the sunrise tomorrow.”Mr Low has now recovered from his ordeal last monthBut by the afternoon of the fourth day, his hopes began to fade.  “I actually told my God, ‘I’m already in this pain, so I don’t mind going inside the water and going home (to Heaven), or if you think I should go back to my real home and meet my family. Either way, I’m ready\u0027,” he said.Two hours later, his answer came in the form of the Diogo Cao, a 4000-tonne dredger, whose captain spotted him from several miles away before crew members fished him out of the water. “I was as small as a bacteria, but this captain managed to locate me. Whoever spotted me must have an eagle’s vision,” he said. An exhausted Mr Low, whose limbs had become stuck to his rescue device, lost consciousness after his rescue and woke up on a small bed on the ship’s deck. “They kept telling me: ‘Don’t worry. You are safe’,” he said. Mr Low was  later winched from the ship by the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF), who posted a video of his rescue and their emotional reunion a month later on their Facebook page. With a wide smile, Mr Low hugs each member of the aircrew and thanked them for their “bravery.” The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Serial entrepreneur Renee Elliott\u0026nbspwas the woman\u0026nbspwho kickstarted the UK’s organic food scene back in the Nineties – way before kale made its way on to\u0026nbspthe menus of fashionable London restaurants.To Elliott, health is the foundation of a person’s wellbeing. “Taking care of yourself is key,” she tells The Independent.\u0026nbsp“For some women it’s a little uncomfortable, for others it can even be agonising, it depends on how you’re built. But I know that if I go out of balance then I go into stress.“In business, life or relationships it’s about trusting and respecting yourself and your body. Essentially trust your gut, not your brain.\u0026nbspIf it tells you to do it, you should respect that, whether it’s an important business decision or sleeping more.”Elliott is as passionate about this mantra today as she was in 1995 when she opened the UK’s first organic supermarket, Planet Organic – the company that was to change not just her career but also the way that organic retailing developed in the UK.Created with Sketch.Food and drink news Show all 35Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.135 Healthy living makes us more inclined to binge, research suggestsGluten-free breads, dairy-free milks and other plant-based products have been some of the most favoured foods in British supermarkets this year.235 Growing list of Vegan celebsMaking the switch to veganism is a major lifestyle choice, one that many claim can improve energy levels, lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and clear up any skin issues.

Cambridge PhD graduate-turned farmer, Adrian Izzard has used traditional growing techniques at Wild Country Organics to produce the colourful spuds, packed with healthy cell-protecting anthocyanin, which had previously disappeared from UK plates when post-war farmers were pushed towards higher-yielding varietiesOver the last 10 years, what began as\u0026nbspa shop on Westbourne Grove became a multi-million pound business.\u0026nbspPlanet Organic\u0026nbspraked in £30.6m\u0026nbspin sales last year on operating profit of £590,000 over seven stores. This year the firm is on track to book revenues of £36m.Although Elliott stepped down from her role as director in 2018 after Planet Organic was sold in a deal thought to be worth around £15m, she remains the brand spokesperson and kept\u0026nbspshares in the business.Her desire to help people lead healthier and happier lives prompted her to launch her second venture, Beluga Bean\u0026nbsp– an academy that\u0026nbspruns courses to empower women with business and life skills including how to save for your pension, deal with postpartum depression or find\u0026nbspthe right balance between your children and your business.Turning her aspirations from fantasy to reality was far from easy but\u0026nbspworking in the food industry was inevitable for Elliott.She was born in Pascagoula, Mississippi, in a home where her mother was always cooking.\u0026nbspHer father kept a large vegetable garden, which she helped out with. “It’s funny I didn’t really see this until I got older, but when I look back, food was always a big part of my family,” Elliott says.“My mum was an incredible cook and baker. Every holiday, every birthday, every graduation, it was all about the food.”As a student, Elliott went travelling in Europe and met her future husband on a night bus in London in 1985. After realising it was more than a summer fling, she settled in the UK\u0026nbspthe following year.Her eureka moment came when she stepped into an organic supermarket called Bread \u0026amp Circus – now a part of Whole Foods – on a visit to the US. Disheartened by the lack of organic presence in the UK, she decided to take matters into her own hands and bring\u0026nbspthe concept to London.“For a long time I had this theme running in my head about food not being what it should be and no one looking after my health in terms of what was available on supermarket shelves,” she explains.“America is usually ahead of the UK, so I thought nobody is doing this back home and I am going to recreate this.”At the time, Elliott was a writer for a wine magazine, so this\u0026nbspfirst step towards her professional goals started with a career U-turn.“I managed a health store for two years but other than that I had no prior business experience, I was an English major at university,” she says.“It was almost easier because I was naive. My dad once said, ‘There’s no reason you can’t do anything, anyone else can do,’ and I believed him.”It took her a year to write up the business plan, find the funding and come up with a logo before opening the first Planet Organic store on Westbourne Grove in November 1995.“Today I spend a lot of time telling my clients don’t worry about the ‘how’, paint the ‘what’ first,” she says.\u0026nbsp“A thousand little steps will lead you to success but if you start focusing on the ‘how’ from the beginning you will be paralysed.”By 1996, stories about mad cow disease,\u0026nbspBSE,\u0026nbsphit headlines in the UK and Elliott was poised to reap the rewards.The business doubled its turnover from\u0026nbsp£1.2m\u0026nbspto £2.4m,\u0026nbspso the founder knew she was heading in the right direction. “It was like chasing a galloping horse, it took up so fast we could barely keep up,” she adds.But just as business was booming, her business partner, who put in the initial equity investment, took her to court.“My business partner, who was a man from a privileged background, decided I should leave the business,” she says.\u0026nbsp“When I refused to abandon what I essentially saw as my baby, he took me to court. It was the hardest thing I ever faced, it was awful and it lasted 14 months.”To get through that period, Elliott practised self-care and read Sun Tzu’s The Art of War – an ancient Chinese military text – the core message of which is know your enemy.Eating organic food lowers risk of certain cancers, study suggestsCould co-operative shops be the answer to expensive organic foods?Pesticides cause brain damage and organic food is the future, says EUThe damage done by neonics makes the case of organic foodOrganic food healthier than farmed products, says new research“I slept, I stopped drinking and I meditated – essentially I prepared,” she says.\u0026nbsp“I was a very good student at school, so I prepared ferociously and I won.”After a decade\u0026nbsprunning the business, she felt like it was time to step down. “I had three kids, which I thought I’ll never do because the responsibility freaked me out,” she explains.\u0026nbsp“I knew\u0026nbspI would either have to hire a nanny or hire a CEO to run the business. It was an awful choice to make and I didn’t see it coming.“A girlfriend of mine told me, ‘Planet is more than 20 years old, it’s grown up now, it has your values,’ and that helped to step away.“But having children does slow you down. Women need to know, they need to have their eyes open, no matter how supportive your partner might be, we often end up being the caretakers. What you give your attention to ultimately thrives. And you can’t give your attention to everything, so often as women we have to make choices.”In 2017, she launched Beluga Bean to help other women learn from her experience of building a business from scratch, being an entrepreneur and a mother, and taking care of yourself.Courses include “Launch”, which\u0026nbspworks with business concepts,\u0026nbspand “Nourish”, which teaches baking and cooking to\u0026nbspimprove your health. Soon she\u0026nbspwill also be launching “Body Talk”\u0026nbspaimed at teenagers\u0026nbspstruggling with self-esteem and self-harming due to constant social media exposure.“We’re growing slowly but I have a big vision and I’ve committed to these for the next 10 years,” Elliott says.\u0026nbsp“The academy is 50 per cent business planning and it’s 50 per cent self discovery. So it covers everything and is meant to answer questions like, ‘I want to launch this business but I also want to have kids in five years’ to ‘I want to start my company but my partner is a bit unsure’ or help younger women to budget and save after they’ve graduated and are living on their own for the first time.”A sought-after speaker on nutrition and wellness, Elliott also teaches healthy baking at the College of Naturopathic Medicine in London and frequently lectures to budding entrepreneurs on podcasts such as Secret Leaders, which features interviews and tips from key figures within the UK tech and creative industries.“My motto in life is learn, earn, return and there’s a part of me that’s about giving back now and supporting others on this journey, because I’ve been there and done that.“These tools weren’t available when I started Planet, and it’s so nice to walk that journey with someone supporting you –\u0026nbspbecause it’s scary and you’re alone a lot of the time, self-esteem can be a problem.“When I launched Planet, my inspiration was The Body Shop founder Anita Roddick – but it’s not like there were many other examples of successful female entrepreneurs out there.”How does she balance it all? “Having fun every week and finding time for myself is key,” she says.\u0026nbsp“I dance and I walk every day.“That balance for me is critical. We often talk about destination but your goal point is always moving. This was my error with Planet – it was always about the next step. But you need to have fun and take care of yourself today because you don’t always know what the future will bring.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

When a recent UK Statistics Authority survey asked a representative sample of the public, 85 per cent\u0026nbspof people who expressed a view said they trusted the statistics produced by the ONS. Moreover, nearly three in four agreed they were produced without any political interference.\u0026nbspThis doesn’t stop some people on Twitter from expressing the view that our labour market figures are misleading or manipulated to support the government of the day.Here are some the most common misapprehensions I’ve spent a lot of time rebutting, in the hope we can persuade anyone who remains undecided on the veracity of our statistics to join the majority who trust our data.\u0026nbsp“The jobs figures are rigged by the government”\u0026nbspThe main numbers do not come from government data on jobs or benefits. Instead, they all come directly from the Labour Force Survey (LFS), a very large household survey carried out by the ONS right across the UK. That’s us, talking directly to real people in their tens of thousands, and logging information about their own experiences. I should also take this opportunity to say thank you to the thousands of people who take time to respond to our survey.\u0026nbspWe ask, among many other things, whether they are working, seeking work or not active in the labour market at all – in other words, we’re measuring their actual labour market behaviour.Ministers and their advisers have no influence on the ONS employment figures and no longer see the figures before they become public. We are independent of ministerial control and accountable, through the UK Statistics Authority, to parliament rather than the government.\u0026nbspThe claimant count is derived from benefits data provided by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). But\u0026nbspit’s compiled by ONS statisticians operating under a strict code of professional impartiality. It also ceased long ago to be part of the headline employment indicators –\u0026nbspthose are all drawn from the ONS survey.“Employment growth is driven by people working an hour a week or\u0026nbspon zero-hours contracts”Only a very small proportion of people in employment work very few hours – in January to March 2019 only 1.4 per cent of workers usually worked six hours a week or less. For many years this proportion has been falling, not rising, so is not a new thing. Likewise, only about 2.6 per cent of workers are in a zero-hours contract in their main job, and this proportion appears now to have peaked or to be falling.\u0026nbspYes, someone who only works for an hour a week is technically defined as employed because that’s the standard international definition of employment (more on that below). But the numbers of such people would seem to be vanishingly small.\u0026nbsp“The definition of employment and unemployment has been changed by the government to massage the figures so our figures aren’t comparable with those for other countries”The definitions used in the figures – what counts as employment and what as unemployment – are agreed internationally at the forum of the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The reason for this is, of course, precisely to ensure that different countries’ figures are comparable. These definitions are long-standing and haven’t been altered. Because they are set internationally, they are not subject to alteration by the UK government and there have been no changes at all to these definitions since the change of government in 2010.“The latest figures are not on the same basis as figures for the 1970s”Our employment and unemployment statistics go back to 1971 and we use the same ILO definitions throughout, so it is not true to say that our latest figures are not comparable with those for the 1970s. Our figures for the 1970s and 1980s are not the same as when those figures were originally published.Unemployment down again but Britain has a soft financial underbellyHow is UK unemployment so low despite Brexit turmoil?Universal basic income trial fails to help people back into workEmployers must do more to tackle domestic abuseEmployers not doing enough to keep new and expectant mothers safe That is because unemployment statistics used to be based on the number of people claiming unemployment-related benefits. However, we have used ILO definitions as our main indicator for over 20 years now because the previous method did not follow international standards and bred scepticism about the independence of the figures. Our unemployment figures have been based solely on the Labour Force Survey\u0026nbspsince the spring of 1992 when we started doing that survey on a continuous basis. The figures from 1971 up until the spring of 1992 are based on other surveys and indicators but use the same ILO definitions as the figures from spring 1992 onwards.“ONS includes unpaid family carers in the employment figures”This is an understandable mistake, but a mistake all the same. There is a small sub-category of employed people called “unpaid family workers” (though it only amounts to 131,000 people compared with 27.6 million employees and 4.9 million self-employed). That’s less than 0.5\u0026nbspper cent of all people in employment. However, it does not cover unpaid carers, who would not count in our employment figures if their caring responsibilities prevented them from being available for work. “Unpaid family workers” are actually people who work in a family business without receiving a formal wage or salary but benefit\u0026nbspfrom its profits instead.“Unemployment is a count of benefit claimants, and so ‘sanctioned’\u0026nbspclaimants and those not claiming benefits are excluded from the figures”That’s not the case at all – as I said, the unemployment figure comes from the ONS survey\u0026nbspnot the DWP, which manages the benefits system. The people who are counted as unemployed are those\u0026nbspaged 16 or over who are not working but are\u0026nbspboth looking for and are available for work, no matter what benefits they may or may not be receiving. So having one’s benefit claim sanctioned (stopped or reduced) does not directly affect this at all.“The school leaving age has been raised to 18, so 16- and 17-year-olds have been removed from the unemployment figures”The ONS does in fact measure unemployment among this age group. Our published figures show that in January to March 2019, there were 81,000 unemployed 16- and 17-year-olds, of whom 61,000 were still in full-time education. Of course, it is perfectly possible still to be in full-time education and count as unemployed – a student who was actively looking for a part-time job would meet the ILO definition and so would count in our numbers. Nor is it correct to say that the school leaving age has been raised to 18: while 17- to 18-year-olds are required to undertake some form of education or training, there is no requirement for them to remain at school. People in that age group can enter the labour market and some choose to do so.These, then, are the main misconceptions I’ve had to deal with. I suppose it’s understandable and only human to doubt figures when they don’t match your own experience. In addition, our statistics cannot capture every aspect of the labour market that is important to people. We’ve also been reporting record high employment levels at a time when according to other ONS figures the economy has not exactly been booming for everyone. Wage growth also has by historical standards been quite slow\u0026nbspand, adjusting for inflation, wages remain below their 2008 levels.\u0026nbspThe ONS survey is probably the biggest regular, long-running household survey in the UK. Its findings aren’t precise – there’s a degree of uncertainty in any sample survey, of course. But the ONS operates transparently and in the public interest. If anyone wants to know more about how the figures are compiled or what they say, we’re always happy to explain.\u0026nbspRichard Clegg is an employment statistician at the Office for National Statistics.\u0026nbspAfter 15 years as senior statistician presenting the UK’s monthly\u0026nbspemployment figures, he\u0026nbspis retiring from the ONSOffice for National Statistics\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some 963 arrests have been made and 42 people charged in connection with the ongoing protestsLocal authority spend per child is highest in London at £7.29 and it is also high in the South East of England (£5.73) and East of England (£4.83).Meanwhile, spending is lowest in the East Midlands (£0.34), the West Midlands (£0.90) and Yorkshire and Humber (£1.18).Figures show that 18 per cent of five-year olds, equating to 114,822 children, are also not reaching their expected level.Overall, 193,971 primary school children are on the special educational needs register for speech, language and communication needs, although the true level of need is thought to be higher.The problem is worse among pupils from deprived backgrounds, with 23 per cent of five-year-olds eligible for free school meals not meeting expected levels, compared to 13 per cent of their peers.Ms Longfield said: “Communication skills are vital for children starting school and for improving social mobility throughout a child’s education.\u0026nbspWe should be very concerned that almost one in five children aged five is behind in speech and language development and yet more than half of areas in England have seen a real-terms fall in spending on speech and language therapy in recent years.”Children with poor vocabulary skills are twice as likely to be unemployed when they group and more than 60 per cent of children in Young Offender Institutions have communication difficulties, previous research has shown. \u0026nbspMs Longfield added: “The next prime minister must make school readiness a priority if we are to give all children the chance to thrive. A well-resourced strategy for addressing speech, language and communication needs must be part of that.”Kamini Gadhok, chief executive of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists, said the\u0026nbspsituation was unacceptable, adding that its own survey had shown that 59 per cent of parents already have to fight to get the support their child needs.Special needs children discouraged from applying to schools amid cutsJames Bowen, director of policy for school leaders’ union NAHT, said: “Children’s early speech and language skills are the foundations upon which all future learning is built.\u0026nbspIf children fall behind in the early years it can prove difficult, often impossible, for them to catch up later, even with additional help.”He added: “Early intervention is key, but schools are finding it harder and harder to access specialist help from speech and language therapists, as both school budgets and local authority budgets are cut. Investment is vitally needed to enable these crucial experts to continue their work.”Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, added that it was “shocking” to see a postcode lottery in “something as vital as speech and language therapy.”He added: “It is absolutely vital that we invest in support for children and families, and speech and language therapy is one vital part of that.”Cllr Anntoinette Bramble, chair of the Local Government Association’s Children and Young People Board, said: “Significant financial pressures on councils’ public health and special needs budgets is severely impacting on their ability to support children with early language development.\u0026nbspPublic health budgets have been cut by £700m while councils face a special needs funding gap of up to £1.6bn by 2021, which we urge the government to address in the Spending Review.”She added that “insufficient funding is impacting on the quality of provision and support for children with special needs, as providers struggle to balance budgets.”A Government spokesperson said: Speech and language therapy gives children in need the best start in life.\u0026nbspAs part of the NHS\u0027 Long Term Plan, we are working to improve support for children and young people including considering how to ensure we have the right numbers of speech and language therapists to meet demand.Good early years education is the cornerstone of social mobility.\u0026nbspWe are boosting local early years services with £8.5m to help establish best practice and are providing £50m to develop more high-quality school-based nursery provision for disadvantaged children, £26m to set up a network of English hubs and a national training centre, and £20m on the professional development of early years practitioners - ensuring every child can thrive.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The company hopes that they and many more to be launched in the future will power fast internet connections that will enable people around the world to get online.SpaceX had said that the objects would be bareful visible at all.But as soon as that launch was complete, people spotted the mysterious shiny objects flying through the night sky, as bright as the stars. Some even reported UFO sightings, fearful of what they thought they were seeing.Now the American Astronomical Society has together warned the world that the satellites could pose a considerable risk to people on the ground and in the sky. Such constellations could eventually outnumbers the number of visible stars in the sky, the astronomers said, with tens of thousands of the objects planned to be launched.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An image from Nasa\u0027s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) shows a 200,000 mile long solar filament ripping through the Sun\u0027s corona in September 2013230 Nasa Celebrates 50 Years of SpacewalkingFor 50 years, NASA has been suiting up for spacewalking.

The light being sent from the satellites as well as bouncing off them could stop astronomers seeing light from space, and the radiation coming out of them could get in the way of radio emissions.SpaceX launches first 60 satellites of its planned \u0027Starlink\u0027 projectWhat\u0027s more, the satellites are at risk of smashing into space-based observatories, which could cause chaos in near-Earth orbit.The group shared an image that showed how the trails formed by the satellites could ruin photos as they flew past.The society said it was excited by the possibility of new ways of connecting the world, and that it recognise that space was an increasingly important resource. But the world needs to do more to ensure that those using it don\u0027t pollute the night sky and harm astronomers and the general public.“The American Astronomical Society notes with concern the impending deployment of very large constellations of satellites into Earth orbit, it said in a new statement adopted during its most recent\u0026nbspmeeting.\u0026nbspThe number of such satellites is projected to grow into the tens of thousands over the next several years, creating the potential for substantial adverse impacts to ground- and space-based astronomy. These impacts could include significant disruption of optical and near-infrared observations by direct detection of satellites in reflected and emitted light contamination of radio astronomical observations by electromagnetic radiation in satellite communication bands and collision with space-based observatories.“The AAS recognizes that outer space is an increasingly available resource with many possible uses. However, the potential for multiple large satellite constellations to adversely affect both each other and the study of the cosmos is becoming increasingly apparent, both in low Earth orbit and beyond.“The AAS is actively working to assess the impacts on astronomy of large satellite constellations before their numbers rise further. Only with thorough and quantitative understanding can we properly assess the risks and identify appropriate mitigating actions. The AAS desires that this be a collaborative effort among its members, other scientific societies, and other space stakeholders including private companies. The AAS will support and facilitate the work by relevant parties to understand fully and minimize the impact of large satellite constellations on ground- and space-based astronomy.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Unhappy with the way the studio, New Line, had re-cut American History X, the filmmaker wrote multiple open letters – published by the trade press – telling people to not watch the final version. He even had the film pulled from Toronto Film Festival. “I had tried to get my name taken off it, and replaced with various pseudonyms,” Kaye wrote in , three years after the release. “One was ‘Humpty Dumpty’. Another was ‘Ralph Coates’, who played for Tottenham in the 1970s.” The Directors Guild of America would not allow Kaye to change his name, and he has bitterly lived with the accolade of directing the cult classic ever since.220 Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen – Michael BayThe first Transformers was a decent-enough popcorn flick. Critics may not have been enamoured by the CGI blockbuster, but there’s no denying watching robots beating each other up is mindless entertainment of the highest order. Yet, Michael Bay managed to make a mess of that simple winning formula in the sequel, Revenge of the Fallen, something he later admitted. When I look back at it, that was crap,” he said of the film in 2011. “The writers\u0027 strike was coming hard and fast. It was just terrible to do a movie where you\u0027ve got to have a story in three weeks. I was prepping a movie for months where I only had 14 pages of some idea of what the movie was. It\u0027s a BS way to make a movie.”While Swedish director Tomas Alfredson received acclaim for the Oscar-nominated Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, his follow-up film, the mystery thriller The Snowman, was ripped apart by critics. “Our shoot time in Norway was way too short,” he explained following the film’s release. “We didn’t get the whole story with us and when we started cutting we discovered that a lot was missing.” Alfredson added that, despite The Snowman being in development for years, with Martin Scorsese once attached as director, around 10 to 15 per cent of the script was not filmed. “It’s like when you’re making a big jigsaw puzzle and a few pieces are missing so you don’t see the whole picture,” he added.420 Avengers: Age of Ultron – Joss WhedonJoss Whedon changed cinema with The Avengers. The ensemble film brought a host of disparate superheroes together, and in the process made over $1.5 billion (£1.15 billion) at the box-office. Balancing all those characters was tough, and come the sequel, Age of Ultron, the director was worn down. Whedon apparently couldn’t muster the ability to watch the entire film after completion, saying: “I’m tied and I had a terrible time.” A year later, in 2016, the filmmaker clarified his comments. “I was so beaten down by the process. Some of that was conflicting with Marvel, which is inevitable. A lot of it was about my own work, and I was also exhausted.” Whedon added that he remains “proud” of the film, yet there are still things about the film that “frustrate” him hugely. Noah Baumbach is now a beloved indie filmmaker (thanks to The Squid and the Whale, Frances Ha, and The Meyerowitz Stories). Yet he was not always an acclaimed director. Baumbach despised his second film, Highball, so much that his directing credit was changed to Ernie Fusco and his writer’s one to Jesse Carter. “It was just too ambitious,” he said of the film, which concerns a newly married couple who end up inviting too many people to their Brooklyn flat for a party. “We didn\u0027t have enough time, we didn\u0027t finish it, it didn\u0027t look good, it was just a whole ... mess. We couldn\u0027t get it done, and I had a falling out with the producer. He abandoned it, and I had no money to finish it, to go back and maybe get two more days or something. Then later, it was put out on DVD without my approval.”Before Babylon AD – a futuristic sci-fi flick about a mercenary who has to escort a woman from Russia to America – reached cinemas in the UK, the director, Mathieu Kassovitz, was trying to distance himself from the Vin Diesel-led project. The movie is supposed to teach us that the education of our children will mean the future of our planet,” he said. “All the action scenes had a goal: they were supposed to be driven by either a metaphysical point of view or experience for the characters... instead parts of the movie are like a bad episode of 24. Kassovitz later added the film was pure violence and stupidity.In 1992, Dennis Hopper joined the ranks of directors who released their film under the pseudonym Alan Smithee (famously used when filmmakers disown their own film). Originally called Catchfire, the Jodie Foster-starring thriller about a woman who enters witness protection was later retitled Backtrack, and 20 minutes were cut for the straight-to-VHS release. Hopper rarely spoke about the film he wanted to distance himself as much as possible from the doomed project.“I think it’s a beautiful film to look at and I think the score is beautiful,” Steven Soderberg said of The Underneath, “but 15 seconds in I know we’re in trouble because of how f***ing long it takes to get through those opening credits. That’s just an indication of what’s wrong with this thing: it’s just totally sleepy.” The film, about a recovering gambling addict, was an unsurprising box-office flop. “I can’t say I’d recommend it to anyone,” Soderbergh added, “other than to look at in the context of someone’s career”.Alan Taylor – of Game of Thrones and Sopranos fame – seemed a perfect fit for Thor, the heroic God of Thunder who spoke in Shakespearean prose. When the sequel was released, many were disappointed with the film, which somehow wasted Christopher Eccleston, who played the villain. Taylor later criticised the project, saying: “The Marvel experience was particularly wrenching because I was sort of given absolute freedom while we were shooting, and then in post it turned into a different movie. So, that is something I hope never to repeat and don’t wish upon anybody else.”1120 Fear and Desire – Stanley KubrickFew filmmakers have spotless filmographies. Stanley Kubrick believed the blotch on his was Fear and Desire – the renowned-perfectionist’s cinematic debut. As his stature as a director grew, Kubrick was said to grow ever-more disgruntled with Fear and Desire, an anti-war film about four soldiers trapped behind enemy lines. Reports emerged in the Sixties that Kubrick had destroyed the original negative print, and was hoping to destroy all leftover prints. In 1964, Kubrick called the film “a serious effort, ineptly done”.1220 Batman and Robin – Joel SchumacherAlmost everyone involved with Batman \u0026amp Robin seems to hate the final product. George Clooney has apologised for his Bat-nippled version of the Caped Crusader, while director Joel Schumacher has said sorry multiple times. “Look, I apologise,” he said in 2017. “I want to apologise to every fan that was disappointed because I think I owe them that.” After the widely maligned film reached cinemas, Schumacher said he was treated like “scum”. “It was like I had murdered a baby,” he continued.1320 The Day the Clown Cried – Jerry LewisJerry Lewis’s The Day the Clown Cried has never been released. The director, who also starred as the leading character, locked the film – about a clown arrested in Nazi Germany for drunkenly defaming Hitler – in a private vault after completion. Lewis thought the film was so “bad, bad, bad” that he often refused to discuss the project, only commenting very occasionally. I was ashamed of the work and I was grateful I had the power to contain it all and never let anyone see it. It could have been wonderful but I slipped up – I didn\u0027t quite get it,” he said in 2013.Everything was looking good for Fantastic Four before filming began. Some of Hollywood’s most promising actors were playing the eponymous characters – Michael B Jordan, Miles Teller, Kate Mara and Jamie Bell – while Josh Trank, coming off the back of runaway success Chronicle, was hired to direct. During post-production, though, everything fell apart. Trank was forced by the studio, Fox, to do extensive reshoots (you can tell which scenes were reshot because Mara’s wig looks awful and Teller has varying lengths of stubble). The month before the film’s release, the director spoke out on Twitter. “A year ago I had a fantastic version of this,” he wrote. “And it would’ve received great reviews. You’ll probably never see it. That’s reality though.” The film bombed at the box office, with Trank’s tweet reportedly costing Fox between $5m and $10m (£3.8m and £7.6m).During the Nineties, Kiefer Sutherland wanted to progress from acting to directing. Although his feature-film debut as director, 1997’s Truth or Consequences, was not exactly a critical success, he persevered, directing the 2000 flick Woman Wanted. Sutherland was so disappointed with the results, he released the film under the pseudonym Alan Smithee – becoming the last person to ever use the famed name. He has not directed a film since.A film about the pseudonym Alan Smithee that ironically ended up being an Alan Smithee film. Arthur Hiller had no intention of disowning Burn Hollywood Burn, which aimed to lampoon the Hollywood system. The film centred on a director, named Alan Smithee (played by Eric Idle), who hands in a cut of a film, only for the studio to recut the entire thing. Life mirrored art as the studio behind Burn Hollywood Burn took the film away from Hiller, who ended up using the Smithee pseudonym on the release. Following the success of Oscar Best Picture winner The Elephant Man, David Lynch could have done almost anything. Despite having not read the book, Lynch agreed to adapt Dune, choosing the project over the third Star Wars, Return of the Jedi. Lynch soon started work on turning Frank Herbert’s epic novel into a screenplay, turning in over five drafts. Yet, despite the preparation time, the final results were less than satisfactory for the director. “I started selling out on Dune,” he said. “Looking back, it\u0027s no one\u0027s fault but my own. I probably shouldn\u0027t have done that picture, but I saw tons and tons of possibilities for things I loved, and this was the structure to do them in.”David Fincher was just 28 years old when the producers of Alien decided to bring the upstart on board their second sequel. With just five weeks’ preparation time, an unfinished script, and no real clout behind his name, Fincher struggled with the film. “Oh, it was just awful,” he later said. “This is the worst thing that ever happened to me.” In 2009, promoting The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Fincher elaborated: “I had to work on it for two years, got fired off it three times and I had to fight for every single thing. No one hated it more than me to this day, no one hates it more than me.”The fourth film in the horror series Hellraiser had a troubled production. Original director Kevin Yagher was ordered by the studio to reshoot scenes, which he refused to do. Joe Chappelle stepped in, leading to Yagher demanding the Alan Smithee pseudonym be used. The final film – which acted as both a prequel and a sequel to the other three films – was not screened for critics, and was dismissed by many fans.David O Russell began working on Nailed in 2008. Envisioning the film as a romantic comedy with political undertones, the director cast Jessica Biel and Jake Gyllenhaal in leading roles, and was awarded $26 million (£20 million) to make it. And still, somehow, the entire filming process was a mess. The set was shutdown a reported 14 times after cast and crew complained about not being paid. Eventually, after key scenes were not filmed during production, the entire thing was abandoned. After Russell started drawing Oscars attention for The Fighter and American Hustle, though, the studio wanted to get Nailed out in cinemas. Work continued on the film without Russell’s involvement. The film was then retitled Accidental Love and released in cinemas, with the director’s name changed to Stephen Greene. Critics hated the results. There are few directors who have gone so actively out of their way to discourage people from watching their film as Tony Kaye. Unhappy with the way the studio, New Line, had re-cut American History X, the filmmaker wrote multiple open letters – published by the trade press – telling people to not watch the final version. He even had the film pulled from Toronto Film Festival. “I had tried to get my name taken off it, and replaced with various pseudonyms,” Kaye wrote in , three years after the release. “One was ‘Humpty Dumpty’. Another was ‘Ralph Coates’, who played for Tottenham in the 1970s.” The Directors Guild of America would not allow Kaye to change his name, and he has bitterly lived with the accolade of directing the cult classic ever since.220 Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen – Michael BayThe first Transformers was a decent-enough popcorn flick. Critics may not have been enamoured by the CGI blockbuster, but there’s no denying watching robots beating each other up is mindless entertainment of the highest order. Yet, Michael Bay managed to make a mess of that simple winning formula in the sequel, Revenge of the Fallen, something he later admitted. When I look back at it, that was crap,” he said of the film in 2011. “The writers\u0027 strike was coming hard and fast. It was just terrible to do a movie where you\u0027ve got to have a story in three weeks. I was prepping a movie for months where I only had 14 pages of some idea of what the movie was. It\u0027s a BS way to make a movie.”While Swedish director Tomas Alfredson received acclaim for the Oscar-nominated Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, his follow-up film, the mystery thriller The Snowman, was ripped apart by critics. “Our shoot time in Norway was way too short,” he explained following the film’s release. “We didn’t get the whole story with us and when we started cutting we discovered that a lot was missing.” Alfredson added that, despite The Snowman being in development for years, with Martin Scorsese once attached as director, around 10 to 15 per cent of the script was not filmed. “It’s like when you’re making a big jigsaw puzzle and a few pieces are missing so you don’t see the whole picture,” he added.420 Avengers: Age of Ultron – Joss WhedonJoss Whedon changed cinema with The Avengers. The ensemble film brought a host of disparate superheroes together, and in the process made over $1.5 billion (£1.15 billion) at the box-office. Balancing all those characters was tough, and come the sequel, Age of Ultron, the director was worn down. Whedon apparently couldn’t muster the ability to watch the entire film after completion, saying: “I’m tied and I had a terrible time.” A year later, in 2016, the filmmaker clarified his comments. “I was so beaten down by the process. Some of that was conflicting with Marvel, which is inevitable. A lot of it was about my own work, and I was also exhausted.” Whedon added that he remains “proud” of the film, yet there are still things about the film that “frustrate” him hugely. Noah Baumbach is now a beloved indie filmmaker (thanks to The Squid and the Whale, Frances Ha, and The Meyerowitz Stories). Yet he was not always an acclaimed director. Baumbach despised his second film, Highball, so much that his directing credit was changed to Ernie Fusco and his writer’s one to Jesse Carter. “It was just too ambitious,” he said of the film, which concerns a newly married couple who end up inviting too many people to their Brooklyn flat for a party. “We didn\u0027t have enough time, we didn\u0027t finish it, it didn\u0027t look good, it was just a whole ... mess. We couldn\u0027t get it done, and I had a falling out with the producer. He abandoned it, and I had no money to finish it, to go back and maybe get two more days or something. Then later, it was put out on DVD without my approval.”Before Babylon AD – a futuristic sci-fi flick about a mercenary who has to escort a woman from Russia to America – reached cinemas in the UK, the director, Mathieu Kassovitz, was trying to distance himself from the Vin Diesel-led project. The movie is supposed to teach us that the education of our children will mean the future of our planet,” he said. “All the action scenes had a goal: they were supposed to be driven by either a metaphysical point of view or experience for the characters... instead parts of the movie are like a bad episode of 24. Kassovitz later added the film was pure violence and stupidity.In 1992, Dennis Hopper joined the ranks of directors who released their film under the pseudonym Alan Smithee (famously used when filmmakers disown their own film). Originally called Catchfire, the Jodie Foster-starring thriller about a woman who enters witness protection was later retitled Backtrack, and 20 minutes were cut for the straight-to-VHS release. Hopper rarely spoke about the film he wanted to distance himself as much as possible from the doomed project.“I think it’s a beautiful film to look at and I think the score is beautiful,” Steven Soderberg said of The Underneath, “but 15 seconds in I know we’re in trouble because of how f***ing long it takes to get through those opening credits. That’s just an indication of what’s wrong with this thing: it’s just totally sleepy.” The film, about a recovering gambling addict, was an unsurprising box-office flop. “I can’t say I’d recommend it to anyone,” Soderbergh added, “other than to look at in the context of someone’s career”.Alan Taylor – of Game of Thrones and Sopranos fame – seemed a perfect fit for Thor, the heroic God of Thunder who spoke in Shakespearean prose. When the sequel was released, many were disappointed with the film, which somehow wasted Christopher Eccleston, who played the villain. Taylor later criticised the project, saying: “The Marvel experience was particularly wrenching because I was sort of given absolute freedom while we were shooting, and then in post it turned into a different movie. So, that is something I hope never to repeat and don’t wish upon anybody else.”1120 Fear and Desire – Stanley KubrickFew filmmakers have spotless filmographies. Stanley Kubrick believed the blotch on his was Fear and Desire – the renowned-perfectionist’s cinematic debut. As his stature as a director grew, Kubrick was said to grow ever-more disgruntled with Fear and Desire, an anti-war film about four soldiers trapped behind enemy lines. Reports emerged in the Sixties that Kubrick had destroyed the original negative print, and was hoping to destroy all leftover prints. In 1964, Kubrick called the film “a serious effort, ineptly done”.1220 Batman and Robin – Joel SchumacherAlmost everyone involved with Batman \u0026amp Robin seems to hate the final product. George Clooney has apologised for his Bat-nippled version of the Caped Crusader, while director Joel Schumacher has said sorry multiple times. “Look, I apologise,” he said in 2017. “I want to apologise to every fan that was disappointed because I think I owe them that.” After the widely maligned film reached cinemas, Schumacher said he was treated like “scum”. “It was like I had murdered a baby,” he continued.1320 The Day the Clown Cried – Jerry LewisJerry Lewis’s The Day the Clown Cried has never been released. The director, who also starred as the leading character, locked the film – about a clown arrested in Nazi Germany for drunkenly defaming Hitler – in a private vault after completion. Lewis thought the film was so “bad, bad, bad” that he often refused to discuss the project, only commenting very occasionally. I was ashamed of the work and I was grateful I had the power to contain it all and never let anyone see it. It could have been wonderful but I slipped up – I didn\u0027t quite get it,” he said in 2013.Everything was looking good for Fantastic Four before filming began.

The film was then retitled Accidental Love and released in cinemas, with the director’s name changed to Stephen Greene. Critics hated the results. Since then, the film has suffered setbacks including director Danny Boyle quitting over reports of creative differences, which were rumoured to have something to do with Craig and producer Barbara Broccoli wanting to kill Bond at the end of the film. There\u0026nbsphave also been\u0026nbspa number of on-set incidents including Craig injuring his ankle in May, which halted filming for two weeks.Here\u0027s a timeline of everything that\u0027s gone wrong with\u0026nbspBond 25\u0026nbsp(so far).October 2015: Daniel Craig claims he would rather “slash my wrists” than play Bond again during promo for the latest film,\u0026nbspSpectre,\u0026nbspand that if he did another film, it would “only be for the money”.August 2017: After two years of speculation over whether he would reprise the role of Bond, Daniel Craig confirms that he will return as the British spy during an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. He said it would be his last outing as Bond and that he wanted to “go out on a high note”.August 2018: Danny Boyle leaves the project over “creative differences”\u0026nbspand disputes about the script, leaving the film in chaos and no way to meet the planned release date of autumn 2019. An unconfirmed report in The Sun claims that he quit over Broccoli and Craig\u0027s suggestion to kill 007 at the end of the movie, which Boyle allegedly thought was ridiculous.September 2018: Cary Fukunaga is announced as Boyle’s replacement.Health and safety bosses probe James Bond film set Explosion on set of Bond 25 injures one crew memberApril 2019: Launch event in Jamaica is disappointment for fans with the title still unconfirmed.

Some 963 arrests have been made and 42 people charged in connection with the ongoing protestsThe BBC’s director-general, Tony Hall, said: “It would not be right simply to abolish all free licences.“Equally it would not be right to maintain it in perpetuity given the very profound impact that would have on many BBC services.“This decision is fairest for the poorest pensioners. It protects those most in need. And importantly, it is not the BBC making that judgement about poverty. It is the government who sets and controls that measure.“We also need to look at how the level of the licence fee is set in the future. The last two settlements have been made in the dark and without proper consultation.“It is vital that future decisions are evidence-based and made after proper consultation and scrutiny. We need to find a better way.”Funding the full free licence scheme would have cost the BBC some £750m\u0026nbspa year, or about\u0026nbspone-fifth of its budget,\u0026nbspthe corporation said.“We expect this would mean the closures of BBC Two, BBC Four, the BBC News channel, the BBC Scotland channel, Radio 5 Live, and a number of local radio stations, as well as other cuts and reductions,” it said in a statement.Special needs children discouraged from applying to schools amid cutsThe decision followed a consultation of 190,000 people.A government spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“We’re very disappointed with this decision – we’ve been clear that we want and expect the BBC to continue this concession.“People across the country value television as a way to stay connected, and we want the BBC to look at further ways to support older people.“Taxpayers want to see the BBC using its substantial licence fee income in an appropriate way to ensure it delivers for UK audiences, which includes showing restraint on salaries for senior staff.”Labour’s Tom Watson called on the Tories vying to succeed Theresa May as leader\u0026nbspto “honour the commitment they made in 2017”.“You cannot means test for social isolation. You cannot means test for loneliness,” the deputy opposition leader, and shadow culture secretary, added.Hannah Bardell, the SNP culture spokesperson, said the decision was “daylight robbery”. She tweeted: “Predicating the free TV licence on pension credit which has already been cut is a deeply damaging \u0026amp cynical act of betrayal.”Jan Shortt, general secretary of campaign group the National Pensioners Convention, warned that pension credit was “massively under-claimed”, meaning some of the poorest older people will wrongly miss out on free TV.A government report published in autumn last year estimated that up to 1.3 million families who were entitled to claim the benefit did not do so.TV Licensing, the body responsible for collection and enforcement of the television licence, said it will contact every customer currently in receipt of a free over-75s licence to explain what steps they would need to take next.It said everyone currently eligible for the scheme would remain covered by a free licence until 31 May 2020.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But that is just one theory on where it may have come from, and scientists stress that it is still unknown what the material is and where it might have come from.Imagine taking a pile of metal five times larger than the Big Island of Hawaii and burying it underground. That\u0027s roughly how much unexpected mass we detected, said Peter B James,\u0026nbspassistant professor of planetary geophysics in Baylor\u0027s College of Arts \u0026amp Sciences and lead author on a new study of the huge chunk.The crater that the mass sits on top of is over-shaped and 2,000 kilometers wide.

One of the explanations of this extra mass is that the metal from the asteroid that formed this crater is still embedded in the Moon\u0027s mantle.Scientists simulated a possible collision with an asteroid on a computer, and found that some kinds of metal could settle into the layer between the crust and the core, where this chunk is still sitting.We did the math and showed that a sufficiently dispersed core of the asteroid that made the impact could remain suspended in the Moon\u0027s mantle until the present day, rather than sinking to the Moon\u0027s core, Professor James said in a statement.If it is an asteroid impact, then it could be an unprecedented look at the kinds of collisions that were happening four billion years ago, when the crater was formed. Bigger impacts are thought to have happened through history – even on Earth – but they have been lost with time, and so the crater could be a way of looking back at a process that shaped our own planet and those that surround us.But the mass might also have formed with the Moon itself. It might be a build-up of dense gas that came about when the Moon formed into the large solid mass that we know today.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s why we support a Final Say on BrexitAnd they challenged the invocation of wartime patriotism by the Leave camp, pointing out that it was Sir Winston Churchill who called for the creation of a “European family” to prevent another descent into bloodshed.Churchill’s words helped inspire the creation of the Common Market, which evolved into the European Union with “one main purpose - to create lasting peace by entwining our economies and societies together on a continent once ravaged by war,” they said.“Nato does not keep the peace in Europe – it keeps peace for Europe. It is the EU that keeps peace in Europe, because when you trade, you do not fight.Created with Sketch.D-Day 75: Normandy landings in pictures Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created

Thirteen nations, including British, Irish, French and Dutch, also Belgians, Poles and Czechs - from all branches of the services - were part of that liberation coalition.“As Europeans, we were stronger together then and should be stronger together now.”He added: “What has happened since 2016 is very disturbing, and it’s clear that the military aspects of Brexit weren’t thought about properly.“Politicians trying to force us out of the EU without going back to the people are cowards, not leaders.

Speaking to Sky News as she announced her bid, Leadsom claimed to be a decisive and compassionate leader. She will prepare to leave without a deal but claims to have a three-point plan for Brexit which she will set out later in the race. Michael Gove, the environment secretary,  is leaning on his extensive government experience, having served in 3 cabinet roles since 2010, to make the case that he is suited to lead.

If there is a tie for last place, officials will speak to the two candidates involved to see whether both should drop out or the ballot be re-run.A second ballot will be held on 18 June, with candidates needing 33 votes or more to survive. Again, if all pass the threshold, the one at the bottom of the list will be removed.By this point, the field should have been considerably narrowed, and further rounds of voting will take place on the following days in the hope of producing a final two by Thursday 20 JuneBetween each ballot, intensive horse-trading can be expected in Westminster as the surviving candidates seek to poach one another’s supporters and hoover up the backers of eliminated candidates.The final two contenders will go through to a postal ballot of an estimated 160,000 party members around the country in July, with the result currently expected in the week of 22 July.It emerged on Thursday that there is no guarantee the new leader’s name will be announced before parliament breaks up for its summer recess, potentially denying the opposition an opportunity to test whether he or she can command a majority in the House of Commons as prime minister.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The planes will fly, the ferries will ply.The -year-old also pledged to pay for a massive tax break for million Brits through money reserved for a No Deal exit - despite being pro No Deal.Mr Hunt was the longest-serving Health Secretary in British history before replacing Boris as Foreign Secretary.He left the Department of Health after securing a £bn funding increase for the NHS, but was hated by junior doctors after changing their contracts so they wouldnt receive extra pay for the many shts they work - previously classied as unsociable hours.Despite campaigning for Remain during the referendum, Hunt now backs the UKs withdrawal from the EU.Just hours after Mrs May resigned, he put his name into the hat to be in the running to replace her.On June , Trade Secretary Liam Fox threw his support behind Hunt in a surprise move, followed by prominent leaver and defence secretary Penny Mordaunt.Though an unlikely candidate at the time, Brexit campaigner Leadsom reached the final two of the  leadership contest.She withdrew over ill-judged remarks about Theresa May not being a mother.Leadsom resigned as Leader of the House on May , ,  with reports claiming May begged her not to go.The Environment Secretary has achieved a remarkable turnaround since kning Boris Johnson during the  leadership contest.His support among party members dropped through the floor and it seemed his chances were gone for ever.But Mr Gove, who led the Leave campaign in the EU referendum, has rebranded himself as an ecowarrior as Environment Secretary.He has also thrown his full support behind Theresa Mays Brexit plan, winning him friends among MPsnot the party faithful.He also said No Deal must be kept on the table.Gove has admitted taking cocaine in a bombshell confession dropped in the midst of the Tory leadership contest - which could upset his chances.The would-be PM said he deeply regrets using the substance as a young journalist more than  years ago.The Home Secretary ended up backing Remain during the EU referendum but is popular among the Tory parliamentary party.Mr Javid was appointed Home Sec in the wake of the Windrush scandal and the resignation of Amber Rudd.A known Eurosceptic, some of his statements and his backing for a harder Brexit have been taken as signs he is pitching for the leadership.The MP for Bromsgrove in Worcs is a former managing director from Deutsche Bank.On May , Javid announced his bid to run for PM.The former Brexit Secretary quit the cabinet in protest over Theresa Mays soft orce deal with the EU.Raab has insisted No Deal wouldnt be chaotic for Britain and said the short-term risks were manageable.He has blasted those who want to extend Article  or a second referendum.He said: If theres an attempt to reverse the referendum, stop Brexit altogether I think that would cut across not only the democratic mandate, the biggest in history we had.Prisons Minister Rory Stewart MP put himself forward to replace May as Prime Minister on April , .Mr Stewart told the Spectator: “Dficult periods need dferent types of people.One of the reasons why I would be tempted towards this job is that we desperately need to rebuild ourselves internationally after Brexit. I am one of the only people in Parliament who is a genuine specialist.”Mr Stewart studied at Oxford and tutored Princes William and Harry in his spare time.The Health Secretary tried to break the ice in a crunch Cabinet meeting in May by turning up with a packet of waffles.Hes already raked in £, in donations from digital tech entrepreneurs, The Sun revealed on May .And hes won admirers for his positive and optimistic brand of conservatism and his track record of getting things done.Hancocks vowed to reject populismelected.Ms McVey has said that the next PM must believe in Brexit.The Tory leadership candidate has backed a No Deal Brexit.On May  she said that Britain should immediately end Brexit talks and go all out for an unscheduled withdrawal.Mark Harper, , was the th Tory to declare his candidacy for the partys leadership.After graduating from Oxford in PPE he became a chartered accountant before becoming an MP for the Forest of Dean in .He has served as a junior minister in the Cabinet Office before becoming an Immigration Minister and then the Minister for Disabled People.Harper then held the position of Government Chief Whip between May  and July  under David Cameron.He hasnt served under Theresa Mays administration and has positioned himself as offering fresh thinking for both the party and the approach to Brexit.During the EU referendum campaign in  he backed remain.Theresa May stepped down as Tory leader without delivering Brexit and with her party on the verge of extinction.May claimed she had done all she could to take Britain out of the EU with a deal, saying: Ever since I first stepped through the door behind me as Prime Minister, I have striven to make the United Kingdom a country that works not just for a privileged few, but for everyone. And to honour the result of the EU referendum.If you give people a choice you have a duty to implement what they decide. I have done my best to do that.Sadly I have not been able to do so. I tried three times - I believe it was right to persevere even when the odds against success seemed high.May survived a vote of no confidence in December , but repeated thwarted attempts to pass her Brexit deal left her without authority.May remains as Prime Minister until a new party leader is found in July."},{"url":null,"title":"who matt hancock health secretary tory mp","story":"But who is he and why did he decide to run  Here is what you need to know.Matthew Hancock, , replaced Jeremy Hunt as Health Secretary on July , .The former Culture Secretary was educated at the private Kings School in Chester and Oxford University.At Oxford, he studied politics, philosophy and economics.He also has a masters degree in economics from Cambridge.After uni he worked at the Bank of England and then as an adviser to George Osborne when he was shadow chancellor.On May , , Hancock announced he was going to run to be PM.It followed a hilarious encounter on Good Morning Britain when he wolfed down a waffle immediately before going on air on ITVs Good Morning Britain.He later tweeted: “Nothing wrong with a bit of waffle in politics from time to time.”Launching his bid, Hancock said: I believe from the bottom of my heart that we need a leader for the future, not just for now.He is backed by David Lidington, who believes hes the ideal candidate as he has no Brexit baggage.Hancock has so far vowed to tax the nations bookies to raise at least £million a year to fight gambling addiction.The Tory leadership outsider will target the moderate vote by aping Labour and promising to slap a minimum  per cent compulsory tax on bookies profits - to pay for an increase in research and treatment for gambling addiction.Hes also claimed an early Commons Brexit vote could lead to a backstop concession.Hancock was first elected as MP for West Suffolk in .From  to  he served in David Camerons government in a number of junior and middle-ranking ministerial roles, including skills minister and paymaster general.Theresa May made him a junior minister in the culture department in July .In the January  reshuffle he was promoted to Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.He celebrated his first night in the job by partying with Rita Ora and Dermot OLeary at a London Fashion Week dinner.Hancock has three young children with his we, Martha, who is an osteopath.According to the Financial Times, the Hancock family decamps from London to his Newmarket constituency home at weekends, so his work-le balance is a challenge.He said: “I pay a lot of attention to timetabling. Both my professional and social and family time gets booked up a long way in advance and then you have to be strict about it.”His website says he is the first MP in modern times to win a horse race after riding to victory at Newmarket in August .He also claims to have played the most northerly game of cricket on record, and succumbed to frostbite en route to the Pole.In February , the minister launched an app - called Matt Hancock - on the iOS and Android s.It is packed with cringeworthy posts advertising the MPs constituency activities and encouraging the public to connect with him.Fans who join up are met with a video message from the minister.They can then view a large gallery of pictures and videos of Mr Hancock, updates about his work, and an archive of his speeches.People can also get in touch with each other, and users were quick to point out this feature of the app is almost identical to Facebook.Within hours the app was swamped with jokers and fake profiles with names such as Donald Trump and Theresa May.Users compared it to a scene from The Thick Of It, and even his parliamentary colleagues began taking the mick.One Twitter user joked: I actually met my girlfriend on the Matt Hancock app but we tell people we met at a bar.Mr Hancock was forced to post a message insisting the service was aimed at my West Suffolk constituents.But the minister - who oversees data protection policy - faced humiliation after claims the app breaches online privacy rules.Users downloading it on iPhones said it was accessing their photos and data even after they refused it permission to do so.A spokeswoman for Mr Hancock’s constituency office said the app “uses standard Apple technology, for example iOS photopicker technology for access to the camera”.Mr Hancock denied the app had a bug, saying it had been fully certied by Apple.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Mayor should scrap this £K event and use the money instead to keep Newham residents safe.This absurd situation would be funnyit wasn’t such a shocking indictment of this Mayor’s skewed priorities. People will rightly question why Khan is prioritising paddling pools over the safety of vulnerable Londoners.The Mayor has repeatedly said he cant spent more cash on police and fighting crime as his central budgets have been cut too much.Last years pop-up party featured street food stalls and classic film screenings too.The final bill came to an eye-watering £,, we revealed last year.The money for the beach project came from the London Economic Action Partnership - which works under the Mayors office.The cash for the project was from business rates generated in the local area., Londoners flocked to the beach to enjoy a -metre swimming lido, a sun deck, street food stalls and musical entertainment - all for free.A spokesperson for the Mayor of London said: The Royal Docks is set to become a major new district for London with up to , jobs and , new affordable homes. It is set to attract more than £ billion of investment by  .This summer we will be launching the Join The Docks festival with a range of activities for the local community, including a new Kids Summer Splash event.This community festival is funded entirely from local business rates, which must be used for the regeneration of the Royal Docks. It is a small but crucial part of the wider £. million investment programme and is key to supporting the local community in the Royal Docks."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy corbyn opinion brits love country","story":"The nation was remembering a debt that can never be repaid to the generation who bought our freedom with their youth, their blood and their lives.And Labour’s leader was ranting bug-eyed at a rally where many were seemingly convinced that the American president is a “Nazi”.No — Nazis built factories for the industrial slaughter of six million men, women and children. Nazis enslaved Europe until a generation gave their all to wipe that evil creed from the earth. Nazis — real Nazis! — were waiting for those men and boys when they landed on those hellish beaches  years ago.As our Queen welcomed the democratically elected leader of the country that fought by our side in Normandy, Corbyn made a great show of boycotting Trump’s state banquet but attending the anti-Trump protest.And Corbyn never looked more like a -year-old student. The Americans are not simply our oldest allies, Jeremy, the Americans are our biggest trading partners. Who are we going to trade withyou ever get to  Downing Street  Venezuela  Palestine Jeremy Corbyn made a massive misjudgement by so flamboyantly snubbing Trump. And I suspect that somewhere in his mediocre old mind, Jezza knows it. That is why he later begged Trump for a meeting, which the President took great delight in denying.The Queen showed Corbyn how it should be done. Whatever Her Majesty’s personal feelings about this brash American President — and she seems to quite like him — she welcomed Trump with grace and dignity.The Queen’s treatment of her American guest was not simply good diplomacy. It was good manners. And the British care about good manners. To insult the American President as we honoured the American boys who never went home was, more than anything, just so unforgivably RUDE. Does Jeremy Corbyn know nothing of the British people Millions find it mind-boggling that he can happily break bread with Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA but refuses to share a state dinner with the President of the United States.Corbyn has spent so long in the self-loathing sewer of the hard Left that he has lost sight of a simple truth — most British people have a deep and profound love for this country.This week was a reminder that we have so much to be proud of. A nation looked at that dwindling band of brothers who stormed the beaches of Normandy and felt nothing but gratitude for their sacrice.There is an instinctive patriotism in our people that Corbyn and his Marxist muppets simply do not understand or share. Labour may have clung on to their seat in Peterborough by the skin of Corbyn’s dentures, but the virtue-signalling old booby never looked less like a potential Prime Minister.The oldest student in town does not look ready to form a government. He looks ready for a care home. The compulsive halo-polishing goes down a storm on social media, Mr Corbyn. It just doesn’t work in the real world.If the day ever comes when Corbyn is drooling on the doorstep of  Downing Street, is he only going to do business with people he approves of  How lonely he will be!GEORGE MICHAEL was the most generous of men. When we wrote his autobiography together, we innocently shook hands on splitting the profits -. But a ghost writer does not usually get the same payday as the global superstar with his name on the front cover.When we wrote our book, George was coming off the back of his first solo album, Faith, and was possibly the biggest star in the world. His American managers confidently assured my agent that our - deal was never going to happen. But it did – because George Michael insisted on it.He had given his word and we had shaken hands. George didn’t care about money. He cared about friendship.  So it was interesting to see how George’s last will and testimony ided his £.million fortune.Among those included are George’s -year-old dad, Kyriacos, his sisters Melanie and Yioda, and his friends Shirlie Kemp and David Austin. Those who didn’t make the cut included his lovers Kenny Goss and Fadi Fawaz, and his old Wham! buddy, Andrew Ridgeley.But Kenny and Fadi enjoyed the good le at George’s side for many years while Andrew has a joint songwriting credit on Careless Whisper, which has been worth around £million in royalties. Not bad, as Andrew was never particularly known for his songwriting genius.George probably felt he had taken good care of Kenny, Fadi and Andrew in le. George could be stubborn, self-destructive and self-obsessed. But he was a beautul man. And he had the biggest heart in the world.THEY are all queuing up to kick Anthony Joshua while he is down. Tyson Fury initially made sympathetic noises when Joshua got battered on his American debut by roly-poly Andy Ruiz Jr, a - underdog who resembles Homer Simpson’s body double.But now the Gypsy King has joined the sadistic joy in Joshua’s humiliation and recommends AJ, “never shows his face in public again”. Madison Square Garden was a catastrophe for Joshua.He was beaten up by a chubby chops who was such a late booking that his name did not even appear on the tickets.  But Ruiz was always more than a Snickers addict. Before Joshua, he had fought  times and only lost once. Ruiz was never going to be a walkover for Joshua.But AJ should have found a way to beat him. And such is the brutal nature of boxing that Joshua now needs to win a rematch with Ruiz Jrhe is to salvage his career.Joshua seemed strangely off in New York, distracted and uncertain, absent-mindedly pushing out his gum shield during the ring walk, weirdly smiley after the ref waved off the fight.  But Joshua has been a great advertisement for British boxing.And there is no shame in losing a boxing match. Muhammad Ali lost five times. Floyd Mayweather never lost. Now you tell me – who is the greater man SIOBAHN PRIGENT is the woman seen screaming “Nazi scum!” at a lone Trump supporter, then cackling with sadistic delight when the mob splatters the POTUS fan with a milkshake.Some social media users say that it is wrong to mention Prigent’s generous girth when commenting on her repulsive behaviour. Fat-shaming, they call it.  That’s rich!It was the protesters who made a great show of flying their big-bellied, fat- bottomed balloon.Sothere is fat-shaming being done, Siobhan Prigent’s side started it.IN a week of heroes, the bravery of one little girl shone brightest.Harmonie-Rose Allen lost her arms and legs to meningitis one month before her first birthday.It was my honour to know quite a few war veterans.They have all gone now, but every one of them would have saluted the courage of this incredible little girl.MILEY CYRUS protests abortion bans in some US states by posing with grapefruits over her bare breasts.“Don’t f*** with my freedom!” warns Miley.I HAVE my doubts about the remake of Worzel Gummidge with Mackenzie Crook playing the lead scarecrow.Jon Pertwee’s Worzel had a kind of raggedy, grandfatherly charm.This new Worzel looks like one of the undead coming to get you in Pirates Of The Caribbean.Who would have thought that Worzel Gummidge would ever lose his looks Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She had been trying to die for a long time. Euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal in the Netherlands.Noa asked the Levenseinde end-of-le clinic in The Hague two years agoshe could be considered for euthanasia or assisted suicide but they — rightly — refused.She told De Gelderlander newspaper in December: “They consider that I am too young to die. They think I should finish my trauma treatment and that my brain must first be fully grown.That lasts until your st birthday. It’s broken me, because I can’t wait that long.” No one, surely, could read those words without agreeing that yes, she was too young to die. Right Most of us have enough le experience to know that, no matter how bad things are, or seem to be, dark clouds can hang around — but they do sht.Things change. Hopelessness gives way to hope. And dark often eventually becomes light. But Noa didn’t believe it.There is no doubt at all that her young le had been incredibly dficult. She’d had extensive treatment for depression and anorexia, and had tried to kill herself several times.She had been sexually assaulted at the age of  and raped at . She was so traumatised she didn’t want to live any more and, after repeated hospital stays, decided to stop treatment earlier this year.In what she referred to as a “sorrowful last post” on Instagram, Noa said she had “stopped eating and drinking for a while now, and after many discussions and evaluations, it has been decided to let me go, because my suffering is unbearable”.A hospital bed was set up in her parents’ home and last week she refused all food and fluids after her parents and doctors reportedly agreed not to force-feed her.It is pretty much impossible for most of us to understand quite how desperate, resigned, despairing this woman’s parents must have been to have facilitated their daughter’s voluntary death.They must all have felt sure that there was no alternative. But it’s also hard to resist the urge to challenge that notion.There are so many examples of people — from Maya Angelou to Malala Yousafzai to JK Rowling — who have overcome adversity to make a huge success of their lives.I know many people who have overcome very dficult, challenging and dark times as teenagers who have gone on to create fulfilling and happy relationships and live rewarding and successful lives.I think it’s fair to say that, as a teenager, it’s impossible to imagine the future. It’s all too easy to be so mired in the dficulties of the present that you feel you will be stuck there for ever.Without in any way diminishing Noa’s suffering, I do know there were things that felt to me like a crisis at  that I barely now recall.I would take the view that it’s possible to get over even the most dficult challenges — evenit involves temporary defeat, sometimes total failure, it is how you react that sets your path.The big question that this story raises is, should we be allowed to choose to die  Ultimately, I think the answer to that is yes, we should. But does anyone know enough about living at the age of  to choose to die  I don’t think so.IT IS striking that this week a new Lancet study confirmed what many of us already know: Self-harm among young women and girls is rising at an “alarming” rate.What on earth is happening to our young people  Our young women in particular. What is the cause of this epidemic of self-loathing, self-harm, self-destruction When I was a teenager I had problems, sure, but nothing that would have driven me to harm myself.But so many parents now have to deal with their children hurting themselves as a daily reality – and my heart goes out to them. I don’t have the solution. But I do have a few theories about how to help kids thrive.Sport is really, really good for kids. It builds self-esteem and gives them another focus than themselves, their bodies, and whether they measure up to the people they follow on Instagram.Social media can be a force for good. But it can make young people feel really bad too. Help your kids to find other outlets, hobbies and passions.Talk to your kids about everything. And listen. Be un-shockable. My daughter – for better or worse! – still tells me everything. No subjects are taboo and they never have been or will be.If you accept your child for who they are, you will help them to be their authentic selves, rather than trying to be someone they are not. That is one of the greatest gts you can give them.I CONFESS to a tear in my eye watching the moment when Nicolas Mahut’s son rushed on court to console his father about losing to Leonardo Mayer at the French Open.Their hug was so heartfelt, and incredibly sweet and touching.It was a great reminder that relationships matter so much more than winning ever will.DID you hear the one about the woman who sold her husband’s £, football memorabilia for a fiver after seeing him cheating Shelly Cohen, , from Warrington, Cheshire, was sick of husband Paul putting his love of the beautul game before their relationship.When a friend texted her to say she’d seen her husband at a Manchester City match with another woman, that was it.She gathered together his prized memorabilia collection, which dates back  years, and listed it for sale on her husband’s OnBuy account.Then she flogged his £, memorabilia collection for a fiver. All I can say is: OUCH!SEEING all the state banquets this week has reminded me about my own visits to Buckingham Palace.I’ve been to white-tie events there as well as an intimate lunch with the Queen.I’ve also had dinner at Winfield House, which belongs to the American ambassador, in the same room that Trump had dinner.And they really are momentous occasions. I mean, just getting ready is fairly momentous.Although for most of them, despite the best-laid plans, I ended up rushing home from work and throwing something on.Some things I remember, in no particular order – after dinner, I really wanted to go to the toilet. But no one is allowed to leave until the Queen does, so I had to just hold on, and on, and on.I practised my curtsey before I went. That’s because when I was given my CBE by Prince William I was given so many instructions about how many steps to take to the left, right, and backwards that when the time came to curtsey I ended up doing a SQUAT!So I thought a YouTube tutorial might be a good idea. When our last course arrived – a plate with a bowl plus a cloth – I didn’t know what it was.Luckily, I was sitting next to the delightful Lord Chamberlain, Earl William Peel, who told me that the bowl was to wash fruit and the cloth was to dry it.Lastly, the Queen really is the world’s most professional conversationalist.She knew about the Olympic Stadium and football, and talked about both of them as though she was really interested.Despite all the pomp and ceremony, I was made to feel absolutely comfortable. But I definitely had more than a moment of thinking, “Pinch me, I’m at Buckingham Palace!”There is no doubt that Donald Trump’s trip was a great success. But my main take home from everything I saw was, what I wouldn’t give to have Melania’s wardrobe! Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

When my brothers and I were young, I remember my mum watching over us to ensure we were doing our reading at the library. She would make sure we’d done all our homework.Nothing out of the ordinary for most families, but my mother didn’t speak English. She wasn’t taught. When she was growing up in Pakistan, village girls didn’t go to school.People in Westminster sometimes say to me, “Saj, you’ve got a great backstory. But what does it mean in practice  Aren’t you just another politician ”With respect – I think that’s rubbish. I remember the pride in my mum’s eyes as her kids, with a decent education behind them, were able to succeed beyond her wildest dreams.I remember how she did all she could to lay the foundation for us to get on – leaving her home, living in poverty, working overnight at the Singer sewing machine in our kitchen to ensure we didn’t have to go to work but could get on with our studies.Hers is a unique story, but not that much dferent from the millions of Brits who make those sacrices for their children.So as Prime Minister – with the whole of the Government behind me – I will make our schools and colleges the envy of the world.Education will be my guiding mission in Downing Street. Today I’ve announced a plan that will transform our education and skills system.We’ll be there at the earliest years, to tackle the attainment gap. We’ll commission experts to deliver a multi-year, multi- billion-pound funding plan for our schools.And, as a former student of a further education college, I’ll treat them with the seriousness they deserve.For a changing economy, we’ll deliver skills and lelong learning to ensure that our people don’t just survive but thrive in the st century.There’s another thing I remember about my mum.She never let me make excuses. AndI became Prime Minister, I wouldn’t. How can you, with all the machinery of Government behind you So I promise you – no s, no buts, no excuses.I’ll give the next generation of Brits a fair go at getting on.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Also promised to ditch business rates for struggling small high street businesses.Meanwhile, this morning frontrunner Boris Johnson has pledged to cut higher rates of income taxhe gets into No.The Tory leadership hopeful wants to use the money put aside for a No Deal Brexit to cut taxes for Brits earning between £, and £,, which he says will boost the economy.But fellow leadership rival Andrea Leadsom warned that with a hung Parliament it would be impossible to get wholesale tax changes through.And tax experts said it would benefit richer pensioners the most.Tory colleague Nicky Morgan branded the move unfair and David Gauke said it shouldnt be a priority for the party right now.A YouGov poll this afternoon showed the public was split over the plans - with  per cent supporting it and  per cent against.However, Boris got a boost as ex-Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers and MPs Matthew Offord and Colin Clark rolled in behind him today.And Ben Wallace announced he would back the ex-Foreign Secretary as he reaches parts of the country none of the other candidates do.Brexit: Boris is set to officially kick off his campaign later in the week, but has vowed to take Britain out of the EU with or without a deal on October . Said he will withhold the £billion orce bill until we get a better deal.Tax: Also wants to cut stamp duty on homes, saying its absurdly high.Dominic Raab promised to raise the NI threshold to pay for pay rises for lower paid Brits as the kicked off his campaign earlier.He vowed to take the lowest paid out of payroll taxes altogether by raising it to £, - saving some £ a year.He also focused on climate change in his speech this morning with a package of proposals to develop clean energy and protect the environment.Weve got to look to the future, he will say.Weve got to leave the environment in a better state than we found it.Brexit: Has said hes prepared to leave with No Deal, or even shut down Parliament to make it happen.Im the Brexiteer you can rely on, he promised.We wont be taken seriously in Brussels unless were willing to walk away on WTO terms.Tax: Wants to cut a penny off income tax for everyone.My tax cuts are for the very poorest in work, he said in a swipe at his rival Boris.Mr Hunt said today: This extremely serious moment calls for an experienced, serious leader. We need the art of tough negotiation, not the art of empty rhetoric.But he warned that not delivering Brexit and being squeezed by the Lib Dems and the Brexit Party would allow Labour through the middle and for Jeremy Corbyn to come into No.Mr Hunt promised his social mission would be education - vowing to abolish illiteracy and ensure no one leaves school without a proper qualication to earn the average salary.Choose me and I will take us through this time of crisis, deliver Brexit, and get us back to walking tall in the world, he said.And Mr Hunt got two huge boosts when Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt and Tory kingmaker Amber Rudd threw their weight behind him to be leader.Ms Mordaunt, who some speculated could run for the leadership herself, said at Mr Hunts speech today: I trust him on Brexit because Ive seen him in Cabinet in the last year... [and] I want the next PM to plug the financial hole in our security and defence budgets.Ms Rudd said this morning: These are serious times and we need a respected statesman who Brussels will listen to, not more bluster.But she gave a huge hint he promised her he would not change the time limit on abortions down to  weeks as the price for her support.There will be no change to abortion lawand when he becomes prime minister, she told Radio  earlier.We need to make sure we always protect womens’ rights to choose.Brexit: Says he would only back a No Deal Brexit with a heavy heart andhe had no other choice. Claimed Angela Merkel said she was willing to renegotiate the Brexit deal.Tax: Wants to slash corporation tax down to some of the lowest levels in Europe to boost businesses.Health Secretary Matt Hancock  commited to raising the living wage for poorer Brits.He said this morning: My mantra is move fast and make things happen.Mr Hancock refused to call a general election before delivering Brexit, saying it would be a democratic disaster.The -year-old – who kicked off his official campaign at London’s Southbank centre in front of an audience including young entrepreneurs -  claimed he trusted all of his rivals.And he said Mr Gove shouldnt be forced out of the race over his cocaine use.He said the race so far had been a “great festival of ideas”.He said it was a great time to be alive but admitted the pace of change is getting faster and that the next decade will see a fight for free speech and free enterprise.Distinguishing himself from other MPs who have been caught up in the Brexit debate, Mr Hancock said he was “fed up” with the rancour and bitterness of the past few years.Brexit: Says No Deal isnt an option for any PM as MPs will just stop it. Wants a time limit to the backstop, will set up a council to stop a hard border in Northern Ireland, and would give £billion of funding to support it, using new technologies and trusted trade schemes.Tax: Wants to slash business rates taxes for small retailers and hit Amazon and other big firms with a new levy.Esther McVey released her campaign video today promising to stand up for Britains workers and pump more money into police and schools.She also labelled Mr Gove a hypocrite for slamming middle-class earners taking coke after doing it himself.Despite being a relative outsider she appeared to have got the needed eight backers as she said earlier her nomination papers were in.Brexit: Promises to leave without a deal on October  and says Mrs Mays agreement is dead.Tax: Has said she wants to cut taxes but hasnt said which ones.June : Theresa May stands down as party leader but will continue as PM until her successor is electedJune : Nominations for the leadership open am-pm candidates must have the support of eight MPsJune : First ballot of MPs, open am-pm any candidate with fewer than  votes eliminatedJune : Second ballot , open pm-pm any candidate with fewer than  votes eliminatedJune : Third ballot , open pm-pm candidate with fewest votes eliminatedJune : Fourth ballot , open am-pm candidate with fewest votes eliminated - any further ballots needed will also take place on this dayJune : Second stage begins where votes sht from MPs to party activists who will choose between final two candidatesJuly : Result announced this week, in time for Commons recess to beginMPs need eight backers to get nominated and hand in their forms.The first round of voting will take place on Thursday.In the next round MPs will need the support of  of their colleagues, and  in the one after.Several candidates are already struggling to get the numbers needed.Sajid Javid, Rory Stewart, Andrew Leadsom and Mark Harper are also in the running.Today Sam Gyimah dropped out of the race citing a lack of support.I have decided to step back, he revealed this evening just after the pm nominations deadline.James Cleverly and Kit Malthouse have already dropped out due to a lack of support."},{"url":null,"title":"fortnite player spends uncle savings","story":"Murad Asad, , had been saving to buy a house when his nephew Alex bought more than a dozen in-game extras.He allowed Alex to use his Sony account after the boy was given the new console as a Christmas present - but warned him not to buy anything.The self-employed joiner, from Stockport, said he was horried when he woke up on Sunday morning to find his bank account had been raided.When he investigated, Murad noticed his hard-earned money had been collected by Sony PlayStation.He says his nephew was responsible for up to  separate transactions.Murads bank statement documents a series of payments ranging from £. to £..He says that despite desperate pleas to Sony and his bank, hes been told he cant be refunded.Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, Murad said: I woke up on Sunday and looked at my bank account.I am saving for a house and needed to move a few bills around and noticed there was £, missing.I looked into it and it said Sony PlayStation on my internet banking. There had been ten to  transactions all on the same day.It said it was for the game Fortnite, which I know my nephew plays, but he is six and so does not have a clue about money.He added: I told him not to buy anything, but he obviously got excited.That money was for a house I had been saving up for.Now Im absolutely skint.Murad said that when he rang his bank, staff said they had tried to make contact to warn him of unusual activity on his account.He said: Its so much money to go in one day, its just ridiculous.Thats four months of savings gone in one day.But Sony allows parents to create special child accounts that can be linked to your adult account.This lets you set a monthly spending limit, which is set to zero as standard.You can also set it higher, and then your children will be able to spend a limited amount of money each month.First, log into your main PS adult account.Then go to Settings gt Parental Controls gt Family Management.Choose Add Family Member gt Create User, and then enter your kids name and date of birth.Youll have to accept a user agreement, and then youll be given options to set specic parental controls.Xbox - Usually, the easiest way to avoid surprise Microsoft bills is by creating a special Xbox account with no payment details added.But playing Xbox multiplayer gamesrequires Xbox Live Gold Membership, which costs money.So that wont work in this case.However, you can create a special passcode thats required to very purchases.Just go Settings gt All Settings gt Accounts gt Sign-inThen choose Change My Sign-In  Security Preferences, and scroll right to Customise.Then scroll right again and select Ask For My Passkey To Make Purchases, and choose Passkey Required.Now all you have to do is pick a PIN number that your kids wont guess – so dont go with ,  or a birthday.Computer - Go into the account settings and then choose Payments.Once youre in there, simply make sure there arent any card details or linked PayPal accounts.If there are, you can very easily remove them.iPhone - Whenever you make a purchase on iPhone , youll always have to very it.Thatll be either by entering a password, using the Touch ID fingerprint scanner, or by scanning your face with Face ID.If your child doesnt know your password and isnt set up on any of these systems, youre largely safe.An email from Sony read: The transactions in question were made on a console with a dferent serial number from the one provided by you, but our investigations do not indicate that the account has been compromised as a result of internet fraud.The transactions are not eligible for a refund under the criteria outlined in the PlayStation Store cancellation policy and therefore we cannot offer a refund in this case.We do require the SEN account holder to be responsible for all activity on their account.Murad added: Sony is one of the biggest electrical companies in the world and they wont help me.Fortnite  - a game involving a hunt for weapons to kill rivals - is free but kids rack up bills on parents’ credit cards for arms upgrades and new outfits for their characters.US software firm Epic Games has so far raked in over £million from it.Many parents say their kids are hooked on the game, which has million users and three million playing at any one time.In April mum Vicky Winstanley told This Morning how her son Nathan was rushed to hospital with seizures after becoming addicted to Fortnite.She said he started having trouble staying awake and struggled with memory loss before she found him passed out on his bed.Medics said he was suffering from chronic fatigue after he spent hours playing the immersive game.Gaming addiction was classied as a medical disorder in June , meaning kids hooked on games such as Fortnite will now be able to access treatment on the NHS.The World Health Organisation told governments around the world they would be expected to incorporate gaming disorder into their health systems, after increasing evidence the addiction caused sufferers and their families severe psychological distress."},{"url":null,"title":"iran missile defence us tension persian gulf","story":"Defence minister Amir Hatami introduced the home-built surface-to-air weapon -

even as it becomes increasingly more isolated and edges towards financial ruin.Last year, the US withdrew from the Irans  nuclear deal and compelled its European allies to stop importing Iranian oil - tanking the countrys economy.Hours before Iran unveiled its new weapon, it was urging European countries like France and Germany to uphold the commitments made under the nuclear deal.Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zar said Europeans have a duty to ensure that Iran s to an economically stable position.On Friday, Iran rejected a suggestion by France to re-open nuclear talks, after much back and forth between the two countries.The new weapon has apparently already been deployed to the countrys military.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We arrived with a couple of hours left and still paid the £ parking for the whole day.Most people had no idea what was going on and you could see the confusion on faces as nobody could see these dinosaurs.There was quite a big crowd around the dinosaurs which when I arrived turned out to be a man with a puppet… Everybody was disappointed.Apparently the crowds were too big to bring out the -foot T-Rex.”The giant T-Rex was not out on the day due to sheer weight of people it was a health and safety decision on the day , it was to crowded to even try and bring it out . Safety comes first .The dinosaurs where out though we had the raptors , the ft T-Rex and the baby dinosaurs out .The viewing area was to small and to crammed . We were expecting somewhere in the region of - people out as this was our first event . We estimate that there was somewhere in the region of  times this many .We realise after running the event that the only way that many people could see the dinosaurs would be in an arena . And this is what we plan to do at our next event .The original plan was for the dinosaurs to wonder round the event stopping for photos and interacting with kids . This was not possible on the day as we did try this approach but people wear pushing and actually hanging on the dinosaurs .Chop the ft T-Rex will be out at our next event in an arena so it is safe for people to see him .This was our first event and we strive to do better at our next one . More planning and more space is required we understand this . This was a free event and we plan to keep it that way .The decision was made on the day to park cars on the embankment site as the pay and display car park was full and traffic was backing up . This was charged at £ for all day parking .

The leadership contenders’ initiatives are little more than wishful thinking.Above all, the expensive promises are just a gigantic distraction from the real task ahead: the delivery of Brexit. That is what really matters. Everything  is an irrelevance.The Tories’ entire future depends on the achievement of British independence. If that goal is reached, there is a chance of recovery, especially against the ided, ineptly-led Labour party.Butthe Tories fail to implement Brexit, they will be annihilated at the next General Election, a truth reinforced by the Peterborough by-election last week, when the Tories, in territory they have traditionally held since , were squeezed into a distant third place by Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party.Yet the leadership candidates continue dishing out their frivolous commitments like confetti. Here are just some of the ill-conceived promises made on the campaign trail so far...Cocaine enthusiast Michael Gove says he will abolish VAT and replace it with a sales tax.The move could be ruinously expensive for the Government, for VAT brings in almost £ billion-a-year. Most other countries in the world have a form of VAT.As Paul Johnson of the Institute of Fiscal Studies puts it, Gove’s proposal would be “the biggest, riskiest, and most disruptive change in the tax system in at least half a century.”The front runner Boris Johnson caused enormous controversy – and damage to himself – with his plan to cut tax for high earners by raising the  per cent threshold from £,-a-year to £,-a-year.His scheme would not only be cripplingly expensive to the Treasury, costing at least £. billion-a-year, but also is unlikely to win over less well-off voters, who should be the Tories’ prime target.According to one study yesterday, fewer than one in ten workers in the West Midlands would be winners.It might be noted, however, that MPs would be big gainers, for their £, salary is just below Boris’s proposed new threshold.Usually clear and rational, even Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has been infected with the madness of the leadership contest.Is he seriously suggesting we might go to war with either of them, despite all the lessons of our failed military interventions over the last two decades.And every one per cent increase in the proportion of national income spent on defence will cost the taxpayer at least £ billion.Esther McVey likes to pose as a tough northerner, but she is a soppy left-winger when it comes to schools.Sounding like a typical Labour MP, she bleated last week about “severe under-funding in schools” and said that “it’s time we started listening to the teaching unions,” as she promised an extra £ billion-a-year.But the unions are they last people we should listen to on education.Addicted to serial whingeing, they have opposed every single sensible reform over recent years, while they have invented the so-called funding crisis for their own political ends.Joining in the prodigality, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has pledged both an extra £. billion for the social care system and a new insurance scheme to end the supposed “injustice” of homes sold to meet care costs.But is this really a scandal  Why should ordinary taxpayers have to fork out to protect the inheritances of the affluent Home Secretary Sajid Javid promises a whopping £ million to Ireland as a “grand gesture” to solve the Brexit border problem, for which he has also advocated the use of new technology.But his proposal is both expensive and unworkable. As one Government official points out, “No Government worldwide currently controls dferent customs arrangements with no physical infrastructure at the border.”Ex-Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, who sees himself as a Thatcherite, calls for slashing tax cuts for the low-paid, by raising the threshold at which employee national insurance contributions start from £ to £,, an average saving of £-a-year.He also proposes a penny off income tax for everyone, part of his drive ultimately to lower the basic rate from p to p. But such steps would signicantly shrink the tax base, as well as cost the Government as much as £ billion-a-year.Given that these candidates aspire to run the country, the leadership contest has been a depressing spectacle so far. Its excesses reflect the Tory party’s flight from serious statesmanship.Matt Hancock describes the contest as a “great festival of ideas.”It is more like a carnival of amateur illusionists desperately hoping their tired tricks will distract us from the Tories failure to deliver Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

U.S. researchers followed the sleeping habits of nearly , women.The study found those who kept a light or TV on while they snoozed at night were  per cent more likely to be obese than those in total darkness.And they had a  per cent higher chance of weighing in at least lbs heavier on the scales.They also were less likely to have consistent waking and bedtime patterns and at greater risk of having less sleep, taking a longer time to doze off and needing to nap during the day.Scientists claim cutting exposure to articial light at night may be a simple weapon in the battle against the bulge.Two in three UK adults are overweight or obese. Being too heavy increases the chances of type  diabetes, heart, liver disease and several common cancers.One theory is that light exposure alters key hormones that control the body clock. It may also trigger the release of stress hormones that contribute to weight gain.Writing in the JAMA Internal Medicine, researcher Dr Dale Sandler, from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in North Carolina, said: “Exposure to articial light at night while sleeping was signicantly associated with an increased risk of weight gain and the development of obesity.“In particular, sleeping with a television or a light on in the room was positively associated with gaining kg or more.“Public health strategies to decrease obesity might consider interventions aimed at reducing articial light at night while sleeping.”Previous UK research has found girls who have TVs in their bedrooms are a third more likely to be fat.Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said televisions and smartphones should be banned from kids’ rooms at night.He said: “It has been known for a long time that the blue, articial light emitted by TV screens - even those simply on stand-by - can mess up the bodys cyclical rhythms and disrupt sleep patterns.“Add to that research which has already linked interrupted sleep to obesity and diabetes and the case is made to ditch any gadget with a screen from the bedroom.Though adults might find that dficult, parents should make that a mandatory ban on their children .Commenting on the study, body clock expert Professor Malcolm von Schantz from Surrey University, said: “The findings make perfect biological sense.We know that light in the late evening will delay our body clocks. We know from experimental studies in people that light at night affects our metabolism in ways that are consistent with increased risk of metabolic syndrome.“These new findings won’t change the advice to maintain good sleep hygiene, and avoid light and electronic distractions in the bedroom, but they add further strength to the case for this advice.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Any costs should be covered by the Government without endangering BBC services.”And Labour’s deputy leader and Shadow Culture Secretary Tom Watson blamed the Government’s decision to handover control and burden of paying for free licences to the BBC as part of its new charter.Mr Watson said: “It is an outrage that this Government is overseeing the scrapping of free TV licences for three million older people, leaving a Tory manesto promise in tatters.“I challenge all Tory leadership candidates to honour the commitment they made in .

The shamed minister launched his own bid for No  with a string of attacks on his former Leave campaign comrade-in-arms. He insisted he was in the race “to win it” after being urged to step down by senior Tories after admitting taking cocaine. And he goaded Mr Johnson over his decision to quit the contest last time round telling him “whatever you do, don’t pull out”. He was later forced to deny that his comments were a dig at Mr Johnson’s well publicised series of extra-marital affairs.  The Environment Secretary also launched a thinly veiled jibe at his former friend’s plans for a massive tax cut for the rich. It comes after he was branded a “hypocrite” for demanding stronger drug laws while taking cocaine himself. The revelation threatened to derail Mr Gove’s campaign, leaving the way open for others to take over as the prime “Stop Boris” candidate.Mr Johnson, who has  publicly declared supporters, is widely regarded as the favourite to take over from Theresa May .The Tory contest descended into a round of bitter attacks on Mr Johnson from his nine rivals for the top job, as nominations closed.  Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, launching his own campaign, cast doubt on Mr Johnson’s suitability for the role.    “We need to get real – we are facing a constitutional crisis,” he said. “Our new Prime Minister will still preside over a hung Parliament. This extremely serious moment calls for an experienced, serious leader. We need the art of tough negotiation, not the art of empty rhetoric.” He urged MPs, who will decide which candidates make it to the last two, to “choose me for unity over ision, for experience over rhetoric, for tough negotiation over empty threats”. But it was Mr Gove’s attacks which will sting Mr Johnson the most after the last contest when he dealt the fatal blow to his campaign.  To titters from the audience, he told his former friend: “If I get through, which I’m sure I will actually, to the final two against Mr Johnson this is what I will say to him. Mr Johnson, whatever you do, don’t pull out”. He added: “I know you have before and I know you may not believe in your heart that you can do it but the Conservative Party membership deserve a choice’.” Mr Johnson has a long history of personal indiscretions including numerous extra-marital affairs, two orces and a love child.  Mr Gove was later forced to denied that he was making a personal attack.    “It was purely about the last leadership contest. It wasn’t anything more than that. Some people have much more imagination than I have,” he said. But asked at the launchhe would give Mr Johnson a job, he replied: “I’m a great fan of Boris’s I enjoy working with him but I think the first person I should discuss that with is Her Majesty the Queen.” Mr Gove, who allies said would unveil more backers in coming days, was just one of the leadership rivals who slapped down Mr Johnson on his tax cut plan for the rich.  The former foreign secretary prompted fury by pledging a cut - which would benefit him and every other MP but not the poorest.  The millionaire Tory wants to raise the p income tax threshold from £, to £,he becomes Prime Minister.  Anyone earning more than £, that sum looks set to save up to £, in income tax every year, though once other taxes are taken into account the benefit would be smaller. He claimed the move would be paid for by cash currently set aside for No Deal - yet insists that he is keeping No Deal on the table.  Mr Gove vowed to never use the tax and benefits system to “give the already wealthy another tax cut” Health Secretary Matt Hancock, another candidate, laid into the plan, saying he would only cut taxes “when we can afford it”. Hard Brexiteer Dominic Raab also put the boot in.“Think about what it looks like for the next Prime Minister going into those Labour marginal seats,” he said.“I’d much rather be going in there saying I’m going to cut taxes for the lowest paid than succumbing to what would inevitably look like the caricature that we are the party of privilege and only help the wealthy.”Mr Johnson also came under fire over Brexit with Mr Hunt warning that his plan to quit without a deal on October  could lead to a general election which would “annihilate” the Tories. The Foreign Secretary said that he would only back No Deal “with a heavy heart”  - and would keep delaying Brexit on the tablethere was a deal “in sight”.  After winning the backing of Cabinet Brexiteer Penny Mordaunt, he added: “A wise Prime Minister would make choices on the basis of the options in front of them on the table at that time.” Cabinet minister Amber Rudd slammed candidates who claimed the UK should simply “pick up some magic beans and believe in Britain”. Would be-PM Esther McVey’s launch was interrupted by a man shouting “fake news” while television presenter Lorraine Kelly claimed not to remember working alongside her at GMTV.

More than a dozen spoke up at the frosty gathering in Parliament - the vast majority negative, a source said - as rows over Brexit and anti-Semitism came to a head. MPs argued over whether Mr Corbyn should fully back a second Brexit referendum after coming third behind the Lib Dems in the EU elections. There was also a row over allegations Mr Corbynaposs staff, named in newspapers, intervened in anti-Semitism cases. Multiple MPs described the Parliamentary Labour Party meeting as the worst ever under his leadership. An MP told the Mirror: It was the worst meeting Iaposve ever attended. Of anything. Normally-quiet MPs, including James Frith and Marie Rimmer, spoke up to Jeremy Corbynaposs face. Ms Rimmer is said to have told him loyal allies are turning away, adding: The leadership’s not there.    According to HuffPost UK, Mr Frith told Mr Corbyn: Your clear leadership delivered my win in . We need clear leadership from you now - for a final say public vote and Remain.” A source close to the leader admitted the meeting was robust, though allies insisted it was not the worst ever. It comes ahead of a showdown today over Labouraposs Brexit policy at a meeting of the shadow cabinet. Speaking at last nightaposs meeting, Mr Corbyn said: To break the Brexit deadlock, we need to go back to the people. Let the people decide the country’s future, either in a general election or through a public vote on any deal agreed by parliament. But several shadow ministers - including Tom Watson, John McDonnell and Emily Thornberry - want Mr Corbyn to go further and guarantee a referendum on any deal. Itaposs understood Mr Watson confronted party chairman Ian Lavery - a key opponent of a second referendum - at last weekaposs shadow cabinet and demanded a plan to re-engage the trust of party members.    Meanwhile new MP Lisa Forbes faced a furious attack at the meeting - on her first day representing Peterborough. She apologised for liking a post saying Theresa May had a “Zionist Slave Masters agenda”, alongside a video of children praying after the New Zealand terror attack. In another comment, she had said she had “enjoyed reading” a thread that said Isis was created “by the CIA and Mossad”. But she was lambasted by the Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who said she didnapost accept the apology and accused Ms Forbes of a pattern of behaviour, a witness claimed. Allies of Mr Corbyn - who joined just  or so MPs applauding Ms Forbes into office yesterday - bristled at the attack, which comes after a long history of spats between Ms Hodge and the leader. A supporter complained: Itaposs not right to lay into someone who just started their job that day.  MPs also called for better processes to handle conduct complaints in the party after an anti-Semitism row. The Sunday Times obtained emails suggesting Jeremy Corbynaposs chief of staff, Karie Murphy, stepped in halting a suspension of an aide accused of sexual advances. Mr Corbyn is said to have urged MPs not to single out members of Labour staff. But a witness said Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle argued against this, comparing senior staff to chief executives of a company under attack by unions. A source said of the meeting to Playbook: It got genuinely nasty... It was up there with the very worst. You saw the depth of unhappiness within the PLP. Some of the people speaking out, you just never would have expected to hear it from. A Labour source called the meeting “robust”, adding: Clearly, there are very strong feelings about Brexit and how it should be handled, both in the Labour party and the country – and among Labour MPs. That’s no secret at all. “We are in a period of heightened polarisation on Brexit, and that is why Jeremy is trying to find a way that reflects our conference policy and that brings the country together. We are listening to the views of members and our MPs. The PLP is very passionate, and that’s what we would expect.

Wheatley Park School near Oxford is proposing to remove an hour-long period at the end of its Friday timetable. The academy in Holton, which teaches , students, said the move would cut costs by reducing staffing requirements. A letter sent to parents said: School budgets are under enormous pressure and our own is no exception. The school currently has some reserves but will quickly tip into deficit unless we can find further ways to reduce costs signicantly. Reducing the school week by one period would mean fewer lessons would need to be taught overall, which in turn would mean fewer teachers would be needed to staff the school. It comes after repeated dire warnings about school funding - with two-thirds of teachers forking out their own cash for stationery.     Yet a letter from more than , heads earlier this year claimed Education Secretary Damian Hinds has refused three requests to meet to discuss the crisis. Theresa May has also repeatedly claimed . million more children are in schools rated “good” or “outstanding” by Ofsted - but the claim has been branded misleading by the statistics watchdog. Mrs May won a place at the then Holton Park Girlsapos Grammar School at  and was a pupil there when it became Wheatley Park School in . She then went on to study at St Hughaposs College at Oxford University. The school has been improving in recent years - it was rated aposinadequateapos by Ofsted in , apossatisfactoryapos in  and aposgoodapos in its most recent full inspection in . The proposal for Fridays would come into force from Septemberconfirmed. Lunchtime would be brought forward about an hour and students would go home at pm instead of pm. Although pupils would leave earlier, some staff would stay to work on collaborative lesson planning and curriculum development.    The letter added: Parents and carers might be rightly concerned that having  instead of  lessons a week would be detrimental to childrenaposs education. However, the school would seek to minimise any negative impact on studentsapos learning by protecting lessons in the core subjects. We anticipate that more collaborative planning amongst staff would increase the quality of lessons, offsetting the reduction in quantity. The letter, from the schoolaposs headteacher Tim Martin and chair of governors Philip Baillieu, said alternative measures had been considered, including removing subjects, creating bigger classes or asking parents for donations. The school is consulting with present and future pupils and parents, staff and the River Learning Trust, which runs Wheatley Park, and a final decision is expected imminently. The trust, which also runs Oxfordaposs Cherwell School and a host of others in the area, is also opening the cityaposs new Swan School. Wheatley Park head Mr Martin was among headteachers who marched in a London protest last year, lobbying for more school funding.  He said: Itaposs our genuine belief that this option has the least impact on studentsapos learning. Schools up and down the country are having to make very dficult decisions in the current financial climate - itaposs our view that [the government] not investing in education is a short-term outlook. He pointed to other neighbouring schools, Didcot Girlsapos and neighbouring St Birinus, which already finish early on Fridays as a examples of the system working. The school is not alone in Oxfordshire in contacting parents about funding struggles. On Friday, headteachers of  partnered schools in West Oxfordshire, including Henry Box and Wood Green, sent a letter urging parents to contact their MP about funding. They said: The past decade has seen a real terms cut to the funding [education services] receive. The UK statistics network has scolded the government for headlines that mask the whole picture. Schools are being expected to do signicantly more, with more children, with signicantly less. The heads said the aposregrettableapos next step would be to make cuts in the staffing budget, which is any schoolaposs biggest expenditure.

Isabella, four, likes to ask Alexa for Baby Shark, Poppy wants to watch Peter Rabbit on CBeebies, while Tom might be finishing off work on his phone. Before we tried BT Complete Wi-Fi, we had a dodgy signal in the two top rooms – the bathroom and my daughter Poppy’s room.

But since setting this up, we immediately noticed things were downloading at the click of a finger. There are now less tantrums as the girls don’t have to wait for things to download.  Isabella understands things are loading when she sees that wheel going round, but Poppy, who is two, has no tolerance for it.

In the past month a ton of the animalaposs flesh - known as bush meat - was confiscated at customs as it came into the UK from West Africa, leading primate scientist Dr Ben Garrod said. The meat can cause serious diseases as chimps are genetically similar to humans and it is often packaged in unsanitary environments. Western chimpanzees are on the critically endangered species list due to threats to their environment and because their meat is considered a delicacy.   Itaposs re, itaposs in all major cities across Europe and the US, the University of East Anglia professor told The Sunday .We have seen bush meat confiscated in the UK in checkpoints at borders and in markets. Itaposs often brought to the country for specic celebrations like a wedding or a Christening. World renowned chimpanzee expert Dr Jane Goodall urged the government to take action and to introduce DNA testing at the border. She suggested that Interpol should up its efforts to stop the meat being taken across borders and suggested dogs could be trained to detect the product. Bush meat is easier than other contraband goods to smuggle because it is smoked and blackened, making it hard to identy.    It can sell for as much as five times the price of prime cuts of beef or pork. The issue of illegal meat being imported into European countries is not a new one. During a  day period in ,  passengers from  flights were searched coming into Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris. Almost half were found to be carrying fish or meat from livestock or wild animals including crocodiles, primates and porcupines. In  chimpanzee meat was found in the West Midlands during a trading standards raid. A spokesperson for the government said: As well as working with enforcement and intelligence partners in the UK and international, Border Force continues to invest in training and equipment to ensure that we do all we can to intercept illegal foodstuffs and cracks down on smugglers.

Simon Aherne and Anna Cousins said the switch - announced with a yearaposs notice - will scupper their wedding plans because most guests will now be unable to attend. The couple, from Cardf, say they have already booked a venue and caterers, and sent invitations to more than  family and friends. They say their plans went out the window when the Government announced the change on Saturday.  The couple have invited more than  people but they will barely get  now. If they cancel, they will lose hundreds of pounds in deposits, they said. The Government said it made the decision as soon as practicable.Mr Aherne, a teacher and part-time DJ, told the BBC: Most of our family are teachers or in the entertainment business - so the bank holiday worked out perfectly for us.   Now we are just sitting here wondering what we are going to do. Mr Aherne and Ms Cousins, a PR worker, are due to get married at Kingscote Barn in Gloucestershire May ,  - a Sunday and the day before the traditional bank holiday Monday. The couple say they respect wishes to mark the VE Day anniversary, but they have hit out at the government, saying there was a lack of warning. Mr Aherne said: How can the government just chuck this on people with  months to go  They have had time to prepare and could have given people a lot more notice.  VE Day – or Victory in Europe Day – is marked on  May and commemorates the Allies accepting the surrender of Nazi Germany in the Second World War. The May Day bank holiday is traditionally held on a Monday but will be put back to the Friday and form part of a three-day weekend of commemorative events. Sir Andrew Gregory, the chief executive of SSAFA, the armed forces charity, said it was a fitting idea. He said: “It is our duty to keep the events of the past alive in collective memory, including future generations – this is how we ensure that such a conflict never happens again. It is our hope that the nation takes a moment to reflect on the signicance of this date, as a milestone that changed the course of history for the whole world.”  The announcement follows events across the UK and France to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. As part of the VE Day commemorations, more than , pubs will encourage drinkers to toast the heroes of the war while churches will take part in a “ringing out for peace”. The bank holiday will move in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but not necessarily in Scotland as bank holidays are devolved to Holyrood. The business secretary, Greg Clark, said moving the bank holiday was a “right and fitting tribute”. He added: “VE Day marked an historic moment in not only our nation’s but the world’s history and it is important that we commemorate this great occasion on its th anniversary. Honouring those who did their duty, whether on the battlefields of Europe or through their efforts and sacrices here at home.” The May Day bank holiday has only ever been moved once before, when it was shted from  to  May in  to mark the th anniversary of VE Day "},{"url":null,"title":"family claim 5000 disney world","story":"NewsFamilys £, Disney World dream trip turns into holiday from hellCai Williams says his we Leonna and their three children, from Caerphilly, Wales, were left in tears because of the mix upShareCommentsByThomas DeaconSandra Hembery:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsThe Williams family in Orlando \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA dream holiday tuned into a nightmare after a mix-up over a hotel booking left a family in tears. Cai Williams, his we Leonna, their three children and some extended family members were flying out to celebrate Heather Schofieldaposs th birthday. The family-of-five from Caerphilly, Wales, paid a total of £, for flights and accommodation and £, for park entry for the two weeks.It was intended to be a special birthday celebration, and a holiday of a letime for Heather, her three daughters, husband and children, Wales Online reports.   But there was a hitch even before they left the UK. Holiday operators Thomas Cook contacted them to say that instead of flying from Gatwick they would be flying from Manchester. Eventually the flights were changed back but when they arrived at the airport they were told there had been no allocation for their baggage, and they had to pay extra to put their luggage on. The travellers spent around an hour arguing their case before they were let on board without paying extra. After an eight-hour flight the party arrived at the Rosen Inn International Hotel in Orlando only to be told their rooms were not available for another two days. The family feared the worst, but the hotel allowed them to stay overnightthey paid £ per family for a room - which they were hoping to redeemthey could sort the situation out with holiday reps before am the next day. But for the Williams family, and the others, the situation was far from ideal.    There were just two three-quarter sized beds in the shared room. This meant their -year-old daughter Alise, Ruby, seven, and Oliver, five, all had to share one bed. The family said the original hotel they had been booked into, which was changed before the holiday because of potential noise issues, was a self-catering suite, but the hotel rooms had minimal facilities, which meant they had to eat out more often. Mr Williams said he thought that added another £, to the cost of his immediate familyaposs holiday. He said the first couple of days were spent trying to sort out the issue with the holiday reps, who were very helpful at the resort. But that meant they missed out on the first days of their two-week pass to the Disney attraction. Eventually the family was given a temporary bed for the room. An attempt to be moved to another hotel failed, as they were told all the similar hotels were booked up.  But the final straw was when the families were coming to the end of their holidays and found out they should have had vouchers to cover their breakfast - but these hadnapost been provided and they had paid for their meals. Mr Williams said: We just want some answers. It was disgusting. My we, my children, my mother-in-law - all they did was cry. I It was horrible. That night at reception, not knowingwe had a room, the kids were really scared. They were also knackered. A Thomas Cook spokeswoman said: We’re very sorry for the inconvenience caused to all the family at the beginning of their trip to Florida. We recognise we made a mistake with the hotel booking and we’re investigating the issues raised. In resort, we did everything we could to try and put things right, including offering meal vouchers. After the initial mix-up with the accommodation Thomas Cook said no further complaint was made in the resort. On May  the customers complained to Morgan Travel, not Thomas Cook direct.

He paid the price for a disastrous - Euro  qualying campaign loss to Kazakhstan.Having resurrected Kilmarnock Steve Clarke was drafted in as replacement on a three-year contract and will lead the Scots against Cyprus tomorrow and Belgium on Tuesday.McLeish handed McKenna his Scotland debut and the Dons centre-back won more caps than any other player during his second tenure as Scotland manager.Having retained his position in the Scotland squad, and likely his starting spot, under Clarke the -year-old is determined to impress the new manager.McKenna said: “Alex McLeish was the man who gave me my first Scotland call-up and my first cap so I was gutted to see him leave.“Every game I was in the squad I managed to get on the park so I am thankful to Alex for that.“I was disappointed when he left but now it is up to me to try to prove myself to the new Scotland manager that I am good enough.”McKenna started in the disastrous loss in Kazakhstan that delivered a major dent to qualication hopes and fatally holed McLeish’s position as manager.The SFA waited almost a month from the - defeat of San Marino to axe McLeish and then took their time to appoint his successor.Clarke was the outstanding candidate having collected the PFA Scotland and the Scottish Football Writers’ Association manager of the year accolades.When Clarke arrived at Kilmarnock in October  they were bottom of the Premiership.When he left for Scotland at the end of the recent season he had led them to a third place finish and European qualication.It was the first time Killie had finished in the top three since .On the SFA appointing Clarke, McKenna said: “I was delighted. We had all seen what he did with Kilmarnock and we hope he can bring that to us.“Kilmarnock punched above their weight and hopefully we can do that, too.“Kilmarnock were always hard to break down.“Obviously keeping clean sheets is a great  to try to do well in campaigns and with that implemented hopefully we can do that in the games coming up.”Former Aberdeen captain Graeme Shinnie is also in the Scotland squad. The midfielder rejected the offer of a new Pittodrie deal to sign on at Championship Derby County on a three-year contract.McKenna said: “Graeme has been so good for the club over the last few seasons.“When we were without him either through suspension or injury it was always a massive loss for us. However, I am sure the manager will have a replacement ready for him during the summer.”International duty will reduce the summer break for McKenna and Aberdeen team-mate Mikey Devlin.McKenna will get just two weeks off before ing for pre-season training with the Dons in the final week of this month.Aberdeen will travel to Cork in the Republic of Ireland for a week-long training camp where they will play Connor’s Quay Nomads in a friendly on Saturday June .Aberdeen enter the Europa League at the first qualying round stage on Thursday July .McKenna said: “Europe is something for us all to look forward to when we come back from the summer for pre-season training.“It is great to play in Europe.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/06/5cfa7e82b693b6.31090834.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet tommy vulcan and blue are looking for a new home can you help","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home.Who can resist this little cutie Tommy is nine weeks old and is a little explorer and into everything.He loves having fun and toys that roll around and he can chase after.He is not neutered yet as he is not old enough.

What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

That revenue would have contributed towards the management and improvement of assets and development of services within the Ardrishaig area for years ahead and for the benefit of current and future generations.Edward Laughton, director, Ardrishaig Community TrustSir,We often hear Argyll and Bute Council being slated.But this time they deserve all the praise they can get for cleaning and re-pointing Lochgilphead War Memorial. All it took was a request and the work was done in time for the Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day on June .Geordie Rhodick, chairman, LAFDSirFor the past two years, since he was elected to Argyll and Bute Council by the skin of his teeth, Councillor Alastair Redman has bombarded local newspapers with a constant stream of drivel attacking the Scottish Government.In his latest diatribe, he alleges that #the SNP has completely misjudged the mood of voters up and down the country#.I know it will be extremely painful for him, buthe can bring himself to review last week’s European Election results in Scotland, he’ll see the complete fallacy of this statement, andhe wants to look even closer to home, he’ll see that the SNP polled , votes in Argyll and Bute – , votes ahead of the Tories who came a distant fourth.Hardly a sign of his mythical assertion that Ruth Davidson is poised to be the next First Minister of Scotland.Robert Macintyre, Serpentine Road, RothesayDear PaulI write on behalf of constituents in Tarbert regarding the application for the Inveraray to Crossaig kV overhead line, which is with the [Scottish Government] Energy Consents Unit.A very large number of constituents have contacted me regarding this matter and almost  have signed a petition.They believe the proposal will have a major deleterious effect on the village and will be a huge and ugly blot on the landscape which, given the very attractive and scenic nature of the area, will be a big disincentive to tourism and will spoil the enjoyment of the area for residents as well.I have met with SSE to discuss this issue and have made it clear to them that the community wishes the company to come forward with alternative proposals, which must include undergrounding the cableno route can be found which does not spoil the visual amenity of the village.I know that the new line is needed for entirely understandable and positive reasons, and I have had only a few complaints from other parts of the area which will be affected.The opposition in Tarbert is virtually unanimous and there is also concern being expressed from those who know and value the area but do not live there.I hope that any consideration of consent will ensure that this issue is dealt with in accordance with the views of local people and I would be grateful to hear from you what the timescale is for that decision .Michael RussellSir,Newly-elected UK MEPs will take their seats in the European Parliament in July and it is crucial they recognise their signicant role in shaping the policies that impact on farming businesses. This new parliament will be pivotal in determining the nature of our future regulatory environment and we are keen and ready to meet with them.Our industry faces a number of challenges over the coming years, not just in relation to Brexit but on issues such as climate change, environmental policy, plant protection and animal health and welfare. There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have.

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert. With a number of races omitted due to protests, it was a nice easy start for Glenn.The Hunter s and Sonatas saw a spread of results after some close racing. The CYCA class  fleet on the Largs passage race was won on corrected time by Celtic Spirit. Additional prizes were awarded to Encore for the passage race line honours and Shona of Ashton for toughing it out at the rear of the passage race.Saturday was a much more challenging day on the water with a light wind and dreich drizzle. The race committee nonetheless got two races in for a number of the fleets.Protests concluded, Saturday’s prize giving announced the remaining results from Friday. This showed #s winner and RC Makars Mash class yacht Storm looking strong with a first place.Chimaera showed early signs of being a threat to the Scottish Series crown, taking a first in Friday racing. With no immediate showing of a dominant yacht in the IRC Class  fleet from Friday’s races, it was IRC class four that showed a brewing battle between Lady Ex and F’n Gr. In the CYCA Class  fleet, First by Farr surfaced with the highest number of race wins from Friday.Not to be outdone, CYCA Class  saw the final results dominated by Cool Bandit  before Saturday#s results were announced. With the weather mixing up the league table for Saturday, there were a lot of yachts taking home prizes.Saturday evening saw theof Big Vern and The Shootahs to the Scottish Series for another year and a spectacular fireworks display in celebration of Valhalla of Ashton’s th year on the water.Sunday saw yet another big weather sht with forecasts up to  knots. Loch Fyne likes to mix it up a bit so the fleets ventured out into more sedate conditions than those forecast. But as the weather built, race officers shortened the traditional round Inchmarnock passage race.Sunday prizes featured an additional prize for the best performer in each fleet. Glenn Porter started proceedings with a special award for #assisting mark layers# to the competitor who got tangled up in one of the race marks. In IRC Class  it was El Gran Senor and Forty Licks shining through. The Makars Mash RC class saw Hijacker leading the prize haul. In IRC Class it was Mata taking the #extra# prize. IRC class four saw F’n Gr take a clean sweep of firsts in both races. With only one race in CYCA  and , it was Reflection and Salamander XXII taking home the wins. In the Etchells One,  Design Hero took a win in both races with Squawk leading the way in the Sigma  One Design Class. In the Hunter  fleet Miss Moneypenny was the only yacht placed in both races taking home the best performer of the day for the s. With two firsts in the Sonata one design, Fiddlesticks made the most of the Sunday conditions. Finally, the CYCA restricted sail fleet saw Celtic Spirit take first place.The  event saw the marquee remain open for the Sunday evening as part of additional shoreside activities supported by Event Scotland.An earlier start on Monday was greeted with sunshine and no wind. This time the challenge was just too much for race officers who had to abandon racing for the day. Despite a number of the competitors making the most of the early finish and heading home, the final prize giving was one of the best attended in recent years.Clyde Cruising Club Commodore John Readman paid special thanks to the valued participants, sponsors, supporters, volunteers and locals, without whom there would be no event.Scottish Series Trophy and overall Series Winner: #Chimaera#Joe Deane Cup and Knox Anchor: Salamander XXIRosebowl: ChimaeraTunnocks# Cup: ReflectionCrinan Cup: Celtic SpiritCrawford McInnes Trophy : ReflectionLemarac Tankard: Celtic SpiritCauseway Cup: F#n GrAlfred Mylne Trophy: HeroClyde Bowl: Celtic SpiritValhalla of Ashton Salver volunteer Award: The Tech or Raynet TeamLa Rochelle Trophy: LyrebirdThe McIver Salver : F#n GrIRC: Forty LicksRC: ChimaeraIRC: HarmonyIRC: F#n GrCYCA: First by FarrCYCA: Salamander XXIICYCA: Celtic SpiritSigma  OOD: Leaky Roof Sonata OD: FiddlesticksHunter  OD: SeawordEtchells OD: HeroIRC: Something ElseCYCA: First EditionOne Design: Miss Moneypenny,  Class Association"},{"url":null,"title":"kyles defeat inveraray in camanachd cup","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsKyles Athletic are through to the quarter finals after beating Inveraray - at Kames Playing Fields.The opening goal came on  minutes following a scramble around the penalty spot.

Eventually they evolved into the largest creatures ever known # the titanosaurs, including the aptly named Dreadnoughtus #  metres long and weighing more than ,kg –  times heavier than an African elephant.Like most youngsters, dinosaurs fascinated me in primary school, but I never thought to ask how they sustained their enormous bulk. As Brusatte describes in his brilliant book*, the answer is their unique body plan.Adult titanosaurs needed to eat around kg of foliage daily, a feat accomplished by the addition, and enlarging, of vertebrae to extend their distinctive necks. So, by just standing still and swinging their heads, they could consume all plants within a -metre-diameter circle, while expending very little energy.But how did they manage to move around when just lting their heads and feet appears to defy gravity  Everything is explained by adaptations to their respiratory system, which combined an energy-generating machine and an air-con system, which also helped movement.Titanosaur lungs were connected to numerous air sacs that filled body cavities, even burrowing extensively into bones. Air sacs stored oxygen-rich air that passed through the lungs in one direction only, allowing for super-efficient oxygen extraction. What’s more, the air sacs# huge surface area dissipated heat, so averting heat stress. And finally, by creating a honey-comb effect in bones, air sacs lightened without weakening the skeleton, thereby allowing animals to move around with ease.If only we could have met these giants. But at least theirclose relatives are around today. Birds are dinosaurs. And with the same efficient respiration and light-weight bones they can fly far and high, even over Mount Everest.*Steve Brusatte, Author of The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs ."},{"url":null,"title":"even tunnel vision has its drawbacks","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOur regular artistic contributor Ann Thomas this week muses on a subject she has mulled over before # the Rest and be Thankful.Transport Scotland is undertaking a review of the country#s strategic transport strategy, with an undertaking that Argyll will be at the front of the queue this time around.We#ll see, but in the meantime a tunnel through the hills is considered by some to be the answer to solving the problem of keeping Argyll connected via the A by avoiding the landslide risk altogether.But there may be some drawbacks to a super underground highway#PIC:no_acartoon"},{"url":null,"title":"16-months-ban-for-vodka-drinking-motorist","story":"A GALASHIELS woman who was seen drinking in her vehicle was found to be three times the alcohol limit when traced by police.Elaine Adamson, of Langhaugh Crescent, pleaded guilty to driving with a breath alcohol count of  microgrammes - the legal limit being  - on March .Selkirk Sherf Court was told how the -year-old had entered a shop in Tweed Road at about .pm and staff could smell alcohol from her.Erin Illand, prosecuting, described how the accused bought a half bottle of vodka.The staff then observed how she got into the driving seat of her car and watched her drinking from a juice bottle and then from a clear bottle believing it to be vodka.She drove off towards Galashiels and police were contacted.The fiscal said that police officers tracked Adamson down to Boleside Road where she had parked in a car park beside the river .Adamson admitted she had been drinking and the bottle had been put in a nearby bin and she was smelling strongly of alcohol.She was taken to Hawick Police Station where the lower reading for a breath test was .Defence lawyer Greg McDonnel said: \"She is deeply ashamed.

Galashiels ndash who was a Captain and i c of A Company, st Battalion Kingrsquos Own Scottish Borderers, in the second assault wave on the morning of June .By June , , the Battalion had moved into the marshalling area Camp A. By this time all ranks of the Battalion had been briefed on maps with bogus name and map references - but everyone was fully in the lsquopicturersquo as to the plan for the invasion of the continent . The time in A was spent testing weapons and lsquoteeingrsquo up all the last details for the lsquobig dayrsquo.In the early morning of June , the Battalion embussed in TCVs and moved to the final Assembly area at Victoria Barracks, Plymouth. At am we were informed that owing to bad weather the operation had been postponed  hours.On June  we again moved to Victoria Barracks and at  hours started embarking on LSIs , although there was a fairly heavy sea running. The Battalion was on board by .. We sat at anchor until . when we set sail for the big adventure for which most of us had been waiting four years. It was an amazing sight, all around as far as the eye could see, there were ships of all shapes and sizes bobbing up and down on the water with their ensigns flying bravely in the summer breeze. As we passed the flag ship, with our Divisional Commander, Major-General Rennie and Admiral Vian on board, all ranks turned out on deck and saluted while the pipers played our Regimental march ldquoBlue Bonnets orsquoer the Border.The sea journey was one of the worst we had experienced, there was a heavy swell running and most of the Battalion felt very ill. After midnight maps were issued and from these, we saw we were scheduled to lsquotouch downrsquo at Lion-Sur-Mer about three miles west of Ouistreham.About . on June  we could see faintly the coast of Normandy on the horizon, all around us were battleships, cruisers and destroyers firing at the enemy, while overhead there was a continual stream of bombers and fighters. As we drew nearer the shore, we could see LCAs, DUKWs, etc ferrying stores from larger ships to shore.At . we were ordered to lsquostand byrsquo to disembark. Each man carried his normal equipment and personal weapon plus to extra bandoliers of ammunition, two -hour ration packs and an airborne bicycle. We had expected a wet landing but when we touched down, dead on time at ., we stepped off the LCI on to the shore. The Navy had certainly put up a terric show and now it was up to us.It took only a few minutes for the Battalion to disembark and then we moved off to our Assembly area north of Hermanville-Sur-Mer , this move was carried out without incident except for a few heavy shells from the coastal guns at Le Havre.At . the Battalion were ordered to move to St Aubin drsquoArquenay and ordered to lsquodig inrsquo. At . we witnessed what must be one of the most spectacular sights of the war - the landing of the Reserve Brigade of the th Airborne Division. It was certainly heartening for us, as up to then we had the feeling that we were all alone on the continent. Several prisoners were brought in during the night.Early on June  we prepared to attack the village of Gazelle. We moved on bicycles through Periers-Sur-le-Dan preparatory to the attack. At midday patrols reported Gazelle clear of the enemy and led by lsquoCrsquo Companythe Battalion moved through Gazelle to the woods north of Le Mesnil.We stayed until the morning of the th when we were relieved by the S Lancs while the Royal Ulster Rlesattacked Cambes Wood. At . the Battalion was ordered to pass through the RUR who had reached their objectives but were pinned down by heavy machine Gun, and Mortar Fire. The Battalion attacked after passing through the RUR and were met by machine gun fire and heavy mortar fire, but all Coys successfully reached their objectives. The Battalion suffered several casualties mainly from mortar fire.From June  to  the Battalion remained in Cambes Wood, where we were continually shelled and mortared and suffered fairly heavy casualties.Enemy mortar and artillery was very active ndash Battalion HQ receiving most attention. lsquoArsquo Coy HQ unfortunately came in for a very heavy lsquostonkrsquo and lost five killed and seven wounded. The end of the month saw the Battalion back in Cambes Wood once more, when we took over the right half of the line from the nd Lincs.During the month of June the Battalion sustained the following casualties two officers and  other ranks killed, eight officers and  other ranks wounded, and four other ranks missing.The Battalion remained in Cambes Wood till July . We continued to probe the enemy defences at night by patrolling. Sgt Grant carried out a very successful  hour patrol in the area of Galmanche. A lot of very valuable information was gained from this patrol. On the evening of July , Lt Robertson lsquoBrsquo Company carried out a very successful patrol and succeeded in bringing back identication of  SS Div ndash this information had been urgently required by higher command in view of the forthcoming attack.The Battalion were relieved by a Battalion of South Staffs and moved by march route to the area of Benouville in preparation for the attack on Caen. On the evening of July  the Battalion took over the nd Kings Shropshire Light Infantry in the area of Le Homme. A large formation of Allied bombers raided Caen in the early evening.On July  the Battalion again moved forward, this time to the area of Lebissey. There was some enemy mortar and artillery fire, but few casualties were suffered.On July  in conjunction with the RUR and Canadians, the Battalion attacked Caen. The Battalion was ordered to attack from the West with the RUR on our right. The Battalion moved to the Forming Up Pointon the outskirts of Caen. We were continually shelled from the Eastern side of the River Orne. It was a very unpleasant approach march to the FUP as the ground was completely open and overlooked from the high ground on the far side of the river. Led by lsquoCrsquo and lsquoDrsquo Coys the Battalion advanced into Caen and proceeded to winkle out the enemy. This proved a very slow job, the town had been heavily bombed and the roads crated or blocked by rubble, giving ideal cover from snipers and Spandau posts. By early evening all companies had reached their objectives, patrols established on the canal, and contact established with the RUR. The civilians gave everyone a terric welcome and produced wine, fruit and bouquets of flowers.On July  the Battalion continued to lsquomop uprsquo the town. There was slight enemy shelling during the day.On the morning of July , the Battalion were relieved by Canadians and moved to a rest area at Plumeto where the time was spent cleaning up, kit inspections and parades. Football games were organised and there was a generous allotment for film shows, swimming, etc. The Pipe Band played Retreat for the first time since landing, on the evening of the th. Officers and Other Rank reinforcements joined the Battalion and on the th we moved off at full strength to the area of Ranville, east of the Orne river, in preparation for operation lsquoGoodwoodrsquo, our objective in this operation was the important road centre of Troarn.On the morning of July , the Battalion moved off via Herouvillette, Touffreville to Sannerville. This was the worst approach march the Battalion had ever experienced. It was a hot summerrsquos day and having to follow the same route as an armoured Div and we were completely overlooked by the enemy. Enemy shells and mortaring was heavy and we experienced for the first time the enemyrsquos multi-barrelled mortarndash several casualties were suffered by the Battalion, including the CO, Lt. Col G.D. Renny. He was wounded in the face and arm but refused to be evacuated.On passing through the RUR at Sannerville lsquoDrsquo and lsquoBrsquo Coys pushed forward and encountered enemy machine guns. The enemy shelling continued throughout the whole advance. After lsquoBrsquo Coy had successfully put in an attack, the Battalion occupied an orchard about  yards west of Troarn where consolidation was carried out. During the night enemy shelling continued and enemy patrols encountered. On the th, the Battalion attack towards Troarn was continued, lsquoCrsquo Coy left ndash lsquoArsquo Coy right. Both Coys advanced, but were met with heavy machine gun fire, and although supported by tanks, were forced to withdraw with heavy casualties.The Battalion took up its former positions and spent a most unpleasant day of enemy mortar and shell fire.The C.O. was ordered to be evacuated by the Brigadier and Major T.G. Coverdale took over command of the Battalion. Casualties in the Battalion in this action were  officers and  other Ranks. To make things more unpleasant we had  hours solid rain. Enemy shelling and mortaring continued but our own guns had moved up and they did some very good counter battery shoots.On July , two enemy Stretcher Bearersapproached lsquoBrsquo Coy position and asked that they and ourselves should bury our dead who were lying in lsquoNo manrsquos landrsquo. A party of SBs under our Padre, Capt Wilson, went out and did this job. As in Cambes Wood some very good patrolling was done, and several prisoners were taken mostly from  Fusilier Battalion and  Panzer Grenadiers.On July , Lt. Col. J.F.M. MacDonald took over command of the Battalion. A strong enemy patrol attempted to penetrate lsquoBrsquo Coy position but were beaten off by small arms and two-inch mortar fire.

and receive a free bike bell at TweedLoversquos Family Ride this Sunday.To launch the new project, Do The Ride Thing, GO e-bike are providing the gt to promote cycling etiquette.Developed with the South East Scotland Transport Partnership , the project centres around three main messages.Do The Ride Thing promotes good cycling manners, cycling as a positive travel choice and how easy electric bikes make cycling.TweedLove and the Tweeddale area benefit from an off-road path linking the Tweed Valley towns of Peebles, Innerleithen and Walkerburn.With the path being so popular with many users including cyclists, walkers, runners and horse-riders, Do The Ride Thing sets out to encourage good cycling manners when using the path, and cycling in general, to ensure all users feel safe and comfortable.At TweedLoversquos annual event the GO e-bike Family Ride, supported by Frog Bikes, all participants will be provided with a Do The Ride Thing bike bell.This aims to encourage the message of good cycling manners on the path and negate the problem of cyclists approaching other users at speed with no warning.A small gesture which will hopefully have a huge benefit to the users of the multi-use path.Hillside Outside created TweedLove to encourages cycling as a mode of transport, on any sort of bike, and showcases the ease of using the Tweed Valley Railway Path.Harley Lothian, Hillside Outside, said: ldquoIt is well-known that adopting cycling as a mode of transport provides many benefits from improved physical and mental health to positive environmental impacts, and it has recently become much easier with the introduction of electric bikes.ldquoTweeddale benefits from its own GO e-bike hub based in Innerleithen to provide the local community access to electric bikes for personal use.ldquoAnd electric cargo bikes for the business community, making it easier to adopt cycling as a transport method in the Tweed Valley.ldquoDo The Ride Thing will continue to promote these messages through a number of dferent avenues over the next few months.Participation is free for the Family Ride event, which will take participants on a journey along the Tweed Valley Railway path departing from Tweed Green on Sunday June  at .am.Full details can be found at tweedlove.More information on the Do The Ride Thing project visit dotheridethingAnd for more information on GO e-Bike

There is no requirement for an actual name change.#This status does not prevent disposal at a future point in time, as long as disposal is of a clear advantage to, and in the best interests of, the community from a recreational perspective.#Ms Milne’s report also stated that the council would continue to manage and maintain the park, with Fields in Trust’s role purely an advisory one.There would be no minimum expectation for maintenance requirements, or pressure to make money as a result of any Centenary Fields status.Ms Milne added: #To achieve Centenary Fields status, the site must have a link to World War One and be suitable for sport, recreation and or play.#The only two sites which appear to officers to meet this criteria are Kinloch Park in Campbeltown and Hermitage Park in Helensburgh.#Given that the profile of Hermitage Park is being raised through the £ million restoration project, officers are of the view that, on balance, it would be more appropriate to put Kinloch Park forward.#This is on the basis that Kinloch Park is likely to derive greater benefit from this enhanced status and protection.#"},{"url":null,"title":"beautiful meal accompanies swi agm","story":"President Jean Ives welcomed the members to the tearoom where Frances Hill provided the sustenance.The formal business included a review of the previous year’s events in which Southend#s SWI excelled, winning several events including bowls and a quiz.After a very successful year, the winter competitions# winner was Alison Eynon, who received the trophy, with Jen Ronald second and Fiona Rowland third.The retiring committee of Jean Ives, Fiona Rowland and Trish Jones were thanked for their hard work over the previous three years.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

Itrsquos in such a beautul part of our county that the journey there was an adventure in itself.The loch is hidden, surrounded by a wood which embraces its secrets. Irsquod never visited it before, but Irsquod been told how magical this place is and that it has a story attached to it.Finding an appropriate place to park was our first challenge. There is no direct access to the loch and no car park with signposts, so care is needed in finding a suitable place. A private farm road that takes you to the entrance gate is not an option, so initially I struggled to find a suitable place, but some kind advice from a friendly farmer helped us out.Itrsquos a perfect time of year for such an adventure. The woods are fully clothed and still echoing with birdsong. I like to explore new places initially without a map or guide. It adds to the adventure, as we had to decide which way to go and initially wonderedwersquod taken the wrong route. But there is a circular walk around the loch, so once the path is discovered there isnrsquot a wrong way.It is a beautul and tranquil place, and as we wandered along the tree-lined loch I thought about the story of the man responsible for its creation.That man was Harry Younger, of the well-known brewing family. His ancestor, William Younger, had been the man who had built up the famous brewing business which produced Youngerrsquos Ale. A huge chunk of the Canongate in Edinburgh was taken over by their Holyrood brewery, including the site where the Scottish Parliament now sits.When William Younger died in , he was a hugely wealthy and successful businessman but also, it seems, exhausted and overworked. The empire he left was continued by the family but eventually in , the Younger enterprise was merged with rivals McEwanrsquos, to form Scottish Brewers Ltd.This merger, the reasons for which are another story, meant the Younger family branched out into other ventures. In the s, Harry Younger, the then head of the family, bought the land at Baro and began transforming it into the haven of nature it now is.Harry led an interesting and privileged le. He was an internationally known curler who regularly competed and won trophies. His intention was to create a new home amid the beauty of this area of East Lothian. He set about building a house, but also developed Bara Loch as it now exists and surrounded it with an embrace of trees.But the dark clouds of the Second World War intervened in his plans to enjoy this paradise. He had attended Sandhurst in his earlier years and seen the last months of the First World War. He remained involved in the Territorial Army and in January  he was sent to France as commander of a mechanised unit.It is recorded that he was killed in action on June  at St Valery-en-Caux. His unit, the Lothian and Border Horse, had been part of the brave and ferocious defence of the Dunkirk beaches. Anyone with knowledge of this action will understand the hell and desperation of that defence, and the supreme courage and sacrice of the defenders.Harry died on the day these brave defenders had to finally surrender, after over , had been evacuated from the beaches. How he died, what horrors he witnessed, we can only guess. He lies buried in the St Valery-en-Caux Franco-British Cemetery.And so this is the story attached to this beautul place. The man who began its creation never got the chance to enjoy it.In our walk, we arrived at a stone seat overlooking the loch. It had a worn inscription on it. We could make out the words lsquoin memoryrsquo or lsquomemorialrsquo and lsquoYoungerrsquo, but the rest was too worn.But I knew this must be a memorial to Harry Younger, which was later confirmed when I found a wonderful blog called Walking East Lothian in which the author explained he had traced the inscription to reveal Harryrsquos name and the date , the year of the lochrsquos creation.I sat on the seat and watched my kids play in the wood. The trees on the north side arch over the waterline to catch the sunlight, creating a canopy which dips into the loch. The serene tranquillity and beauty of the place is no doubt what Harry intended.But that in a sense is part of the magic of this place. As the pioneer Nelson Henderson once said to his son: ldquoThe true meaning of le is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit.It was these words I was reflecting on as I watched my children play. Harry was of course wealthy but we can all plant trees, either real ones or metaphorical ones, as a legacy for others.The recent death of a fellow storyteller and all-round wonderful woman, Ros Parkyn, was also on my mind. I had spoken about this place to her and of my intention to visit it. She loved nature too and would have gladly come along with me. But I sadly left it too late.Ros encapsulated all that was good and compassionate about humanity and she also planted many trees, some in the ground for she was a nature lover, but even more were planted in the hearts of those who knew her. They all now will grown as part of her wonderful legacy.As we left the wood, butterflies and blue dragonflies accompanied me, along with thoughts of my friend Ros and a man I didnrsquot know but whose trees shaded us.I willin autumn to see the colours and pay quiet homage to those who leave this world having made a positive dference."},{"url":null,"title":"new-primary-school-at-letham-mains-starting-to-take-shape","story":"Work began on Letham Mains Primary School, on Haddingtonrsquos western edge, earlier this year.The

Tranentrsquos eastern edge, despite the land being earmarked solely for economic development.Developers insisted that the only way to bring businesses onto the site was by generating funds from the sale of the new homes.They argued that making the site suitable for development would cost pound.million and it was not viable without housing.However, East Lothian Council rejected their plans at a meeting in August when officers insisted the site should be retained for employment use.Councillor John McMillan, economic spokesperson, referenced the Kevin Costner movie Field of Dreams when he told colleagues: ldquoIf we build it, they will come.Developers appealed to the Scottish Government to overturn their decision, insisting the local authority had failed to acknowledge the evidence they had provided which, they said, demonstrated the need for enabling residential development on the land.However, the Scottish Government Reporter appointed to investigate the appeal has now rejected their argument, siding with the council.He said that the Local Development Plan for East Lothian had set aside the land at Kingslaw for economic development and it should be retained as such.And he pointed out that the housing proposed by Barratt,which was described as lsquowindfallrsquo housing ndash which refers to a site which becomes available unexpectedly ndash would ldquosimply supplement an already generous housing land supply.Despite rejecting the appeal, the reporter said that he accepted the views of the developers and the District Valuer that the site was not financially viable as employment land in the current market conditions.He said: ldquoWhile I cannot be certain that there is no prospect of a business or industrial use being realised on the whole site, the information for this appeal indicates that, in the current economic conditions, it would be unlikely.However, he questioned whether the plans to build  houses and provide the local authority with . hectares of ldquoserviced land to build business units on it were possible, with no evidence the units would be created or could operate next to the new residential development.The reporter said: ldquoI find that the housing proposed would not directly enable commercial development to take place.ldquoAlthough not likely to be currently viable, the site would be removed as a strategic long-term employment option.East Lothian Council welcomed the ruling which is the first housing appeal to have been ruled in their favour since their new Local Development Plan was adopted.Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning convenor, said: ldquoWe welcome the outcome of this appeal both in the context of the Scottish Government Reporter upholding a decision that was carefully considered by East Lothianrsquos

The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship. The human race isnrsquot over yet."},{"url":null,"title":"high-school-gets-top-marks-from-inspectors","story":"St Ninianrsquos High School in Gfnock has received the best secondary inspection report since Education Scotland introduced new ratings in .The school was praised for the overall holistic education is provides and achieved two sector-leading ldquoexcellent evaluations - one for leadership and another for raising attainment.Read moreTeachers at more than  schools teaching three courses at the same timeIt was also awarded two very good ratings for ldquolearning, teaching and assessment and ldquoensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion.Head Teacher John Docherty was praised highly in the report, with the entire senior leadership team also credited with helping to deliver ldquooutstanding outcomes for pupils over a sustained period of time.Mr Docherty, who has been at the helm of the school for  years, said: ldquoIt is an absolute privilege to be Head Teacher at St Ninianrsquos High School and this excellent inspection report is reward for all the hard work put in by staff, pupils and parents over many years.ldquoWe always strive to provide the very best education for all our pupils, with a strong focus on giving them the skills they will need for later le.ldquoOur approach to preparing young people for employment involves a wide range of partners, and it is extremely pleasing to see this recognised by Education Scotland.ldquoSince our last inspection a decade ago the school has continued to improve and Irsquom absolutely committed to continuing to drive this school forward as we look to build on this latest endorsement, with everything we strive to achieve underpinned by gospel values, mutual respect and nurturing relationships across the school.Read moreIs Scotlands school subject squeeze damaging pupils Inspectors scrutinised four areas of work during the week long visit to the school, where pupils regularly achieve some of the best exam results in the country.Their report also highlighted the staffrsquos commitment to continuous professional learning, the highly motivated pupils who are determined to succeed and the ldquoclimate of aspiration which has been created in the school.Councillor Paul OrsquoKane, convener for Education and Equalities at East Renfrewshire Council, said: ldquoThis is an outstanding inspection report for St Ninianrsquos and Irsquom delighted for everyone at the school.

While some HRCs are licensed to take trade waste, some businesses dispose of or recycle their waste asit was domestic waste, therefore not paying for their commercial waste to be disposed of. As well as taking up space meant for local householders’ recyclable materials and causing congestion at facilities, it also has legal and financial implications. Steps to tackle the issue are being proposed to each of the Council’s Area Committees to allow local councillors to give feedback, prior to final consideration by the Infrastructure Services Committee. It follows agreement on a new waste strategy for the area in January, designed to push up recycling rates and send less materials to landfill. Currently, as much as % of the waste taken to recycling centres is thought to be business waste, which should not be there.Disposal of business waste by these means is thought to be costing Aberdeenshire taxpayers around £, a year – money which could be better spent improving recycling services for households. Businesses would be prevented from using HRCs and instead directed to use council waste transfer stations at Banchory, Ellon and Macduff.At these facilities materials can be accurately weighed and charged for appropriately. As it is around half the cost to recycle materials than to landfill them, this gives businesses an incentive to consider which materials have the potential to be erted from landfill.This approach would also make it fairer to those businesses which already dispose of their waste through a paid-for collection service or by paying for the waste they take to recycling centres. To try to ensure businesses cannot continue to use HRCs unlawfully, a vehicle permit system is being proposed. data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Staff from Johnston Carmichael at the Aberdeen Kiltwalk\"  Firm goes extra mile for charities viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Certain types of vehicle typically used by businesses would not be permitted at HRCs, specically those over . tonnes gross weight, tippers, tractors, large trailers and vehicles with twin wheels or more than four wheels.Under the proposals householders who use commercial type vehicleswould be able to apply for free permits to access HRCs. Households would apply for the free permits in advance and a year’s supplywould be issued at one time to minimise inconvenience.Aberdeenshire Council’s Waste Manager, Ros Baxter, said: “The majority of households will not be affected by the proposed permit system as those using cars, MPVs, xs or hire vans would continue to have unlimited access to recycling centres.“The permit system is simply designed to address the fact that some households use commercial type vehicles – we understand this and they will be able to use the services in the same way as other members of their community, with a permit which shows staff they are entitled. “In the past we have seen situations where staff are put in a dficult position where they suspect someone disposing of materials at an HRC is linked to a business but cannot prove this. “The permit system will avoid any confusion and will make it perfectly clear that only household materials are permitted to be disposed of at our HRCs.“It is also really important that businesses take disposal costs into account when charging for work, paying appropriately for the waste they create. Following recent public engagement on budget setting, we know many residents agree with this approach that the council should not subsidise businesses. It is not for the taxpayer to pick up this bill on their behalf, hence these proposals."},{"url":null,"title":"poppy scotland s bud visits meldrum pupils","story":"Poppy Scotland#s travelling education vehicle, Bud, visited Meldrum Academy last week.Pupils in S and S had the opportunity to step inside the special vehicle so that they could learn more about the charity and the work it does.The Bud vehicle is interactive, giving pupils the chance to watch videos and they also had a go at making their own poppy.Bud aims to teach pupils about the Lady Haig Poppy Factory and showcases ious items from the Poppy Scotland archive including poppies from across the world.The academy was one of the few schools chosen in Aberdeenshire to get a visit from Bud thanks to the work of one of its pupils.S pupil Anna Jackson was a finalist in Poppy Scotland’s ‘Breaking News, War is Over’ competition.Meldrum Academy had five entries and Anna was selected as one of three finalists.She created her own newspaper, with the leading story announcing that war was over.Anna said: “I did research for it on the internet and I stained it with tea to make it look like it was from that time.“I was excited to make it to the finals.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Carolyn McKay on her practice walk at Lochnagar\"  Inverurie mum to trek Ben NevisviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Samantha Banks with her Official Make Up award\"  Top award for make-up artist viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"raft race hailed a success","story":"The Inverurie Raft Race celebrated its th anniversary at the weekend.Event organisers, Inverurie Scout Group, said they were “delighted” with the turnout of over  participants on Sunday, June .A total of  rafts entered the event this year.Over  people turned out to watch the race at dferent stages along the route, while it is estimated that over  people gathered at the finish line in Inverurie to watch the rafts come in.This was the first year that the Inverurie Scout Group took charge of the event after the previous hosts, Inverurie Lions, stood down due to a lack of volunteers.The Scouts are already discussing ways that they could improve the race for next year following their successful first event.At the race’s Inverurie end the Scout Group had support from all of its sections including the Beavers, Cubs, Scouts and Explorers.Speaking to the Herald Jackie McBeath of Inverurie Scout Group said: “It was great to see them enjoying themselves but also contributing to raising money for good causes in our area.“Our total raised is yet to be confirmed but it will be at least £, that will be split between Inverurie Scout Group, Kayleigh’s Wee Stars and MS Scotland.“This is an amazing amount to raise and has made me very proud to be part of the organising of this event on behalf of Inverurie Scout Group.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Russell being congratulated by his we Alyson, son Frankie and daughter Georgie after completing the marathon challenge\"  Russell runs  mile marathon for JackviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Equipment at Inverurie Police Station has been highlighted as unsuitable\"  Poor conditions highlighted at police stations viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"June ,  at : amA RICH and ied programme of events gets underway later this week as the centenary approaches of the scuttling of the German High Seas Fleet in Scapa Flow.

According to these three parties, the new power supply system — known as #cold ironing# — will reduce the overnight carbon footprint from the vessel’s diesel generators and engines. It is believed that this will lower the ferry#s fuel consumption by at least  tonnes a year and resulting in a signicant reduction in carbon dioxide. It is also hoped that this will make a contribution towards further reducing nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides and noise.According to the organisations behind these plans, it will be £, cheaper to service MV Hamnavoe each year, as a result of the project. £, of funding was secured for the scheme from the European Regional Development Fund in August last year, with additional funding coming from OIC#s Miscellaneous Piers and Harbours fund and HITRANS.The scheme is expected to fully pay for itself in three years’ time through efficiencies and cost savings.Organisations behind the project say that other benefits will include the installation of an electric bus charger at the ferry terminal to open up opportunities for an electric vehicle to be used on the Stromness to Kirkwall route. There are also plans for the installation of electric vehicle charging points, as well as  electric bicycles for use by members of the public.For the full story, pick up a copy of The Orcadian, this Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The network spans  countries from Russia to Ireland and from Norway to Malta.There were representatives of  countries at the meeting, hosted by Za Zamiata, Friends of the Earth Bulgaria.As well as discussing bylaws and agreeing budgets, we visited Kresna Gorge, a lovely km river canyon which is Bulgaria’s top hotspot for nature and is a gateway to the Pirin National Park, a Unesco World Heritage site.The gorge is host to  protected species, including bears, wolves and two sorts of tortoise, and provides a safe corridor for wildle to travel through this part of Bulgaria, including migrating Egyptian vultures.It is said that more butterflies live in one square kilometre of the Kresna Gorge than in the whole of the UK.The main road to Greece goes through the gorge. Traffic on the road has tripled in the last  years.The Bulgarian government had agreed to build a new motorway in a tunnel, to avoid trashing the gorge, but the plan has changed to building a full on motorway.This has received half a billion euros of European funding despite the gorge and its species supposedly being protected by European nature laws.The motorway would massively increase traffic flow, change the character of the gorge completely where section of the walls were removed to allow for a straighter road, destroy most of the best agricultural land and risk serious water pollution from road runoff in all seasons and salting operations in the winter.We visited the Kresna Gorge to hang a giant campaign banner from one of the bridges over the Struma River.The story featured on three Bulgarian TV stations, including a live interview from the protest.There are , signatures on a petition to save Kresna Gorge and we went to Kresna village to hear from a range of local campaigners.One man told us of his distress over the years as the traffic built up and more and more wild animals were killed on the road.Now, he says, there is very little roadkill because populations have been reduced so severely.We also heard from a representative of the rafting industry, which brings tens of thousands people to the area every year. They are all clear that they want the existing road to remain for local access and the previously-promised motorway in a tunnel to take the long distance traffic.The local campaigners made accusations of corruption, with sections of the road starting construction even before the tendering process was completed.Repeated appeals to the European Commission to intervene to protect nature have been met with silence.With tremendously fortuitous timing, as we were standing in the village square meeting the locals, we got the very welcome news that the Welsh government had turned down the M relief road, which has been debated for at least  years and would have severely damaged the sensitive Gwent Levels coastal wetlands.As you can imagine, there was a heart-felt cheer in Kresna at this news. Wales declared a Climate Emergency shortly after Scotland did in April and this was the first big test of whether they are serious. They have passed that test and in doing so given renewed hope to people , miles away, at the opposite end of Europe.l Dr Richard Dixon is director of Friends of the Earth Scotland©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"leader comment time for the bbc to get priorities right","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Broadcaster should think again about decision to scrap free licences for the over s.

Controversy flared after black-out barriers erected on Princes Street on the insistence of the city council to ensure public safety on the road and pavements blocked out views of Edinburgh Castle, even on days when no events were on.: ‘Heartbreaking’ - Edinburgh reacts to picture of Princes Street Gardens looking like ploughed fieldThe number of Summer Sessions concerts during this year’s Fringe has been almost doubled from five to nine this year, with Florence  The Machine, Primal Scream, Chvrches, Lewis Capaldi, James and Madness in the  line-up.It emerged last month that a second new series of concerts had been given the green light by the city council. Tribute acts to Elvis Presley, Queen, The Jam and Status Quo are among the acts lined up for the Edinburgh Summer Fiesta in July.It is understood that the council has decided against imposing a limit on the number of events in the gardens which require them to be closed to the public. Instead, organisers of all but the biggest events are to be told to ensure full access to the gardens is maintained. Fly Events director Tom Ketley said: “Council staff could not have been more supportive in helping this event grow. However, having operated successfully in Princes Street Gardens for the past three years, we have now been told that September’s event must scale back in size and cannot have the same footprint it did previously. Council officers have said the event must be restricted to the confines of the Ross Theatre and unfortunately these changes would make it impossible for our event to go ahead.“It would be unsafe and overcrowded with no space for queue management and search lanes. Plus, all medical, food, power and bar provisions would need to be placed on the dance floor of the event arena – creating additional overcrowding and signicantly impacting on the capacity of the show. “Officers also asked that there would be no event perimeter, which would cause huge public safety concerns. These suggestions make the show unviable.“Despite discussions with officers on these points, I am advised that due to heightened scrutiny on operations within the park due to other events coming in and causing issues, it would therefore mean Fly Open Air cannot take place this year. We find this grossly unfair.“I want to make the case that young people in our city deserve the right to use the space. I want ersity in Edinburgh’s music scene and for the council to continue to support an event that it helped create.”: See how our vision for Princes Street Gardens is starting to bear fruit – Donald WilsonNick Stewart, owner of music venue Sneaky Pete’s and a leading figure in the recent Keep Music Audible campaign in Edinburgh, said: “It sounds like the council is not being supportive of a very well run event that has given joy to a huge amount of Edinburgh’s youth. An element of cultural snobbery may be taking place where dance music events, loved by young people, are seen as low culture, and therefore less worthy of support. “We don’t think authorities should decide which music events do or don’t go ahead based on their genre content: audiences should dictate that. Fly has a large, dedicated and very lovely audience.”A spokeswoman for the city council said: “We are still in discussions with the Fly Events around arrangements for their proposed September events.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon to talk up independent scotland s eu status in brussels visit","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon will set out how an independent Scotland can remain part of the EU today as she meets euro chiefs in Brussels.The First Minister again made it clear as she arrived in the Belgian capitalthat she plans to stage a fresh referendum on Scottish independence, ahead of meetings withEU President Jean-Claude Juncker and the EUs chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier.And the First Minister will also make a speech at the European Policy Centre where she will set out how she plans to pave the way for Scotlandto remain in the EU after a Yes vote.\"Scotland in my view must have the option of choosing to become independent in order to remain a country at the heart of Europethat cannot be achieved within the UK,\" Ms Sturgeon told Sky News.\"Thats why weve started preparations in the Scottish Parliament to give people that choice.\": Sturgeon: Prospect of Boris Johnson as PM is a nightmare for Scotland Legislation has been published at Holyrood on the way future referendums should be run and she wants to see this vote held next year.However such a vote would require approval from Westminster which has power over the constitution all the contenders to replace Theresa May as Prime Minister have indicated they would reject such a move.The SNP leaders visit comes just weeks after the European elections - where the SNP increased its share of the vote and won three of the six spots for Scottish MEPs.

Overall a victory for hope not hate. Lest we forget what international solidarity and cooperation sounds like:Love it. What a wonderful man and what a great work – one of Europe’s greatest composers and one of Europe’s greatest poets – a sublime combination. Here’s to Europe and Europeans: Wo dein zanfter Flügel weiltThis has always been my favourite stanza, but I’ve yet to find a satisfactory English translation – one that conveys the humanity as well as the poetry. Would you happen to have one Peter as ian says your discount the exit tories and labour. and best for remain itsa draw at worse its a good win for leave.In Britain, the total Remain vote was larger than the total Leave vote :. you claim that is not true.O dear me, Peter, you have absolutely forgotten both the Tories and the Labour voters. What you have counted was the Leave without a deal of any type vote  and your figure of  includes voters who may care nothing about the EU but are considering a host of other reasons for casting their vote.LOL The London Liberals’ view of democracy:“Dear plebs, we’re honouring you by asking your advice on which of two options # Leave or Remain # you want us to adopt .” 🙂Alternative description of London Liberals:They made it % clear that they want to withdraw Article  and remain in the EU.They expressed this view in language that was so clear that not a single person could misunderstand them.Millions of London plebs agreed with them and voted Liberal, so they won the election.If you saw anything dferent John, I suspect your moving picture wireless needs re-tuning.Would you say the same about the SNP in Scotland, Malcolm Still thinking about it, Malc Not at all Brian.There’s nothing to think about.I replied to you immediately but I forgot to gentry my working-class language, so it wasn’t published.The Lib Dems in London and the SNP in Scotland had a very similar policy on Article  and EU membership.The SNP had clearly planned their strategy well in advance and provided clear guidance to their supporters who knew exactly what they were voting for.Why did that make you swear Stop fishing Brian.I would never swear at you.I merely referred to the Brexitiers in language that was a trle unrefined.@MHJ, Like you, I replied immediately and my comment was withheld, although, notI may say, due to foul language. You clearly misunderstood my point, which related to democracy.Clarity is a desirable quality of communication, in itself, neutral. As opposed to democracy, which is a fundamental principle by which we live and are governed.Liebe Rosa, you’ve fairly thrown down the gauntlet there!I agree, each translation has issues, but happily help is at hand within Shetland culture. Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us, saying that joy in this reunites us. He knew it was chance that saw us on one side or another of any nationalist driven war, and wanted to emphasise the need for healing and togetherness.It’s a concept of course that also is captured by Robert Burns ten years after Schiller in: For a’ that and a’ that, or Trotz alledem und alledem, as it also became in . The final lines guaranteed translation into many other language too:Shall brithers be for a# thatSchiller would also have recognised the romantic sensibilities which informed Shetland’s Up-Helly Aa, or unserer feuer-trunken Faschingsdeinstag, ob du wilst. I think these lines from the closing verse of The Galley Song capture Schiller’s intention perfectly:O’er stre the curtain drawHappy to see Europe inspiring Shetland still!#Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us#Unless of course they#re English eh Peter. You want to separate scotland from the rest of the UK yet come out with the PC BS above. just who are you trying to kid I wondered when the anti- English racist rhetoric would raise its ugly head on here. Rule Britannia was actually written by Thomas Arne a Roman Catholic who was proud to be British. He’d get short shrt on the so called Liberal Shetland Islands.The first  notes of Beethoven#s Fth. Lest we forget how Europe became free.And there is a big world out there we don#t need Europepo founded , napoleon long dead by then. liberals to replace lairds  look at tavish family historyThe original company originates from , with the formation of the Peninsular  Oriental Steam Navigation Company, Napolean not long dead . Napoleonic Wars were certainly consequential in the rationale behind the companies formation. Particularly the Peninsular war.It wasn’t of course ever a one way street. Garve, a contemporary of Schiller and Goethe, did a great to broadcast the gains of the Scottish Enlightenment by translating and accrediting the works of Smith, Hume, Ferguson, Hutcheson, Reid and others, to the extent that Goethe himself, though perhaps before his heyday, said there was nowhere in Europe that could hold a candle to what was happening in Scotland. It would be unreasonable to suggest Burns did not become familiar with the thoughts of Kant, Rousseau, Locke, and other European philosophers, directly or indirectly, in the salons of Edinburgh. It would similarly be a nonsense to suggest that Haldane had no exposure to all this. His inspiration cannot be orced from the earlier flourishing of inspirational ideas of brotherhood and equal worth that happily live on yet. Shetland, after the Napoleonic era, seems to have been quite a radical place to a degree, as the later broken-promise legal challenges possibly demonstrate. There was also a legal challenge related to a whale grounding in Sandwick which seemed fairly radical in intent. The underpinning ideas don’t appear to respect the random lines drawn on maps that seem to dominate some people’s thinking.Some lines are more equal than others eh Peter The modern Labour movement of course grew out of the earlier Liberals, with many older ideas and values broadly held in common. Opening the debate, crossbencher, Lord Lisvane saw a problem where Scotland and Northern Ireland, as two of four parts of the United Kingdom, backed Remain, yet could be dragged out of Europe against their will. He identied #a sort of imperial condescension from the centre—from Westminster and Whitehall# and sought #a devolution settlement properly owned by its participants# that would #include something perhaps missing from the present arrangements: the R word—respect.#Most Scots voted to continue their solidarity with Europe, whilst a signicantminority of English and Welsh voters would apparently risk sacricing their older union with Scotland in order to Leave. Schilleradvocated seeking broadminded and warmhearted company. Should the UK falter, will it be those who sought to continue to enjoy the benefits of the wider degree of solidarity who are really to blame I am so sorry, Peter Hamilton, Schiller died two hundred years ago. Have you someone a little more contemporary to bore us with  Tony Benn had some creative thoughts about Europe, as did Jack Jones. They were real socialists and Democrats, not pretentious windbags. Now carry on spouting, Liebe Rosa, will be most impressed. # made me realise how cushioned from the worst excesses of Tory Lib-Dem austerity we are in Scotland: free prescriptions, no bedroom tax and – of vital important to many state benefit recipients – universal credit payment choices, to name but three. This of course, was reflected in Shetland’s EU election result. My friend is planning on early retirement and swt relocation to pro-Europe Shetland.In that same spirit, and reflecting on Northern Ireland’s and Scotland’s situation, I found myself wondering how someone might feeltheir favourite pub, which offers a decent selection of bar meals, was to be burned down by their dour in-laws who run the bog standard cafe next door, all in order to secure wider access to the market.These words were in the context of his apologising to the Roma people for Catholic discrimination.They sit in contrast to Farage’s racist and isive comments regarding Romanians that some people willingly overlook.

He lived at Wilson Crescent and was a keen walker. Few,any, would have known that the tall, bespectacled figure who went about his civilian le so quietly and modestly was one of the heroes of D-Day.This is what his citation recorded about the action:-  Unit : B Company, th Parachute Battalion. Service No. : . Awards : Distinguished Conduct Medal‘This NCO was one of the parachute troops who landed behind the German lines in Normandy on the night th th June . During the fighting for Beacutenouville bridge on the th June, McCambridges platoon was responsible for holding the village of Le Port. At one period his section became detached from the platoon and the fighting, which went on for  hours almost without pause, was particularly fierce. McCambridge noticed that one house dominated the scene of the fighting. By skilful use of a smoke grenade and displaying the greatest dash he got his section across a road swept by Machine Gun fire and into the house. He used anti-tank grenades to smash open the garden gate and the door of the house. Once inside the house he was completely cut off from the rest of his company, who actually had withdrawn slightly, but he was in a dominating position and became the target for the enemy who greatly outnumbered his section and were surrounding him. So well did he dispose his men however and so splendid was his leadership that he held this isolated house until the seaborne troops eventually entered the village from the other end, several hours later. At times the enemy were close enough to try and beat down the door by beating it with their rle butts - McCambridge dealt with such attacks by having grenades dropped on them from the upper windows. There is no doubt that the holding of this dominating house seriously weakened the enemy attacks and greatly assisted the battalion to carry out its job of holding the bridge. On the th June at Bois de Bavent during a company attack Sgt McCambridge, together with another NCO, saved the le of his platoon commander, who had been wounded and whose phosphorus bomb was burning in his pouch. Between them they extracted the burning bomb and dragged the officer to cover despite heavy and accurate mortar and Machine Gun fire.McCambridge has shown himself throughout the three weeks continuous fighting to be a truly magnicent NCO. He is calm, cheerful and always reliable.

The Amateurs celebrated reaching the historic milestone by holding a gala sports dinner at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel in Ballynahinch“Sixty years is a long time for a Junior or indeed an Intermediate club to keep going, especially in the modern day when there are so many other attractions,” said Mr Martin.He revealed that the Irish FA was working on a strategy to reverse the nationwide decline in the adult game, and hoped that the Amateurs would themselves benefit from this plan in the near future.Over  members, friends and former players of Dromore Amateurs enjoyed a fantastic evening at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel, Ballynahinch on April  as the club celebrated in fine style its th anniversary.Formed at the beginning of the   season, the Amateurs have maintained football in the Co Down town for six decades.Terry Pateman, chairman of the Northern Amateur Football League, presents a crystal vase to Amateurs chairman Russell WardAs well as the president of the Irish FA, special guests on the night included Terry Pateman, chairman of the Northern Amateur Football League, and Maurice Johnston, vice chairman of the Mid Ulster Football League.Dromore played in the Northern Amateur Football League from  to  and again from  to , before moving to the Mid Ulster Football League where they currently play in the Intermediate B Division.The compere and after-dinner speaker was BBC legend Jackie Fullerton, whose wit and charm throughout the evening brought much fun and laughter.The Ballymena man’s tales about sporting icons George Best, Joey Dunlop and Alex Higgins went down a storm with the audience.Mid Ulster Football League representatives Maurice Johnston, vice chairman, left, and Stephen Magill, honorary secretary, right, make a presentation to Russell Ward, chairman of Dromore AmateursMr Fullerton was the perfect gentleman with all he met, mingling with guests and accommodating every request for a photograph or a selfie with good grace.SpeechesThe Amateurs’ hard-working committee was delighted to secure the attendance of such a prestigious guest as the president of Irish FA.Universal Credit in Crisis: These people want you to hear their stories of le on the problem benefit before it is rolled-out even further Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"However, the pleasure was reciprocated because, of course, Mr Martin is an Amateurs old boy himself.Top goalscorer and first team player of the year Matthew Reain, centre, withcoach Keith Halliday and manager Graeme DavisHe spent  years with the club as a player and club treasurer.“I receive many invitations over the course of a year but this is one which gives me so much pleasure in being able to attend,” Mr Martin told the audience. “It was Mountview Park in  when I joined the club.“I was a second team player. Robert Gracey, Sam Vint, Aubrey Davidson, Wyn Crothers, Brendan Maginess, Philip Roy, Bernie Mackin, John Toucher and, of course, so many others, were my teammates.“They were great times, great moments. We weren’t successful, however these guys were fine clubmen.“I was treasurer from  to . We developed the clubhouse and upgraded the pitch and surroundings. We put the club on a sound financial footing before I left in  – this was achieved from a less-than-zero position in .“Suffice to say, this is where I began as a football administrator and I have always been grateful to the club for that.”Commenting on the Amateurs’ exciting plans for a new pitch and clubrooms, Mr Martin said the future was looking bright for his old club. He brought the best wishes of the Irish FA and on their behalf presented a crystal bowl to Dromore chairman Russell Ward to mark the occasion.Indeed, Mr Ward was a busy man on the night.In addition to making two fine speeches himself, the Amateurs chairman was presented with a further two pieces of crystal from Mr Pateman and Mr Johnston. Both league officials made excellent speeches during which they brought the best wishes of their respective organisations and paid generous compliments to Dromore on reaching their th anniversary.AuctionA highlight of the evening was the auction of sporting memorabilia. Hospitality tickets for a Northern Ireland game, signed shirts from Ulster Rugby and Linfield FC, and signed footballs from Rangers FC and Manchester United, all sold for very respectable sums.However, a titanic bidding war took place over a signed Liverpool FC football and the atmosphere in the room was electric as the figure kept getting higher and higher.When the auctioneer, Mr Fullerton, eventually brought the hammer down and declared ‘sold’, it was Amateurs committee member and local businessman Darren McCauley who became the new owner of the prized football.He might have paid an eye-watering amount, but being a lelong Liverpool fan and a great Dromore clubman, Mr McCauley was delighted with his purchase – and with Liverpool having won the Champions League final at the weekend, it now looks like a clever investment.With the formalities over, it was time for the band to take to the stage, and five-piece Klass proved a big hit, packing the dancefloor until the finish.AwardsThe final act of the   season came on Saturday, May  with a charity match between current players and a team of Amateurs “legends”.An entertaining game was played in a friendly but competitive spirit at the Community Centre.The youthful legs of the current players proved too much for the wise old heads of the legends. However, a clever tactical decision to play the last  minutes with  players on the pitch helped the old boys finish the game with a respectable - defeat.It was wonderful to see so many former players come along, pull the boots on and attempt to relive past glories. Special mention goes to Malcolm Hanna, who celebrated his th birthday with a sterling display in midfield.A total of £ was raised for Diabetes UK, with the costs of the day kindly sponsored by Trevor Tate and Son Transport Ltd.Afterwards, the Amateurs held their end-of-season awards presentation in the clubrooms.Chairman Russell Ward expressed his sincere thanks to the coaching staff, players and committee for all their efforts throughout the season.First team player-manager Graeme Davis was praised for guiding the Amateurs to their highest place league finish in many years.Dromore ended the season in fth positionin the Intermediate B Division of the Mid Ulster Football League.Their record was as follows: P W D L Pts .Graeme can be proud of this achievement in his debut season in charge.

Although there were many ups and downs over the year, the team stuck together and there was a great spirit in the changing room, right up until the last game.The award winners for both teams was dominated by young players – an encouraging sign for the future.The first teams gongs were a family affair, with the Reain brothers, Josh and Matthew, iding up the trophies between them. These two fantastic athletes will be the backbone of the first team for many years to come.Young player of the year was Matthew Briggs, who moved up from youth football and played the entire season in the first team - a tremendous achievement.In the seconds, top goalscorer Jonathan Rodgers only joined midway through the season but he is a great attacking player and is such an exciting prospect. And -year-old Nathan Thompson capped a wonderful season by taking home both the manager’s and players’ player of the year trophies. Nathan is a quiet young man – but on the pitch he makes his presence felt, and is a model defender who rarely makes a mistake.Clubman of the year was the popular Christopher Tate – a committee member and first team coach, Christopher puts his heart and soul into the club.Dromore Amateurs will hold their AGM in the clubrooms on Monday, June  at pm.

However, underlying issues of majority and binary decision-making processes, and the resulting exclusion of certain voices, are ones that have dogged the institutions since the formation of the Northern state. It is this same system of binary voting that has further polarised opinions and furthered tension in the wake of the Brexit vote. Therefore, it is in this broad context that democratic processes advocated by the North Belfast-based de Borda Institute become all the more interesting.Headed up by Ballysillan man Peter Emerson, The de Borda Institute aims to promote the use of inclusive voting procedures on issues of social choice. These procedures are multi-choice and make use of points based voting system popularised by French mathematician Jean-Charles de Borda.Peter began his own professional career in the British Navy, but soon became disillusioned with the role of British Empire, instead viewing colonialism as “part of the problem” in other nations.His ergent path following his naval resignation saw him move to Rwanda, where he worked as a teacher in the s. It was during that time that he began questioning the majority voting systems implemented by Europeans worldwide. When he came to the North of Ireland in , he realised how similar processes had hindered political progress. “Traditional African decision-making is so much better than majority voting,” he explained.“When you look back and realise that Europeans went to Rwanda and applied majority rule. How crazy can you get “I started to question majority rule in Africa. Then I came here in  and realised that it was part of the problem here. My dad was Irish, from Cork, but he was a member of the minority because he was a Protestant. My mum was English, but she was a member of the minority because she was Catholic, so I’m a political b*****d.“We have this stupid thing here where we’re asked whether we’re British or Irish, which I was asked a lot when I arrived here. They have the same in Rwanda – are you Hutu or Tutsi  It’s a closed question. You’re caught because you could be neither, or both, so you can’t answer a question like that.“I realised very early on that the question was part of the Northern Ireland problem. In  there was the Anglo-Irish Agreement and you had Paisley standing outside City Hall protesting. One week later, six of us stood outside the same venue with a banner saying ‘we have got to say yes to something’.“Six months later we brought a number of parties together at a conference to discuss a range of issues. You put down in order of preference what you like and you can see which option has the widest support. We did this in May . We had Sinn Féin, Official Unionists, UDA, Ulster Clubs – you name it – and we had this fantastic meeting. People could suggest anything they like and as long as it didn’t infringe the UN Charter on Human Rights it was allowed.“We finished with  options on the ballot paper and the people came to conclusion that Northern Ireland should have devolution and power sharing within a joint Dublin, London and Belfast tripartite agreement. It was like a mini Good Friday Agreement, but just  years ahead of its time.”The methods – known as the ‘Borda Count’ – employed by The de Borda Institute, are used to determine the highest average vote amongst a number of options, resulting in what should be a more democratic outcome. While western countries pride themselves on being ‘democratic’, Peter said that their use of majority voting calls that self-ascribed description into question.“In Western Europe we often discuss electoral systems, but when it comes to decision-making it has to be a majority vote,” he said.“Sometimes you see complaints about North Korea, and their elections where they have do you want candidate ‘x’, ‘yes’ or ‘no’  Then we go ahead and have Brexit, ‘yes’ or ‘no’ – it’s the same thing. The basic idea of just asking yes or no is too primitive and gives all the power to the person who sets the question. Majority voting has been used by Napoleon, Lenin, Mussolini, Hitler, Pinochet, Duvalier, Saddam Hussein, Gaddafi – you name it – dictators love it. David Cameron wrote the Brexit question. The Electoral Commission says it’s fair – it’s crazy. It’s like asking a vegetarianthey would like beef or lamb.”In the coming months Peter plans to publish a new book entitled ‘Majority Voting as a Catalyst of Populism’, which tells of his overland journey from Belfast to Beijing and back. The book offers an assessment of a number of regions that he visitied that have suffered from majoritarianism, including post-conflict areas such as the Balkans and the North of Ireland. Asked about our own political impasse, Peter said: “Politicians don’t like the idea of giving people a choice. The politician who wants ‘x’ is happy to have it on the ballot paper, and maybe ‘y’, but not ‘z’. If you are a proper democrat and you want the will of the people then you give them the choice to decide. Then whatever they decide you, the Executive, execute. If you totally disagree then you resign.“We go to the polling stations and elect an assembly. If somebody abstains then that’s fine. Those who do want to get on with it can. If the DUP and Sinn Féin don’t want to be there then that’s a pity, but to give them the monopoly or veto is a crazy way of doing things. Part of the trouble is that the Belfast Agreement was designed by people who were part of the problem in the first place. It is a very majoritarian document. They devised this system that gives them control.”He added: “This idea that because one group is bigger or more numerous that they can tell the other where to go is totally primitive.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"total rematch for a night in november","story":"AUGUST  and the curtain came up on Marie Jones’ A Night in November, making its theatrical debut as part of Féile an Phobail.  years on and the play is back, detailing one man’s struggle with identity at the Lyric Theatre.The play charts the story of welfare clerk Kenneth McAllister, a Protestant who has always followed the rules and has “cleanly discriminated” against Catholics throughout his le. This is the case up until he witnesses the hatred and bigotry directed towards Irish supporters of the now infamous and most politically -charged match between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland during the  World Cup qualier at Windsor Park.The toxic atmosphere which rained down from the stands was captured in Marie’s prose the match comingjust days after the Shankill bombing and the Greysteel murders.The Fall and Come Home actor Matthew Forsythe fought off  submissions,  self-tapes and “ people in the room which was then whittled down to ,” for the “dream role” of playing Kenneth.“I read it around  and it was and is one of those theatre pieces that I instantly felt a connection with. I saw a lot of me in the part especially growing up in the s and s.”The play on its first initial run was a showcase for actor Dan Gordon who portrayed Kenneth, and later Marty Maguire who toured the production around the States. Matthew explained how when he was trying to get into drama school across the water he contacted Dan for advice and support.“I was holding a charity event to try and raise a bit of money, Dan couldn’t come but he sent me a postcard with a £ cheque in it and the postcard was of Dan in character as Kenneth. I still have it,” he said.Matthew’s further connection to the piece was that he was in the Windsor stands that ‘night in November’having been taken to see the match with his school, Laurelhill High School in Lisburn.In August  Patrick Kielty took on the role of Kenneth, directed by acclaimed actor Ian McElhinney during a run at the Opera House. Fast-forward  years and its Ian and Marie’s son Matthew now in the director’s chair.“The play debuted during a very sensitive, political time,” explained Matthew McElhinney, “the reaction was very funny, very moving and very engaging. There was some controversy over the content, it was seen as being not painting the side of the community my mother came from in the best light, essentially it was a critique of her own community, her own people. Mum was writing about what she saw at the time. Such was its reaction the Lyric had to put on extra security.”Asked about the signicance of the play  years on Matthew spoke of how the play “paints the two sides of football”.“I remember there was talk of bringing the play back to the stage during the Euro’s but mum said it wasn’t the right time.  years is a big anniversary and I kept thinking ‘how am I going to stage this ’ To frame it within the context of that was then, this is now. There has been astounding progress from the ‘Billy Boys’ to being awarded the Grand Vermeil in  during the Euros, for the Northern Ireland fans along with the Republic. It’s a chance to say look at what we have achieved, and the tagline of the play is ‘is it possible to change ’“The play has ups, downs, laughs and emotion. It’s been  years and we are about to have a whole new generation come to see it.”A Night in November runs at the Lyric Theatre from June -.

We will support Ireland’s fishing boats.”John O’Kane from Foyle Fishermans Co-Operative Society said three vessels are fishing in the disputed area and have no plans to cut short their trip, and when they , will head back to Rockall despite the warnings from the Scottish government.The boats are small family fishing businesses with six to eight staff aboard fishing mainly for haddock, monkfish and squid.“This announcement came totally out of the blue and we were unaware about any notication to the Irish government prior to that,” Mr O’Kane said.“There’s a bit of diplomacy going on at the minute, and we’re hoping that resolves it, but at this minute in time, we’ve not had any word from anyone in the Irish government.“Our boats have been fishing there since January, its a very sustainable fishery, it’s rich fishing ground, and our boats have fished there for over  years.“The last thing we want is a Scottish patrol vessel making arrests, taking people ashore. You lose time, you have the expense, a court case, a fine and the repercussions of whether to go back to fish from that area.“This is our business, we need as much fish coming in as possible, we have markets to supply, and everyone on the boats, the crew to the skipper, to the locals who work on the pier, we’re all reliant on these boats continuing to fish.“There’s many families in the local Donegal area dependent on whitefish vessels fishing at Rockall.“Everything from the local shop, to the welder, to the boatbuilder, they’re all reliant on this industry.”A Scottish government spokeswoman said: “Irish vessels or any non-UK vessels for that matter have never been allowed to fish in this way in the UK’s territorial sea around Rockall and, despite undertaking extensive discussions with the Irish authorities on the matter, it is disappointing that this activity continues.“There has actually been an increase in that illegal activity and, with the Rockall fishery season nearly upon us, it is our duty and obligation to defend the interests of Scottish fisheries and ensure compliance with well-established international law.”The Scottish government first raised the issue of access to the area around Rockall in , according to the Irish government."},{"url":null,"title":"oops sinn fein press advisor accidentally sends mass email asking about redundancy","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I believe we have achieved this outcome with the design incorporating the Mourne mountains, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoI am also pleased that dedicated motorhome bays have been provided in Castle Park and that the spaces are being well used.Cllr Clarke said it was important that the local authority works with motorhome owners as Newcastle and the wider region needed to be a welcoming place for

obesity epidemic  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council is aiming to help fight the growing obesity crisis across Northern Ireland.Local politicians are gearing up to declare war on the issue and implement a new policy that will result in high sugar items such as sweets, fizzy drinks and high fat snacks being banned from vending machines in council buildings across the district, including its leisure centres.The high sugar items will be replaced with healthy choice snacks and drinks with local politicians hoping that other organisations across the district, which have vending machines in their buildings, will follow suit.A number of local schools have already banned chocolates and crisps from their vending machines with politicians keen to lead from the front in encouraging people to eat more healthily and exercise regularly.Last year, the local authority launched a new app to make it easier for residents across the district to take part in sport and leisure activities and receive up-to-date information about the local authorityrsquos leisure facilities.Now it wants to go a step further to help improve peoplersquos health.The move to ban high fat and sugary items from vending machines across council buildings, which will be formally discussed later this month, comes after it emerged this week that sweets, crisps and fizzy drinks could soon be sold under cigarette-style plain packaging under plans by a number of leading brands to help combat the obesity epidemic.A recent Department of Health survey revealed that that % of people in Northern Ireland were overweight, with % classed as obese with councillors acutely aware that obesity continues to be one of the most important public health challenges.They recognise that being overweight or obese increases the risk of le threatening disease, with its costs extending far beyond the public sector, affecting iniduals, families, communities, the economy and society as a whole.At Monday nightrsquos monthly meeting of the local authority, politicians agreed to debate the possible ban and view the move as an important step towards tacking the obesity issue.They aim to encourage people to opt for healthier food choices and to change their diet as part of the drive to create an environment that supports and promotes a physically active lestyle and healthy diet.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke, who is spearheading the drive to ban sugary snacks and drinks from council vending machines, said he hopes it will empower people to make healthier choices and reduce the risk of overweight and obesity related diseases.He said tackling childhood obesity was already a public health priority and was keen for Newry, Mourne and Down Council to do all it could at a time when research suggested that one in four children across the island of Ireland carried excess weight.Cllr Clarke said that without action to reverse current trends, the next generation will be beset with signicant ill-health related issues linked to obesity, most of which are potentially preventable.ldquoI am keen for the local council to introduce a new policy to effectively ban high fat and sugary foods and drinks from vending machines across its facilities and replace them with healthy options, he explained.ldquoI also hope that the local authorityrsquos many partner organisations will follow suit. We do not want to see obesity becoming a social norm and I believe we can help make a dference by exercising greater control over what items are in vending machines in all council buildings.Cllr Clarke said he viewed a ban on sugary snacks and drinks as ldquojust the start of a concerted campaign to help tackle obesity and get people move towards healthier lestyles.ldquoI think it is important that the council takes the lead on an issue which everyone can support. It is essential people signicantly reduce their intake of unhealthy food and drinks, he said.The local councillor also suggested that the local authority should offer politicians healthy options when they arrive for their tea ahead of the monthly council meetings.ldquoHealthy options featuring salads, fruit and vegetables should also be on the menu at council-organised s so people can choose to eat healthily. While I want the council to take the lead on this issue, I hope many other bodies it works alongside will follow suit.ldquoWorking together we can make a dference and help people change their lives. The councilrsquos lead on this issue could have a ripple effect across the district beyond.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoThis is not about being a kill joy but encouraging people to be more health conscious when it comes to what they eat and drink and is the first step in a process..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Countdown to DownTime summer festival  ","story":"THE countdown is on for this monthrsquos spectacular DownTime summer festival which has something for everyone.Organisers of the four-day community event mdash which kicks off on June  mdash are promising a sparkling festival of fun which includes two daysrsquo of not-to-be-missed horse racing at the widely acclaimed Downpatrick track.Horse racing first took place at in Downpatrick in  and for almost  years the local track has been constantly improving, boasting great racing, modern facilities, themed race days and a rather unique atmosphere.DownTime summerfest has been organised by a dedicated local team from all sectors of the community whose aim is to get people out and about not just over the four-day festival, but across the summer.Now in its second year, the festival is supported by Newry, Mourne and Down Council and features over  events covering arts, heritage, music, food and, of course, sport.There will be street art, live music, theatre performances, free train rides, a living history Viking encampment at the St Patrick Centre and an artisan market mdash which will be open between am and .pm mdash cradled in the grounds of the Down County Museum.Locals and visitors alike will experience a haven of freshly produced food, bespoke crafts and relaxing surroundings.

Antrimrsquos expected fightback started immediately with the accurate Katie McAleese keeping her side in contention with five consecutive points, including three from play.There was only a point in it as the first half drew to a close, but Down broke free from their shackles and Mallon sent her side into the break with a - to - lead with a well-taken score.Antrim reduced the leeway to a single point at the start of the second half with a score from Bronagh Orchin, but a composed Down side replied with a brace from Mallon as the Mourne girls took a - to - lead after  minutes.McAleese and Paula OrsquoHagan swapped points before Down hit the jackpot when Sara Louise Carr found the back of the Antrim net for Downrsquos second goal and a six point lead with  minutes remaining.Full credit to Antrim, they refused to throw in the towel and three unanswered points from Maeve Kelly and McAleeseleft a puck of the ball between the sides.It was a hammer and tongs finish with both sides feeling the pressure, but it was Downrsquos Niamh Mallon who settled the issue with a converted free and give her side a deserved victory.Down captain Fionnuala Carr was delighted after her sidersquos victory and it marked a successful season on both the club and county front for her after she also lted the All-Ireland Intermediate Club Camogie title with Clonduff in March.ldquoThere are a few of us that played for Down for many years and couldnrsquot win an Ulster senior.

Apart from a host of blister complaints, the bulk of real casualties were a handful of people taken to Downe Hospital suffering from heat exhaustion.One woman suffering from exhaustion had to be taken by an RAF helicopter to the Red Cross mobile treatment room and a man, who was knocked unconscious when a small boulder struck him on the head, was also taken to hospital.Despite minor upsets, the whole day was a big success story. The chief organiser, Mr Paddy McAteer, said he was stunned by the huge turnout.ldquoThe walk was a tremendous success with a record number of starters and a high number of people who completed the trek, he said. ldquoThis walk is undoubtedly getting bigger and bigger and it is amazing to see people from all walks of le coming together.The walkers were supported by a range number of voluntary route marshals.

With winter over, during which time many elderly residents were effectively trapped in their homes after dark, the news may not be much consolation for residents.The committee also heard that their plea for a telephone kiosk at Cuan Beach had been refused and that an alternative site has been found for the Toye Kiosk at the New Line.ANNSBOROUGH mdash The youngsters of Annsborough have at last been able to use their new playing fields where a mix-up in the erection of a fence had kept them out for several months. Grazing cattle which have been using the field have been banished to the sidelines behind a new fence.The problem started when Enterprise Ulster erected only one fence at the new playground and forgot about s second fence to keep out nearby cattle. The mistake led to angry words at Down Council where officials were blamed for not supervising the work and inspecting the completed job.However, Enterprise Ulster workmen responded quickly to a council call and within days had put things right.SHRIGLEY mdash A new factory in Shrigley, which will manufacture plastic products and employ  people, is expected to open within the next few months.The factory is sited in premises vacated by the tannery at Shrigley and the man behind the venture is Mr Garfield Brown, who already owns the Killyleagh Rug Company.It is not exactly clear when the new firm will open, but itrsquos managing director, Mr Lance Walker, says he is optimistic that production will start in August.He said the factory will carry out plastic processing and will provide materials for the packaging industry. ldquoObviously we want to start as soon as possible, but at the moment machinery is being delivered and we are waiting for more to arrive. This makes it impossible to announce when production will start, he added.CROSSGAR mdash Mr Edward Cargo, from Crossgar, retired this week after  years of service to transport and received an inscribed gold watch from his colleagues to mark the occasion.Mr Cargo, who was based at Downpatrick bus station, received his gold watch from the station manager, Mr Ian Cunningham, at a specialheld in the Slaney Inn, Raholp.Mr Cunningham, who made the presentation on behalf of Mr Cargorsquos colleagues at the Downpatrick, Newcastle and Ballynahinch Ulsterbus depots, thanked him for his long and distinguished service in transport, starting with the old Northern Ireland Road Transport Authority and finally Ulsterbus.Mr Jim Prior, on behalf of the engineering department, wished Mr Cargo a long and happy retirement and thanked him for all the help and friendship he gave to all the men in the garage over the years.SAINTFIELD mdash Preparations for the th annual Saintfield and District Agricultural Show have been finalised and the organisers are hoping for good weather to ensure big crowds.Entries for the agricultural, home industry and poultry sections are very high.

He started out on his footballing journey as a fresh-faced teenager in the mid s alongside his brother Denis, the McClurgs and Pattersons at Kilmore United, and was an integral part of the embryo that was to become Kilmore Rec.Originally from Inch, just outside Downpatrick, Cyril followed Denis to Killyleagh YCin  and that was the start of a close link with the club that lasted the best part of  years.He spent a decade at The Showgrounds before moving to Drumaness Mills where he again endeared himself to all at Meadowvale with his goals and whole-hearted play.When he hung up his boots in the mid s he bided his time before taking up the role as manager at Drumaness with his pal Paul Gelston mdash he also had managerial spells at Ballynahinch Unitedand Kilmore Rec.However, in  he ed to The Showgrounds to team up with Dee Heron and together they set about building one of the best team sides to play in the Amateur League.They won everything there was to win with the exception of the Intermediate Cup.They lted the Steel  Sons, Border and Clarence Cup with regularity, as well as six Amateur League Premier Section titles in a row.In addition to his time at Killyleagh, Cyril was Heronrsquos assistant with the Amateur Leaguersquos representative team and also teamed up with Nortelrsquos Ricky Beggs as manager of the Amateur League U- youth team for three years.In more recent years Cyril, although he wasnrsquot attached to any club, still followed the highs and lows of all local outfits and loved nothing better than travelling to watch Northern Ireland.Sincere condolences are expressed to his we Betty, daughters Jenner, Pamela and Heather, and extended family circle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Walking along path of history on the Camino pilgrimage  ","story":"THE faint sound of a church bell ringing in the distance, a cockerel crowing under a leafy olive grove at sunrise or the thunderous crash of an Atlantic wave as it beats off a rocky shoreline in northern Portugal became a welcome replacement to the bustle of Downpatrick last month.For  days, my friend Shona and I ventured the -mile trek of the Camino Portuguese from the beautul and vibrant city of Porto to Santiago de Compostela in neighbouring Galicia, in northern Spain.Time stood still as we listened to the rhythmic crunch of sandy gravel underfoot and breathed in the soft pine-scented woodland pathways that led to an ever increasing number of pilgrims making their way up through the captivating beauty of the Camino da Costa mdash just one of many routes leading to the famous cathedral which is the final resting place of St James the Apostle.Our journey began after a seriously hearty breakfast in one of the many fabulous street-side cafes in Porto on Thursday, May . The traditional merchant city is situated on the lsquoRiver of Goldrsquo. It was here in the th century that Portugal took its name. Much of its fine architecture in the old medieval quarter and a mandatory wine tasting session of the world famous ruby-port wine warrant atrip in itself some day.Hugging the coastline, this first stage meanders along a low lying shoreline of boardwalks and sand dunes to Vila do Conde where we took lodging for the night in a guest house as the townrsquos albergue offered only mattresses in a hallway.Day two saw us slowly begin to adapt to the rigours and demands of the Camino. I secretly longed for the day to be over before it began and was relieved that not just a few of us were wondering the same thing. Yet,  miles later, with a one and a half stone weight packed inside our rucksacks and the unwelcome emergence of a cluster of painful blisters forming, we were singing with joy as we arrived at the popular surfing resort of Esposende in the Braga district later that afternoon.Day three began in much the same way, neither of us forgetting the miracle cure that can be derived from a good nightrsquos sleep. We crossed the Rio Nieve to the first of two  foot peaks leading to Viana do Castelo where the majestic Monte Santa Luzia stands atop of a steep hill overlooking yet another captivating beachside town.Half way between Esposende and Viana do Castelo is Igreja Santiago de Castelo do Neiva, where an altar inion relating to St James and dated  AD was found during the reconstruction of the church. This is the oldest consecration to the apostle to be found outside Spain and has put this relatively recent route firmly on the official routes map for pilgrims.Onwards we hiked to Caminha on day four, where more beach board walks, pebbled pathways and sand dunes morphed into woodland trails, offering welcoming shade from the midday sun. Another steady uphill climb helped us reach here before crossing the Spanish-Portuguese border the next day.Farmers still tend their crops by hand in this part of the world, which harks back to a bygone era, leaving it untouched by modern intensive farming methods and giving us a window on the past.The fth leg of our journey began by being ferried across the border in a row boat which had a small motor installed, leaving behind the harbour town of Caminha for the Spanish town of Garda a few short miles round the bay.Further up the coast we trekked, for -and a-half miles until we reached the quaint seaside hamlet of Oia and its famous Cistercian monastery, Real Monasterio de Oia, which dates back to .By this stage our trek was getting easier as we adapted to the distances we were hiking each day. By way of a measuring stick as to how far wersquod come, we got chatting to a couple from Kent who had made their way to a villa they had rented out for a short break.They had driven from Porto in a hired car up the motorway the day before and it took them  minutes. It had taken us five gruelling, but extraordinarily peaceful days to reach the same point and we laughed at how easy it could have been.Each day we handed over our pilgrim passport to be stamped by church sacristans, post office workers, tourist office clerks, cafe and hostel owners, each of them eager to put their mark on our pilgrim way as we followed another hand-painted yellow arrow or scallop shell, dutully painted and maintained by locals proud to be part of a , year-old Christian pilgrimage, which has exploded in popularity in recent years not only with Christians, but also with the unbeliever, the doubter, the atheist and the sceptic mdash all eager to take on its challenges in a bid to escape the rigours and stress of modern day le.Each day too locals seemed to appear out of the midsts, asby magic, beckoning us with a whistle or a car horn to prompt us to turn aroundwe had mistakenly taken a wrong route mdash for which we were very grateful because each step we took seemed to matter a great deal.On day six the town of Moughas gave way to the mountain village Baiona, from where we walked to Ramallosa, famed for its historic sites and narrow medieval streets.Day seven presented a continuous series of spectacular vistas, each imprinted upon our minds until the day we die, such was their beauty, until we reached the large city of Vigo.Between Ramallosa and Vigo we met with a retired local man out walking his dog along the seashore. Silently he studied the two of us slouched exhausted over a park bench at mid morning. We could almost hear the mechanisms at play within his mind.ldquoWhere are you from  he enquired in a fair attempt at English.ldquoNorthern Ireland, we both replied, knowing that he was going to say something witty.ldquoAh, Paddies, he said, aswaiting our next move in a chess game.Ah, you must be Pedro, we retorted, intending no harm.ldquoWhere are you walking to  he enquired.ldquoSantiago de Compostela in Galacia, we both said.It was a trigger. After telling us quite succinctly what, over the last several decades, he had slowly come to realise le was about and how it should be lived, he asked: ldquoWhy are you doing it Neither of us was prepared for his directness but I showed him my rosary beads nonetheless. ldquoItrsquos a sacrice, I said straight out. He paused before he shook his head and said: ldquoYoursquoll never make it.As he watched us stand up he was only too eager though to hold our rucksacks as we reached into them again after our short but thought provoking rest.After wishing us buen Camino, he asked us to remember him when we reached the tomb of St James.Day eight and the noise and bustle of Vigo soon gave way to  feet and a steady climb of mountainous terrain and shady woodland trekking until we reached the refreshingly rural town of Redondela.Quiet country lanes led to  miles of more pebbled rustic pathways and stony gravel lanes on day nine until we reached the city of Pontevedra. As good fortune would have it, Friday, May , was a public holiday across Galacia and every shop, except cafes and wine bars were closed. We did mange to explore the magnicent Roman town though in the evening, but our bank balance didnrsquot suffer too much.Pontevedra paved the way on day ten with more forest trails and waterfalls. Our first climb of the day was to Caldas de Reis, home of the famous volcanic foot spa where for centuries pilgrims have been dipping their sore and weary feet in water of  degrees.Our penultimate day saw us take on the dizzy heights of Mount Corgullion before reaching the famous city of Padron, where we sampled the world famous padron peppers with dinner in the evening.Padron is  miles south of Santiago and is the starting point of St Jamesrsquos ministry in Spain and to where his remains were brought following his martyrdom in Jerusalem. His remains were later taken to the cathedral in Santiago where they lie in a tomb.We gazed in awe at the great Jacobean treasure and the original stone mooring post of Padron, from which the town gets its name.On the twelfth day a final temptation presented itself in the form of a train station that was situated directly opposite our lodgings that evening. Fellow pilgrims laughed at the idea that a train would take us to Santiago in  pain-free minutes,we werenrsquot up to the final trek and the almost , feet climb.I wasnrsquot laughing. I seriously eyed up the possibility, going as far to check train times. It was a stroke of good luck when I learned there was no other half way stop between Padron and Santiago. After what we had endured over the last  days, not to walk the final few miles would have been an obvious regret.And so we reached Santiago on foot shortly after pm on May , overjoyed and in a state of euphoria. The city of Santiago was worth the hike. Itrsquos as beautul and charming as it is captivating.The camaraderie and craic shared among all us pilgrims who made it from Porto to Santiago that day was incomparable to anything I have encountered before. The memories will stay with me until the day I die..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/farming/ource srcset=/resources/images/4926744.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"line up of calves win over judges at calf fair","story":"Breed judges from throughout the UK and Ireland were unanimous in their praise for the Pedigree Calf Fair and Beef NI Expo, held at the Balmoral Showgrounds in Belfast on SaturdaySpeaking after the one-day show, which featured three show rings and  native and continental beef breeds, event organiser and Chairman, David Connolly said: ldquoItrsquos been another fantastic event, and we certainly exceeded our strap-line lsquoBigger and Betterrsquo.ldquoThe  show has surpassed last yearrsquos inaugural event, attracting hundreds of spectators and more than  trade exhibits.

The PSNI will not make such a decision in isolation.”Asked what advice police could give to motorists faced with long delays for an appointment, the PSNI said: “Keep checking the online booking portal for cancellations. Carry your appointment letter with you.”Charlene out to strike a gender balance in the music industry\"  \"  Reported On This Day : Murdering Irish peer is pardoned by King George II Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mr Cousens said: “If not quickly resolved, lawful drivers could be unfairly penalised for an issue outside of their control.“It’s not just the private motorist at risk either, as delivery vans are being caught up in the backlog.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Glasson cow calved in February and is currently giving  litres of milk per day at .% butterfat and .% protein.“She is a tremendously well-bred animal,” Simon Haffey confirmed.“Our plan is to take embryos from her later in the year.”There was a tremendous turnout of dairy stock, across the board, at this year’s Armagh Show. The same could also be said for the number of visitors coming through the gates of Gosford Forest park, the now traditional venue of the event. Frequent heavy showers failed to dampen the enthusiasm and enjoyment of everyone taking part in what has now become a blue-ribbon event in the Co Armagh calendar. Meanwhile, in the beef cattle rings, the Matchett family, from the Birches in north Co Armagh, were having an equally successful day. Their two-year-old Charolais heer Summervilla Niki won the Beef Inter Breed Championship. She beat off the stf opposition posed by the majestic Limousin bull, shown by the Crawford family from Co Fermanagh.Niki was bred by Co Roscommon breeder Ciaran O’Donnell.“She is confirmed in calf to Allenford Vagabond,” Gail Matchett explained.“He is quite an old bull now but is an extremely easy calving sire. We currently have six pedigree Charolais females in the herd. We plan to grow this number for the future.” This year’s Armagh Show was also marked by the confirmation from the PSNI that rural crime has reduced signicantly across Northern Ireland. Inspector Kieran Quinn, who is based in Armagh city, attended the event. He said: “Rural crime figures have fallen by % over the past number of years.Police have a deflating experience Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“This is a very encouraging figure and reflects the efforts farmers are taking to prevent crimes from taking place in the first place.”He added: “There are  PSNI officers operating in the Banbridge, Armagh, and Craigavon areas. Our primary role is to advise farmers on how to prevent crime taking place in the first instance.

Renewed weakness was evident within services, retail and construction. All three of these sectors signalled a signicant decline in activity in April.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mannnn.jpg","title":"manufacturing is ni bucking the global slowdown","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Global manufacturing and industry stalwarts such as Germany are feeling the slowdown. So, why are Northern Ireland’s makers and engineers bucking the trend  John Mulgrew takes a look at our top performers and what may be skewing the figures If there’s been an industry yet to be tainted by the ill-effects of the run-up to Brexit that I, or other journalists haven’t written about, I’d be very surprised.The latest economic metrics and predictors have been tarred by the three years of uncertainty and political instability. But, according to the latest purchasing managers’ indexfrom Ulster Bank, manufacturing here has seen an uplt – unlike the other sectors.Globally, however, the growth of the manufacturing sector has slowed closer to stagnation, sitting at . in Januaryaccording to the JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI.“At the moment, exports are falling in German manufacturing,” Richard Ramsey, Ulster Bank chief economist said. “Northern Ireland and the UK compare favourably to the German powerhouse, and countries such as France and Italy.”He says that nine out of the  nations which are recorded by PMIs show manufacturing is falling.For Northern Ireland and the UK as a whole, Brexit-related stock-piling is certainly a factor. Let’s say you’re a cross-border business and you could be burdened by World Trade Organizationtarfs on your exports to the Republic in the event of a hard exit. What do you do  You produce more, and warehouse in your export market.Graeme MacLaughlin, relationship director, Barclays in Northern Ireland, said the “underlying state of health of UK manufacturing continues to be obscured by stockpiling, albeit down from the last survey’s record high, as Brexit uncertainty still thwarts investment intentions”.Ulster Business has revealed in this magazine that one major manufacturer, which has its base here, had stockpiled more than £m in food stock for its market in the Republic amid border concerns – and is now left with huge levels of product in a warehouse, with the exit from the EU now not likely until Halloween.“Continuing increases in inventories of both inputs and finished goods have exacerbated the slowdown in growth of new orders and given the loss of momentum in exporting activity, with growing signs that overseas markets are looking to alternative suppliers, the sector needs some degree of clarity on the future relationship with the EU sooner rather than later,” Graeme MacLaughlin said.Looking at what organic factors and positive stories which are fuelling the increase in manufacturing, Richard Ramsey says the success stories and expansion of firms such as CDE Global and Terex could be among those contributing.“They seem to be in expansion mode. But they are firms which are more exposed to the US, which is growing strongly. I would imagine those focused on eurozone are maybe experiencing that fall in demand.”Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, told Ulster Business that “in the past year, our firms have been busy”.“The economic conditions have been right. A purple patch indeed. Admittedly Brexit stockpiling has driven demand for many and as that begins to wash through the system in the coming monthsand with slowing of international and domestic demand, then now is the time to ensure we have the right conditions to ensure that this success is sustained.“By value, our engineering sector remains our most important. The extraordinary growth of the export focused sector in Mid Ulster, South Derry and West Tyrone contributes huge levels or employment and wages but as labour and skills have become more dficult to secure, firms have begun to spread out. CDE’s investment in Monkstown and Terex’s announcement for the North West demonstrate their commitment to creating more jobs here instead of overseas.“There has been much speculation about the demise of our manufacturing over recent years but the sector continues to confound its detractors. Employment levels, despite high profile closures, are back to  levels with exports at record levels and orders at home remaining strong. Our sector is larger and more important than manufacturing in the rest of the UK. Through direct and supported jobs, one in four local families rely on a manufacturing wage with our rural economy and community depending on manufacturers to bring both wealth and work.“Our award-winning food firms feed families at home and abroad with a greater number securing supply contracts with the UKs and Ireland’s largest buyers. Indeed news that Dale Farm had secured a supply contract with Greggs is further evidence that there is more growth possible for this critical sub-sector of manufacturing.“Often overlooked is our strength in building products. From Specialist Joinery and Carella fitting out the best of corporate offices to Smyth Steel and Macrete making the bulk of the new Tottenham Hotspur stadium, regarded as the best in Europe, in factories here before shipping on barges to London.“We’re also leading the move in construction from site build to factory built homes, schools, hospitals and offices at the McAvoy Group and Fasthouse. We have even seen a beautul table made by Terry Design from Portadown in  Downing Street.“Whether it is a critical spring on the Mars rover, or a defibrillator in the Oval office or indeed the fact that one in  people on the planet this year benefiting from a Randox test, products made in Northern Ireland are making a dference and making a huge economic contribution.“It is therefore critical that we cherish and celebrate our great firms who are making great products with great people in every postcode area. We must create the conditions that allow them to be free to make a success of their business and their community.As for the current and future “disruptor”, Richard Ramsey says while Brexit is the largest, the impact of Trump on the global economy, could have an impact on business here. “The thing is, it’s to what extentthere is when there is a trade war. Trump is increasing tarfs on China, then he focuses on the EU – how does the EU retaliate ”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/kpm_1.jpg","title":"ni bosses searching new markets to boost exports","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Around % of Northern Ireland bosses are exploring emerging markets in order grow their exports, according to the latest survey from KPMG. Thats signicantly higher than % of bosses globally. And according to the firm’s latest Global CEO Outlook, Northern Ireland’s bosses are leading the way when it comes to embracing the ‘fast fail’ culture in an effort to make their companies as innovative as possible. Of the Northern Ireland bosses surveyed, % said they want their employees to feel ‘empowered to innovate. On the issue of Brexit, around two thirds of business leaders see the UK’s exit from the EU as the greatest threat to growth. Looking at overall growth, all of those questioned said they expect ‘top line revenue growth over the next three years’. But just % of company bosses said they ‘expect to increase headcount in the next three years of more than %’. John Hansen, partner in charge of KPMG Northern Ireland, said: “Successful CEOs know they need their companies to be as innovative as possible and it’s clear that the right environment is being created in Northern Ireland to do just that. “Our leaders aren’t afraid to give their teams the scope to try new ideas which may have a risk of failure and that opens up a world of potential. This level of freedom will no doubt make sure that Northern Ireland companies are at the cutting edge of innovation in the years to come.” Angela McGowan, CBI director in Northern Ireland, said: “KPMG’s  Global CEO Outlook gives local business leaders some great insights into what is on the radar for chief executives across the globe and raises some important and interesting ideas around what leaders should doing to maintain competitive advantage despite the uncertainty.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glandore_web.jpg","title":"glandore the family flexible workspace on the rise","story":"Posted on Wednesday June  by Ulster Business High-end flexible office company Glandore has expanded rapidly into an all-island family business with further growth on the horizon. Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
