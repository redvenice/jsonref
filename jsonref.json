for Meeks and his family.But he is not the only member of his family to run into trouble with the law, with the shocking extent of their crimes laid bare for the first time.According to the Daily

union","story":"Theresa May’s flagship legislation is vulnerable to attacks in the Lords and from pro-EU Tory MPs (Picture: PA)Theresa May is facing a week of fresh parliamentary battles over Brexit as clashes centred on staying in a customs union with the EU continue to dog the Government.With flagship Brexit legislation vulnerable to further attacks in the Lords, pro-European Tory MPs are set to voice their concerns over withdrawal on Thursday.Though the looming Commons vote on a pro-customs union motion would be a symbolic, non-binding one, it has the potential to deepen Tory wounds on Brexit.Mrs May is set to face calls from leading Brexiteers Boris Johnson, David Davis and Liam Fox to abandon her preferred form of a customs deal with the EU, according to The Times.A showdown is expected to come at a meeting of the Cabinet Brexit committee scheduled for Wednesday when the trio will tell the PM that a so-called customs partnership, where the UK would collect EU import tariffs on behalf of Brussels, would be unworkable, the report said.Downing Street sources insisted there would be no backsliding over quitting the customs union (Picture: PA)Former Cabinet minister John Whittingdale told BBC Radio 4’s The Westminster Hour that defeats like the one the Government suffered last week in the Lords over the customs union played into the EU’s hands.‘Part of the problem is that there are some in the European Union and in the Irish Republic who want to make out that we have to stay in the customs union and will not examine other alternatives.‘And votes like ones in the House of Lords are going to add to the view over there that somehow the British Government might U-turn or go back.‘We need to make it absolutely clear that leaving the customs union is an absolutely fundamental part of Brexit. We then have to find a solution to the Northern Ireland border question.’Labour MP Chuka Umunna and backbench pro-Remain Tory Anna Soubry have tabled amendments to the Trade and Customs Bill, due to be debated on Thursday, that will make staying in the customs union a legal objective of the Government.Mr Umunna said on Twitter: ‘The Brextremists threaten May with a leadership election if she concedes on the customs union but a new Tory leader would face the same Parliamentary arithmetic.’Cabinet minister Sajid Javid tweeted that the referendum gave ‘clear instructions’ to leave the customs union and accused some of seeing it as a ‘kind of post-Brexit comfort blanket’.The Housing and Communities Secretary’s comments were rebuked by the head of the CBI, Paul Drechsler, who tweeted in reply: ‘An MP of your talent should rise above ideology and lead based of fact, analysis and evidence – all of which favours a customs union. Always happy to discuss.’The Lords could deliver new defeats on the Government regarding incorporating the EU charter of fundamental rights into UK law, and pressing to ensure MPs get to decide what happens next if the Commons rejects a final Brexit deal with Brussels."},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sei_7921317.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"world scheduled end today going go","story":"This is what the approach of Nibiru will look like, according to scientists Ron MillerStocktrek ImagesAre millions of people going to look up today and see death planet Nibiru burning in the sky – heralding the end of human life on Earth?Christian numerologist David Meade predicted that the ‘rapture’ – when Jesus Christ comes back to save the faithful and bin the rest of us – would begin today.But even Meade – who has written 14 books about the end of the world, and repeatedly predicted apocalypses which didn’t happen – has now dialled back on his doomsday prediction.But Meade has described reports that the world will end on Monday April 23 as ‘fake news’, according to the Guardian.Meade says that ‘The Rapture’ – when Jesus returns to save the faithful – will in fact begin between May and December.After that, there’ll be seven years of ‘tribulation’ followed by 1,000 years of peace and prosperity – THEN the world will end.He said, ‘So the world isn’t ending anytime soon – in our lifetimes, anyway.’David Meade has a long history of statements about the end of the world – having written 14 books on the subject including ‘Planet X: the 2017 arrival.AAAAAAAAAAARGH Credit: ShutterstockOf course, the whole thing is absolutely ridiculous, and one can only hope that David Meade (the guy behind the idea it’s about to hit our planet) has got his excuses ready for the morning of October 22.Nibiru (or Planet X) was widely predicted to hit our planet in December 2016, and before that in April 2016, and December 2015.Are you seeing a pattern here?Prior to that, it was predicted to smash into our planet to coincide with the Mayan apocalypse in 2012 – and before that, Nancy Lieder, an American website writer who claimed to have an alien implant in her brain, predicted it would destroy the world in 2003.Nibiru does not exist. It has never been seen on any telescope, and no credible scientist has ever confirmed its existence.NASA has thoroughly debunked the Nibiru myth via its Beyond 2012 page, saying, ‘Nibiru and other stories about wayward planets are an Internet hoax. There is no factual basis for these claims.‘If Nibiru or Planet X were real and headed for an encounter with the Earth, astronomers would have been tracking it for at least the past decade, and it would be visible by now to the naked eye.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/17/09/4B3DB82D00000578-0-image-a-16_1523952605110.jpg","title":"Raw Kate Middleton","story":"Look spring fresh in florals like yummy mummy KateBespoke, but shop the current collection at Net-a-PorterThe birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s third child is impending and we\u0026#39re all excitedly awaiting the moment they step out of the Lindo Wing to show off their new arrival once again.We\u0026#39re of course also excited to see what Kate wears when she leaves the hospital.

He is pictured a company after party in Beverly Hills, California on January 8, 2017Harvey Weinstein\u0027s laywers have called on the film studio he used to co-own with his brother to hand over a stash of his work emails, claiming they could help clear his name.In a filing with the US Bankruptcy Court in Delaware, an attorney acting for the disgraced movie mogul said the Weinstein Company has refused to allow him access to e-mails that were relevant to ongoing criminal and civil lawsuits.The 66-year-old was fired by the company after dozens of women including actresses Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek accused him of offences including sexual assault and rape. The film studio filed for bankruptcy in March amid the scandal.Weinstein is the target of federal and state criminal investigations in at least four different jurisdictions, including New York, Los Angeles, and London, which have requested documentation relating to their cases, according to the filing.He is also the subject of at least 11 civil suits, including one brought by British aspiring actress Kadian Noble. Weinstein denies all claims of non-consensual sex. According to his attorney, Scott D. Cousins: \u0027It is critical that Mr. Weinstein be granted access to e-mails relevant to the certain civil proceedings and criminal investigations and that are in the Debtors\u0027 possession, as they were sent or received by his TWC e-mail accounts.  The 66-year-old was fired by the company\u0027s board after dozens of women including actresses Angelina Jolie (left, in London on Feb 18) and Salma Hayek (right, in Beverly Hills on April 14) accused him of sexual offences \u0027The Debtors\u0027 continued refusal to permit Mr. Weinstein to access these emails has significantly impinged his ability to effectively defend himself from these allegations and is a continuing deprivation of his due-process rights.\u0027Weinstein\u0027s lawyers previously filed a suit asking a Delaware state court to force open up access to his work emails on October 8, but that attempt failed.Anthony Bourdain advises Alec Baldwin to \u0027just shut up\u0027...Italian \u0027Harvey Weinstein\u0027 is charged with three counts of...Doors from the Chelsea Hotel sell for $400,000 including the...Share this articleCousins blasted the Weinstein Company\u0027s board, which includes his brother, Bob, saying it was against their interests to deny him access to the emails as doing so exposes them to increased civil liability.\u0027To put it bluntly, TWC, and its counsel, may be knowingly withholding e-mails that may exonerate Mr. Weinstein and, importantly, that would aid in the efficient conclusion of multiple pending criminal investigations and civil litigations, thereby limiting significant potential liability to the Debtors and their estates,\u0027 he argued.          Weinstein is  the subject of at least 11 civil suits, including one brought by British aspiring actress Kadian Noble (pictured in New York on November 28The Weinstein Company itself has been sued by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman over claims it tolerated the \u0027systematic\u0027 sexual abuse of staffCousins said the Weinstein Company had already provided a \u0027handful\u0027 of emails which were already in the hands of investigators.He added that he was confident Weinstein would be able to obtain a \u0027favorable conclusion\u0027 to the cases against him if he is able to view the emails.The Weinstein Company was set up by Harvey Weinstein and his film producer brother Bob in 2005. It filed for bankruptcy after it spent months looking for a buyer or investor.Texas private equity firm Lantern Capital agreed to buy the company out of bankruptcy for $310 million, setting the floor for other bidders in a court-supervised auction scheduled for May 4.While the film studio has produced and distributed critically acclaimed movies as \u0027The King\u0027s Speech\u0027, as well as the televised fashion competition \u0027Project Runway,\u0027 the entertainment industry distanced itself from the studio after the accusations against Harvey Weinstein rocked Hollywood.The women who spoke out against Weinstein spurred a national movement against sexual harassment, with victims sharing their stories on social media and labeling them under the hashtag #MeToo. Dailymail.com has contacted Weinstein\u0027s representative for comment.            The Weinstein Company filed for bankruptcy after it spent months looking for a buyer or investor.

The letter, which has been sent to Cabinet Office minister David Lidington by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, is reported to say that there is a risk legal residents who may not have a passport or driving licence may be disenfranchisedHe said: \u0027Forcing voters at election time to prove their identity at polling stations by producing official documents would have a disproportionate impact on people from black and ethnic minority communities.\u0027It is the same hostile environment all over again, shutting our fellow citizens out of public life, treating communities who made Britain their home as second-class citizens. It\u0027s disgraceful and it must be brought to an end.\u0027Meanwhile, Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said the Windrush problem has come about from a pro-European idea which suggests people need to show their papers.He told the Sunday Telegraph: \u0027We are not the sort of country that demands to see your papers, but I\u0027m afraid pro-Europeans think we should be.\u0027They buy into the EU-style relationship between inidual and state.

I think she is doing the best she can in the public eye\u0027 she told the Sunday Mirror.\u0027I\u0027ve always really looked up to her, like a big sister I never had. She took me shopping for kids books and clothes.\u0027She taught me how important it was to read books. She\u0027s kind, genuine, very thoughtful and warm\u0027 she added.Ms Rasmussen also said she was \u0027embarrassed\u0027 by the way her mother and other relatives had treated Meghan since the news of the engagement broke.   Samantha Grant, who shares a father with half-sister Meghan, said the former Suits actress should have invited several family members \u0027out of respect\u0027.\u0027At issue is not a matter of closeness as more than 1,000 complete strangers are invited,\u0027 she tweeted. \u0027Family is family. I have an uncle I have only seen once by I would never say he is not family because we are not close. Humanitarians move forward with love and kindness especially to family.\u0027  Ms Grant, who uses a wheelchair after being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, later changed her profile picture to a snap of her and Meghan together when they were younger.          Meghan Markle has angered family members by not inviting them to the weddingHowever, according to a Palace source, the list of 600 guests does include several star names, including the celebrity vet who treated Meghan\u0027s dog. And all of Harry\u0027s aunts and uncles – Prince Andrew, Prince Edward and Princess Anne – will be there.Last night Michael, 78, who had a distinguished 19-year US government career, told The Mail on Sunday how he helped Meghan get a job at the American embassy in Argentina in 2001 when she was just 20 – a position she later boasted about in interviews.\u0027I knew the ambassador and I asked him if he could help, as her application was a little on the late side,\u0027 he said. \u0027That\u0027s why I don\u0027t understand why she has been so indifferent towards me. It\u0027s uncalled for. I helped her out and I didn\u0027t ask for anything in return.\u0027I\u0027m upset and surprised about not being selected but if they don\u0027t want me there, then I don\u0027t want to go.\u0027This whole invitation thing has not been played out very well. I never did anything to embarrass Meghan. It seems to me they handled the arrangements poorly.\u0027It was not well thought-out because no Markles I know are going to the wedding, although you\u0027d expect the bride\u0027s father to be there. I\u0027m disappointed, but I hope she has a good wedding.\u0027Michael\u0027s daughter Trish Gallop, 58, added: \u0027People usually invite their families to weddings, whether they are close or not. I would have loved to have given her my best wishes. We as a family are very saddened that we won\u0027t be there to witness her beautiful celebration.\u0027The comments came amid growing disquiet about the wedding plans and who is \u0027in\u0027 and \u0027out\u0027.Palestinian rocket scientist is assassinated by \u0027Mossad\u0027...\u0027She was beautiful till the day she died\u0027: Jeb Bush\u0027s...Share this articleAmong those The Mail on Sunday understands are attending are TV \u0027supervet\u0027 Noel Fitzpatrick, former England football captain David Beckham and his wife Victoria, and tennis legend Serena Williams.Victoria Beckham declined to confirm if she and her husband were going, while Prof Fitzpatrick, who treated Meghan\u0027s beloved beagle Guy when he broke his legs, said: \u0027No comment.\u0027 However, Palace insiders say he is on the list.The main cast members of Suits, the legal drama that propelled Meghan to fame, have been invited, a source close to the show said, adding: \u0027They are thrilled.

I thought, “Maybe I’ve got it all wrong and I should go for it. Maybe I should do what most of the world do. It works for them”. Now I’m going to stick to my previous view.

The pair were in a relationship for five years before splitting in 2007. Martinez, who was married to James Bond actress Halle Berry between 2013 and 2016, had helped Miss Minogue through her battle with breast cancer.Perhaps her most public romance was with Jason Donovan, whom she dated for three years after meeting on the set of Neighbours.

Scorching sun gives way to rain this week...Corbyn calls for St George\u0027s Day OFF! Labour leader will...Share this articleIt is claimed the Guernsey system could cut the amount of household waste sent for landfill or incineration by 20per cent.The Guernsey system will involve families buying stickers that are put on to black bags to certify they should be cleared by the binmen - much like putting a stamp on a letter.          The Taxpayers Alliance have argued that the scheme will encourage fly-tippersThe fee will be £2.50 per black bag of rubbish plus an annual fixed charge of £85 per household.Introducing ‘pay as you throw’ (PAYT) has been attacked by the Taxpayers’ Alliance and Big Brother Watch. They argue it would increase fly tipping, as people try to avoid charges, and allow local councils to spy on families’ bin habits.A new survey found that three in four people are ‘concerned’ or ‘very concerned’ that adopting a PAYT system would lead to a rise in fly-tipping and so-called bin dumping, with people trying to save money by putting their rubbish in someone else’s bin.People were also worried about the charges and six in ten of those against PAYT were concerned it would not be affordable for people on low incomes.The survey of 1,000 UK householders was undertaken for waste management and environmental communications consultancy Pelican Communications.          The scheme which will begin in Guernsey is seen as setting a template which could be adopted by BritainIt found that, despite the potential problems, one in three UK households were open to the idea of PAYT - rising to two in three when the details about how it would improve recycling were explained.Pelican’s managing director, Michael Bennett, said: ‘Unsurprisingly 86per cent of respondents hadn’t heard of PAYT, but once the system was explained to them 34per cent indicated they were in favour, with a further 37per cent saying that they might be in favour.’ When asked to consider which potential benefits of PAYT appealed to them, 79per cent said that the possibility it would encourage more recycling was the key factor, as well as being seen by 60per cent as a significant incentive to reduce waste production.Some 40per cent said that it would be fairer on small households, which produce less rubbish than families, particularly those with young children.Sixty per cent said they would be more supportive of PAYT if it was guaranteed to tackle increasing waste production and product consumption. This went up to 65per cent being more supportive if PAYT schemes were guaranteed to increase recycling and have a beneficial environmental impact.Mr Bennett said: ‘This research highlights the importance of winning the hearts and minds of residents for councils considering introducing PAYT.‘Councils need to ensure they make a convincing environmental case for the system, that they are able to demonstrate that such schemes deliver positive environmental results, and that they can be managed fairly and effectively.‘In addition, they need to be very sensitive to the concerns of the third of respondents who are worried about increased costs and the adverse effects on lower income households and ensure the system is equitable.’ He added: ‘PAYT has the potential to give household recycling in many local authority areas a much-needed shot in the arm.‘However, there are significant educational, legal and political challenges that will have to be overcome and only a very committed council would embark on its introduction at this time, without funding and political leadership from a city region, devolved administration or national government.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/23/03/4B70992500000578-0-image-m-52_1524449681320.jpg","title":"Hoda Kotb sips wine boat Florence host Kathie Lee Gifford","story":"    The Today Show\u0027s Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford (left) were spotted sipping wine on a boat in Florence after preparing for NBC\u0027s coverage of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle \u0027s wedding          Kotb also posted this photo of her with Gifford and their crew.

And all of Harry\u0027s aunts and uncles – Prince Andrew, Prince Edward and Princess Anne – will be there.Last night Michael, 78, who had a distinguished 19-year US government career, told The Mail on Sunday how he helped Meghan get a job at the American embassy in Argentina in 2001 when she was just 20 – a position she later boasted about in interviews.\u0027I knew the ambassador and I asked him if he could help, as her application was a little on the late side,\u0027 he said. \u0027That\u0027s why I don\u0027t understand why she has been so indifferent towards me. It\u0027s uncalled for. I helped her out and I didn\u0027t ask for anything in return.\u0027I\u0027m upset and surprised about not being selected but if they don\u0027t want me there, then I don\u0027t want to go.\u0027This whole invitation thing has not been played out very well. I never did anything to embarrass Meghan. It seems to me they handled the arrangements poorly.\u0027It was not well thought-out because no Markles I know are going to the wedding, although you\u0027d expect the bride\u0027s father to be there. I\u0027m disappointed, but I hope she has a good wedding.\u0027Michael\u0027s daughter Trish Gallop, 58, added: \u0027People usually invite their families to weddings, whether they are close or not. I would have loved to have given her my best wishes. We as a family are very saddened that we won\u0027t be there to witness her beautiful celebration.\u0027The comments came amid growing disquiet about the wedding plans and who is \u0027in\u0027 and \u0027out\u0027.Palestinian rocket scientist is assassinated by \u0027Mossad\u0027...\u0027She was beautiful till the day she died\u0027: Jeb Bush\u0027s...Share this articleAmong those The Mail on Sunday understands are attending are TV \u0027supervet\u0027 Noel Fitzpatrick, former England football captain David Beckham and his wife Victoria, and tennis legend Serena Williams.Victoria Beckham declined to confirm if she and her husband were going, while Prof Fitzpatrick, who treated Meghan\u0027s beloved beagle Guy when he broke his legs, said: \u0027No comment.\u0027 However, Palace insiders say he is on the list.The main cast members of Suits, the legal drama that propelled Meghan to fame, have been invited, a source close to the show said, adding: \u0027They are thrilled.

She was struggling with depression and I was walking on eggshells, trying to balance her ill health with my working lifeThe key word for me is \u0027love\u0027. I\u0027m a romantic. I want to give and receive true, heartfelt passion. But when I first fell in love, aged 18, I was struggling with a difficult home life: my mum, Sheree, was in a low phase and the fear that she would take her own life always haunted me.This was the early Seventies, and I\u0027d just started working as a pub DJ. People were into drinking and having fun, and when one thing led to another that frequently meant sex.I was doing what came naturally, shall we say, and discovered that I\u0027d fallen in love with two people at the same time — one called Caroline, and one named John.My big concern was that Mum might take it badly. I so wanted to open my heart to her. But she was struggling with depression and I was walking on eggshells, trying to balance her ill health with my working life.Dale Winton ‘died of a broken heart after being dumped by US...The Bond Girl mum who gave me my love of the limelight: DALE...Share this articleReally, she should have guessed long ago, what with my Dusty Springfield obsession. Boys at my school would be into the Stones or the Monkees, but all I cared about was Dusty.Put it this way, my favourite of all my mother\u0027s boyfriends, after she orced my dad, was a man called Aubrey who listened to Dusty singing Son Of A Preacher Man with me, and pronounced it \u0027a very strong song\u0027. That won my approval!The extraordinary thing is that, though I have met so many stars in my career, I only ever spoke once to Dusty. And that was by phone when I was a presenter at Radio Trent in Nottingham. I did see her once at a book signing, but I was too shy to go and say hello.Shortly after she died in 1999, I went to an exhibition of her memorabilia and a woman approached me to introduce herself as \u0027Barbara — Dusty\u0027s secretary\u0027. She told me a story that broke my heart.          My big concern was that Mum might take it badly. I so wanted to open my heart to her. Really, she should have guessed long ago, what with my Dusty Springfield obsessionA couple of years earlier, when Dusty was being driven around Soho by her chauffeur, she spotted me on the pavement and cried out: \u0027Oh look — there\u0027s Dale!\u0027At first, I was astonished at the very idea, then I realised I had mentioned her in just about every interview I had ever done. She probably knew what a huge fan I was.And here\u0027s the saddest part: her driver suggested stopping so she could get out to meet me and she said: \u0027No, I\u0027m too shy.\u0027 Isn\u0027t that awful? I was suddenly overcome with emotion at the thought, and collapsed on a chair, knocked off my feet by an incredible wave of grief.I was luckier with another musical heroine, the wonderful Cilla Black. We\u0027d been friends for years and she was a great fan of Supermarket Sweep — so much so that she invited me to come to push a shopping trolley on a Christmas edition of her top-rated show, Surprise Surprise.I wanted to repay the compliment, and when I was asked to stand in for Lorraine Kelly for a week on GMTV, Cilla was top of my guest wishlist. She couldn\u0027t make it because she and her husband Bobby were at their villa in Marbella. But when I told them I was due in Marbella for a TV shoot, they insisted I visit them.Sitting on their patio, chatting to Bobby while Cilla rustled up the most fantastic lunch, I couldn\u0027t have felt more at home. From that moment, we all became firm friends.After Bobby died in 1999, it would have been easy for her to fall to pieces but, heartbroken though she was, she said: \u0027I may have lost the love of my life, but I haven\u0027t lost my love of life.\u0027 That\u0027s so Cilla.Another of the grandes dames of showbusiness whose company I adore is Barbara Windsor. At her 60th birthday party I had a great time meeting almost the entire cast of EastEnders, before finding myself the centre of attention with some quite different East End characters.          Dale Winton is pictured leaving Scotts restaurant in London on July 26, 2016Tony Lambrianou, an infamous Sixties gangster who had served time for his part in a notorious murder, grabbed me and said in the gruffest of voices: \u0027Hello Dale, I\u0027m taking you to meet the guv\u0027nor.\u0027This was Freddie Foreman, a former associate of the Kray twins and the self-proclaimed \u0027godfather of British crime\u0027. \u0027Don\u0027t forget, Dale,\u0027 Mr Lambrianou growled, \u0027he\u0027s the guv\u0027nor. Show respect!\u0027I wasn\u0027t at all sure what to expect — but I have to speak as I find, and say the two of them could not have been more charming to me. Dusty, Cilla, Bar . . . I suppose I\u0027ve always been drawn to strong women, and that\u0027s my mother\u0027s legacy.My father was much less influential in my life, though I can\u0027t deny his death had an effect.He had always made it clear he felt little responsibility for me. When I was ten and my parents were orcing, he told me: \u0027Your mother will always look after you, Dale, so I\u0027m going to spend all my own money. I\u0027m leaving you nothing.\u0027He was true to his spiteful word — his will amounted to £284.Aged 13 and coming up to my bar mitzvah, the Jewish ceremony that marks a boy\u0027s transition to manhood, I was taken to Westminster Hospital to visit him.Though my mother had warned me he was not expected to live more than another day or two, she tried to keep his spirits up.\u0027You\u0027ll be fine,\u0027 she said to him, \u0027you\u0027re going to get better. You can come and recuperate at the house. We\u0027ll nurse you back to health.\u0027By now, Mum was living with another man (Aubrey, who shared my admiration for Dusty), but her kind words perked up Dad\u0027s morale. He began to make a miraculous recovery.          This was a time when gays were taken for all kinds of treatments, including electric shock aversion therapy, and it was pretty clear from Mum\u0027s words that if I was \u0027that way inclined\u0027, I could be straightened outMum was in a state of panic. \u0027My God, what are we going to do?\u0027 she exclaimed. \u0027I\u0027ve given him a reason to live and he\u0027s getting better by the minute. I\u0027ve made a promise to this man and he could be living with us within a week.\u0027More than that, he was planning to come to my bar mitzvah.I hadn\u0027t attended synagogue on a regular basis, and I was learning the Hebrew words of the ceremony phonetically, memorising the sounds without understanding their precise meaning. Dad would expect me to be word perfect. The big day was two weeks away, and it was all turning into a black farce.Then Dad had a relapse. Plans changed: he wasn\u0027t coming to the synagogue at all. Instead, I would do my bar mitzvah before the rabbi, with all my relatives watching, then take my tallis, capel and book to the hospital and read it to Dad.As I performed the ritual, speaking everything I had been taught, the congregation was in tears.It wasn\u0027t until afterwards that Mum took me to one side, kissed me, congratulated me and then put an arm around my shoulders. \u0027Dale,\u0027 she said, \u0027your father died this morning.\u0027She had to speak to the rabbi about Dad\u0027s funeral, and to deal with all the relatives. Aubrey the boyfriend took me to sit in his car.I asked him for a cigarette, and though I was only 13, he understood that I\u0027d been through enough. He let me sit in the passenger seat, blowing the smoke out of the window.I don\u0027t know what became of Aubrey. After a while, he just wasn\u0027t around any more. Maybe if he had still been there when I reached 18, I could have talked to Mum more easily about my love life. Because she really didn\u0027t want to know.I remember inviting her to look at a second-hand car at a garage on the Edgware Road. This was about 1972, the era of flared trousers and corduroy caps, and guys didn\u0027t have to be gay to carry a shoulder-bag.          I preferred to be ambiguous about my sexuality, but I\u0027m wise enough to realise that if you appear on the telly, there are certain things people think they have the right to knowFeeling very much the dedicated follower of fashion, I flounced into the garage with a bag swinging against my hip.I must have looked like a pastiche of Seventies camp, and Mum burst out laughing. \u0027Dale, if you could just see yourself,\u0027 she said. \u0027You\u0027re such a character. I wouldn\u0027t have you any other way.\u0027That wasn\u0027t really true. Soon after, I fell in love with John who was unmistakeably gay, and in the way of Seventies teens we used to natter for hours on the phone.One day, while we were chatting, Mum burst out of her bedroom in a rage. \u0027Are you talking to John again? You know he\u0027s gay, don\u0027t you? And if that doesn\u0027t bother you and you\u0027re hanging around with him, that probably means . . . you\u0027re going to be gay yourself!\u0027This tirade came out of the blue, and it got worse. \u0027I\u0027ve worked with gay people in the theatre and the movies,\u0027 Mum told me. \u0027They\u0027re great fun, but being gay makes for a very lonely old age.\u0027You don\u0027t have to be gay, Dale. There is an alternative. We can get help. This doesn\u0027t have to be the way for you.\u0027Shocked, I walked out . . . though I came back a week later.I\u0027ve never blamed Mum. It was the way most parents thought then. She wanted what she thought was best for me: marriage, a family — and grandchildren for herself.This was a time when gays were taken for all kinds of treatments, including electric shock aversion therapy, and it was pretty clear from Mum\u0027s words that if I was \u0027that way inclined\u0027, I could be straightened out. Perhaps that\u0027s part of the reason why, when journalists asked if I was \u0027one of those\u0027, I preferred to say nothing.I never forgot that afternoon. I was stunned and filled with guilt at having caused Mum such terrible distress when she was already depressed. I loved my mother with all my heart and I didn\u0027t want to disappoint or offend her. But I knew I could never be the person she wanted me to be.Until the day she died, I was never able to tell her: \u0027Mum, I\u0027m gay — and I honestly think that\u0027s OK.\u0027Adapted from My Story by Dale Winton (Arrow Books, £9.99).

He said he had not seen it before. But after having a series of visa applications rejected for ‘baseless’ reasons, she was issued with an automatic ten-year ban stopping her from making any further applications.The 2015 ban means she will be 91 before she can even apply to visit England again.‘It is heartbreaking,’ she said. ‘I feel very lonely without being able to see my family and I find myself crying at night. I feel very alone at times like Christmas and when I miss their birthdays and parties.‘I haven’t even been able to meet three of my great-grandchildren. I’ve never even seen them,’ she said.‘I worry as I am getting old that I might not ever be able to return again. It makes me very angry. I worked there all my life and I just want to visit now, I do not want to live there. My whole family is there and I just want to visit once a year and on special occasions.’Mrs Williams arrived in England to join her husband, a cabinet maker, in 1962 – both were Commonwealth citizens – before the couple settled in Bradford.She worked in a textile mill before becoming a nurse caring for mentally ill children in two local hospitals.‘I spent 27 years in the NHS doing night shifts – sometimes caring for as many as 100 patients a night and that’s not easy,’ she said. ‘I loved being able to help the patients because they could not help themselves. I poured my heart and soul into that job but it did mean I missed out in a way on the childhoods of my own children. And now I am not even able to enjoy my family in my retirement.’Her children in the UK have spent thousands of pounds in legal fees battling her case and Mrs Williams is determined to return to England.‘I will come back, I will not give up and I will keep on fighting because I worked there and raised my children there and did my bit,’ she said.Mrs Williams has lived alone in Jamaica since her husband died in 2004.As the Windrush scandal escalated last week, the Home Office said it would urgently review Mrs Williams’s case. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46969f6f0400caaabf4f2684c6b50914ac8dae8d/0_829_6884_4132/master/6884.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51f5c0aef75a10215fd018d8682757ca","title":"soviet film posters of the 50s and 60s in pictures","story":"After the break-up of the USSR in 1991, many artefacts associated with Soviet life – from posters to gadgets – were discarded, destined to be forgotten.

That’s what everyone – including members of the government – have been asking since the rumbling story erupted a week ago, after six months of cases appearing in the press. Trying to work it out herself, Amelia Gentleman, the  reporter who uncovered the scandal over six months, wrote rather modestly: “Obviously the prime minister is busy and maybe doesn’t read the  much.” But Theresa May employs people to keep her abreast of brewing rows, and no one thought to mention it.Stranger still, when you consider that this scandal has been years, not just months, in the making, as the “hostile environment” policy on immigration was formulated under the coalition. I understand that, at the time, it was the subject of a standup row in the cabinet room between May when she was home secretary and the then education secretary, Nicky Morgan. Morgan had, along with the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, raised concerns that May’s new policy for illegal immigrants would turn teachers and health workers into immigration officials. Morgan went further and also questioned the very principle behind the “hostile environment”. No wonder she lost her job as soon as May took over as prime minister.May had also been asking ministers from other departments to insert the phrase “hostile environment” into speeches and documents, which didn’t go down well. But while some Conservatives objected to the catchy name, few noticed that the design of the policy itself was flawed. It required people to produce documents that the Home Office itself knew no longer existed, or which it was highly unlikely that anyone, whether living here illegally or legally, would have kept for several decades.This wasn’t just May’s mess. David Cameron was the one who had made and then stuck to the Tory promise to drive net migration down into the tens of thousands. He then took over the cabinet committee charged with creating this hostile environment after his 2015 election win.Ministers from the time say they noticed Cameron growing rather awkward when dragged into standoffs between the Home Office and other departments over the target. “May would say to him, ‘Well, you’ve given me this target to meet so why are all these ministers getting in the way’,” says one cabinet minister. “That’s what she’s like, what she’s always been like, if you give her something to do, she’ll keep at it even when it seems impossible.”This dogged determination once won May plaudits as a “bloody difficult woman” who focused on getting things done, rather than playing political games. But it can also lead to the sort of stubbornness that prevents pragmatism: many Tories would dearly love for their party to ditch the net migration target, as it serves largely as a quarterly reminder that the government is still failing to meet it. Unfortunately, one of the very few who would die in a ditch for the target is May.Amber Rudd, her successor, is known to be more liberal on immigration in private. But she has stuck to May’s imprint for the Home Office, something her allies now feel is a mistake. “Successful home secretaries, like them or loathe them, set their own agenda,” says one. Some have suggested Rudd should have emulated Jeremy Hunt in pushing ahead with a personal programme of reform, though it’s difficult to see how this would have worked in practice, given May is still very interested in the Home Office and generally happy for Hunt to do as he pleases as health and social care secretary.These leadership tensions are one of the reasons Conservatives on both sides of the party think the Windrush issue suddenly blew up in the way it did: everyone saw it as an opportunity to further their own causes. Privately, many senior Tories aren’t too worried about the implications of the row itself, beyond the usual gripes about No 10 being “flat-footed” in not realising there was a problem, and refusing to discuss the matter with those who tried to raise it. They think this is eminently solvable, and it will cause no long-term damage to the Conservatives – so long as the Home Office ensures the flaws in the hostile environment policy are ironed out quickly.This, though, suggests few Tories have yet grasped how big the flaws are with the hostile environment approach, despite the many years in which it has now\u0026nbspbeen active. It has caused problems that go far beyond the Windrush generation. If the Tories really think they can move on after merely addressing Windrush, then they’re at risk of failing to see the next big row coming, too.• Isabel Hardman is a political journalist and assistant editor of the Spectator"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13de7366df29fd43ffa985d8fad75870a4fa1fe7/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=491511f7e0d812d2a1bc0ea260440722","title":"propaganda brexit fish eu britain fishing rights","story":"British skippers weren’t denied fair quotas by the EU, Britain let them sell their fishing rights to foreign boatsStanding on the shingle of Hastings beach beside his fishing boat, Paul Joy says his family have fished these waters since before the time of William the Conqueror. He’s done the research, and the Joys have had boats here since records began. His boat had been out at dawn that morning, hugging the coastline with a skipper, two crew and the “boy” ashore, aged 80, who winches the Kaya up the pebbles with a rusty bulldozer. “My father, Will, born in 1906, made an adequate living with a smaller boat than mine. Now everyone subsidises fishing with other work. I earned the same as a carpenter, now you’re lucky to get a Tesco shelf-stacker’s pay.” Fishing quotas are killing the small fishermen, he says.Stand here to breathe in the heart of Brexit. Last week, in ports around the country, fishing boats protested – sending up flares to oppose the transition deal that leaves them in the common fisheries policy (CFP), but\u0026nbspwithout a seat at the EU table sharing out the fish. Protest organisers said: “We are sickened by remainers gleefully peddling the deliberate narrative that fishing doesn’t matter.”Here the referendum was lost, in the romance of the sea, the rugged cliffs and coasts of our island story among old salt spirits of a seafaring nation. This is the symbolism the remainers fatally forgot, tone deaf to the draw of John Masefield’s poem Sea Fever or Millais’s The Boyhood of Raleigh. Economics says fishing is of nugatory value, but politics says fishing is deep-dyed in national identity, down to the last fish and chip shop. That heart-versus-head error is why remain lost – and why its campaigners still fail to connect with unreasoning national sentiments. They forget those sentiments can be cashable too: Hastings’ 27 picturesque boats, huts and fish stalls bring the impoverished town £5m a year in tourism.Joy heads the small-fishers’ organisation, Nutfa. He is a sharp campaigner, steeped in the fiendishly conflicting complexities of international fishing policy. If “take back control” meant anything, it was Britannia ruling her own waves. But that’s not going to happen, because it can’t.Michael Gove, the secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs, casually promised instant freedom from the fisheries policy, but backed down embarrassingly when our know-nothing negotiators were taken by surprise (again) to find other EU fishing nations just as adamant: those with their own fierce fishing traditions feel just as passionately. Who knew?There always were and always will be fishing treaties between countries, now more than ever to preserve precarious stocks. Unless navies are to go to war to defend their fishing fleets, there must always be agreements. Fishing treaties existed before Britain joined the EU. Quotas fixed long ago often don’t seem fair now, nor do they preserve stocks well enough. But the EU is only one element: ask Grimsby fishers about friction between English and Scottish rights, as global warming sends cod migrating north. Fish don’t obey treaties.Gove has the power to do it, says Thomas Appleby, associate law professor at the University of the West of England, a fisheries law specialist. Britain could and should have banned the sale of its quotas, but Gove could repair some of the damage: so long as UK quota is taken back proportionally from all, shares could be redistributed to the small boats. Why doesn’t he do it? Joy points to the power of the big companies: two-thirds of UK quotas are taken by three multinationals. And he talks of business influence over the Conservatives. Here’s an irony: the EU fisheries fund has given Joy’s small boats lobby a grant to set up its own producer organisation as a political counterweight to fight the big\u0026nbspboats.At sea, the Brexiteers are coming face to face with hard truths: we are not alone. No man is an island entire of itself every man is a piece of the continent. We trade, we exchange, we buy and sell. Fish was a bad emblem for the hard Brexiteers to choose because it’s an archetypal example of the need for cooperation – in fishing, conservation and sales. Trade-offs, haggling, deals and environmental necessity demand treaties between us and our neighbours, in or out of the EU. Except that outside it, our negotiators have a weak hand. The romance of the sea was good referendum propaganda now it stands as the best example of why standing alone is impossible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20bbce36f2c59a29f75124807c3f0da078d5d34f/0_0_3035_1819/master/3035.jpg?w=645\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d373e0baca944eba9f3575eaf33fe98 645w","title":"cambridge university urged again to end fossil fuel investments","story":"Hundreds of academics, authors and scientists sign open letter as isive issues comes to headHundreds of academics, scientists and authors have signed an open letter calling on Cambridge University to stop investing in fossil fuel companies, marking an escalation in an increasing bitter estment campaign at the institution.The move, by signatories including Sir David King, until recently the UK’s permanent special representative for climate change, Thomas Blundell, the former president of the UK Science Council and the author Robert Macfarlane, comes as the university council is set to consider the issue at a meeting on Monday.In a sign of growing tensions, students occupied and shut down the university finance building last week and said there could be “no more business as usual whilst the university remains complicit in the destruction of the planet and vulnerable populations across the globe”. Macfarlane, a Cambridge academic and author of books including Mountains of the Mind and The Wild Places, said the letter underlined the growing concern about the university’s attitude to fossil fuel investments.“If it fails to est, Cambridge will be on the side of dirty money over a sustainable future,” he said. “Evidence is everywhere now of companies, countries and institutions taking stands against fossil fuel investment. Why is Cambridge not following the lead of Stanford and Edinburgh universities, and of the whole of New York City?”Dr Drew Milne, a fellow in the Cambridge’s English department, said it was inconceivable that a university could continue to profit from fossil fuel extraction without damaging its core values.“The scientific consensus around climate change is clear and overwhelming. The university must now put their money where their science is and est from fossil fuel investment as soon as possible,” he said.The university has received money from several oil companies including BP, ExxonMobile and Shell, and campaigners estimate that it has £377m invested in fossil fuel firms both directly and indirectly. A spokesman said on Sunday that he was unable to answers questions about the estment dispute, but confirmed in a statement that the university council would consider the matter on Monday.The estment campaign has received the support of the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams and the Cambridge MP Daniel Zeichner.Zeichner said that as a world leading institution in science and innovation, Cambridge University was “perfectly placed to be turning its back on the fossil fuels that are damaging our environment and taking a lead on promoting a low, and eventually zero, carbon economy”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d38900dfe910f570da198113a35ce010daef79c/196_609_5224_3135/master/5224.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa53471aaba377306e2782727970b919","title":"labour bid to block regulatory powers for office for students","story":"Party plans Commons tactic to thwart a key plank of the government’s higher education policy Labour is launching a last-ditch bid to stop MPs rubber-stamping the transfer of higher education regulatory powers to the controversial Office for Students.The new universities watchdog was at the centre of a row earlier this year when the rightwing commentator Toby Young stepped down from its board following anger over offensive tweets he had posted.Labour will use a procedural device in the Commons on Monday night to force one final debate and vote on the Office for Students (OfS), which is an important part of the government’s market-oriented higher education policy. If the government were to lose the vote, the watchdog would no longer have key powers enabling it regulate universities.Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, accused the government of ignoring concerns from students about the cost of living and rising debt because ministers were preoccupied with creating an institution that they could dominate.“Ministers have sought to turn the so-called independent regulator into their puppet, pursuing their obsession with free markets and political pet projects instead of the sector’s best interests.”The OfS combines the responsibilities of the former Office for Fair Access (Offa) and the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce). In the redesigned higher education world it will be at the heart of the market-oriented higher education system.Set up by the Higher Education and Research Act, it combines the roles of regulator with access to government funding. It has a mission to encourage a competitive market and it is permitted to intervene where it believes there is market failure, or to protect the interests of its “consumers” – students, government and wider society.Rayner, who will lead the debate against a technical piece of secondary legislation that is necessary to incorporate the powers of Offa and Hefce, is challenging the way the board has been set up and appointments to it.The OfS has been mired in controversy from its inception. On New Year’s Eve, the universities minister, Jo Johnson, announced the appointment of Young, an enthusiastic backer of the government’s free schools policy, as one of its non-executive board members. Young resigned just over a week later, after several controversial past tweets of his emerged. The chair of the education select committee, the Tory MP Robert Halfon, called them “incredibly dark and dangerous” remarks about people with disabilities, working-class students and “progressive eugenics”. Rayner said: “There are still serious unanswered questions about the shambolic process of appointment to the board ... The choice of student representative was blatantly politicised while university staff and the entire further education sector have been left unrepresented entirely,” Many critics say the OfS is too powerful, and too close to government and to the universities themselves. The National Union of Students is not represented on the OfS, and nor is there any collective representation of further education colleges. The OfS will control universities’ funding through a series of hurdles that need to be passed in order to access the highest levels of government support.Last December, the National Audit Office published a highly critical report of the government’s whole approach to higher education and in particular student fees. It said English universities would risk charges of misselling if they were regulated like financial institutions and found that many courses were not good value for money."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac51482e7a22171ce8b799bd7eb13c19d3b61b41/0_337_5236_3142/master/5236.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3a7b996976f6b80b9cc32eaf75a7f15","title":"university costs working class students more says nus report","story":"‘Poverty premium’ in higher education leads to poorer people feeling isolated, says unionWorking-class students are penalised by a “poverty premium”, often paying higher costs to continue studying in a university environment in which they may feel isolated and as though they do not belong, according to a report.Research for the National Union of Students finds that student expenditure routinely outstrips income from loans, leaving many whose parents cannot afford to subsidise them without the means to pay for basics such as food and heating.Fees for halls are often unaffordable for those struggling on maintenance loans, with many universities setting rents above inflation to generate additional income, the study claims. It quotes the results of a freedom of information request by the University of East Anglia students’ union, which found that more than 20 higher education institutions generated more than £1,000 profit per bed space a year.One student said they had to find an additional £700 on top of their maintenance loan to pay for their accommodation alone. “This pricing policy risks segregating working-class students in lower-cost accommodation from others who have access to additional funds from their families,” the report says.Working-class students – who are most likely to be employed in a job that requires more than the recommended 15 hours a week of work while studying – also struggled to afford to participate in social events with their wealthier peers, leaving them feeling ostracised. One student said they were expected to pay £200 to join a junior common room for their halls of residence to be included in social activities.An annual survey by the University of Bristol students’ union found just over a third of respondents had witnessed bullying, harassment or discrimination based on a person’s economic or class background.The NUS report, Class Dismissed: Getting in and Getting on in Further and Higher Education, goes on to point out that dropout rates from university are highest among working-class students, who are more likely to be debt averse than their wealthier peers, yet can end up paying more.Fees for access courses mean many working-class students pay an additional year of fees to gain qualifications and they can struggle to find a guarantor to rent in the private sector, leading them to use private schemes with higher fees and interest rates.Addressing student poverty and creating equal access to education has been Shakira Martin’s central mission as NUS president. A black, working-class single mother, she explains in a powerful introduction to the report how education has played a transformative role in her life.“I left high school with one GCSE, left home at 16 – living on just £44.50 per week – and became the young mother of two beautiful girls. If you were to tell any of my teachers at secondary school this would be where I am, where I have worked to be, they would have never believed you. But here I am. Against all odds. Further education transformed my life and gave me the second chance I needed. “My hope, and my vision for the UK is that we will arrive at a day where my story is not against all odds. That no working-class person’s story is against all odds. We will no longer be the exceptions to the rule when it comes to success and fulfilment in education. We will be the rule.”The report calls for the introduction of a minimum living income for students in further and higher education it also recommends the restoration of maintenance grants, the education maintenance allowance and NHS bursaries for healthcare students."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46b00b3542b588b66865fdda85e8cc54597844a0/0_20_5087_3052/master/5087.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=171c24c6eba9ec2c96831878b26d2700","title":"michael bloomberg paris climate pact","story":"The former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg has said he will write a $4.5m cheque to cover this year’s US commitment to the Paris climate agreement.Donald Trump last year pulled the US out of the deal, which was signed by Barack Obama, making the US the only country opposed. Even Syria, torn by a seven-year civil war, has signed the pact.Bloomberg, whose net worth Forbes pegs at about $50bn, was speaking on Earth Day, to CBS’s Face the Nation. He did not commit to provide funds beyond 2018 and said he hoped that by next year Trump would have changed his mind.“America made a commitment and as an American, if the government’s not going to do it, we all have responsibility,” he said. “I’m able to do it. So, yes, I’m going to send them a cheque for the monies that America had promised to the organization as though they got it from the federal government.”Trump, he said, should be able to “listen to others and change his mind. A person that doesn’t change their mind isn’t very smart … And he’s been known to change his mind. “He should change his mind and say look there really is a problem here. America is part of the problem. America is a big part of the solution and we should go in and help the world stop a potential disaster.”Asked if he thought the non-binding nature of the Paris deal was a problem, in terms of other countries not sticking to its aims for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the effect of climate change, Bloomberg said: “Look, it’s dangerous to keep doing what we’re doing. “If everybody would do the right thing, yes, it would be better. But if some people or some countries do the right thing we all benefit from that.“All I know is that America, I believe, will meet its commitment by 2025 to reduce greenhouse gases by an agreed amount, and if we do it hopefully other countries will do it as well.”Asked if he was “filling a leadership gap”, the media baron – who was a Republican mayor and considered a 2016 presidential run as an independent – said: “Well, I think that this is what the American public when you poll them say they want to do.” The odds on him running for the White House in future, he said, were “not very high”.Bloomberg said the Trump appointee, who has expressed doubt about accepted climate science, was “saying the environment doesn’t need protection” and saying instead he would “try to protect jobs”. “That’s not his job,” Bloomberg said. “His policies are not good for the world. That to debunk science and walk away from it is just ridiculous. Even if you don’t believe it. If there’s a possibility that it’s right, you have to take prophylactic actions to prevent a disaster.”Firing Pruitt would be up to Trump, Bloomberg said, adding: “If he could get Scott Pruitt to change his policies, then he can keep him.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9537cbebecc9169cf6f1a4830fa6ad39005abf1/0_391_5200_3121/master/5200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54425e5d3967a9d0210b1ef85f7df937","title":"seven ways to avoid hair loss","story":"There are two clinically approved drugs for preventing further hair loss – finasteride and minoxidil. Finasteride works by inhibiting the hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which causes the hair follicles to shrink and eventually fall out, while minoxidil increases blood flow and nutrient uptake to the follicles. Both treatments may result in some hair regrowth as well, but they include the risk of side-effects. Finasteride has been found to lead to erectile dysfunction and decreased libido in approximately 1 in 31 men, while minoxidil can result in skin irritation and allergic reactions.Apart from finasteride and minoxidil, laser combs are the only hair-loss treatment to have received FDA approval. (In the UK, the medication and the combs have to be paid for privately as they are not available on the NHS.) A 2014 study of 103 men with pattern hair loss found a significant increase in hair density after 26 weeks of applying a laser comb across the scalp three times a week. The exact way the combs work isn’t fully understood, but it has been suggested that low-power lasers have an antioxidant effect on hair follicles.There is some evidence that many gels and other styling products may contribute to hair loss, as the chemicals within these products stay on the scalp and become trapped in the follicles, preventing the hair from coming to the surface. Avoid excessive use of hair gels and try more natural styling products, which contain fewer chemicals.Overly hot showers can cause damage to the scalp by stripping it of the essential oils that help to protect it, causing dryness and inflammation. There is no direct evidence that hot showers lead to hair loss, but some believe that scalp inflammation can result in miniaturisation of the hair follicles and thinning hair.Some studies have suggested that scalp massage has the potential to increase hair density by improving blood circulation to the scalp and hair follicles, as well as increasing the activity of genes known to promote hair growth. An additional benefit is that massage helps to lower stress levels, another factor relating to hair loss.If you already have significant hair loss, a transplant may be your best bet. Before hair loss, we have about 100,000 hairs at least 25,000 are required to give the appearance of a relatively complete head of hair. The transplant process involves taking hair follicles from the DHT-resistant “donor” regions at the back and sides of the head, and grafting them on to the scalp. There are many different hair transplant techniques, but some of the newer methods use hair stem cells to stimulate regrowth in the donor area, allowing for repeated transplantations if necessary."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7a1094f8ac97ba3071efdd42b846028f1c53c63/120_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0414eb7cbea613682b03cb9405e03a9","title":"obey review jamie jones london riots","story":"Jamie Jones’s shrewd drama describes some of the tensions, rage and desperation felt by young people of colour before violence spilled on to the streets in 2011• Sign up for Film Today and get our film team’s highlights of the dayThis movie, from first-time feature director Jamie Jones, takes place amid the London riots of 2011 and the white noise of rage and desperation they both caused and fed off, as the police shooting of Mark Duggan in Tottenham triggered angry protests that degenerated into nationwide violence and looting.As the title implies, the film is about power. It is about submitting to the imperatives of sex, friendship and family, and asks what it was like to live in that atmosphere, to inhale its microbes of anger and fear, and to contend with the decibel count of aggression on the streets. One of the film’s most insightful moments comes when the three main characters go on a bucolic narrowboat ride along the River Lea the sudden calm and silence are startling and healing. It is the noisy and clamorous city that is poisoning people’s hearts.Obey is a well-directed, well-acted film that cleverly meshes news footage of the riots with staged fictional scenes, and there is a strong central performance from Marcus Rutherford as Leon, a young man just out of care, back at home with his caring but lonely and alcoholic single mum, Chelsea (an excellent performance from T’Nia Miller) and channelling his energies into boxing. When social tensions escalate, Leon finds himself in a crisis of loyalty among his friends, while falling for a beautiful social justice warriortrustafarian white girl, Twiggy (Sophie Kennedy Clark), who is temporarily in a squat, though with the safety net of a comfortable family home out in the shires.My reservations about the film centre on its tendency towards gender cliches and to fetishise the dangerous blondeness and sexiness of its female lead and also the way it ends on a macho flourish of violence that has no consequences other than the final credit roll. The violence has kept it real – end of story. Yet what leads up to all this is powerfully and emotionally presented.Leon is a thoughtful, intelligent guy dealing with complex emotions. The film reveals that his going into care at 15 was a voluntary decision, and his return home four years later is conditional on his mother dealing with her drinking issues now his abusive father is off the scene. But his mother has a new boyfriend, who is another bully and addiction enabler. Leon hangs out with his friends, who drift around getting into trouble almost accidentally. James has a very interesting opening shot, showing them all ambling up the street talking about all sorts of lightheartedly outrageous stuff before stealing something from a car seemingly on a whim.Sucking up nitrous oxide from balloons is their chief leisure activity, and there is a nice moment when Leon morosely plays with some Scalextric in his flat – a reminder of fleeting childhood happiness. Fate turns when he goes to a squat party and meets the elegant Twiggy, who has an activist boyfriend, Anton (Sam Gittins), clearly from the same side of the tracks as her. Leon finds himself drawn shyly into their ambit, to the suspicion of his friends. His feelings for Twiggy are one source of tension, his loathing of his mum’s obnoxious boyfriend is another, and then, when the riots cause the boxing gym to close its doors, the frustration climbs to dangerous levels.The disorder causes a serious split among his friends, some of whom believe the riots are about “revenge” and some whom think it is about “stealing stuff”. When Twiggy shows up at Leon’s flat, her encounter with his mum is uneasy. “Where d’you spring from?” asks Chelsea. “Same place as you, I guess,” says Twiggy insouciantly, to which Chelsea replies: “We ain’t from the same place, darling.” And they certainly aren’t.Jones gets some nice shots and shrewd moments.

The Italian has worn a haggard expression on the touchline in recent weeks as his side’s pursuit of the top four was rendered ever more forlorn, his demeanour indicative of a campaign consumed by anticlimax. But the old zest and manic enthusiasm were back in plain sight at Wembley. Chelsea eased beyond Southampton to ensure a season that has served to underwhelm could yet yield major silverware.The prospect of another spiky collision with José Mourinho, and Manchester United, in the domestic season finale will merely add to the sense of occasion. “There is not a problem between him and me,” offered Conte rather unconvincingly of a counterpart with whom he has sparred regularly during his time in England, with relations having reached a nadir this year.“We are talking about two managers with strong characters and two winners,” he said. “And when in your mind, in your heart and in your blood there is the will to win … I have great respect for United’s story, for Mourinho’s story, and they have the same respect, I think, for Chelsea’s story and my story. But we want to win.”The Italian’s career at Stamford Bridge is winding down prematurely, his departure anticipated in the summer but he can still go out with a bang. This was a semi-final claimed by his two strikers, Olivier Giroud supplying a goal of jaw-dropping quality in the opening exchange of the second half before the substitute Álvaro Morata added a late second, even if it was Eden Hazard’s effervescence which had most consistently illuminated the occasion.The Belgian seemed to thrive playing in a competition that can still be won. Southampton, with Premier League survival their priority and four critical games still to be played, were aggrieved to have been denied a route back into the fray by the officials in the game’s frenetic latter stages. Yet in truth they rarely contained the irrepressible Hazard and had been badly unpicked by Giroud’s close control.The Frenchman had scored twice against these opponents in the league just eight days previously but neither of those goals could match his opener on this grander stage. Cesc Fàbregas’s lofted pass forward 25 seconds into the second half had been optimistic but Hazard collected on the volley in mid-air ahead of Jan Bednarek and, once grounded, kept his head to flick the loose ball towards the penalty spot, where Giroud had evaded Mario Lemina in anticipation of a pass. The composure demonstrated thereafter by the Frenchman, in the tightest of spaces with markers flinging themselves in from all around, was startling.A touch with his left foot took the ball away from Maya Yoshida, a second with his right cutting back to bypass Cédric Soares as he slid in. The slalom was played out at pace and, by the time the striker had calmly flicked home his finish with the outside of his right foot as he finally stumbled, Alex McCarthy and Bednarek had joined Soares in the pile of bodies cluttering up the goalmouth. “My second passion has always been skiing,” said the Frenchman, born in Alpine Chambéry whose first professional club was Grenoble, through a smile. Giroud’s control and subtlety of touch had been too much for Southampton. He has won all 10 of his club visits to Wembley, a record to which Chelsea will cling next month.Mark Hughes’s side, who boast a solitary top-flight win since late November and languish four points below the relegation cut-off, had already survived Willian striking the crossbar by then with their initial display cramped by caution, but they did at least respond to their deficit. Shane Long’s dreadful first touch, after Wesley Hoedt’s diagonal pass and Charlie Austin’s dummy, passed up a fine chance to equalise. The introduction of Nathan Redmond and Dusan Tadic injected “craft”, according to Hughes, though luck remained elusive.Willy Caballero, initially wrong-footed, had done wonderfully well to improvise a save and deflect Redmond’s shot from distance behind with his left arm as he fell. Yet the goalkeeper was far less convincing from the resultant corner, leaping to catch a high ball under pressure from Austin only to spill back, behind and over his line. His blushes were spared by the referee blowing for what seemed a soft foul. “The keeper’s basically thrown the ball into the back of his net, and if ever there was a situation for the VAR to step in, that was an opportunity,” Hughes said. “It was a match-defining moment. Why it wasn’t referred, I have no idea.”He also bemoaned the non-award of a penalty after the ball struck Giroud’s arm and saw Austin skim a shot on to the far post before the end. Yet by then Chelsea’s lead had been doubled. Morata had been on the pitch only a few minutes when César Azpilicueta gathered in space and flung over the kind of cross from which successive Chelsea forwards have prospered in recent times. His compatriot had eased far too comfortably away from Hoedt and his downward header bounced beyond the helpless McCarthy.“In this type of game, the most important thing is to reach your target,” Conte said. “To reach another final is very important for the players, important for the club, and especially it is important for the fans. I’m delighted for them.”It may not be enough to prolong his stay into a third season but Conte can still emerge from a trying campaign with a trophy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7e06b40b89bbf1b795ba23f671994e05939f214/0_78_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64489d9dd77d70682fd2eaddf9f96d20","title":"eusebio di francesco roma liverpool champions league","story":"Roma’s voluble manager Eusebio Di Francesco is full of passion as his side prepare to face Liverpool in the Champions LeagueWords race out of Eusebio Di\u0026nbspFrancesco’s mouth like cars entering il\u0026nbspGra, the orbital motorway that encircles the city of Rome. They are going a mile a minute, bumper to bumper, yet the man behind the wheel somehow finds a way to transmit an overwhelming sense of calm.Roma’s manager speaks fast because this is no time to drop a gear following his team’s return to their Trigoria training base after a vital league win away at Spal. They have barely one day here before they pack up again and fly to Liverpool for the first leg of their Champions League semi-final.Roma began this weekend third, just a point clear of Internazionale in fifth. The game against Liverpool will be their eighth in 25 days, a stretch that has included not only a two-legged quarter-final with Barcelona but also a draining derby against a Lazio side fighting to leapfrog them in the table.If this team is running close to empty, you would not know it from the grins on players’ faces as they arrive for training. “What we do is a job but it needs to be fun, too,” says Di\u0026nbspFrancesco. “It should be a joy. That’s what I always say to the lads. The first thought is to prepare to enjoy ourselves together, and work hard. They have to enjoy themselves. This is a game first of all.”That lesson was learned during Di\u0026nbspFrancesco’s own playing career. As a member of the Roma team that won the Scudetto in 2001 – only the third in their club’s history – what he remembers above all is the way that he and his team-mates used to spend time together off the pitch, hanging out to play cards or shoot\u0026nbsppool.He does not see great similarities between that team and this one. “Because these are completely different times. There’s a greater professionalism now, as there should be, but back then there was more of a family spirit. That’s been lost a little bit, with social media, with technology, with the arrival of new ways of working. If those two things could come together, that would be the ideal. And we are trying here to make it so.”That he thinks a great deal about players’ psychology is obvious. After Roma overturned a three-goal deficit in the second leg of their quarter-final against Barcelona, pundits rushed to acclaim his tactical nous, switching for the first time to a three-man defence: some move for a man who has always insisted that 4-3-3 is the “ideal formation”.Yet Di Francesco frames the change differently. “Football is dynamic,” he asserts. “Even when you talk about a four-man defence, you often end up defending as a three, or even a two, depending on the game situation.“My decision to change the system was linked to the fact that with some teams, with the characteristics of certain players, a three-man defence can give you a little bit of extra physicality. You get a little bit of extra strength – some of that just in the heads of the players themselves. Sometimes, especially in Europe, you need a little bit more physicality.”That was certainly the case against Barcelona, bullied into submission by Roma’s muscular midfield trio of Radja Nainggolan, Kevin Strootman and Daniele De Rossi. Does Di Francesco plan to repeat the ruse against Liverpool? He would hardly tell us if he did, yet he does observe that Jürgen Klopp’s team are a long way from the old English stereotype of long balls and reducers.Appointed last summer, Di\u0026nbspFrancesco never had a chance to work with Mohamed Salah. If there is any regret at missing out on the chance to coach such a talent, then he hides it well, though he does note his players’ praise for “a great guy, a great professional, a hard worker”.“I don’t need them to tell me,” he says with a smile when asked if he has sought out advice from his defenders on how best to frustrate Salah. “His qualities are very clear. Don’t forget that I prepared games against him in Italy, too. But the fact lots of our players know him well, that can be an advantage.”Salah has scored 41 goals this season, yet it was his assists last year at Roma that helped Edin Dzeko to reach 39. The Bosnian has a more modest 20 this time around, and Di\u0026nbspFrancesco offers frankly that “he has alternated good matches with not-so-good ones”. The good, though, have been very good indeed. He notched a double at Stamford Bridge and scored in both legs against Barcelona.Does Di\u0026nbspFrancesco think Manchester City made a mistake in letting go of a player so capable of taking the biggest games in hand? “It seems to me Guardiola loves a different type of forward. One who’s a little more mobile, a little faster. Edin is a fantastic player, but with different physical and technical attributes to the ones Guardiola wants.”He is banging the table now, swept away with the force of his own sentiment. Italy’s biggest clubs first came calling for him in the summer of 2016, yet he turned them down then because he could not stand to walk away from Sassuolo in a year when he had just led them to their first ever Europa League qualification.Di Francesco believes in seeing a project through to its conclusion. For Roma, he hopes, a first Champions League semi-final in 34 years is just the beginning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5b0c91e4991ee59e4aee22ec45f8673b749acb8/0_99_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=209940dfdd8bdd8df4c0022cbb12b14d","title":"juventus napoli serie a match report koulibaly","story":"Napoli threw the Serie A title race open in dramatic style on Sunday when Kalidou Koulibaly scored with a towering header in the last minute to give them a 1-0 win at the leaders, Juventus.Maurizio Sarri’s side cut the gap between them and the Turin side to one point with four matches to play, setting up a dramatic finale to the Serie A season. Juventus, chasing a seventh successive title, still face difficult matches away to Internazionale and Roma. Napoli dominated the match but seemed to have run out of ideas and energy until the final minute when José Callejón’s outswinging corner was met by the Senegal international with a mighty header which left Gianluigi Buffon helpless.Napoli will hope to capitalise on any slip-up by their modern rivals when they tackle the likes of Torino, Sampdoria and Crotone across their remaining fixtures.Juve needed steel in defence to nullify Napoli’s forward line but a key figure was removed from the back three early on when Giorgio Chiellini suffered an injury during a clash with Lorenzo Insigne.Stephan Lichtsteiner replaced him and despite the disappointment of the enforced change to the game plan, Juve came close to scoring with a little over a quarter of an hour on the clock in Turin.Bosnian schemer Miralem Pjanic rattled the far post with a free-kick after Raul Albiol had fouled Gonzalo Higuaín and the touchpaper had been lit.Napoli soon found channels to run into given the modified Juve set-up and in the 21st minute Mario Rui let loose a twisting drive that Gianluigi Buffon did well to palm over the crossbar.Another Azzurri raid down the left allowed Mario Rui to set up his captain Marek Hamsik, who grimaced after dragging his shot across Buffon’s goalmouth and wide of the far post.Napoli had the ball in the back of the net as half-time approached, Insigne prodding home only for referee Gianluca Rocchi to rule that the Italy striker had been offside.Allegri surprised many when he withdrew Paulo Dybala for Juan Cuadrado at the break, not only removing the X-factor of the Argentinian from the pitch but leaving himself with just one more substitute.And with Napoli making up consistent ground in the Juve half as the second period progress, the boss rolled the dice and threw Mario Mandzukic into the fray when there were 20 minutes remaining.Pjanic made it his business to try and pick out the tall Croatian with his pinpoint free-kicks - one in particular caused chaos in the Napoli box.But the visitors were unruffled and roamed forward to test Buffon with a sighter from Piotr Zielinski. Juve failed to heed the warning and in the 89th minute the unthinkable happened."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e5293d881847d2a5dc9e3605ac3afd4ba0efa63/0_137_4104_2462/master/4104.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0caec2d958e17cfda65b3e4aaa3192a9","title":"manchester city swansea city premier league match report","story":"Manchester City fans came to see a victorious coronation and were not disappointed. They witnessed a masterclass from their freshly crowned champions on a jubilant afternoon.It was decorated by a 20-yard peach from Kevin De\u0026nbspBruyne that rocketed past Lukasz Fabianski after 54 minutes on a right-left diagonal that was as pure a connection as possible. This had Pep Guardiola blowing his cheeks in admiration and the Etihad Stadium offering a collective “ooh”.This 29th victory takes Guardiola’s team to 90 points, six from breaking Chelsea’s record Premier League total of 95. If the maximum remaining are taken, City will finish on 102. They also have 98 goals, six short of breaking the highest tally of 103, again by Chelsea.At the close City supporters invaded the pitch and at least one flare was fired. Each of these could draw a Football Association charge but Guardiola, understandably, was not concerned.“No problem,” he said. “Football is an emotional game. I understand you have to be careful – but when they feel they want to share that they are happy – it is better they stay where they should stay – I’m not going to tell them don’t do that.”Of his team, whose 1,015 attempted passes was the most since 2003-04, breaking records, Guardiola said: “Looking for them helps to keep the players focused.”For his stated mission of ending the season with five victories Guardiola made two changes. Kyle Walker and Leroy Sané became substitutes – alongside Benjamin Mendy after seven months out with a knee injury – as Danilo and Bernardo Silva took their places in a still formidable XI.Carlos Carvalhal made one alteration – Luciano Narsingh being replaced by Mike van der Hoorn, as the manager continued Swansea City’s survival bid. His team formed a pre-game guard of honour before a newly unveiled banner that read: “Welcome to the home of the Premier League champions”.Guardiola’s men began and ended as they nearly always do at home: in control. Fabianski’s first action was to catch a long De Bruyne cross-shot from the right that was heading in.Next Ilkay Gündogan played an inadvertent one-two with the referee, Craig Pawson, that allowed the German to find David Silva. He relayed the ball to his namesake Bernardo and a devilish delivery was scrambled out for a corner by Martin Olsson.De Bruyne took this but it was unproductive. The Belgian’s next contribution was the opposite. This time, from along the left, he found Raheem Sterling who turned the ball off his left foot inside to David Silva. It ricocheted off Van der Hoorn and the Spaniard collected a 10th of the campaign.After the quarter-hour the lead was doubled. Once more David Silva was involved. He returned a pass to Fabian Delph and, when the ball was swept in, Raheem Sterling had a tap-in for his 23rd goal of the season.This signalled contest over with more than three-quarters still to play. Already the game was akin to a training ground affair with the home side yo-yoing the ball around. De Bruyne – City’s player of the season – warmed Fabianski’s fingers with a left-foot zinger. Gabriel Jesus hit a low shot that again kept the goalkeeper honest. At the close of the half Alfie Mawson wandered forward and took aim at Ederson. The Brazilian collected but this was as good as the visitors were before the break.The second half began with a lightning foray that included a David Silva step-over and ended with Danilo’s cross flashing before Fabianksi.After De Bruyne’s glorious finish City continued to dominate. Sterling won a penalty, Jesus’s effort from the spot was steered on to the post via a Fabianski palm, and Bernardo Silva slotted in the rebound.It might have been more but Alfie Mawson’s back-header rebounded to safety off the left post. There was even time for a 15-minute cameo from Mendy and for City to secure a fifth as Yaya Touré’s lob was headed home by Jesus: it was that kind of day for City.Carvalhal’s side are four points above the drop zone with four matches left. Asked how the defeat would affect confidence, the manager said: “Zero, absolutely. They are a team from another planet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68ccc384ccdf48511a72a07b8c98fa2c5a944eec/0_40_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21829807f1977867ea9515757b9eb40b","title":"mohamed salah pfa player of year","story":"Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah has been named as the Professional Footballers’ Association player of the year for the 2017-18 season.The Egypt international saw off competition from the Manchester City trio of Kevin De Bruyne, Leroy Sané and David Silva to become the second African player to win the award after Riyad Mahrez of Leicester in 2016. Tottenham’s Harry Kane came third, with De Bruyne second. Salah, who moved to Anfield from Roma last June for a club record fee of £36.9m, has scored 40 goals in his debut season as Jürgen Klopp’s side have reached the semi-finals of the Champions League.Salah was presented with the award at the Grosvenor Hotel in London on Sunday evening, with City’s winger Sané voted as young player of the year.“It’s an honour to win this award especially because it was voted for by the other players,” said Salah. “I would like to thank my team-mates and everyone at the club for helping me to make this happen.”Asked what it meant to become the first Egyptian to win the award, he said: “Hopefully I’m not the last one. I’m very proud to win and I’ve worked very hard.”Fran Kirby, who played in Chelsea’s 3-1 defeat in the first leg of the Women’s Champions League semi-final on Sunday, won the women’s player of the year award. Bristol City’s Lauren Hemp was named young player of the year. The PFA’s Merit award went posthumously to Cyrille Regis, the former West Brom forward who died aged 59 in January. The award was recognition of Regis’ pioneering role in changing attitudes towards black footballers in England.While not unexpected given his stunning debut season at Anfield, Salah faced strong competition from the Belgium international De Bruyne, who has been the standout player for the champions.Speaking after their 5-0 victory over Swansea on Sunday, Manchester City’s manager, Pep Guardiola, had backed his midfielder for the award. “If he doesn’t win, then congrats to the guy that wins,” he said. “But in my opinion there is no player better than him in terms of continuity, every three days, competitions, three days. Maybe the numbers say someone is better than him but this season there has been no one better than him. That’s my opinion but players can have another one. But in the end, in the summertime, we will be at home being champions.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19f627fa20dc4866f9dbee50ea80c9a8893e0af9/183_356_4157_2494/master/4157.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1dfb4f4a6056a428b65e84ad179fb0b","title":"ian rush liverpool team spirit 1984 interview","story":"Rome conjures many glorious European memories for Liverpool but for Ian Rush it means the most nerve-racking walk of his life, singing along to Chris Rea in the Stadio Olimpico tunnel and the unshakable belief that underpinned victory over Roma in the 1984 European Cup Final. He recognises that same quality when watching Jürgen Klopp’s team today.With the Giallorossi on the European horizon, Mohamed Salah closing in on one of his records and Accrington Stanley showing there is much more to them than a milk advertisement, Liverpool’s all-time leading goalscorer has been transported back to the 1980s of late. The development of Klopp’s team in recent months has had a similar effect, fuelling Rush’s confidence for the Champions League semi-final.“It’s strange Liverpool drew Roma as there are similarities with the team in 84,” says the club ambassador. “In Europe Liverpool are playing extremely well. In the Premier League there are times when they do not but there remains that belief and confidence they are going to win. A year ago they didn’t play that well at home to Bournemouth and drew 2-2. Last Saturday they didn’t play that well and won 3-0. It’s a very good sign when you are not playing to your full potential but still winning comfortably. That was the same with us. The spirit in that 1984 team was massive and it is something I see in Liverpool now.”The side’s confidence had deeper foundations in 1984 and they found an unusual way to show it. Joe Fagan’s team had won the league for a third year running before arriving in Rome, the first two of the hat-trick coming under Bob Paisley. It was their fourth European Cup final appearance in seven years and, after a 1-1 draw, extra time and Alan Kennedy’s winning penalty in the shootout, Liverpool returned home as European champions for a fourth time. Rush believes the seeds of victory were sown before kick-off.“It was like going into the Colosseum, playing a European Cup final against Roma in Rome,” he recalls. “In the tunnel before the game we lined up alongside the Roma players and, while waiting to go out, we all started singing I Don’t Know What It Is But I Love It by Chris Rea. That threw Roma. They didn’t know what was happening but it was our way of showing them we wouldn’t be fazed by anything.“We respected Roma but it was a nice way of letting our opponent know they were up against Liverpool and our supporters. We didn’t care that the game was in Rome. Every stage was the same to us. I think that played a big part on the night. They tried all sorts of intimidation tactics over there but we overcame them as a team, not as iniduals. They did the usual thing of trying to keep us awake all night by blasting horns outside our hotel but we deflated them by singing in the tunnel. It must have had a big impact because when I went to Juventus the first thing Antonio Cabrini said to me was: ‘What was that singing all about with Liverpool?’ I told him we did it all the time!”Rush converted Liverpool’s fourth penalty that night, moments before Bruce Grobbelaar wobbled his legs, Francesco Graziani struck the crossbar and Kennedy reprised his European Cup-winning routine from 1981. “That walk from the halfway line to the penalty spot, with 60,000 people booing me, was the most nervous walk of my life. It was such a relief to score,” says the former striker, who dropped to his knees on the walk back.The penalty is not included in the record tally of 47 goals that the Wales international struck for Liverpool that season. Rush’s record has remained intact for 34 years but is under serious threat this season, with Salah scoring his 41st at West Brom on Saturday.“I’m very proud of the record,” he admits. “It is an amazing feat and so is what Mo Salah has done. He’s a joy to watch. He seems so humble too. What I like about him is if someone else is better placed he will pass. He’s not greedy and he always runs over to the person who made his goal and says thank you. That is something we were brought up to do. It seems funny to say now but in the first five or six games of the season he missed quite a few chances. Now he’s in the same frame of mind as I was in ’84 – knowing you are going to score in every game. Keep him fit and Liverpool have every chance. Honestly, if he needs one more goal to break my record and scores his 48th in the Champions League final, I’ll be a happy man.”The Liverpool legend was working in Thailand last week but could not escape from another chapter from his past when Accrington Stanley sealed the first league promotion in their history. Reruns promptly followed of that 1989 ad for the Milk Marketing board, when a young scouse hopeful drinks milk on Rush’s supposed advice, and the 56-year-old was keen to congratulate Accrington’s manager, the Liverpool fan John Coleman, on a remarkable achievement.“John deserves the utmost respect and credit,” says Rush. “He has been there for quite a while now and must have one of the lowest budgets in the entire league. My club, Chester City, have just been relegated and, when you look at clubs like Accrington and Chester, they tread such a fine line. All credit to them. I don’t think people will be asking who Accrington Stanley are any more. Maybe they’ll ask who Ian Rush is instead!”The answer, should anyone need to ask, would be the winner of one European Cup, five league championships, three FA Cups, five League Cups and the most prolific goalscorer in Liverpool’s rich history. Exactly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00f586379d540da2815618f62728aa8fa78218f7/0_0_620_372/master/620.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=757e889fcf245cd905e9e8a23f0a470d","title":"fa cup and premier league talking points from the weekend","story":"Harry Kane is out of sorts, Joe Hart soars before being floored, and Stoke must choose between youth and experience up frontWhile Southampton will take something from getting this far in the world’s most celebrated domestic cup competition there are other, more pressing priorities, such as making a late dash for safety in the Premier League. Can they take any hope from their performance? Not from the first half. Olivier Giroud’s goal at the beginning of the second period forced Mark Hughes to change things, however, and it was to his team’s benefit. A 3-5-2 became a 3-4-3 and suddenly Charlie Austin was getting service.

Paul MacInnes• Pochettino: ‘Maybe next season we play the FA Cup with kids’When José Mourinho arrived at Chelsea he ensured he had a solid foundation at the back on which to build, bringing the trusted Paulo Ferreira and Ricardo Carvalho from Porto. On Saturday Manchester United’s back five comprised players purchased by Sir Alex Ferguson, who stepped down five years ago. The ageing Antonio Valencia and Ashley Young have both been successfully redeployed from attacking roles but their longevity is unknown. David De Gea is now one of the best Premier League goalkeepers but the much-maligned Phil Jones and Chris Smalling are still the most trusted defenders as David Moyes, Louis van Gaal and Mourinho have all failed to acquire a consistent centre-back to oust them, forcing Mourinho to rely on the old guard, who thoroughly justified their selection at Wembley even if they have faltered this season. This summer’s defensive transfer movements will be critical. Will UnwinThe Arsenal players continued to talk of winning the Europa League for Arsène Wenger – in order to afford him the send-off he deserves – and it was difficult not to view this Premier League win through the prism of Thursday’s semi-final first leg against Atlético Madrid. Mohamed Elneny’s nasty-looking injury will deprive Wenger of a midfield option if he goes with a 4-3-3 formation while the manager will hope that Petr Cech, Mesut Özil, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Jack Wilshere can return. The biggest positive here was Alexandre Lacazette, who scored twice. It is now six goals in six appearances for the striker since his return from knee surgery and the way that he took his second, in particular – a drop of the shoulder, burst and low finish – pointed to a level of ruthlessness and confidence that will be needed against Atlético. David HytnerJoe Hart was left forlorn, not for the first time this season, but he will be especially frustrated by the fact he briefly proved why he is a Premier League champion and the owner of 75 England caps. With the scores at 1-1 he made two world class saves. Hart first denied a powerful Granit Xhaka drive, which forced him to e full stretch to his left, the side many see as his main weakness, with his fingers flicking the ball beyond the post. He replicated the acrobatics minutes later when Danny Welbeck curled a shot from 18 yards with the same impressive result. Unfortunately for Hart, he was the victim of Declan Rice ducking out of a header to help Arsenal regain the lead and then the goalkeeper’s confidence dropped as he failed to deal with two Alexandre Lacazette shots, leaving the scoreline flattering and Hart, once again, flattened. Will UnwinTwo January signings excelled for Stoke here. Badou Ndiaye gave the central midfield solidity and thrust, as well as scoring his first goal since his £14m arrival from Galatasaray. Moritz Bauer, a right-back, did well as a makeshift left winger. His cross should have led to a goal that might have secured a precious win, but Mame Birame Diouf fluffed it. Which brings us to the signing that Stoke did not make in January or at any other time in the last three years: a regular goalscorer, which despite the arrivals of Saido Berahino, Joselu and Wilfried Bony, has been a big factor in Stoke’s decline. Paul Lambert says his team must win all three of their remaining matches to survive. His choice is whether to put his faith in Tyrese Campbell, an 18-year-old who has been scoring prolifically for the club’s Under-23s, or continue hoping that Peter Crouch can fire Stoke to safety. Paul Doyle If Roy Hodgson is right and Wilfried Zaha’s reputation is costing him dearly, then the Crystal Palace forward has a real problem. His reaction to the harsh yellow card for simulation in the second half against Watford at Vicarage Road on Saturday was an indication of how frustrated Zaha is becoming with the perceived lack of protection he receives from referees. The Ivory Coast international certainly splits opinion among supporters as well. Given his ability, however, most would probably still welcome him at their club and Hodgson will know that without their talisman Palace’s season could have turned out very differently. The challenge will be to retain him this summer in the face of serious interest from several bigger sides, while Zaha must decide if he needs to leave Selhurst Park to fulfil his true potential. Ed AaronsA big part of West Bromwich Albion’s mini-revival under the stewardship of Darren Moore has been the togetherness the first-team coach has been preaching. But on Saturday, with 20 minutes to play, Jonny Evans was roundly booed after replacing James McClean, who was nursing a stomach bug. Was it a combination of his role in Taxigate, his underwhelming performances since speculation over a January move, or a combination of both? Either way, it was hardly helpful, even if Moore insisted it was a managerial masterstroke given Evans’s role in the set piece that kickstarted the comeback. “It worked an absolute treat, so tactically it was absolutely spot on,” Moore said. With Ahmed Hegazi likely to face retrospective action by the Football Association for appearing to punch Danny Ings in the chest, Evans may yet be promoted to the starting XI at Newcastle on Saturday. Ben FisherDanny Ings’s move to Liverpool was a dream one for a man who spent time on loan at Dorchester Town in 2010. Five years later he headed to Anfield in the hope of making his mark at a top Premier League club after a fine four years with Burnley. But his time in Liverpool has been a nightmare, mainly because of injury. Under Jürgen Klopp, Ings has endured constant misfortune, sustaining an anterior cruciate injury in his first training session with the German in October 2016, missing nine months, then a year later damaging cartilage in his right knee, forcing him out for 11 months. Klopp has shown great faith in him recently and his first goal in two-and-a-half years could be the boost he needs to show he can be a key squad player next season or give him the confidence required to restart his career elsewhere after three tough years.

There are on average about 250 babies born every minute – more than 130 million in a year. It is projected that there will be 11 billion people by 2100. New UN figures are due out in June. Most national governments make their own population projections. The United Nations and the World Bank figures are the most widely used globally. Since the 1960s, more boys than girls have been born every year. About 117 million women are believed to be “missing” in Asia and eastern Europe – due to discriminatory son preference and gender-biased sex selection.Where is the population rising fastest – and slowest?Broadly speaking, the fastest population rises are being recorded in Africa and Asia, which will have 15 of the 20 most populous nations by 2050. By that year, there will be more Nigerians than Americans. By 2100, it is projected that as many as one-third of all people – almost 4 billion – will be African.At the other end of the scale, population growth has stalled – or even gone into reverse – in parts of western Europe, Japan and Russia. Are these numbers sustainable?A nuanced question. Experts like Paul Ehrlich argue that the population of the world has long since surpassed optimal levels, though critics counter that consumption is as important as population levels.Some believe the very argument about overpopulation is controversial as it tends to point the finger at poorer parts of the world with large growth rates, and not at richer regions, which use disproportionately high amounts of resources.The fertility rate is the number of children born for every woman of childbearing age in a population. The things that tend to affect it include female empowerment, wellbeing and the status of children, technological and economic changes, and opportunities for family planning.The level of education in a society – of women in particular – is one of the most important predictors for the number of children families have.The global average fertility rate is just below 2.5 children per woman today. Over the last 50 years the global fertility rate has halved, as some of these factors bore down on family sizes. In the pre-modern era, fertility rates of 4.5 to 7 children per woman were common. At that time high mortality rates of young people kept population growth low. As health improved, the population growth rate began to soar, only flattening out as the fertility rate declined towards 2 children per woman.Africa has the lowest percentage of women using contraceptives, and the highest unmet need in the world. Despite this, some African countries have made the biggest leaps in contraception use over the past 40 years and are projected to make the greatest gains in the next 15.If birthrates have fallen so far, why is the population still rising fast?Of course, fertility rates are just half the story. People are living longer – far longer in some parts of the world. About 55m people die every year, which is less than half the number who are born. The number of children who die before reaching their fifth birthday has fallen to an all-time low: it is currently less than half what it was in 1990.A child’s chance of survival is still vastly different depending on where they are born. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest under-five mortality rate – 79 deaths for every 1,000 births, which means that one child in 13 die before their fifth birthday. This compares with six for every 1,000 in Europe and northern America and four for every 1,000 in Australia and New Zealand.At the same time, life expectancy is higher than 80 in 30 countries and higher than 70 in more than 100 countries.So what is the demographic idend?Countries that do succeed in reducing fertility rates can benefit from a demographic idend, where there are more people in work than children to support.Where you have a rapid decline in fertility, the younger population is no longer growing as fast and the economy should receive a boost because the number of workers per child increases, and that should provide a period of rapid economic growth. This was the experience in the east Asian “tiger” countries like South Korea and Taiwan in the 70s. Now countries such as China and India are benefiting from a demographic idend.A young population offers a lot of potential for the development of a country, but only if their talents are realised through investment. If there is little support given to young people to develop the skills they need as they enter the labour market, then the economy misses out. Isn’t it problematic that western populations are declining?Another global demographic shift is ageing populations in developed countries such as Japan and Germany, and also in advanced developing countries. In nations as erse as Bangladesh, Cambodia, Mongolia and Vietnam, the population aged over 60 will triple by 2050. This year, the number of people worldwide who are over 60 will rise above 1 billion for the first time. By 2050, it is forecast to be 2 billion. This raises the question: who will pay for them?Falling birth rates can mean fewer young workers entering the labour force at a time when the healthcare and social support costs associated with ageing are likely to rise.But ageing populations can be a cause for celebration. It means development has taken place.If countries plan for the shift they can see gains. In Japan, for example, the introduction of universal health coverage meant more treatment for high blood pressure, and therefore fewer strokes, extending worker productivity. If countries consider redesigning pension systems and offering flexible work in retirement, seeing older volunteers as a potential resource, then many more mature members of society can have not just greater life expectancy but also be healthier for longer. Later retirement does not have to mean fewer jobs for the young. More older people working can increase GDP and generate more demand for young workers. The funding battles over international family planning are ongoing. US Congress rejected the 2018 budget. The debates will continue in 2019.Family planning organisations are learning that to survive political shifts and budget cuts, they need to ersify their sources of funding. This means seeing family planning as not just a public health concern but also about development and a clear return on investment. Where women have control over their own fertility, there are gains well beyond their own families.Population.io: the world population project by World Data LabFamily Planning 2020 (FP2020): a global partnership that supports the rights of women and girls to decide whether, when, and how many children they want to have.Population matters: on working towards a sustainable future.IUCN red list: on threatened species.She decides: a global movement to promote, provide and protect the fundamental rights of woman and girls.Kaiser Family Foundation: on global health policy, especially their research on the impact of the “global gag rule”.The Bill and Melinda Gates Institute for Population and Reproductive Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8b8b92c3613ff26be9a3632c56125c436e3cbbb/0_28_3777_2267/master/3777.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=296be0ff084ac3072a84ca7623374c7a","title":"everything you need to know about recovering from a marathon","story":"Your race is done, the medal is won. But what next? How do you recover properly after running 26.2 miles? Here’s the lowdown on compression gear, ice baths, sleep and when to get back into trainingCongratulations! You are a marathoner. For months, you’ve focused on that one goal – had nightmares about it, over-analysed every niggle and spent sleepless nights fretting about what shoes to wear. Well, now you’ve gone and done it. The box is ticked, the medal is hanging around your neck. So, what now?The chances are that having pored over every minute decision that went into running the race, you’ve given absolutely no thought to how to recover from it: you certainly won’t be alone. But if you want to recover in good speed, and get back out there – either to train for another marathon or just stop feeling like a bus hit you – then you should. Treat the recovery the same way as you did the training – as an integral part of the marathon process, and you’ll soon be back and raring to go. Get back too soon and push too early, and you risk injury.The second you cross that line, your legs will go from running to “utterly incapable of movement”. But don’t stop. The best thing you can do is just keep moving – it doesn’t matter how slowly. Get into clean, dry clothes and comfy shoes: I’ll be staggering around slowly in Oofos slides, others swear by cheap flip-flops. Whatever you find comfortable. If you are a fan of compression gear, now is also the time to get into that (a challenge in itself, when it comes to climbing into those tights ... ). While the jury is out on the benefits of actually running in compression gear, it can definitely help aid recovery. Go for proper, quality compression like those from CEP. It’s one area where cheap options can be a false economy. If you have any very specific sore spots, noticeable immediately, you can try a topical product like a ‘freezing’ spray. Chris Roberts, a rehabilitation therapist, explains: “Cryotherapy products such as Biofreeze are topical analgesics, which work through a ‘counter-irritant’ mechanism. This creates a sensation that overrides pain signals to the brain. This process is known as ‘gate control theory’, where nerve impulses from one stimulus block the nerves containing pain signals to the brain. But it is important to remember that cryotherapy only provides temporary pain relief and is not a long-term solution if injury does occur.”A note on painkillers: please, please, think twice. NSAIDs – such as ibuprofen or aspirin – are a lot stronger than many people realise. No one wants to be in pain, but you also don’t want to mask injury and risk making it worse. Nor do you want to do damage to a body that’s just gone through quite an ordeal. NSAIDS can cause harm to your kidneys, which are already working overtime, given you are undoubtedly mildly dehydrated, at best, and increase your blood pressure to risky levels, as well as putting you at greater risk for hyponatremia. You can research, endlessly, the latest research into the right balance of protein vs carbs and the crucial post-race recovery window in which to eat them. And in an ideal world, you’ll have that three-parts carbsone-part protein snack waiting for you. However ... I’ve run 10 marathons and I know full well that sometimes you can’t even look at food after the race. You’ve just run 26.2 miles and your stomach is queasy, full of gels and in rebellion. Don’t worry, just try and eat whatever you can cope with, whether that’s an ice cream, a bag of crisps, a banana or a protein bar. Have a proper good meal later: heaven knows you’ve earned it. Or celebrate the next day when you feel up to it. Do, however, make sure you rehydrate – take the water you’ll be offered at the finish and keep sipping away for the rest of the day.Back in the comfort of your home or hotel room, it’s time to soak those aching limbs. So what’s better, hot or cold? “The research is ever changing in this area,” says Neil Smith, a physiotherapist at Pure Sports Medicine. “But I would say that ice baths are likely to be better for recovery than a hot bath. It may not be the first thing you want to inflict on yourself after 26.2 gruelling miles – but it does have some positive effects – including reducing Doms (delayed onset muscle soreness). However, if you really feel like a dip in a hot bath the evening of the marathon then no one is going to stop you!” Also note that you do not need access to a fancy cryogenic chamber: “How cold it should be is definitely a personal choice – but something in the region of 15C would work” says Smith. “Some athletes like to go as low as 8C – and that is still achievable with cold water and plenty of bags of ice.”However, Smith and his colleague Lisa Posnett are sceptical that Epsom salts, which are often recommended as a post-marathon remedy, make any difference. “Epsom salt is a common name for magnesium sulphate,” they say. “Despite it being used for decades, there is actually little evidence out there to support its use and muscle soreness alleviation. The idea behind it is it helps reduce magnesium deficiency. However, if it seems to work for you – even if it just provides a placebo effect – then go for it!”Many races will offer you a quick post-race massage. That can definitely help, but can also involve standing around in a queue, which itself can be a form of post-race torture. But if you can afford it, a proper sports massage is a really good idea. As Ellen Cook, sports massage therapist at Ten Health and Fitness says: “The sooner you can do this, the better, as it will flush out any lactic acid that has built up during the race and in turn reduce the build-up of muscle tension. Pushing ourselves that far can cause damage to the muscles. Sports massages help by warming up the muscle fibres through friction and improves blood flow and circulation. Once the muscles are warm they become more malleable, making it easier to release tension, re-align them and ultimately speeding up the healing process.”And if you’ve had a Torquemada-like experience, then don’t be put off. “There are many myths out there regarding sports massage,” says Cook. “The most common is that effective massage should hurt. This is not correct at all, there are many techniques for massage that are used to relieve muscle tension and sometimes going gung-ho on a muscle is not what it needs.” So don’t be afraid to ask your masseur to back off a bit: there are no prizes for enduring agony. Sleep is essential for recovery. However, this also comes under the “great idea in theory, hard in practice” rule. I have never slept well after a marathon. You are riding an adrenaline high (or, though I hope not, a crashing low) and every muscle in your legs is twitching and your system just can’t seem to shut down. Don’t worry – this is perfectly normal. Just rest. Don’t reach for the phone, just try to relax, listen to an audiobook, have another bath ... whatever helps you to drift off again. You’ll no doubt catch up and sleep like a log on subsequent nights.If your legs don’t feel like they fought a war the next day – and the day after that – then did you really run that marathon? But at what point do you know if it’s just a sore muscle, or something worse. “Doms can start a few hours after your exercise and will often peak at about 48-72 hrs, but can last up to even a week,” says Smith. “A lot of people find some gentle massaging and stretching can be helpful. If the pain lasts longer than a week or gets worse then I would suggest seeking some medical advice from a physio or doctor.” To some of you, that will be a no-brainer. Those legs are barely coping with stairs, let alone the idea of running again any time soon. Others, riding an adrenaline high, will be twitching to get back out there again after a few days. Don’t. You have nothing to gain, and a lot of torn muscle fibres that need to heal. If you crave being active, go for a swim, or do a gentle yoga class, but do not feel guilty about not doing any exercise if you don’t feel like it. Remember that elite athletes take a minimum of two very, very easy weeks to recover from a marathon, some longer. If you just want to get outside, gentle walking is a great way to stretch out sore legs.Your immune system, as well as your legs, has just taken a battering. Many people come down with a minor bug in the week after a marathon. So look after yourself, and try to eat healthily. Sure, you deserve celebratory treats, but your body needs to rebuild so be nice to it, and give it the micronutrients it deserves. As well as the cake. But don’t be surprised if elation soon turns to a touch of the blues. You’ve spent months planning and training for this event, and suddenly there’s a hole. Start thinking to the future: while you need to rest and recover, there’s no harm in starting to think of your next challenge. Follow all this advice (and if you have, you’re doing better than me. As my mum would say: “Do as I say, not as I do”) and you’ll soon – but not too soon – be back and raring to go. Use that marathon fitness and see what it can do to your 5k or 10k times."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf6c992ae61b9cd641336dccdfc5ff8db048710c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b2b1e48a5318da6e918756a36cbcb58","title":"taste test falafel ice cream sandwiches vegetarian vegan snacks","story":"Meera Sodha rates high street sandwiches, pasta, burgers and moreTesco Wicked Kitchen smashin’ pumpkin falafel£3, tesco.comI like the colour.

Sussex Double Glazing submitted a tempting estimate via a job quote website and its director, Luke Tester, visited Bidwell’s house to assess the job in February 2017.The quote was £21,760 and Bidwell was asked to pay £6,435.50 by bank transfer as a deposit. That was the last he saw of Tester. “By April I had heard nothing and started chasing,” he says. “If Luke responded to my messages it was with lies about progress. After 20 emails and over two months since I paid the deposit, I advised that I was cancelling the contract and demanded my deposit back. He said I didn’t have a leg to stand on.”Ten months previously another reader, Leanne Fisher* from Seaford, East Sussex, had contacted the Observer after transferring £2,388 to a company called IEO Home Improvements. This, too, was a deposit for a conservatory and, again, the work was never started. IEO’s website had promised that deposits were guaranteed by the Independent Warranty Association, but since IEO had failed to pay the premiums to cover the protection, the guarantee was invalidated. The director of IEO was Luke Tester.Fisher and Bidwell’s ordeals expose a problem with trading law. A director can close down an insolvent company with no personal liability for unpaid debts, then start afresh with a new company doing the same business under a different name.The rules are to allow a second chance for the majority of failed businesses which are not guilty of misconduct. However, they allow incompetent or unscrupulous traders to duck their debts and mask their past by repeatedly reinventing themselves until enough complaints lead to official disqualification as director.Tester, 40, has registered seven home improvement companies in 11 years. Fisher discovered that he had applied to have IEO struck off the Companies House register three days before she paid the deposit in December 2015.A month later – and just days after a voluntary liquidator was appointed – he set up L\u0026ampJ Home Improvements. Nine days after that, he registered Warmseal Windows.In March 2017, a month after pocketing Bidwell’s money, Tester applied to strike Sussex Double Glazing off the register. He was finally disqualified by Companies House for seven years last June because of his conduct as director of IEO, which left over 30 customers out of pocket, including two whose conservatories had been built so badly they were unsafe. Undeterred, he then set up as a sole trader under the name South East Trading.“To my shame and embarrassment I believed his talk and paid a deposit of £1,050 to his bank account last June,” he says. “To date he has avoided doing any work and the more I have read about him, it is obvious that he has no intention of actually doing it. I have sent a notice of intended legal action but hold no hope that I will get my money back.”Tester blames domestic problems and the Observer for his career history. He says he was obliged to wind up Sussex Double Glazing and go solo after being disqualified as director last June. “My business would have thrived if there wasn’t such a witch hunt on social media and in the press, of which the Observer column, Your Problems, was a contributing factor,” he says. “Everyone deserves a chance to rebuild and, although IEO suffered cash-flow problems because of poor subcontracting choices by myself and my business partner, a lot of the problems were beyond my control. People were reading one-sided reports on Google and cancelling contracts based on past problems, not on anything I had done wrong.”He points out that he has offered a repayment plan to Bidwell and Clark. Bidwell confirms that he was offered a four-year repayment deal last April, but, after three instalments, the payments ceased in October.He invited Tester to lay the foundations of the conservatory in lieu of repayment but Tester declined. Clark agreed to accept repayment instalments over six months and received the first £90 this week after pressure from the Observer. Tester claims a marriage breakdown left him unable to keep up promised repayments and that he is now homeless. He insists he intends to settle his debts.Citizens Advice says it receives over 3,000 calls a month about substandard builders. In the last 12 months it handled 43,877 complaints, making it the second biggest issue in its inbox – 7,000 inquiries were from customers who had paid for work which never materialised or was left unfinished.Protections are minimal to those who fall victim to cowboy operators. Deposits paid by bank transfer are not recoverable under the Consumer Credit Act like credit card payments and court action is unlikely to be successful if the company goes into liquidation, or if a sole trader lacks sufficient assets.Builder Harvey Ellingham was prompted to set up an insurance-backed scheme, Home Improvements Guarantee at www.higlite.co.uk, to safeguard customer deposits after his parents lost £23,000 to an unscrupulous operator.“I realised that people who are spending life-changing sums on their biggest asset, their home, should not be relying on a guarantee from a builder they’ve only met once or twice unless it’s insurance backed.”According to Ellingham, legislation is needed. “In the US, Canada and Australia all building contractors have to be licensed and that should be happening here,” he says.The government considered introducing licensing as part of its industrial strategy for construction in 2013 but nothing has so far come of it.Victims of malpractice can report a trader to their local trading standards and officers can prosecute businesses found to be acting fraudulently. West Sussex Trading Standards confirms it is aware of Tester but declines to comment on whether it is taking action.Directors who have been involved in a series of failed companies can be disqualified by The Insolvency Service if malpractice is discovered. In the past, there was nothing to stop them setting up a new limited company with a relative as director and continue as before.

I immediately told it we have no trace of a mobile signal here, and, as result, it would not work. But it insisted, and in February someone called to install one. After a few seconds he concluded that it wouldn’t work, and left without undertaking the work. Since that day, Scottish Power has insisted the meter was changed. It claims that the reason it cannot read the meter is because some gadget is in the wrong place. It insists that we must move this non-existent gadget nearer to the non-existent smart meter. I can no longer supply a reading. I have phoned and emailed Scottish Power again and again. I have sent a picture of my meter, in every possible format, but its system seems unable to call up these pictures. Until it is resolved, I cannot even change to another energy provider since the wrong meter is on its record. This was another case of smart meter nonsense and, in your case, a staff member who refused to accept that what the computer was telling them was wrong.Scottish Power has apologised and is rectifying the problem. It says: “Our system was updated incorrectly, which appears to be human error. We have spoken to WGL to apologise.

Then Brexit happened. He tells the Observer of his fears and hopes for manufacturing, trade and investmentKoji Tsuruoka is sipping green tea in Japan’s splendid embassy in Mayfair, recalling how his first two years as Japan’s ambassador to the UK have not gone quite according to plan. At least, they haven’t turned out how his predecessors assured him they would. One after another, ex-ambassadors advised him, before he took up the position on 6 June 2016, that he would find the UK very “stable”, and its politics “very predictable”.A year later, after the Brexit bombshell caused global diplomatic and economic panic that reached Tokyo, Theresa May called a surprise general election that threw everything up in the air again. Thinking back to that period of turbulence, Tsuruoka stops for a few seconds and glances out of the window in the direction of Buckingham Palace. “Now I have to keep in mind that you don’t predict what is going to happen in the UK.”That said, he does quickly predict, in his diplomatic and soft-spoken way, that Brexit will bring considerable economic uncertainty to this country, in the short term at least. He spells out how decades of ever-increasing Japanese investment into the UK have already come to a halt for the time being. He is well qualified to judge how Brexit will pan out. Before coming to London, Tsuruoka spent three intense years negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal that aims to reduce barriers between the US, Japan and 10 other Pacific nations. He knows as much as anyone about how international trade flows work, and about what is possible and what is not.This account of a relationship that strengthened year after year – in a period during which the UK was in the EU – raises a very obvious question. Will it continue to thrive after we have left? He replies decisively. “One thing I can say for certain, based on fact, is that the companies operating today in the UK are not expanding their investment in the UK today.”Huge Japanese firms with big plants in the UK – such as Nissan and Toyota, who sell most of their British-made cars into the EU – are, he says, treading water, biding their time before deciding whether to relocate part or all of their businesses, so they can continue to be based inside the single market after March 2019. He tries not to sound alarming, but is clear about the threat to UK jobs. “They are currently considering and thinking and watching very closely what they need to do. That is why they are not investing additionally today.“If you are proposing in your board meeting in a company that you need to invest more and build more cars in the UK today today there will be questions, and those are questions that are very difficult to answer today with certainty and therefore decisions are put off.”For Japanese enterprises which came to the UK to sell into EU markets, tariff-free trade is the guiding star that decides where they locate.“The reason that many of those companies have come is that this is the best gateway to Europe,” he says. “If that is in danger, if that is no longer sustainable, of course they will have to look at what they will have to do best. The existing arrangement for the single market is a total frictionless trade.”He believes membership of the single market is as good as it gets for Japanese firms wanting to sell into the EU from European bases. “The EU is a very exceptional single market. I don’t think the single market could be substituted by something and be better or even be the same.”It is not a uniform picture across the whole economy. There are sectors, such as software design, where the UK is still attractive, as it has the R\u0026ampD expertise and skills. He cites the example of how Japan’s SoftBank agreed, after the referendum, to buy the British software design firm Arm Holdings for £24.3bn in the hope that it would become a global leader.“That is one representation of what will go on and that was based on the assessment that the R\u0026ampD, the hi-tech capability, the potential for the UK succeeding further in this area, was quite concrete… those technologies are not necessarily linked to the EU.”Factory-based businesses, however – those producing goods for European markets rather than merely designing them – are a very “different issue”. They face real uncertainties if and when the terms of trade change. So too do Japanese financial institutions in the City, Japanese banks and other organisations offering financial services.The fact they will no longer have passporting rights to operate into EU markets will have significant effects on employment here. “It is an issue – because having passporting rights to reach the single market and be part of the single market is a very efficient and cost-saving way of conducting financial services which is a regulated industry.” Will Japanese banks up sticks and go? No, he says, not lock, stock and barrel, because Europe is just part of their market. But jobs will head out of the City into the EU and Japanese companies will have to reduce their operations in London. “They are not leaving London, because London is a global financial centre, not just a centre for the EU – but they will have to relocate some of their EU business to the EU in order to continue serving the EU consumers.”He is at pains not to talk down the UK’s post-Brexit prospects. Just as no one thought Brexit would happen when he arrived, no one can know for definite that it will turn out badly, as it approaches.“If you take a longer term, five, 10, 20 years… things become more unpredictable,” he says. But he is clear that in the shorter term it will not be good for the UK economy nor the strength of its economic partnership with Japan.He says Japan has not yet begun talks with the UK on a post-Brexit trade deal and that it would take several years to complete, if one is struck at all. It is another area of real uncertainty in the entirely unpredictable post-Brexit world that he never expected to encounter on arriving in London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f956ae3020ff1d9e2c8879f5e73b26bcb010fdc/500_799_5085_3051/master/5085.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c606317e8581ad743342548da66cfc5a","title":"tower hamlets labour win in londons diverse borough is far from certain","story":"Mayoral hopeful Rabina Khan aims to forge a new coalition in the ethnically erse London boroughA team of half a dozen Labour leafleters wait outside an East End primary school on a warm afternoon just off Roman Road street market in the gentrifying suburb of Bow. The party’s message is that schools are facing spending cuts imposed by the central government the target audience is the predominantly Bengali women picking up children, a group that party campaigners otherwise struggle to reach in an area where the Bangladeshi vote is critical.Outside the school is the diminutive figure of John Biggs, the incumbent directly elected mayor. But the Labour politician’s path to the top job in the borough that contains the gleaming towers of Canary Wharf and the traditional East End has been anything but easy. This time around Biggs faces the same principal opponent, Rabina Khan, a local councillor who leads the People’s Alliance for Tower Hamlets (Path), but much else has changed. Rahman, who once backed Khan, is now supporting another independent candidate, the Aspire party’s Ohid Ahmed. With Labour’s popularity in London greater than it was in 2105, and his principal opponents ided, it appears to be Biggs’s election to lose.“When I became mayor it was the end of a period of some controversy in the borough. The easy bit was clearing out the politics the harder bit was improving the quality of our services,” Biggs says, arguing that Labour is the only party that represents the borough as a whole.“Whatever Lutfur Rahman did, whether it was good or bad, it was about a very isive politics that was very segregated. He predominately focused on one community.”However, Khan believes she can put together an alternative coalition to take on Labour. The Bengali councillor talks about “a Tower Hamlets for all” and says she would like to create “a cross-party cabinet with all the political groups”. If you’re living in an area going to the polls in May we want to hear from you. Let us know which way you’re thinking of voting, and which issues are most crucial to you locally.You can share your thoughts using our encrypted form here. One of our journalists may contact you to discuss further and we will feature some of your contributions in our reporting.Khan emphasises how she has “shared a platform with the Green party, challenging austerity measures” that she says were implemented by Labour. “We have to learn from Tower Hamlets right from the beginning. Let’s not forget Cable Street when Oswald Mosley and his blackshirts tried to march through and people came together,” Khan says, and highlights the need to combat Islamophobia and antisemitism in the borough today.At Tower Hamlets, the mayor appoints a cabinet, although most of the power resides in the directly elected leader, who needs the support of the full council to ensure the budget is passed.Khan was a cabinet member for housing when Rahman was executive mayor. She says her experience of the time, in obtaining funding from Boris Johnson’s mayoralty, demonstrates that it is possible for council leaders to succeed outside the mainstream political parties. “I was 1,400 votes behind Biggs last time on first preferences, and he had a party machinery against me,” she adds.But such is her falling-out with Rahman-backed Ahmed, (who did not respond to requests for an interview by the ) that the two were reportedly engaged in a public “shouting match” at a community centre. Some independent locals say it is far from certain that second-preference votes would transfer from Khan’s Path to Ahmed’s Aspire or vice versa in an anti-Labour challenge. In 2015 Biggs won over Khan by 27,255 against 25,763 in the first round. But the Labour candidate won 5,499 second preferences against 621 for Khan.Such personality-driven politics is arguably encouraged by a system of directly elected mayors, used only by a minority of London boroughs. Without it Rahman would probably not have become Britain’s first directly elected Muslim mayor in 2010 after the Labour party stripped him of his nomination.Biggs says that brought with it further difficulties. “The problem was that Lutfur Rahman tested what happens when you get a maverick person elected,” he adds.In neighbouring Newham, where Labour is expected to win easily, the party’s first-time mayoral candidate, Rokhsana Fiaz, wants to have a referendum on whether to continue the system after she wrested the nomination from Sir Robin Wales who had been mayor and the borough’s dominating presence since 2002. Fiaz emphasises a more personal tone and she wants to consult residents on major decisions and developments by using citizen assemblies. She says: “I can understand why people might feel cynical. But I am committed, my instinct is to be very open and involving. The council has become too remote.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b598977e875269ff1d96955a6be2f8763d30a949/0_419_6068_3641/master/6068.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7157d6d6311317cb7150090a1f084c5","title":"dan jarvis labour sheffield city region mayor election","story":"Labour candidate seeks to overcome voter apathy toward city region vote with pledge to work for wider Yorkshire dealOn a grey weekday morning in Scawsby, Doncaster, the Labour MP Dan Jarvis is knocking on doors to garner support for his bid to be the first mayor for the Sheffield city region – a role that comes with no agreed powers, no agreed budget and no agreed salary. “Apart from that, what’s not to like about it?” he jokes.The government’s decision to push ahead with the election on 3 May, despite south Yorkshire’s local authorities – Sheffield, Rotherham, Barnsley and Doncaster – failing to agree a devolution settlement, has been criticised as strange and undemocratic.Barnsley and Doncaster pulled out of an initial deal agreed in 2015 last September, following disputes over the route HS2 would take through the region. The two authorities are now among 18 of 20 Yorkshire councils to back proposals for a devolution deal for the whole historic county area, while the government has insisted that the Sheffield city region mayoral election will take place as it was legislated to do so by parliament.The role of Sheffield city region mayor is, therefore, less about wielding power and more about trying to obtain some. “If I’m elected mayor then the very first thing that I will do on my first day is sit down with the four leaders and work out precisely how we are going to reach an agreement that satisfies all of the constituent parts of south Yorkshire,” says the MP for Barnsley Central. “We need an agreement that enables us to start drawing down on the maximum amount of power and the maximum amount of money.” As far as Jarvis is concerned, the Sheffield devolution deal is an interim step. He is one of an increasing number of politicians to have been converted by arguments for a Yorkshire-wide devolution deal and his eventual goal is to see the Sheffield city region join a settlement for the whole county, something Jeremy Corbyn endorsed last week.In what has been dubbed the Socialist Republic of South Yorkshire, Jarvis’s win seems assured. All of the county’s 15 MPs are Labour, save for Jared O’Mara in Sheffield Hallam, who was suspended from the party following complaints about homophobic and sexist comments. Jarvis’s main opposition in the mayoral race is split, with pockets of strong Green and Liberal Democrat support in parts of Sheffield and some Tory support in Barnsley and Doncaster.He has six opponents, including candidates for the Yorkshire party, South Yorkshire Save Our NHS and the English Democrats. The Conservative candidate, Ian Geoffrey Walker, a local businessman, stood against Nick Clegg in Sheffield Hallam in the 2015 and 2017 general elections. The Lib Dem candidate, Hannah Ruth Kitching, runs a manufacturing business and is also standing to be a councillor in Barnsley. The Green party candidate is Robert Murphy, a heating engineer and councillor in Sheffield.Out canvassing with Jarvis is Kevin Rodgers, a Labour councillor in Doncaster. He says he would be astonished if Jarvis did not win, but adds: “Thinking back to 2009 in Doncaster, at the height of the expenses scandal, we got a real protest vote and we got an English Democrat mayor.” (Peter Davies served a four-year term in the role, resigning from his party in early 2013, citing a big influx of new members from the British National party.) “So, never say never,” Rodgers says. Unlike Sheffield and Rotherham, Barnsley and Doncaster are not holding council elections in May, meaning turnout in the towns could be low. A prominent campaign against tree-felling taking place in Sheffield could result in its Labour council losing some seats in the city’s comparatively affluent south-west, but it is not an issue Jarvis thinks will affect the mayoral race. He acknowledges voices on either side of the argument, but welcomes the council’s decision to pause the felling.Many people opening their doors to Labour activists in Doncaster seem unaware of the upcoming mayoral election. Rebecca Chambers, 20, is coming out of her newly built council house on her way to start her first day in a beauty therapist job, when she runs into the canvassers. “I’d vote if I understood it,” she says. Asked whether she identifies as being from the Sheffield city region, she says no. “Donny first, then Yorkshire.” Even if the four south Yorkshire councils reach a devolution agreement, the new mayor is unlikely to be rolling in cash. The offer on the table includes just £30m a year over 30 years. Jarvis, however, argues that the mayor’s power goes beyond that given to them by central government. “The greatest power that any mayor has is the power to bring people together,” he says. Jarvis is running on a Labour and Co-operative ticket and boasts that his manifesto has “co-op principles hardwired through it”, with plans to help set up more mutuals, cooperatives and community interest companies in south Yorkshire. “I think I’m possibly the only person who was simultaneously in the parachute regiment and the Co-op party,” he says. “And although there are many differences between those organisations, there is one very strong principle that underpins both and that is the need and importance of working alongside other people. At a point when resource is scarce, we have to think even more carefully about how we pool our resources.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a488916d9683ebf7c9c095cde826d6f4e251c64/180_120_2356_1414/master/2356.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1f2939be610d6e4f54a770aab205755","title":"downing street rules out u turn on customs union pledge","story":"UK will leave single market and customs union, No 10 maintains, as MPs prepare for key debateDowning Street has insisted it will not back down on leaving the customs union, as pro-Brexit MPs signalled their resolve over the issue ahead of a key week for the future of the UK’s relations with Europe.Peers voted last week in favour of an amendment in favour of staying in the customs union, meaning MPs will have an opportunity to debate the idea on Thursday.But No 10 rejected the idea of any backsliding. “The position remains very clear: we don’t think staying in a customs union is the right thing to do and it isn’t government policy to do so,” a Downing Street source said.Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, reiterated the point on BBC1’s Breakfast on Monday. “Theresa May’s position on this has been very, very clear,” he said. “She has said that we are not going to be part of the customs union or any customs union. That position hasn’t changed and Downing Street have been clear about that this morning.”Government hopes of avoiding a hard border in Ireland either through technological innovation or regulatory alignment have been set back after they were rejected during preliminary negotiations in Brussels.That has led to speculation that May is preparing to concede on a customs union, which has been a red line since the prime minister’s conference speech in October 2016.John Redwood, the strongly pro-leave Conservative backbencher, said on Monday he did not feel that No 10’s reiteration of the plan to leave any form of customs union had been necessary.“I don’t think I needed reassuring,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “I’ve heard many times the prime minister say that it is our policy to leave the single market and customs union.“More importantly, on a three-line whip, we have twice now had formal, important votes in the House of Commons on this, and the House of Commons voted on both occasions by a big margin that we should leave the single market and the customs union.”Asked if the prime minister might shift her policy, Redwood said: “Theresa May won’t change her mind, I assume, because she’s been crystal clear on this throughout, and the Conservative manifesto was quite clear on this, and we need to stick to our word.”Reports over the weekend suggested a “wargaming” exercise into the consequences of a concession showed that not even leading Brexiters such as Michael Gove, the environment secretary, or Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, would resign.But a source close to Gove reiterated his opposition, saying: “Michael believes respecting the referendum result means taking back control of trade policy. He fully supports the prime minister’s position that this means leaving the customs union.”Although the dropping of other pledges in negotiations have been reluctantly accepted, such as the promise to reclaim control over fishing quotas from March 2019, accepting continued membership of a customs union would be of a different and much larger scale.Any customs union makes it effectively impossible to negotiate free trade deals with other countries – one of the government’s key ambitions and a central justification for leaving the EU. A meaningful vote on remaining in the customs union is likely in the next few months. At least 10 Conservative backbenchers have signed an amendment to the trade and customs bill supporting continued membership.The former cabinet minister Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury committee, is one of the 12 select committee chairs who are backing that policy in the Commons debate on Thursday. She warned against Brexiter threats of a leadership challenge on the issue. “This sabre-rattling is not coming from the section of the party that I represent. It is coming from the pro-Brexit section of the party and is deeply unhelpful,” she said. Thursday’s debate, Morgan said, would be an opportunity for a calm debate about the reality of leaving the customs union based on the evidence that select committees were hearing as they investigated its potential impact. “If every time we debate these issues or pass an amendment all we end up with is this hysteria and leadership speculation, that is not in Britain’s interest,” she said.“The majority of the party would not entertain a leadership contest at the moment and those who want to ... should think very carefully if they really want to intervene in the negotiations in the way a leadership contest would.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36bd24e635702135cb8c7710ba63667c6ea8de74/0_193_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de0f6bdb31e4fed37ff618f72731c321","title":"labour promises four more bank holidays if it wins general election","story":"Jeremy Corbyn says workers deserve more time off after years of ‘damaging Tory austerity’ Labour will introduce new bank holidays to mark the patron saints of England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland if it wins the next general election, Jeremy Corbyn is to announce.The party leader will tell a union conference on Monday, which is St George’s Day, that Britain’s workers deserve a day off after eight years of “damaging Tory austerity”.Labour will ask for the support of the devolved governments so that the same four holidays can be enjoyed across the United Kingdom.Under Labour’s proposals, UK-wide public holidays would be held on St David’s Day (1 March), St Patrick’s Day (17 March), St George’s Day (23 April) and St Andrew’s Day (30 November).With eight public holidays, the UK has the fewest of any G20 or EU country, Corbyn will tell the annual conference of the Communication Workers Union in Bournemouth.He will say: “If we win the next election, St George’s Day will become a national holiday for Britain’s workers. It will be a day where we can all show our pride and celebrate our country’s tradition of fairness, inclusivity and social justice.“Eight years of Tory austerity, which Labour will bring to an end, have had a disastrous effect on our vital public services and workers have paid a heavy price in the cost of living and their working lives. We will give our workers four extra days’ paid holiday.”Corbyn said the Windrush scandal and the “sickening ‘go home vans” showed that the government’s “patriotic posturing” was a sham.He will add: “We need to end the Conservatives’ constant pandering to a rich elite at the top and their attempts to ide the rest of us, creating a ‘hostile environment’ for people who come to contribute to our country.“So let me say to the Windrush generation and to everyone who has come to this country to make a contribution: you are welcome. You have equal rights and under Labour you will never be treated like second-class citizens. We will never allow people to be ided on the basis of race or religion.”Corbyn will also recommit Labour to bring Royal Mail into public ownership.

This is not right, nor fair.“These measures will ensure thousands of children affected by their parent’s alcohol dependency have access to the support they need and deserve.”Hunt paid tribute to Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, who had previously spoken of an upbringing in which his father would fall over drunk at the school gates. In an interview with the  in 2016, Ashworth also described how he would return home to a fridge stacked with cheap alcohol and no food. “Some things matter much more than politics, and I have been moved by my Labour counterpart Jon Ashworth’s bravery in speaking out so honestly about life as the child of an alcoholic,” Hunt said. The programme will include rapid access to mental health services and support for children and their families where there is a dependent drinker funding to identify and support at-risk children more quickly and early intervention programmes to reduce the numbers of children needing to go into care.The government has also appointed Steve Brine as a dedicated minister for children with alcohol-dependent parents.Research shows that children of alcoholics are twice as likely to have problems at school, three times as likely to consider suicide and five times more likely to develop an eating disorder. More than a third of all serious case reviews for children involve a history of parental alcohol abuse.The Labour MP Liam Byrne, the founder and chair of the cross-party group in parliament for children of alcoholics, welcomed the measures.‘We know as children of alcoholics that we can’t change things for parents, but we can change things for our country’s kids,” he said. “This is a huge step forward for Britain’s innocent victims of booze, the kids of parents who drink too much and end up scarred for life.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd688030dcbdf101935c3cf65084e9a67242deaf/0_268_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c21bda144df30acfebfd6de647df5fbb","title":"ministers urged to ban fast food outlets from opening near schools","story":"Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health says councils need increased powers to help combat childhood obesityFast food outlets should be banned from opening 400 metres from schools in England, according to leading child doctors. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health urged the government to introduce the measure as part of its updated childhood obesity strategy, published this summer.The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has suggested a ban on any new fast food outlets being built within such distance and the college called for this to be extended across the UK.Prof Russell Viner, president of the college, said ministers should “take a leap of faith” and introduce the measures to make it easier for councils to keep junk food away from students.In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, he said: “Kids are coming out of school hungry and finding themselves surrounded by cheap chicken shops, chip shops and other types of junk food. This just wasn’t the case 20 or 30 years ago.“People tend to eat what’s in front of them and we need to make it easier for children to make the right choices.”Viner said local authorities needed increased powers to make it easier to bring in such bans. A number of councils have introduced these measures, but others said they faced too much red tape.It comes as data shows that almost a third of children aged 2 to 15 are overweight or obese and younger generations are becoming obese at earlier ages and staying obese for longer.In May, the Commons health and social care committee will open hearings for an inquiry on childhood obesity, examining areas that they should take action. The college also proposed that there be a national programme to weigh and measure children from birth through to their teenage years. It called for GPs to be given training in how to talk to parents about children who gain weight.He added: “We have to take a leap of faith to protect current and future generations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/644aead20671a4bf86da012a1325aa547faa1483/178_490_4943_2966/master/4943.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de3fbc6c0b165766dbf21c71ebfe6ac2","title":"tagging domestic abusers is not enough say campaigners","story":"Satellite trackers and offender register would be more effective, government toldElectronically tagging domestic abusers who are subject to restraining orders would not go far enough to protect victims, campaigners have warned.The tagging proposal is part of a wide-ranging consultation on measures to be included in the government’s draft domestic abuse bill launched by Theresa May last month.As part of its response to the consultation, the Victims’ Rights Campaign, along with Plaid Cymru, have suggested fitting perpetrators with satellite trackers, which would alert their victims if they were nearby, as an alternative to tagging. If risk was deemed to be high, the police could also be automatically alerted.Harry Fletcher, director of the Victims’ Rights Campaign, said: “Our proposals are about improving safety and public confidence, and allowing victims of domestic abuse and stalking to live their lives without fear. “Manufacturers have told us that they could develop these simple devices and it is important that the government takes these ideas on board and gives them serious consideration.”Safety had to take priority over cost, he added. “Indeed, if safety was paramount it would reduce health costs.”Under the government’s proposals, offenders would wear a device that transmitted a signal to a call centre, which in turn would register a breach if the device was tampered with, or offenders left their home. “The evidence is overwhelming that tagging and house arrests have no impact on crime,” Fletcher added. “In fact, they could make it worse and put women in real danger of further abuse if the perpetrator is living with the victim.”In addition to satellite trackers, Plaid Cymru and the Victims’ Rights Campaign, who successfully lobbied to create a new offence of coercive control in 2015, have also called for a domestic violence offender register to be introduced.They also want improved data collection on instances of domestic abuse and for perpetrators released from prison to undertake preventive programmes as a condition of parole.Plaid Cymru’s justice and home affairs spokeswoman, Liz Saville Roberts, said: “We know that manufacturers could develop simple devices based on transmitters and receivers that could provide a vital extra layer of security for victims and genuinely reduce the incidents of reoffending by convicted stalkers and abusers. “A victim would carry a receiver and be alerted if their abuser were to enter a court-imposed exclusion zone, with the police also receiving an alert in high-risk incidences. “Above all, it would give the victim an increased sense of safety and confidence – something that is taken for granted by most of us but is severely lacking amongst some victims of abuse.”Other proposals put out to consultation include banning domestic abuse suspects from contacting their victims, drinking alcohol or taking drugs.The tagging would come under a new domestic abuse protection civil order, breaches of which would be punishable as a criminal offence. Ministers say the civil orders are designed as an early intervention measure to shield victims from further abuse from unconvicted suspects.The bill would include a new statutory definition of abuse that for the first time recognises economic abuse. This would include forcing someone to take out loans, withholding access to wages or bank accounts, food, clothing or transport.The government consultation paper also includes proposals to create a domestic abuse commissioner, tougher sentences for domestic abuse cases involving children, and special measures for victims in court including testifying behind screens or by video link so they do not have contact with their abusers.

With many young people eschewing alcohol, the beginning of the end of booze Britain is in sightA cool glass of sauvignon canalside in the summer. A soothing beer by a pub fire as the leaves turn red. Mulled wine with a Christmas mince pie. Alcohol is shot through British life like, well, shots on a night out. But recent trends suggest that might be changing. Could the British love of booze be drying up as surely as our passion for\u0026nbspcigarettes?The result was immediate: fag breaks at work were suddenly more frowned upon the huddle of people outside the pub failing to light a cigarette in the driving rain came to seem pitiful. All the incremental changes – the health warnings, legislation, the images of diseased lungs on fag packets, the association with impotence – led to a genuine cultural shift. If you wanted to keep smoking, you had to be really committed (addicted, maybe?). Social and fairweather smokers dropped away.Could the same trend be under way with our attitude to alcohol? Some experts believe so. It will be a huge shift, because drinking in the UK has a spirited history, stretching back thousands of years – jugs for fermenting alcohol go back to the stone age, past Hogarth’s Beer Street and Gin Lane in the 1700s through to the peak modern drinking period of the 90s and early 00s. This was the Britpop era: a wasted Jarvis Cocker mooning at Michael Jackson at the Brit awards in 1996 and the hideous proliferation of garish alcopops with brand names with no vowels. That period also saw\u0026nbspa breakdown in the social taboos around women’s drinking that led to\u0026nbspan explosion of alcohol being marketed to them. Witness the birth\u0026nbspof the ladette and girlfriends drinking boyfriends under the table. Witness a massive overall rise in consumption.As a society, we have always thought of drinking as a bit naughty. The language we use is telling. A “cheeky pint” after work a “swift half” “OK, but just one glass of merlot”. Everyone has feigned resistance at one time or another – but we don’t try very hard. And in recent decades, anyone who didn’t want to drink was considered an anomaly. You driving? You sick? You on antibiotics? You pregnant? You, you know … (whisper it) in recovery? An answer of none of the above would elicit raised eyebrows, a puzzled expression or, more likely, mirth. Possibly even anger or dislike. In years past, people who have chosen sobriety, or rarely had a drink, have been subject to intense peer pressure. Nondrinkers became isolated – not out of preference, but because British social life has been entirely organised around alcohol. Booze sat at the head of the table at dinner parties, dominated the dancefloor and landed deals at lunch meetings.But over the past decade, that culture has shifted. It has certainly been difficult to avoid the news that alcohol isn’t good for you. The most recent reminder came last week, care of a Lancet paper, reporting that every glass of wine or pint of beer over the daily recommended limit will cut half an hour from the expected life of a 40-year-old. And that recommended upper safe limit is lower than you might expect. The paper suggested five 175ml glasses of\u0026nbspwine or five pints a week – about 12.5 units in total. Overdo it, and you\u0026nbspare at greater risk of stroke, fatal\u0026nbspaneurysm, heart failure and early death.Then there’s the cancer risk. There was consternation in 2016 when Prof Dame Sally Davies, the government’s chief medical officer, told MPs just one glass of wine could increase the risk of breast cancer. This came just a few weeks after the recommended upper safe limit for men was revised down from 21 to 14 units a week, the same as for women.The quality newspapers interview health experts and sociologists about the problems with alcohol the popular press shames indulgent punters (usually northern, often women) on dark high streets, hitting the chip shops at 3am. That picture of the woman lying on her back on a bench, sozzled, gets wheeled out. And there have been all sorts of schemes and campaigns designed to curb our enthusiasm for drinking. There’s the Department of Transport’s road-safety Think! campaign, for instance, much of which has focused on drink driving. In 2012, Andrew Lansley and the Department for Health rolled out the Change4Life campaign, while Challenge 25, introduced in 2005 by the British Beer and Pub Association, encourages people who may look under 25 to carry ID when attempting to purchase alcohol, and encourages retailers to ask for it. This has made it harder for groups of teenagers to bulk buy supermarket-own tinnies. (Attempting to enter licensed premises to buy alcohol using a fake ID is a criminal offence, carrying a maximum £5,000 fine and up to 10 years imprisonment.)All of this legislation, campaigning and awareness raising has had an impact, just as they did on tobacco consumption. In particular, millennials (those born between 1981 and 1996) and the later Generation Z (those born after 1996), are surprisingly sober.“Alcohol is a strange concept,” says Ben Gartside, 19, a politics student at Hull University who is originally from Manchester. “Here’s a liquid you can drink and it can lead to you not remembering the night before and making bad decisions.” Ben is typical of many young people I speak to, in that he prefers to spend his money on food and travel rather than pub sessions.Another young person I speak to says his family are heavy drinkers and he wanted to avoid falling into that pattern. In a broader sense, says Dr James Nicholls, director of research and policy development at Alcohol Research UK, this is quite common among young people they are rebelling against older generations’ chosen methods of rebellion. According to a 2017 ONS study, more than a quarter of 16- to 24-year-olds are teetotal, a four-fold increase on the rest of the population, with just one in 10 seeing drinking as “cool”. Nicholls says that drinking among young people has been declining for a decade.The millennials and Gen Zers I spoke to cited various reasons for their sobriety one of the most recurrent was that between university tuition fees, the axing of maintenance grants and the sixth form EMA grant, and the perilously high cost of housing, they are pretty much broke. But they also have concerns for their mental and physical health. Lauren Clapp, 23, says booze made her chronic fatigue syndrome worse. There is also a case to be made that young people, who suffer disproportionately with mental health issues (a third of 16- to 24-year-olds have experienced a mental health issue in the past 12 months, according to one survey), are more open to talk and seek support, relying less on substances as an emotional crutch.But not everyone is laying off, even with the growing awareness of alcohol’s negative side effects. There are plenty of people who hold out for those articles proposing that red wine is good for blood pressure and cling to the glamorous champagne habits of celebrities. Drinking among the middle-aged middle classes has not declined. In fact, while some of them might feel smug to have left their binge-drinking pasts behind, their regular daily consumption might be doing more damage to their bodies, not less. In 2015, Age Concern found that higher-income groups are “endangering” their health with their drinking habits. Figures show that mortality rates due to alcohol, among people aged 75 and over, have risen to their highest level since\u0026nbsprecords began in 1991.In fact, alcohol consumption is rising among the over-50s. This is a looming crisis for the NHS, health experts warn, as alcohol contributes to diseases such as Alzheimer’s, as well as a litany of cancers.But the fact is that those who are currently middle-aged may prove to\u0026nbspbe the last generation who of boozehounds. Just as young people are changing the worlds\u0026nbspof politics, technology and environmentalism, it is possible that this shift in the British attitude to alcohol will last the course. And further legislation and awareness is planned for the future. Next month, minimum alcohol unit pricing comes into force in Scotland.We are not alone in this cultural shift. While many countries, particularly our European cousins, have long had a mature attitude to drinking, Nicholls says that declining interest in alcohol, especially among\u0026nbspyoung people, is a worldwide trend. This is true even of countries that used to be big on the booze, such as Russia.We don’t know for sure, of course, that Britain will become a dry land in\u0026nbspyears to come – alcohol trends peak and trough, but it has never looked more likely than it does now. Drinks on me, then – it’s going to be a\u0026nbspcheap round."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b08bd09c5090aecd6c84c7243dacd2ef15cdf957/0_39_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5adcb0a106c679efda4176c15d999b4","title":"eliud kipchoge london marathon mo farah british record","story":"On the hottest day in London Marathon history it took Eliud Kipchoge 24 hard miles to neutralise a field laced with venom and great expectations. Yet deep down the Kenyan’s victory, his third here, merely confirmed what most spectators already knew: he is the finest 26.2-miler of all time. A much greater surprise was to be found further down The Mall, where Mo Farah was holding on for third in a British record of 2hr 6min 21sec.True, it was still two minutes behind Kipchoge, who glided home in 2:04:17 – a staggering feat on a day where temperatures topped 24C, a race record by two degrees. Yet Farah’s performance showed that the doubters, who suspected he was running London solely for one last massive payday before hanging up his Nike Vaporfly Elites, were wide of the mark.“I really enjoyed it - even though over the last 10km I was bollocksed,” said Farah, delighted at tasting sweet redemption after flopping in his first marathon attempt in 2014. “To run a personal best, break the British record and finish on the podium. It can’t get better than that.”The 35-year-old ides opinion as few other British sportsmen. Yet remarkably he now holds national records over 1500m, 3,000m, 5,000m, 10,000m, the half-marathon and the marathon. Those performances inspire awe in some quarters and suspicion in others – given that his former coach Alberto Salazar, who turned him into a world-beater, remains under investigation by the US Anti-Doping Agency.But whatever one’s view, Farah’s belief he could be a marathon medal contender at next year’s world championships and at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo no longer appears outlandish – especially given he was able to handle a devilishly fast pace and stick with Kipchoge until 18 miles before his legs and spirit finally began to buckle.“If I can run 2hr 06min in a major championship, it shows I can be competitive,” Farah said. “I’ve beaten some good runners. I’m satisfied. I fought as much as I could.”The race began with a collective moment of madness, as the field rushed through the first mile in an astonishing 4min 22sec. Farah had intended to attach himself to a slower group, with the aim of reaching halfway in 61min\u0026nbsp45sec. Instead he realised that, because everyone else was going with Kipchoge, who reached 13.1 miles in 61 minutes flat, he had to do so as well.That was not the only thing to throw him. Farah’s coach, Gary Lough, had prepared his drinks bottles with a highly potent carbohydrate solution. Yet at the 10km mark Farah picked up the wrong bottle, leaving him to remonstrate with one of the support crew when they pulled up on a motorbike beside him.“I was table four but the staff was trying to take pictures and I was trying to take a drink,” Farah said. “Me and the other athlete from Ethiopia had the exact same bottle and were on the same table, too. So I was telling the people: ‘Can you please just tell us which one is our drink because it’s exactly the same bottle.’”To make matters worse Farah then picked up and dropped his bottle at 20km, losing more valuable metres. Perhaps it should not have been a surprise for while Farah was back on familiar turf, close to the scene of his Olympic 5,000m and 10,000m triumphs at London 2012, the marathon is still largely alien territory. As Paula Radcliffe pointed out, Farah could have avoided the problem by making his drinks bottle more distinctive.Despite his lack of bottle, Farah was still in contention and even moved up to Kipchoge’s shoulder after 18 miles. But it was the briefest of mirages. Soon he was slipping back, leaving the 21-year-old Ethiopian Tola Kitata and Kipchoge to duke it out in front, with the latter finally breaking clear near the end to win by 32 seconds.“I was a little bit worried,” a smiling Kipchoge said. “But I said it would be a beautiful race and it was.”Farah noted with regret that he had run his first half too quickly, in 61 minutes, before coming home in 65. And while he insisted afterwards that he was still learning, he also knows Kipchoge runs in a different stratosphere.“Eliud is a great athlete,” he said. “He makes it look so easy. I came across at 30km, absolutely knackered at that point, and he just changed gear and kicked on. But could you have got a better field? I beat Kenenisa Bekele, Daniel Wanjuri, so many good guys. I will take time to improve, as I took my time to win medals on the track.”Kipchoge, meanwhile, calmly celebrated his 10th victory in 11 marathons - unprecedented in such a gruelling event where so many things can go wrong - as if nothing could have been easier. At his training camp in Kenya, where he takes his turn to clean out the toilets, they call him the “boss man”. In London, he again proved master of his domain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ed60fce59f6d7b5f8ea9b9e19f5cfa87e5d22c6/34_99_4283_2570/master/4283.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abcce2e81f612ccbd0608cec2d9a56b4","title":"kendal lake district locals guide 10 top tips walking cycling","story":"The Lakes’ southern gateway opens up fantastic hiking, cycling and running routes and plenty of spots to savour the views and refuel, says the director of Kendal Mountain FestivalKendal is a vibrant, growing town of almost 30,000 people in South Lakeland and is also a gateway to the Lake District national park – itself a Unesco world heritage site. The town, eight miles south-east of Windermere, is listed in the Doomesday book but while there is history to explore, it is the opportunity to experience great landscapes and outdoor pursuits that best sum up its many natural wonders.Kendal and South Lakeland attract road and mountain bike enthusiasts, due to the beautiful and challenging terrain. For road cyclists, there are great short routes such as Kendal to Grange-over-Sands or Windermere, both 15 miles or less. The scenery is captivating and there’s the option of a train ride back to Kendal, too. Road bikers who want to clock up the miles can try routes across the Lakes or into the Yorkshire Dales. And for the fit, and competitive, there’s the annual Fred Whitton Challenge (13 May), with its 112-mile Lakeland circuit featuring the one-in-three slopes of Hardknott Pass. Recommended for mountain bikers are the Grizedale or Whinlatter trail centres where there is something for all abilities: singletrack or trail riding, along with bike hire, parking and cafe facilities.With views over the Winster valley and four miles from Whitbarrow national nature reserve, this inn, which dates back to the 16th century, is the perfect pitstop.

The technique has been compared to the clear-cutting of forests because the heavy doors – some of which weigh several tonnes and are marketed as canyonbusters – scrape the tops off of seamounts and rugged terrain.Determined to challenge this, Nouvian switched from journalism to activism, founded the Bloom Association  in 2005, and began a campaign that recently resulted in a major policy shift by the European Union.She describes her strategy as an application of investigative journalism. She first identified the problem, honed in on the causes, interviewed the major players and then sieved through reams of data to expose the ecological and economic flaws of the business.“Deep-sea bottom trawling applies the most destructive fishing to the most fragile ecosystem,” Nouvian told the  in an interview ahead of the Goldman award ceremony. “The seafloor has intricate features that form over years, like cities. Bottom trawling wipes it out.”Nouvian initially focused attention on a fishing fleet owned by Intermarché, a French supermarket chain. Her association sifted through years of corporate accounts and discovered that the fleet was chronically unprofitable even with public subsidies. In partnership with other NGOs, they also canvassed former fishing communities in France and the UK to see how fishing port communities were being ruined by industrial trawling.This was followed by a petition calling on the government to ban a practice that was environmentally destructive and economically unviable. With the help of a viral cartoon on the subject by acclaimed French illustrator Pénélope Bagieu, more than 900,000 people signed up, forcing first Intermarché, then the French and UK governments, then the European parliament and council to agree on restrictions. From June 2016, European fleets have been banned from bottom trawling at depths of more than 800m.Nouvian is now targeting pulse fishing, which uses electric currents to stun fish or induce spasms that force sole and plaice from the sediment.“This is terrifying. If we electrocute fish, we also electrocute eggs and everything else. All life in a certain space is wiped out. It sounds like science fiction, but it is real.”Under pressure from Bloom, other NGOs and small-scale fishermen’s groups, the European parliament voted to prohibit pulse fishing inside EU waters earlier this year.But she says it continues on a wide scale because the European commission is failing to enforce regulations while the EU institutions make a final ruling on whether pulse fishing should be prohibited.Nouvian has called on supermarkets to refuse to stock electric-caught fish but so far in the UK only Waitrose, Co-op and Morrisons have agreed, while Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Marks and Spencers have not replied. French retailers – who have learned not to cross this formidable campaigner – have been more responsive.The prize-winner – who complains there is only 20 hours to work in a day – is also working to ban shark-finning in Asia and lobbying the World Trade Organisation and governments around the world to end subsidies for destructive industrial fishing and to give more support to small-scale fishing communities.“There are way too many big fishing vessels and they are kept afloat with public subsidies. But there are fewer fish so they have to go further, enter deeper waters and take more types of fish,” she said. “We have the means to wipe out other species and us with it, but just because we can it does not mean we have to.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f61f2e289b7d2cf7545586d8a536841bdd04292c/0_199_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=619420573cc8c175b89363ce0adb124e","title":"shutdown of pakistani tv network hints at armys bid for control","story":"Geo concedes to military pressure after going off air for two weeks and agrees to self-censor“First we used to have missing persons, now we have missing TV channels,” said Babar Sattar, a lawyer who regularly appears as an analyst on Geo, referring to the hundreds of Pakistanis whose disappearance has been linked to security services over the years. “Just like with missing persons, everyone knows who the culprit is but saying it out loud would get you into even more trouble.”Earlier this month, Sattar announced that The News, a daily newspaper owned by Jang Group, the same media house that owns Geo, would not be publishing his column because it was “ordered not to touch sensitive topics”. A few days later, another popular columnist, Mosharraf Zaidi wrote that for the first time in over a decade, The News had refused to publish him too.Both had written about a protest movement led by thousands of ethnic Pashtuns from the tribal areas against decades of military operations and abductions by security forces. Pakistan’s all-powerful army chief has called the movement, now in its third month, “engineered” – a veiled reference to the country’s arch rivals India and Afghanistan – while a majority of local media have not covered its rallies. Many TV channels and newspapers are choosing to self-censor content critical of the military in what journalists, rights activists and analysts see as the army’s most powerful and sophisticated push in decades, in an attempt to suppress freedom of expression and manipulate public opinion before July’s general election.“Given that the military retains a tight grip over cable networks in most districts, all fingers point unambiguously to its shady involvement,” said Dr Farzana Shaikh, an Asia-Pacific fellow at Chatham House. “The latest moves suggest that the military intends to act decisively to regain the initiative and control the narrative in the run-up to general elections.”The “narrative” the army ostensibly wants to block involves a vitriolic and very public campaign by ousted Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif accusing the military and the judiciary of jointly working against him. Sharif was removed from office in July 2017 in a unanimous supreme court verdict over corruption allegations, and has for decades had a tense relationship with the country’s powerful military. In recent days, he has travelled around Pakistan addressing rallies and criticising the military and the judiciary for micromanaging politics to keep his party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), from retaining a parliamentary majority.Geo did not shy from covering Sharif’s accusations in its daily bulletins and primetime talk shows. And in mid-February, it was quietly taken off the air in army-administered residential areas and cantonments. However, the big blow came on 30 March, when all Geo news, entertainment and sports channels were blocked by cable operators in most of the country.The channels remained off air for over two weeks and only slowly began to reappear on screens last week after what Geo executives describe as “marathon meetings” with top military officials, including the head of the military’s media wing, in which Geo agreed to cease favourable coverage of Sharif and censor any criticism of the army.“We won’t completely toe the army line but we will have to self-censor in order to survive,” one executive told the , requesting anonymity as he did not want to jeopardise the negotiations. “Our coverage of Nawaz Sharif will have to be tweaked.”The army’s media wing did not respond to calls for comment about the meetings.“We are being blacked out perhaps because we push a narrative of free and fair elections, of bolstering democratically elected governments, of pointing out the mistakes and transgressions of various institutions, and that doesn’t go down well,” Geo president Imran Aslam said in an interview. He declined to comment on the negotiations with the military but added that the channels had remained off air for weeks despite the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority repeatedly instructing cable operators to restore it and the chief justice calling the blockade a constitutional violation.“So who has the power?” Aslam asked. In Pakistan, the military establishment has for decades exerted great influence over courts, media, and politics. It has also been accused of acting with impunity against suspected militants, dissidents and journalists, using intimidation, torture and even extrajudicial killings. The military denies these accusations.The army has a particularly tense history with Geo. The network was first ordered to shut by former president Pervez Musharraf in 2007, when it refused to abide by a new media code. In 2014, cable television providers were ordered by the defence ministry and military to drop Geo from their lineup after it aired allegations that the head of the army’s intelligence wing was behind the assassination attempt against its star anchor, Hamid Mir. Academic and columnist Umair Javed said it did not portend well for media freedom or democracy that Pakistan was “heading into an election where the largest political party in the country believes it is being systematically targeted, and the biggest media house is facing a suppression campaign.”“Pakistan is being pushed into another season of silence and we will all wake up to dangerous consequences,” Aslam said. “If people don’t like Geo, they can change the channel but once you take the remote away, next you’ll take their vote away.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb6309aa2eb6fbc997ddc586a3323976d22175a8/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90b343a6d2cbec2d368902d14eaff52a","title":"sprinkling sand save arctic shrinking sea ice","story":"Arctic Dispatches, part 3: A pilot project at a lake in northern Alaska is one of a number aiming to slow climate change with geoengineering – but some worry about unintended consequencesAs a test location for a project that aims to ensure the livability of Earth, a frozen lake near the northern tip of Alaska could seem rather inauspicious.While the North Meadow Lake near Utqiaġvik, formerly known as Barrow, may be relatively nondescript, it will be the staging ground this month for an ambitious attempt to safeguard the Arctic’s rapidly diminishing sea ice and stave off the most punishing effects of global warming.Tiny spheres of reflective sand will be sprinkled upon the lake to see if this can prevent the lake ice from melting or slow the process down. Should testing prove successful, the project, called Ice911, has the grand vision of slathering around 19,000 sq miles of sea ice – equivalent to the size of Costa Rica – with trillions of sand grains in order to stem the loss of ice cover and prevent runaway climate change.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can follow up with our Further Reading guides and can also recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@the.com“The ice in the Arctic isn’t going to come back by itself,” said Leslie Field, founder of Ice911. “And we don’t have much time left.”Field, a Silicon Valley engineer and researcher who worked for Chevron and HP, said she was inspired to intervene in the Arctic after seeing Al Gore’s climate change parable An Inconvenient Truth in 2006. “It hit me like a train,” she said. “The importance of the Arctic just leapt out to me.“I looked at it and thought: ‘What if this is a materials problem?’ You go through the list of things that aren’t adding pollution or foods to the environment and it’s a fairly short list. I’ve been through a few options and this one has legs.”For the past decade, Field has been testing out various materials that might provide a protective barrier to the winnowing sea ice, conducting tests in barrels of water in laboratories, on lakes in California and Canada, on a pond in Minnesota. Testing is now set to take place in the tundra of the Alaskan Arctic, near a research station where scientists generally observe changes in sea ice, rather than attempt to halt or reverse them. Scientists flock to Utqiaġvik to survey seabirds or gather data from boreholes in the tundra – there are about 80 beds in austere cabins at the Barrow Arctic Research Center and all will be full this summer.“Leslie is kind of a one-off,” said Nagruk Harcharek, a senior official at the Ukpeaġvik Iñupiat Corporation, which operates the research centre. “I think her dream is to go pretty big time. Whether that’s realistic and is going to save the world, I don’t know.”In March, the National Snow and Ice Data Center reported that the Arctic had reached a seasonal maximum of 5.59m sq miles – the second-lowest peak extent in the 39-year satellite record. Scientists forecast that Arctic sea ice could completely vanish in summertime by the 2040s. The cost and logistics are daunting, however. It’s unclear how the sand grains will be distributed, although Field prefers the idea of ship-based deployment rather than using aircraft. Field isn’t targeting the whole Arctic region – instead focusing on areas such as Fram Strait, between Greenland and the Norwegian island of Svalbard – but the cost to festoon 19,000 sq miles of ice in silica would still be around $750m, not including labour.The continual funding for such an effort will have to come from private donors, or the UN, or perhaps the World Bank. That, too, isn’t certain as yet, despite a “large-scale launch” of ice covering earmarked for 2020.The world may have warmed by around 1C (1.8F) over the past century but the Arctic far outstrips this global average and is warming at around twice the rate of the rest of the world.In places, the rate of warming has been astonishing. Novembers in the Alaskan town of Utqiaġvik, formerly Barrow, are now 5.5C warmer than they were in 1979. This past winter, the warmest on record in the Arctic, saw some locations exceed 20C hotter than normal.These “rapid and dramatic changes” are introducing a “new normal” to the Arctic, according to US government scientists in a report card last year. Storms are eroding away ice-free coastlines, summer wildfires are becoming fiercer and certain species, such as polar bears, are increasingly struggling to find food. This is all providing a major challenge to communities in the Arctic, but a boon to the shipping industry, which can navigate the area more easily. This task will get even simpler once the Arctic is ice free in summertimes, forecast as soon as 2040s.“It’s not chump change, but compared to other options it’s cost effective,” she said. “It’s a matter of trying to prevent the horrific list of things, such as sea level rise, storms and so on, that will come from climate change. Things that will cost us trillions, not billions.”Ice911 isn’t the only direct environmental intervention, known as geoengineering, plotted for the Arctic. A team of scientists at Arizona State University want to add an extra metre of sea ice to the Arctic’s current thickness by spending $500bn on a network of 10m wind-powered pumps that would be used to push seawater on to the surface of the ice where it would freeze.“Our only strategy at present seems to be to tell people to stop burning fossil fuels,” lead physicist Steven Desch said last year. “It’s a good idea but it is going to need a lot more than that to stop the Arctic’s sea ice from disappearing.”In the Paris climate accords, world governments agreed to a 2C warming limit. Most plausible forecasts concede this won’t be possible with emissions reductions and renewable energy ramp-ups alone. Some sort of technology that captures carbon or removes it directly from the atmosphere will be needed. No such viable technology exists at any sort of scale, but a number of geoengineering projects of various hues (Field calls her option “soft” or “eco” geoengineering) have in recent years jostled to forge a breakthrough. There is the plan to use 16tn miniature robots to deflect the sun’s heat away from Earth or the project to pump aerosols into clouds in order to “brighten” them and bolster their reflective power. Another scheme, devised by the scientist who developed Australia’s polymer bank notes, is trialling a thin “sun shield” to be placed over parts of the Great Barrier Reef, which has recently suffered from severe coral bleaching. A separate project, led by the Harvard physicist David Keith, plans to head to Tuscon, Arizona, this year to launch the “StratoCruiser” – a high-altitude balloon equipped with sensors that will spray a mist of molecules such as sulfur dioxide or calcium carbonate into the atmosphere to deflect sunlight and spur cloud formation. Harvard’s solar geoengineering program has received funding from Bill Gates, among other sources.These and other similar projects have faced criticism over potential unintended pollution, as well as the even more hazardous prospect of handing countries a reason to slow down their emissions cuts in favour of a geoengineering panacea that may never arrive.János Pásztor, a former UN assistant secretary general for climate change, recently called for a pause in solar geoengineering so that unforeseen risks could be properly explored. In a speech to Arizona State University, Pásztor singled out Keith’s experiment. “Some time within the next year, we may see the world’s first outdoor experiment on stratospheric aerosol injection take place here in the skies above Arizona, yet for the most part governments are not aware of, nor addressing, the profound governance issues this poses,” he said.“We urgently need an open, inclusive discussion on how the world will research and govern solar geoengineering. Otherwise we could be in danger of events overtaking society’s capacity to respond prudently and effectively.”Some scientists are also wary about interventions to restore Arctic sea ice, broadly following the same precautionary principle that tweaking the composition of an ecosystem can have far-reaching ramifications, such as unleashing the cane toad in Australia or allowing feral hogs to run rampant in Texas. “I think there are good intentions to solve this difficult problem,” said Cecilia Bitz, an Arctic sea ice expert at the University of Washington. “I don’t fault people looking for geoengineering solutions but I believe it will be cheaper and more effective to reduce our emissions.”Bitz said she was “not very optimistic” about Ice911’s plan as it creates “very small particulates that are very dangerous for ecosystems”, despite Field’s assurances that the silica will be harmless to wildlife. “You could put a big sheet on top of the ice instead, I suppose, but that could trap seals,” said Bitz. “The idea of spraying seawater on top of the ice is interesting and potentially effective, but it’s very costly. All of these solutions would be very expensive. We need to mitigate our greenhouse gas emissions, first and foremost.”Even if the silica proves benign to the Arctic environment, keeping a lid on warming in the region could backfire anyway, according to Julienne Stroeve, senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center. “Weather patterns and ocean currents bring excess heat to the poles to balance out the planet, so you might invigorate those warming systems,” she said. “It might all be a bit futile.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3470457.1524435562!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit must not scupper lifesaving cross border treatment","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDonie Cronin from Co Donegal was treated at Altnagelvin hospital in Derry. Photograph: Trevor McBride When Donie Cronin had a heart attack, cross-Border treatment saved his life.A grandfather of seven from Newtowncunningham in Co Donegal, he was among the first patients from the county to receive a life-saving operation in Altnagelvin hospital in Derry under a new cross-Border initiative which began in 2016.Initially Cronin thought he was suffering from indigestion, but drove to Letterkenny hospital when he realised something was wrong.“I was going through a fairly massive heart attack,” he recalls. “I didn’t know this at the time, but they were monitoring and liaising with Altnagelvin, and they said whip him up, this is a guy for us.“In a very short time I was in an ambulance and I had the quickest run up to Derry I ever got.”In half an hour, Cronin was having stents inserted in Derry.“I was extremely lucky, because the doctor said at the time that in my situation Galway or Dublin was too far away.“It was a life or death thing, and there’s no doubt in my mind they did save my life.”Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is internationally regarded as the best available treatment for a major heart attack and is proven to reduce mortality. When patients have a major heart attack – where an artery is completely blocked – the procedure reopens the artery by inserting stents.Time is crucial. The procedure must be done as soon as possible, and in a maximum of two hours from the patient’s first medical contact.This means hospitals must be near population centres – and there must be sufficient numbers of patients and staff to make it viable 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.Primary PCI was introduced in Altnagelvin in 2014, and the hospital began treating cross-Border patients in May 2016 – a month before the Brexit referendum.Consultant cardiologist in Altnagelvin and the clinical lead for cardiology in the Western Health and Social Care Trust – which covers much of counties Derry, Tyrone and Fermanagh – Dr Albert McNeill was one of many on both sides of the border who worked to make it possible.In two years, about 100 heart attack patients from Donegal have been treated in Derry, receiving immediate life-saving surgery they would otherwise be unable to access.“Instead patients would have been given a clot-dissolving drug, that works on about 75 per cent of people and hopefully the patient would be in the good three quarters,” explained Dr McNeill.“After a day or two the patient would have gone to Galway and you would have probably had the same procedure as you would have had in Derry, only two or three days later, the drug having bought them time.“When primary PCI started in Europe maybe 20 years ago I used to say that would be fine if you happened to be walking past the hospital I used to work in in Rotterdam when you had your heart attack, or past Guy’s in London, but it’s not much use if you’re in Limavady or Sion Mills or wherever.“Now our patients are getting the same treatment as they would get anywhere else.“It’s very fulfilling to know that patients from rural parts of Donegal or Fermanagh have access to the same management as if they had a heart attack in Belfast or London.”Setting up the scheme required huge levels of co-ordination.The ambulance services on both sides of the border now transmit ECG readings straight to the cardiology centre at Altnagelvin patients arriving from the Donegal islands by helicopter have helipad and portering staff – and the NI Ambulance Service – ready and waiting for them as soon as they land.In a procedure where time is critical, any delays at the Border could mean the difference between life and death.Dr McNeill cites the example of an ambulance encountering a queue of cars at the border and having to wait for customs checks.“I don’t want to be melodramatic,” stresses Dr McNeill, “but it could be the difference between living and dying.“Even without being that dramatic, if you’re delaying the patient their heart muscle function subsequent to their heart attack would be less good than if they’d had the procedure done earlier.”In such circumstances, Dr McNeill is confident common sense will prevail, and a solution will be worked out.“No matter what happens between London and Brussels and Dublin, there has to be some sort of fast track where people jump the queue and go through.“There is such a body of clinical sense, but there’s also a body of public opinion, public opinion is really supportive of this and in fact many people want us to roll this out and do other heart treatments.“There will have to be political wisdom to say no, we’re not going to have people coming from Buncrana or Ballybofey sitting in a queue waiting for half an hour even if there is a hard border.”Dr McNeill is equally adamant that, whatever the eventual nature of the UK’s exit from the EU, cross-Border treatment will continue.“It is inconceivable that the service would be discontinued,” he says.“It would be a real clinical problem for the people of Donegal, and a real political problem for the Government in the Republic because they’d suddenly be in a situation where once again the Donegal population were disenfranchised.“As clinicians, as health services on both sides of the Border, there’s no way we’re going to sit back and watch something which is a potentially life-saving service be allowed to fall apart.”Eighteen months after his heart attack, Donie Cronin is fully recovered and enjoys spending his time looking after his grandchildren.“It’s very important for people like us, family people, that the older ones get a chance to see the younger ones coming on and that we’re there for them and we can enjoy them in a decent, long-lived way,” he says.“Derry is ours, Altnagelvin is ours, and the co-operation is brilliant and hopefully it will stay.“It’s crucial for Ulster, and I’m saying Ulster in the broader sense of the whole province. It’s a geographical necessity and it’s common sense.“Brexit must not scupper what is a brilliant initiative.” Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orceThank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Dublin City Council issues warning amid delay in decision on \u0026euro10m civic plazaUS president\u0026rsquos refusenik stance on the issue has galvanised action, says EU agency headPoll indicates that young people do not find parents or teachers useful for adviceOrganisation to remind county boards of its neutrality as players voice support for both sidesCommissioner says CAP is seen as an \u0026lsquoobvious target for cuts\u0026rsquo in many EU quartersTaoiseach\u0026rsquos office intervened on National Development Plan following rural criticismGrandparent of two children who were orphaned by the fire is suing county councilGovernment and public service unions to meet to discuss end of two-tier pay systemCompany has \u0026lsquoachieved a major turnaround\u0026rsquo after previously hinting at 2,000 job cutsActivists criticise Government\u0026rsquos failure to engage with public over Hinkley Point CMinister should not regulate media to avoid perceived conflict of interest, union saysDelivery of \u0026lsquoWB Yeats\u0026rsquo ferry from German shipyard \u0026lsquolikely to be delayed\u0026rsquoFianna F\u0026aacuteil leader blames British and Irish governments for Northern Ireland impasse\u0026lsquoDisgraceful\u0026rsquo figures for first three months of the year already above total for 2017#OurFuture says it will argue case for protecting Eighth Amendment in \u0026lsquoconcise, fact-based way\u0026rsquoSociologist takes case after senior position given to academic 20 years her juniorJohn Hearne began tradition of presenting a bowl of shamrock to the White HouseFianna F\u0026aacuteil leader praises former taoiseach\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquotireless work for peace\u0026rsquo in Northern IrelandThank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3470889.1524466940!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"big pay rises may be on the way for newer public servants","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTeachers from the INTO, ASTI and TUI protesting before a Government report on pay equalisation. File photograph: Alan BetsonTens of thousands of staff who entered the public service in recent years on lower pay rates appear likely to receive special increases to allow them to catch up with longer-serving colleagues on foot of new talks between the Government and unions. The Government and public service unions are to meet on Friday to discuss ending the highly controversial two-tier pay system which has seen nearly 60,000 teachers, nurses, civil servants and others recruited since January 2011 receive less pay than those in place before that date.Highly-placed sources said a key element of the talks would be proposals to effectively allow newer entrant staff to “jump” incremental points on their pay scales. This would effectively remove the additional two lower points which were added to the bottom of the scales for newer entrants. The abolition of the two-tier pay system could be worth €3,300 on average to those taken on after 2011.However, any such move could cost the Government about €200 million, a report drawn up by the Department of Public Expenditure last March estimated. A key issue to be determined in the forthcoming talks would be how and over what time the additional points added to the pay scales would be removed. Should, for example, this issue be addressed in one go in 2019 or phased in over a longer period.There are also technical complexities as different grades of staff in the public service have incremental scales of different lengths – teachers, for example, have more than 20 points on their pay scale. The Government’s position has been that while it was prepared to carry out a review of the two-tier pay system under the terms of the most recent public service agreement, actually addressing the issue would have to wait until after the end of 2020 when the current deal expires. However, last Friday public service unions said they wanted the Government to bring forward to next year the provision of increased pay for newer entrants to the public service. Tom Geraghty, joint general secretary of Fórsa, the country’s largest public service union, said the public service staff concerned could not wait until the agreement expired at the end of 2020 “to resolve something so fundamentally unfair”.About 60,000 staff recruited since 2011 – or about 19 per cent of the total public service workforce – are impacted by the two-tier pay system. Removing the additional points on the pay scales for newer entrants would not totally end the two-tier remuneration system. It would not address allowances which were separately removed or reduced for new entrants during the austerity era. Meanwhile, top level management in the Defence Forces believe that an independent review board should be established to examine the totality of remuneration on offer to military personnel, including basic pay and allowances. It is understood to have suggested that military service allowances paid to all personnel should be increased, weekend security duty allowances should be restored and special payments reintroduced to retain key staff such as pilots, air traffic controllers, bomb disposal experts and engineers. This recommendation is expected to be at the heart of a submission prepared by the Defence Forces for the Public Service Pay Commission, which is looking at recruitment and retention difficulties in keys parts of the State sector.It is understood that management of the forces has concluded that the current trend of premature voluntary retirements is not sustainable, and that the rate of staff leaving will not be alleviated solely through the current high rates of recruitment.It is understood that military management has estimated that “based on current premature voluntary retirement rates and assuming the maintenance of the current rate of recruitment of 800 personnel per year, the official establishment strength of the Defence Forces of 9,500 would not be reached until 2031.”Thank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3470357.1524420685!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish ferries confirms up to 10 000 passengers affected by cancellations","story":"Irish Ferries has confirmed that in the region of 5,000-10,000 customers will be affected by cancelled bookings on a new ferry, the delivery of which has been delayed.The company, which continued to make contact with booked passengers on Sunday, said it did not have an exact figure for numbers impacted at this stage.A spokesman for Irish Ferries said that less than 10,000 passengers are impacted by the cancellations. “It is under 10,000, somewhere in the 5,000-10,000 segment,” he told The  on Sunday. In a statement, the company said it cancelled a number of sailings from July 12th-29th as the German shipyard building the new vessel, the WB Yeats, informed Irish Ferries her delivery “is likely to be delayed”. The company emailed affected passengers late on Friday evening stating that while the delay had yet to be “fully confirmed by the shipyard we have, in the interests of minimising the level of potential disruption to you, taken the decision to cancel your sailing”. The company is contacting affected customers to offer alternative space on the MV Oscar Wilde for times close to their booked sailing dates. It said in the absence of an acceptable alternative, customers will be entitled to a full refund. “The schedules don’t actually overlap each other so everybody is going to be inconvenienced regrettably.“There is reservation staff working throughout the day and throughout the rest of the week. Our ambition is to facilitate every single customer according to their wishes. It is an ongoing process.” The spokesman also denied claims that have appeared on social media that the company continued to take bookings knowing the building of the ship would be delayed. “Nobody can say we took bookings knowing that there was going to be a delay. It doesn’t make sense to do that,” he said. “We did not delay at all in notifying passengers. Once we knew for sure the delay was likely, we informed customers.”Impacted customers have also been offered a €150 voucher by the company, for sailings next summer. “Notwithstanding the extraordinary nature of the delay in the delivery of the ship to us, which is outside of our control, we do really value your support and would like to offer you a goodwill gesture of a €150 electronic voucher off an Ireland-France trip for next year,” email correspondence to customers said. Once delivered, the new ferry will have space for 1,885 passengers and crew, 435 cabins and nearly 3km of car deck space. It will do three return journeys each week. The €147 million ferry was due to start servicing routes from Ireland to France and the UK in July and will be the largest and most luxurious vessel to shuttle passengers to and from Irish ports.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Taoiseach’s office intervened shortly before the National Development Plan was published to boost the prominence of regional developments, such as a university for the southeast.There had been criticism in the weeks prior to the plan’s publication from backbench TDs and some Ministers that major cities were being prioritised over regional areas. “Could suggest it as a possible Irish campus of the new European University being contemplated.”The final version of the plan included a stand-alone section on a new “technological university for the southeast”, to be formed from the merger of Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT) and the Institute of Technology Carlow. It also contains a reference to it participating in a network of European universities.This is a reference to a recent proposal from French president Emmanuel Macron for the establishment of a European university with campuses in different member states, with students rotating among them during their years of study. While Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has spoken favourably about the idea, this email seems to be the first suggestion that WIT could be an Irish campus for such an entity.An email from the the Department of the Taoiseach also sought to boost the prominence of Athlone Institute of Technology. “Can anything be said about Athlone IT in the context of Technological Universities (it doesn’t seem to be part of any of the four potential groups)?” the senior official from the Taoiseach’s department wrote.In the end, no reference was added on the basis that Athlone IT had decided not to form part of any consortium seeking to become a technological university . Emails released under the Freedom of Information Act also show the text of the plan was changed at a late stage to play down expectations that universities would receive significant State funding for capital projects over the coming years.Officials estimated that universities planned to source about €3 billion over the coming decade in new and enhanced infrastructure, largely funded from their own resources, philanthropy and borrowings.This included both approved campus development projects and those awaiting sanction, as well as a number of investments in student accommodation.While an original draft of the plan gave a prominent position to the role of exchequer funding in these plans, it was reworded at the suggestion of Department of Public Expenditure officials to “reduce expectations” of such funding.Records also indicate officials also decided to include private-sector investment in projects that were already announced, even though it was not “new investment”.A National Treasury Management Agency official who was asked to draw up a list of private-sector investment in university public-private partnerships for the plan wrote: “We’ve excluded the projects which have already been signed and financial close achieved, as these will not be ‘new’ investment on this period.”He warned that investment in student accommodation was also at a preliminary stage, with no certainty of progressing at this stage given a number of hurdles yet to be crossed.However, a Department of Public Expenditure official decided to include projects in the overall figures.“While I note your point that these are not ‘new’, nevertheless, they will involve new investment by the private partner in the economy over the coming years, so I propose to leave them in,” the official wrote.We send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and ThursdayThank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017.

We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the Guardian. “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”Thank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"tradition evolution royal birth queen duchess cambridge","story":"Royal births are far from private affairs.

Last year, just 243 cases were reported.Health officials suspect the rise can be attributed to holidaymnakers returning from the continent. In Europe, there has been a large outbreak in measles this year.Dr Yvonne Doyle, London regional director for Public Health England, said: “We are seeing a concerning increase in measles cases across  London which could lead to a wider outbreak in unvaccinated children and adults.Measles is a highly contagious infectious disease which usually starts with cold-like symptoms“Those who have not received two doses of the vaccine in the past — or who are unsure — should speak to their GP. There’s no harm in receiving an additional dose where there is any uncertainty.“It’s crucial pregnant women have been vaccinated with MMR, as rubella in particular can cause serious complications during pregnancy.”Measles is a highly contagious infectious disease which usually starts with cold-like symptoms, fever and red, sensitive eyes. It can spread very easily and can be caught by breathing in droplets from an infected person when they cough or sneeze.In rare cases, complications can include deafness, blindness and swelling of the brain, leading to brain damage, and in even more rare cases, a progresssive disorder.Please review our commenting policyRoyal baby: Duchess of Cambridge in hospital after going into labour - latest newsRoyal baby: Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s due date, possible names and all the latest newsWestworld, season 2 episode 1, Journey Into Night recap: the twistiest show on TV is back with a vengeanceCanadian lynched by villagers in Peruvian Amazon after death of elderly healerSt George\u0026#39s Day 2018: How the dragon-slayer became a patron saint of England, Russia and Catalonia\u0026#39Heavy casualties of  Chinese tourists\u0026#39 in North Korea bus crashOn this day in 1415: St George\u0026#39s Day declared a national feast daySouth Korea halts border propaganda broadcasts to the northMichael Bloomberg to pay $4.5m to cover US contribution to Paris climate pactShark bite victim previously attacked by bear and rattlesnakeMartin Lewis to sue Facebook over fake ads which scam people out of thousands  Fast food outlets should be banned from opening near schools to tackle obesity epidemic, say doctors\u0026#39Young\u0026#39 MI5 analysts need experience of policeman on street, former terrorism reviewer says Elderly and disabled at risk in inadequate housing, human rights watchdog findsSorry I told the world you love George Formby, Your Majesty, biographer jokesRunners brave hottest ever marathon, complete with detours to local pubs and shops to stay hydratedTom Daley reveals the difficulties of having a child via surrogate in the UKSliver of Germany\u0026#39s mighty gold stash goes on show for the first timeEmmanuel Macron, the \u0026#39Trump Whisperer\u0026#39, says there is no Plan B on Iran as he travels to WashingtonMajor police review recommends dropping policy of automatically believing \u0026#39victims\u0026#39We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

And it had a really eerie feel about it.“There was definitely a ghost. Without a shadow of a doubt. I remember the first time I walked up the steps, got into the hall and I thought I can’t go any further.“I literally froze. If my hair could stand on end, it would have done.“I remember leaving and thinking I don’t want to come back here again and I didn’t for a few years.”After the Prince’s team began work on the house, opening it to the public in 2008, she said she had walked in to find a “completely new house”.“Whatever was there had disappeared,” she said. “The whole thing seemed to be smiling again.”Of the idiosyncrasies of staying at Dumfries House, the Duchess added: “I love hearing clocks striking together. We’ve got 10 or 11 grandfather clocks that were collected by the Queen Mother.“They are all supposed to strike at the same time but they never do. However much you wind them, they’re always out of sync.”In 2007, the  revealed that Dumfries House had been “saved” by the Prince at the 11th hour after the building was put on the market and its unique contents already on their way to an auction house ready to be sold off. A group convened by the Prince secured the property and its furniture for £45m, with £20m personally guaranteed by the heir to the throne himself.Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall walk rescue dog Beth at Dumfries HouseThen, it was described as “one of the great heritage saves of modern times\u0026quot, with the Prince “descended from the clouds” to preserve it.An ITV documentary, to be broadcast tonight, will tell the story of the Prince and Duchess, from the deep controversies of their relationship to their marriage.Restoration at Dumfries HouseBen Elliot, the Duchess’ nephew, relays how the Queen expressed her approval at their 2005 wedding, saying: “It was a really happy day because clearly these two people had been in love for a long time. This was the end of a journey.“I think it was the Queen who said something in her speech about, I think it was the same day as the Grand National, that they had got over Becher\u0027s Brook and that her son was with the woman that he loved.”He added: “As we’ve seen with our current Queen, she’s been a great Queen because she’s been assisted absolutely brilliantly by her husband The Duke of Edinburgh.“And when the Prince of Wales eventually becomes our King, with my aunt next to him, he will be a great King.”The Real Camilla: HRH The Duchess of Cornwall airs on Monday at 9pm on ITV.Camilla, Duchess of CornwallWestworld, season 2 episode 1, Journey Into Night recap: the twistiest show on TV is back with a vengeanceCanadian lynched by villagers in Peruvian Amazon after death of elderly healerSt George\u0026#39s Day 2018: How the dragon-slayer became a patron saint of England, Russia and CataloniaRoyal baby: Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s due date, possible names and all the latest news\u0026#39Heavy casualties of  Chinese tourists\u0026#39 in North Korea bus crashOn this day in 1415: St George\u0026#39s Day declared a national feast daySouth Korea halts border propaganda broadcasts to the northMichael Bloomberg to pay $4.5m to cover US contribution to Paris climate pactShark bite victim previously attacked by bear and rattlesnakeMartin Lewis to sue Facebook over fake ads which scam people out of thousands  Fast food outlets should be banned from opening near schools to tackle obesity epidemic, say doctors\u0026#39Young\u0026#39 MI5 analysts need experience of policeman on street, former terrorism reviewer says Elderly and disabled at risk in inadequate housing, human rights watchdog findsSorry I told the world you love George Formby, Your Majesty, biographer jokesRunners brave hottest ever marathon, complete with detours to local pubs and shops to stay hydratedTom Daley reveals the difficulties of having a child via surrogate in the UKSliver of Germany\u0026#39s mighty gold stash goes on show for the first timeEmmanuel Macron, the \u0026#39Trump Whisperer\u0026#39, says there is no Plan B on Iran as he travels to WashingtonMajor police review recommends dropping policy of automatically believing \u0026#39victims\u0026#39Israel dismisses claims that Mossad killed Palestinian activist in MalaysiaWe rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"day 1415 st georges day declared national feast day","story":"St George slays the dragonSt George’s Day, 23 April, has been celebrated as a saint’s day in England since before the Norman conquest.

although her precise due date is unknown.Here\u0027s everything royal-watchers need to know about the new addition to the royal family.Kensington Palace has only said the baby is due sometime in April. Suggestions have included St George\u0027s Day - April 23.With Prince George and Princess Charlotte, Kate gave birth just over five weeks after going on maternity leave. She went on maternity leave for her third child on March 22, so this suggests the baby might put in an appearance around April 27 or 28.Both Prince George, four, and Princess Charlotte, two, are thought to have been born slightly late: in 2015 the Duchess of Cambridge let slip that her due date was towards the end of April, however Princess Charlotte was born on 2 May. This might mean another longer-than-average pregnancy is on the cards for the Duchess.The new arrival will come just weeks before Prince Harry and Meghan Markle tie the knot on May 19, hopefully giving Kate a few days to recover.Prince William and Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, hold their new born son GeorgeParking restrictions are in place outside the Lindo Wing of St Mary\u0027s Hospital in London in preparation for the birth.Crowd barriers are set up on the street outside to accommodate the television crews, journalists and photographers who will be present as she goes into labour. Both Prince George and Princess Charlotte were born at the Lindo Wing.The private wing of the NHS hospital charges £5,215 for the first 24 hours if a baby is born naturally, or £6,745 for a Caesarean section, plus £1,155 for the deluxe package for each additional night.Royal baby | Inside the Lindo WingThe \u0027s Anna Maxted had all three of her children there, and describes the rooms as basic, but the care as first-class.When the Duchess of Cambridge was pregnant with Princess Charlotte in 2015, contingency plans were put in place. If the Duchess unexpectedly went into labour while visiting her parents in Bucklebury, she would have been taken to the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, while if she went into labour at Anmer Hall, the couple\u0027s country residence in Norfolk, she would have given birth at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King\u0027s Lynn.The Duke and Duchess have chosen solidly traditional royal names for their children in the past, making it likely they will reference previous monarchs this time as well.Alice, Mary, Alexandra or Victoria for a girl, or Frederick, James, Arthur or Philip for a boy are good bets.There is one former king who\u0027s highly unlikely to ever have another royal namesake: King John. That’s because in his 17-year reign he managed to so sully his name it\u0027s pretty much been removed from royal circulation.Not only was he exceptionally rapacious and cruel (he had a penchant for starving his enemies to death), John was also one of the most cowardly and incompetent scoundrels to sit on the throne.Prince George in JuneThe couple\u0027s first child George will in time become King George VII, following a tradition dating back to German-born George I, the first Hanoverian king of Great Britain who acceded to the throne in 1714. The last was the Queen\u0027s father George VI who died in 1952 but was known to his family as Bertie.Among the previous monarchs to have had the name is George III - on the throne from 1760 to 1820 - who is predominantly remembered for losing the American colonies and his sanity. However, the Prince of Wales has previously disclosed that he is the king he most respects, describing him as a good man who was simply misunderstood.Princess Charlotte in JulyThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge honoured both royal tradition and family ties by naming their second child Charlotte.The name’s royal pedigree includes Queen Charlotte, the wife of George III, who bore him 15 children and helped found Kew Gardens. Queen Charlotte’s \u0026amp Chelsea Hospital, which is named after her, is part of the same NHS Trust as St Mary’s Hospital Paddington, where the private Lindo Wing is situated.Her granddaughter Princess Charlotte of Wales, who married on May 2, the day the new Princess Charlotte was born, died in childbirth in 1817 at the age of just 21. She was the only child of George, Prince of Wales, who would go on to become King George IV.Charlotte also happens to be the middle name of the Duchess’s sister, Pippa Middleton, and goes back in her family to her paternal great-great-great-grandmother Charlotte Ablett, born in 1825 and therefore possibly named for Princess Charlotte.The new royal baby will be fifth in line to the throne, behind the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge, Prince George and Princess Charlotte. It means Prince Harry will drop down to sixth in line, and every other member of the Royal family will be one step further away from the throne.Because of recent changes to the laws governing succession, the baby\u0027s sex will make no difference, as boys no longer have precedence over girls.If the change hadn\u0027t been made and the third baby were a boy, he would be fifth in line instead of Princess Charlotte - however that will now not be the case.The new baby will be an HRH and a Prince or Princess of Cambridge - thanks to the Queen who stepped in ahead of Prince George\u0027s birth to ensure all William\u0027s children had fitting titles.Unlikely. It\u0027s rare, but not unheard of, for a third-born royal in direct succession to become king or queen.This Cambridge sibling will live their life happy in the knowledge they will not be expected to wear the crown, leaving that role to older brother George.William IV, a Hanoverian king who ruled from 1830 to 1837, was a third child - of George III and Queen Charlotte. He acceded to the throne when he outlived his older brothers, George IV, who died without an heir, and Frederick, Duke of York.Both Prince George and Princess Charlotte are believed to have been born by a natural delivery, meaning the Duchess of Cambridge will presumably be planning to have a natural birth this time as well.In 2015 Pat O\u0027Brien, a consultant obstetrician at University College Hospital, said that because of the speed with which the Princess Charlotte was delivered after the Duchess was admitted to hospital, it is likely that she went into labour naturally.From Princess Charlotte to the Queen: The Royal Family as toddlers through the agesHe said: \u0026quotThe fact that she went into hospital at around 6am and had the baby by 8.34am would not imply that she was induced at all.\u0026quotSecond time labours tend to be quicker than first time labours. Everything tends to go faster. The dilation stage is quicker, the pushing stage is usually quicker and easier as well, and the baby comes out more quickly. You would expect it to be an easier labour anyway.\u0026quotThe medical team in charge of safely delivering Princess Charlotte was led by Guy Thorpe-Beeston, Surgeon Gynaecologist to the Royal Household.Mr Thorpe-Beeston, an obstetrician who specialises in high-risk pregnancies, has a private Harley Street practice and is a consultant at the Portland private hospital and at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in the NHS.A Cambridge graduate, he worked at King\u0027s College Hospital in London before becoming a consultant in foetal medicine at Chelsea and Westminster in 1996.The Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s best maternity fashion moments...He was assisted by Alan Farthing, Surgeon Gynaecologist to the Queen, who was the fiance of the television presenter Jill Dando at the time of her murder in 1999, and has been part of the Queen\u0027s medical household since 2008.In 2014 Sir Marcus Setchell, the recently retired surgeon gynaecologist to the Queen who delivered Prince George, told BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour: “What happened in labour is an entirely private matter, but I do think there are certain situations when someone is giving birth that it’s important…to have a specialist…in the same room to deal with anything that’s immediately going to be wrong.”After the Queen, other members of the Royal family and the Middleton family have been told the good news, the royal communications team will email media organisations with the sex, weight and timing of the birth.Moments later the news will be announced via royal Twitter and Instagram accounts before a traditional paper announcement is placed on an easel outside Buckingham Palace.The age-old custom of placing a paper proclamation for the public to see at the Queen\u0027s London residence took place when Prince George and Princess Charlotte were born.A brief formal announcement - on foolscap-sized paper set in a dark wooden frame - will be placed on an ornate golden easel on the forecourt of the Palace.It will confirm the sex of the baby and the time of birth, but will give little else away, other than usually revealing that the baby has been \u0026quotsafely delivered\u0026quot and mother and child are \u0026quotdoing well\u0026quot.It used to be hand-written, but is now typed. It will also be signed at the hospital by the doctors who tended to the duchess, and then ferried back to the Palace by car.Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge was safely delivered of a daughter at 8.34am.\u0026mdash Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) May 2, 2015After the birth of Prince George, the Duchess left hospital the next day, while she left the hospital to go home on the same day after giving birth to Princess Charlotte.But the length of the Duchess\u0027s hospital stay this time around will be entirely down to how she is feeling, so there is no guarantee we will see the baby within 24 hours of its birth. The Duke and Duchess are expected to leave the Lindo Wing by the front door to give the waiting media the chance to take the photographs that will no doubt adorn the front pages of newspapers the next day.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge outside the Lindo Wing of St Mary\u0026#39s Hospital in London in 2015, with Princess CharlotteAfter the birth of Princess Charlotte, the Duke and Duchess spent the first nights of her life at Kensington Palace before driving north to their country home, Anmer Hall, on the Queen\u0027s Sandringham estate, where they were likely joined there by the Duchess\u0027s parents, Michael and Carole Middleton, who often stayed over to help look after Prince George.However, the family permanently relocated to Kensington Palace last year, after deciding Prince George should be schooled in London, so it\u0027s unlikely that they\u0027ll head back to Norfolk for a while.The names given to royal babies are not usually revealed straight away, and the public is often left guessing for several days.William and Kate took two days to announce both George and Charlotte\u0027s names, informing the Queen of their choice beforehand.Mike and Zara Tindall used Twitter to unveil their daughter\u0027s name six days after she was born in 2014, with proud dad Mike tweeting: \u0026quotFor everyone who has asked what our daughter\u0027s name is, it\u0027s Mia Grace Tindall.\u0026quotWhen Princess Beatrice was born in 1988, it was two weeks before her name was known.In 1982, the Prince and Princess of Wales waited seven days before deciding upon and announcing Prince William\u0027s name.The Prince of Wales\u0027s name, however, remained a mystery for an entire month and was only declared ahead of his christening in the Music Room of Buckingham Palace in December 1948.Prince George to start school with mum and dad by his sideThey have on previous occasions: after the birth of Princess Charlotte, the Duke took two weeks\u0027 statutory paternity leave from his job as an air ambulance pilot, which he quit in July 2017 to become a full time royal, and the Duchess took maternity leave from her official royal duties.After the birth of Prince George, the Duchess was back in action after five weeks, joining her husband to start the Anglesey Coastal Ultra Marathon. However, she maintained a light workload for several months after both births.As well as having a full-time nanny and plenty of help from the Middletons in 2015, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge hired another temporary nanny to help them through the first weeks of Princess Charlotte\u0027s life.The couple were determined to manage without professional help when Prince George was born, but he was not a good sleeper and the Duchess became exhausted after countless sleepless nights.Prince George, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince George\u0026#39s nanny, Maria BorralloThey eventually accepted they needed help, and hired Spaniard Maria Borrallo from the world-famous Norland nanny agency when Prince George was seven months old.When Princess Charlotte was born they reportedly made arrangements through Norland for a maternity nurse to work full-time for at least three months, to get them through the most difficult period of their new baby’s life.The Duchess of Cambridges best jewellery momentsAlmost certainly. Perhaps the most tasteful souvenir will be a commemorative £5 coin that is likely to be a hit with collectors.When Prince George was born the Royal Mint produced 10,000 solid silver coins, which cost £80 each, and 2,013 22 carat gold sovereigns, priced at £800. They all sold out within days. Babies born on the same day as Prince George were also entitled to a free \u0026quotlucky\u0026quot silver penny minted for the occasion.When Princess Charlotte was born the Royal Mint produced four coins, ranging in price from £13 to £1,800.The Royal Collection Trust, which runs the official souvenir shops at royal palaces, is likely to bring out its own range of commemorative china. When Prince George was born, official plates, cups and other chinaware was on sale just two days later.The usual unofficial range of tea towels, postcards and crockery will no doubt follow.Duchess of CambridgePlease review our commenting policyRoyal baby: Duchess of Cambridge in hospital after going into labour -

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy.

Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices.

It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 17,500 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpaths (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Yet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Certainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers.

A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

One of the people Dr Ilardo met told her he once stayed underwater for 13 minutes while hunting.Bajau \u0027sea nomads\u0027 of IndonesiaBajau \u0027sea nomads\u0027 of IndonesiaThe Bajau village of Jaya BaktiJaya Bakti homes from the waterA Bajau villager demonstrates the use of traditional wooden gogglesA young Bajau girl looks on in excitement as her father, a traditional Bajau er, returns to Jaya Bakti from a two-week fishing tripA small, unnamed island serves as a haven for visiting Bajau houseboats.\u0026#13The population was interested in learning about their genetic heritage, and Dr Ilardo used a portable ultrasound machine to measure spleen size in 59 Bajau.She then measured spleen size in 34 people from a neighbouring village inhabited by non- Bajau people so she could make a comparison.When she took her data back to Denmark to analyse, Dr Ilardo found Bajau people had spleens around 50 per cent larger than their neighbours. Spleens are involved in the so-called “human e response”. When a body is submerged in cold water the heart rate slows, blood vessels in the extremities shrink and the spleen contracts.This contraction injects a spurt of additional oxygen-rich blood cells into circulation, allowing the body to survive for longer underwater. Dr Ilardo and her collaborators estimated the enlarged spleens of the Bajau could provide them with around 10 per cent more blood cells than someone with a normal-sized spleen.Humans ‘evolving gene’ that may stop us drinking alcoholAs well as measuring spleen size, Dr Ilardo took spit samples from the study participants so she could investigate the genetic basis for the differences she was seeing. She identified several genes that were observed far more frequently in the genomes of Bajau participants, including one – PDE10A – that is involved with the production of thyroid hormone, which in turn is associated with spleen size.We believe that in the Bajau they have an adaptation that increases thyroid hormone levels and therefore increases their spleen size, said Dr Ilardo. It\u0027s been shown in mice that thyroid hormones and spleen size are connected. “If you genetically alter mice to have an absence of the thyroid hormone T4, their spleen size is drastically reduced, but this effect is actually reversible with an injection of T4.\u0027Unprecedented\u0027 7,000-year-old Native American burial site discovered by amateur er off coast off FloridaThis is the first adaptation for ing ever observed in humans. Previous work appeared to show that sea nomad children had superior underwater eyesight, but those results have since been disproved.The findings were published in the journal Cell. Despite initially warning Dr Ilardo against undertaking the work due to the likelihood she would find no significant results, her supervisors Professor Eske Willerslev and Professor Rasmus Nielsen think her findings are significant for a number of reasons.This is the first time that we really have a system like that in humans to study, said Dr Nielsen. “Nature has made experiments for us that tell us how humans react and adapt genetically to a whole new set of physiological conditions, so that we can explore and learn much more about the interaction between genetics and physiology.Mutant gene in Amish makes them live 10 years longerUnderstanding the genetics underpinning the Bajau’s abilities could even have applications in medical research – specifically for those trying to treat the condition of acute hypoxia, when body tissue experiences a rapid depletion of oxygen.There is also a fundamental need to understand the ersity of genes found in the world’s indigenous populations, said Professor Willerslev.This really tells us how valuable and important indigenous populations are around the world that are living extreme lifestyles, in terms of understanding the function of various genetic traits and finding the underlying genetic background for various physiological traits, he said. Most of these populations are completely understudied, and I think there is a huge benefit, not only potentially to them, but also to the rest of mankind by actually paying some attention to them.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In essence, there is a concern that some voters will be disenfranchised as a result of restrictive identification requirements,” writes Claire Collier, the commission\u0027s legal secretary.The intervention comes after a slew of stories this week about members of the Windrush generation facing problems with access to healthcare and other state services.Many immigrants who arrived from the Caribbean between the late Forties and Seventies have no record of their legal status.Responding to the letter, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told the newspaper: “It is the same hostile environment all over again, shutting our fellow citizens out of public life, treating communities who made Britain their home as second-class citizens. It’s disgraceful and it must be brought to an end.”The new electoral rules are set to be tried for the first time in five local authority areas – Bromley, Gosport, Swindon, Watford and Woking – during this year’s local elections on 3 May. If a success, they will be rolled out nationally from 2020.Although they are being implemented in response to perceived increase in voter identity fraud, figures previously reported by The Independent suggest the risk of such crime is minimal.A study by the Electoral Commission found just 28 allegations of someone having lied about their identity at a polling station in 2017, despite almost 45 million votes having been cast.Only one of these allegations resulted in a conviction.

Argue with Nigel FarageBrexit: Tory and Labour MPs team up to push through customs union voteUK wants the EU to protect its products from imitation after Brexit“The sector would undeniably suffer from reverting to WTO tariffs in the event of a ‘no deal’ scenario,” the MPs’ report states.The committee added British participation in the single market and customs union had led to an “over reliance” on EU markets, which accounted for 60 per cent of the £22bn in processed food and drinks exports in 2017.They said during their inquiry the committee did not hear any evidence that moving away from the current customs arrangements could be beneficial to UK manufacturers or consumers.May’s Brexit orce bill ‘could cost billions more than estimated’It echoes a similar warning from Sainsbury’s chief executive Mike Coupe, who last month said the supermarket would have to increase prices if any barriers to imports were introduced after Brexit.Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said: “The success of the industry has been highly dependent on participating in the single market and customs union.“To ensure the continued success of our food and drinks industry, the government must provide clarity and certainty on our future relationship with the EU and seek continued regulatory, standards and trading alignment with the EU in the processed food and drink sector.”The report added that the industry, which employs 400,000 people – a third of them EU nationals – would “undeniably suffer” if Britain left without a trade deal and was forced to fall back on WTO rules.Brexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUBrexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUA key point in the negotiations remains Britain\u0027s access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union.

The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.\u0026#13“The EU’s most favoured nation tariffs under WTO rules would be disastrous for UK exports and must be avoided at all cost,” the committee said.“A no deal scenario would be unviable and unacceptable to the sector as, at least in the short term, the EU is the UK’s main trading partner. It would also have serious repercussions for importers of UK products in the EU and the rest of the world.”The committee warned that if the UK tried to lower or remove tariffs on imports after Brexit, the consequences for British farming could be “extremely serious” while the impact on prices in the shops was likely to be “very limited”.It said that Britain should remain “as close as possible” to EU regulations, warning that UK consumers “would not tolerate any lowering of standards”. It also urged the government to seek a deal on immigration to allow the industry continued access to EU labour – both skilled and unskilled – on which it is heavily reliant.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Parliament can, if it chooses, let the people have their say on the deal, and with public support for a People’s Vote growing by the day, that’s exactly what parliament should do.”Caroline Lucas, the co-leader of the Green Party and a backer of the anti-Brexit Best for Britain campaign, said that “many MPs from across the political ide” would wish to amend the motion.“It’s now down to parliament to flex its muscles on this issue, and give people a say on this monumentally important decision,” she said.Mr Baker’s admission came in evidence to a Lords committee investigating the nature of the so-called “meaningful vote” on the final deal, which will take place later this year, or early in 2019.The prime minister, and other ministers, have repeatedly insisted that while MPs can reject the agreement reached with the EU, that would simply mean the UK crashing out with no deal at all.Brexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUBrexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUA key point in the negotiations remains Britain\u0027s access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union.

The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.\u0026#13But Mr Baker, when asked if the motion “would be amendable”, told peers: “I believe the position is that parliament can always seek to amend motions.”The minister was then asked specifically what would happen if an amendment requiring a fresh referendum was carried, replying: “That would be an extremely controversial situation, of course.”Mr Baker acknowledged such an amendment could not be ignored, adding: “We would be in the position where we would have to look extremely carefully at what the amendment precisely was.”And he held open the possibility of attempts to change the nature of the deal – which, if successful, would send the prime minister back to the negotiating table, it has been argued.“Clearly, the range of amendments that is possible is within the bounds of the imagination of all members of parliament,” the minister said.Speaking to the Lords constitution committee on Wednesday, Mr Baker suggested parliament had a duty to respect the referendum result and not to “frustrate that process”.UK wants the EU to protect its products from imitation after BrexitWindrush wasn’t an anomaly – and it has implications for BrexitLiam Fox ‘underestimating’ difficulty of getting farming trade deals“We will leave, there will not be attempts to stay in by the back door, there will not be an attempt to reverse the result,” he insisted – but he admitted it was “a political point, rather than a constitutional point”.Ms May has firmly rejected a further referendum, but some pro-EU Tories believe she could yet accept one if it appears the only way to keep her warring party together on Europe.Similarly, although Jeremy Corbyn has said Labour does not back another referendum, he has left the door open to a change of mind.There is also evidence that support is growing for a referendum on the Brexit deal, amid continuing confusion about both the planned transition period and the final agreement with the EU.A recent poll for Best for Britain found that 44 per cent of people want a vote – a clear eight points ahead of the 36 per cent who reject a further referendum.Opinion appears to be shifting as the negotiations remain bogged down on how to avoid a hard border in Ireland and with the details of a future trade deal unlikely to even be discussed until after departure day.Strikingly, last month David Davis predicted that parliament would vote down the deal unless the trade terms were broadly agreed – but the EU has insisted there is no time before its autumn deadline.The constitution committee was told the vote would take place “as soon as possible” after an expected autumn agreement in Brussels, and that it should be supported “in the national interest”.If parliament backs that motion, it will be followed by a Withdrawal Agreement and Implementation Bill (Waib) to put the agreement into legal effect.Some MPs believe the “meaningful vote”, secured in a revolt last December, should take place on the bill, rather than the motion, only then passing the regulations necessary to deliver Brexit.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

She was pulled back inside by fellow passengers but died from her injuries.  It was the first time in eight years that someone died in a fatal accident aboard a US airliner. Robert Sumwalt, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), said the dangerous kind of engine breakup that occurred Tuesday — called an uncontained failure because pieces were shot out like shrapnel — should not have happened. But he and other aviation experts have cautioned against drawing any broad conclusions yet about the safety of CFM56 engines or Boeing 737 jets.CFM International says the engines are used on 6,700 planes around the world.Uncontained engine failures are rare — there are about three or four a year, according to Mr Sumwalt. It is not the first time an emergency of this kind has occurred.A similar incident aboard another Southwest flight in 2016 also involved an engine fan becoming detached and was also associated with metal fatigue. That plane also made an emergency landing but no one was injured.Woman \u0027partially pulled out of\u0027 Southwest Airlines plane in-flightSouthwest issued letters of apology to passengers who were aboard Flight 1380. US media report that each was given a $5,000 cheque and a $1,000 travel voucher. Southwest said in a statement earlier this week that it is “accelerating its existing engine inspection program relating to the CFM56 engine family.”“The accelerated inspections are being performed out of an abundance of caution and are expected to be completed over the next 30 days. “The accelerated checks are ultrasonic inspections of fan blades of the CFM56 engines.   In a further statement, they acknowledged the directive issued by the FAA, adding that their “existing maintenance program meets or exceeds all the requirements specified in the Airworthiness Directive.”Additional reporting by agenciesor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The Kremlin isn’t ready to do it just yet –\u0026nbspbut that doesn’t mean they won’t break the\u0026nbspinternet\u0026nbsptryingOn Friday 13 April, inside a cramped Moscow courtroom, judge Yulia Smolina made Russian internet history. It took her just 19 minutes to agree to a government request to block the popular messaging app Telegram. The brutal efficiency of the decision – which took hold even before an appeal took place – suggested everyone thought implementation would be easy. Communications regulator Roskomnadzor began implementing the ban last Monday, ordering internet providers to block access to the messaging app. A game of hide and seek ensued. As soon as the first subnets were blocked, Telegram switched its servers to alternate IP addresses. Regulators responded by blocking entire internet subsets – to general calamity. By midday on 19 April, it had banned a total of 18 million IP addresses (compare this to 38,000 in all previous years).Importing apple trees instead of apples, Russia secures foodMany businesses, including parts of the banking infrastructure, were caught in Roskomnadzor’s net. On Sunday, Gmail and some other Google services went offline for many Russians, as the authorities shut down major networks they believed were being used to circumvent the ban.Telegram, meanwhile, remained accessible to the vast majority of Russian users. The Kremlin faced an embarrassing reality that the internet was stronger than its heaviest fist. But for many, the fear is that sharper impacts will now follow. Once a largely free space, the Russian internet has been increasingly subjected to regulation and censorship. The first blocklists appeared in 2012. Now, the decision of a remote Siberian village court is enough for a site to be struck off completely. Such, for example, was the fate that befell the country’s leading LGBT website, gay.ru, earlier this year – and any number of dating and porn sites the year before. Russia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsKremlin threatens to expel all UK media if Britain shuts down RTRepublicans say they found ‘no evidence’ Trump conspired with RussiaInstragram ‘removed photos of Kremin leader with escorts aboard yacht’In 2015, a new law was passed forcing foreign tech companies to move Russian data to servers inside Russia. Most refused to comply, but that may change. Kremlin hardliners have meanwhile made little secret of ongoing work to build an analogue to the Great Chinese Firewall. The Chinese model is now one of three scenarios under consideration, said independent observer Konstantin Gaaze. The first is to continue as if nothing has happened. Russia could certainly continue its haphazard approach of blocking subsets and IP addresses. But if it is to appear remotely effective, it will need the agreement of Apple and Google – for example, to block the notifications the app is using to update users on new server addresses. In 2016, the tech giants did cooperate with the Kremlin to remove the much less popular LinkedIn platform from its stores, but it is unclear if they will do so in these more controversial circumstances. On the other hand, Russia could choose to revisit and fudge the original court decision. Or it could take a sledgehammer to the internet with a system of filters and whitelists. “The security council met on Thursday, and it appears no major decision has been taken,” Mr Gaaze told The Independent. “Things are likely to continue as they are until the inauguration in May – then it is anyone’s guess”Others are less sure that Russia can make a firewall work. “It isn’t workable right now, as we don’t have the technology to deal with the data involved,” said Andrei Soldatov, author of The Red Web. China has been ready to lend a hand to the Kremlin, the security expert told The Independent, but the “paranoia” of Russia’s security services has prevailed.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesSouth Koreans cheer during the welcoming event for the inter-Korean summit between South Korea and North Korea in Seoul.

The unexpected resistance of Telegram may change that. “The severity of Russia’s legislation has always been compensated by the lack of enforcement – that was the old adage,” said IT entrepreneur David Homak. “Telegram may not yet be blocked, but the Kremlin has shown it is ready for a battle, demonstrating strength in the most primitive sense .” In an interview with Izvestia, Roskomnadzor’s chief Alexander Zharov appeared to be clearing the way for a renewed assault on those tech companies refusing to move their data to Russia. “We will finish our compliance checks by the end of this year,” he told the pro-Kremlin newspaper. “If nothing happens … then obviously the question of blocking arises.”For Mr Soldatov, last week’s technical failure might be interpreted as political success. “After a week or two of this, the Kremlin might come to a view that it’s taken all the heat its possible to muster,” he said. “At that point, nothing is stopping it moving against Facebook”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?
