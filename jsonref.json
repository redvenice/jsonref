Just for the east side of the country. The south and central areas are likely to continue with the higher 20s.’Next week will welcome showers and possible thunderstorms for those in the south of England.When will the UK heatwave end?Although the UK will have a long period of sunny weather until August, bookies have predicted that the heatwave could end as early as next week as July enters the record books as the wettest ever.Forecaster Amy Hodgson of The Weather Channel said: ‘Increased cloud with outbreaks of light rain will affect Ireland and Scotland over the weekend, whilst England and Wales will be dry and mostly sunny.‘It will be a hot and humid weekend in a south-westerly flow, with maximum temperatures in the mid to high 20s across England and Wales, but cooler across Ireland and Scotland with highs in the high teens to low 20s.’          The heatwave could end as early as next week as July enters record books as the wettest everAlongside this, according to a Met Office forecaster, the weather will be ‘less hot, is the best way to describe next week, but it will still be warm. There will be some sunny spells but there will be a few showers around that could be heavy and thundery.‘All parts of the UK will see some spells of sunshine, but there is likely to be relatively more in the way of rain or showers at times too. Some of the showers could be heavy or thundery at times.‘There may also be bands of more persistent rain on occasion which may bring some stronger winds too, especially to northern and western parts. These bands of rain could occur at any time but become more likely later on in the period.The best of the fine weather and sunny conditions looks to be in the east and southeast of the UK. Temperatures will be close to average in the northwest, but with light winds it will still feel very warm at times across the south and east.’UK heatwave historyDuring the UK heatwave 2018, many parallels have been made with the hot weather that consumed the country during the summer of 1976. As reported in The Mirror, Met Office forecaster John Hammond said: ‘Hot and dry weather breeds hot and dry weather. This effect was seen in 1976.’However, the driest summer on record was in 1995, with only 64.7 ml of rain in June, July and August. The average for June this year was 35.4ml, which makes it one of the five warmest Junes in the UK since 1910.June 2018 was also one of the hottest for more than 300 years, bordering on the top 10 since records began 359 years ago.Who will win Love Island 2018?

Bolt (pictured) retired from athletics last year after he cemented his success as the fastest man in the world with eight Olympic gold medals and eleven world titlesIt is understood that Phelan, who worked closely with Sir Alex Ferguson for over 19 years, would be closely involved in Bolt\u0027s trial and potential season. Bolt retired from sprinting last year after he cemented himself as the fastest man on the world with eleven world titles.The eight-time Olympic gold medalist had grown up playing football and cricket before focusing on his athletic career.This would not be the first time Bolt has aimed for a professional career as he has already trialled at Borussia Dortmund in March and Stromsgodset last month.The German and Norwegian teams, respectively, did not offer Bolt a contract for the trials.  \u0027I want to try to get better, to work as hard as I can, play as much as I can.

And how does such disproportionate variation of representation skew perspectives of minority groups?” asked the report. “Topics such as conflict and the refugee experience are valid subjects for authors to explore and unpick. Our concern would be if children only encounter ethnic minority representation in that context and no other,” Serroukh told the . “We need books like that, but they need to sit within a wider diet of books so readers can appreciate that people from minority backgrounds have as much variety of life as everyone else – yes, there is struggle, but there is also going to the dentist, going to the supermarket. It’s striking a balance.”The report states that “every child is entitled to feel safe and valued”, and that “in the current socio-political and economic climate the risk of marginalisation is even greater”. It warns publishers that if children do not see their realities reflected in the world around them or only see problematic representations mirrored back at them, the impact can be tremendously damaging. “To redress imbalances in representation is not an act of charity but an act of necessity that benefits and enriches all of our realities,” the report adds.Author Nikesh Shukla, who has been a major force behind the push for ersity in UK publishing, sat on a steering committee for CLPE’s report.“I do feel the industry is getting better but a report like this is a reminder of how much work still needs to be done – and a stark reminder of our readers, and how our readers are not getting what they need,” he said.“When you’re figuring out the world, being able to see yourself in books, as well as people who don’t look like you, is really important. It means you see your story as valid, and it can contribute to who you imagine yourself to be – and a kid should be able to imagine themselves as anyone in the world. These mirrors are so important.”His words echo those of the late American children’s author Walter Dean Myers, who wrote in 2014: “Books transmit values. They explore our common humanity. What is the message when some children are not represented in those books? … Where are black children going to get a sense of who they are and what they can be?”Serroukh said that the CLPE had plans to work with publishers to help them improve. Recommendations include increasing investment in authors from a range of backgrounds, looking for stories where main characters are BAME, and ensuring that they are not “predominantly defined by their struggle, suffering or ‘otherness’”.“At the moment, every title out there featuring BAME characters shoulders a heavy weight. It has to fulfil so many expectations,” said Serroukh. “It comes back to the issue around volume. If there are more books which are representative, then there is more opportunity for wider experiences to be expressed.”Serroukh writes in the report’s foreword: “We know that those who work in all areas of children’s books and literacy recognise that there is work to be done. We want to channel the momentum to ensure that this isn’t reduced to an awkward footnote or ‘trend’ in the history of UK children’s publishing because something as integral as a person’s identity and sense of self deserves to be recognised, respected and valued now and always.”Like a long-running equivalent survey in the US from the University of Wisconsin-Madison – which has charted a slow increase in BAME characters over the last decade and a half – the CLPE report is intended to be annual. A separate piece of research, by the BookTrust, is also currently under way, examining the number of authors and illustrators of colour working in children’s publishing. The BookTrust findings are due in September.Serroukh said she hoped CLPE’s research would be useful as a starting point to help publishers reflect. “Hopefully in 10 years’ time, or however long, it will become redundant,” she said. “We are really keen for the UK market to develop a more nuanced conversation.

High rates of employment and low levels of unemployment usually signal rising wages.There have been signs of recovery in the British economy that could tempt the Bank to raise interest rates from as early as next month to counter persistently high levels of inflation since the EU referendum two years ago. Having shuddered to a standstill during the freezing weather earlier this year, the economy rebounded in May thanks to warmer weather and the royal wedding. The Bank has previously said it would raise rates should the economy continue to improve.The UK jobs report failed to move the needle on Tuesday, with investors seemingly waiting for Wednesday’s inflation reading before making a call on what the Bank of England might do in August.So, not the most hawkish news, if not particularly dovish either, leaving the pound without much reason to rebound on Tuesday... Elsewhere the UK Office for Budget Responsibility has warned on the state of the country’s finances. Reuters reports:Britain’s budget watchdog on Tuesday outlined a gloomier picture for the government’s finances in the long term, reflecting recent pledges to increase health spending without tax hikes or spending cuts to pay for it.The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) stuck to its view that the public finances are likely to come under significant pressure from an aging population.“The long-term outlook for the public finances is less favourable than at the time of our last (fiscal sustainability report) in January 2017,” the OBR said in its report.This was “more than explained” by the government’s health spending announcement in June.Last month Prime Minister Theresa May announced a 4 billion pound ($5.3 billion) boost for the National Health Services, to be funded in part by a “Brexit idend” that the Institute for Fiscal Studies says does not exist.Finance minister Philip Hammond has indicated that taxpayers will need to foot some of the bill.The OBR also looks at falling immigration:Even if the Bank of England does raise rates in August, the Brexit uncertainty casts some doubt on further increases, reckons economist James Smith at ING Bank:However, it’s worth noting that, like last month’s fall, this is mainly a function of base effects. Wage growth was particularly weak in early 2017, but began to recover from the second quarter – meaning the year-on-year growth rates are beginning to ease. Admittedly the recent momentum has slipped a little too. But with Bank of England Agents still pointing to skill shortages resulting in more rapid pay increases, we doubt the recent figures will lead to any kind of rethink amongst the committee on the overall trend for wages.With employment growth also reasonably solid, Tuesday’s jobs report gives the Bank another green light to hike in August. We doubt the few remaining data points between now and the next meeting will do much to change this. And even though the political scene has become particularly noisy, the Parliamentary recess that’s due to start in a matter of days should (in theory) create a brief period of calm, giving the Bank enough cover to hike in August.However, when it comes to Brexit, the bigger headache for the Bank of England could come beyond August. With the EU likely to remain resistant to the UK’s latest proposals, the perceived risk of a “no deal” could feasibly increase (even if the actual probability of this happening remains low in our view).If Brexit uncertainty picks up as time starts to run out, we think the Bank could have a tricky time hiking rates later this year. After an August hike, our current expectation is that the BoE remains on hold until May 2019.On interest rates, Bank of England governor Mark Carney said at Farnborough a no-deal Brexit would be a material event for borrowing costs. Reuters reports:Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Tuesday it would be a “material event” for interest rates if Britain leaves the European Union next year without a deal to smooth its departure.“Our job is to make sure we are as prepared as possible,” Carney told lawmakers at a parliamentary hearing held at an air show in Farnborough, southern England.Carney said he could not predict which direction rates would move in the event of a no-deal Brexit. It was too soon to judge the government’s proposals for Brexit published earlier this month, Carney said.Carney also said that after Brexit, the Bank needed to retain its ability to regulate banks to maintain financial stability.While today’s figures may put wage growth above last month’s CPI inflation reading for May, any reason for British households to cheer could be short lived as there is a possibility that we could see inflation jump back up and over take wage growth when June’s CPI figure is released tomorrow.If inflation does jump back up after this weakening in pay growth, then it adds to the conundrum for the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee who are desperate to deliver a rate hike in August’s MPC meeting. Higher inflation would support that position but an absence of sustained real wage growth as well as ongoing fears about the impact that Brexit will have on the UK economy means that we could see the ‘unreliable boyfriend’ make an appearance again if Mark Carney and the central bank is forced to make another U-turn come August.At the Treasury committee meeting, Bank of England governor Mark Carney says he is concerned the European Union has not yet indicated its solution to continuity in derivatives contracts after Brexit.He said that a no-deal Brexit would have big economic consequences. But he said it was possible that an increase in financial services business from emerging markets could make up for any loss of EU activity.And he believed the UK banking sector was appropriately capitalised even for a disorderly Brexit.They have given up trying to stream the Treasury Select committee from Farnborough:Not everyone believes an August rate rise is a done deal, however. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, says:Both sterling and the FTSE were little changed after the data was released. All in all these numbers don’t alter the economic picture of anaemic growth, a relatively tight labour market and under-control inflation. Markets are still expecting the Bank of England to raise interest rates in August. But given the increasingly uncertain climate I think there’s a real chance policymakers will sit on their hands and wait for firmer signals the economy is on the right track before risking raising borrowing costs.The jobs and wages figures will probably not deter the Bank of England from raising interest rates in August, says Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst:At least one part of the UK economy is showing strength with employment hitting fresh 47 year highs in May. Slowing wage growth is unlikely to shade expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates on August 2nd although tomorrow’s inflation numbers are expected to show that the real wage gains that consumers have been receiving for a few months now may peter out soon courtesy of higher oil prices and a weaker pound.Here is a chart showing the slip in wages growth:And the increase in employment:And the unemployment rate:While the stream is down from Farnborough, over to the day’s big UK data release."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc9d7d7eedd10162b4e756485bae9415d5da324f/0_120_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89d4b5961074e4b70f1a33be5f8c4e41","title":"feeling hot tell us your experiences of heat in your city","story":"Temperatures across the globe have broken records – and rising temperatures have serious implications for cities. What’s happening where you live?Whether summer in your city is present or past, there is a good chance you weathered record-breaking temperatures this year. Climate change in cities is frequently discussed in terms of flooding or storms – but its most dangerous consequence may be heat. Air conditioning, private transport and water engineering have allowed urban settlements in arid areas to expand at a dizzying and unsustainable rate, while outdated paradigms of urban planning and design give little relief from rising temperatures.Cities around the world may find their water use restricted – Cape Town, South Africa and Shimla, India have already have already come dangerously close to “day zero”, when taps run dry – and their power infrastructure compromised by reliance on air conditioning. Standards of living are likely to fall. Heat islands, droughts and disrupted seasons will likely lead to more deaths – particularly among the young, the old and those with health issues. Cities will be publishing a special week of journalism next month investigating heat in cities, and we want to hear from you.How are rising temperatures affecting or changing your city?

Here are some solutionsHow do you solve a problem like tourism? It employs hundreds of millions of people, buoys entire industries – but can tear apart the very cities that benefit from it, alienating residents and causing irreversible damage to their culture and heritage.Protests across Europe have spurred talk of “responsible tourism” and forcing the sector to factor in sustainability, but the problem is already at such a scale that doing anything about it seems akin to turning around a cruise liner.What’s the way out of this mess? The most obvious solution to the problem of too many tourists is to spread them over a larger area, says Alex Dichter, a senior partner of McKinsey \u0026amp Company consultancy, which in December produced a report on managing overcrowded tourist destinations.Overcrowding is such a localised issue that even in a city apparently at breaking point, such as Barcelona, Dichter is “sure there are neighbourhoods that are overwhelmed and there are others that are in need of quite a bit more”.Many cities compound the problem by promoting only a small number of sites – often the obvious ones. Tourists can be dispersed by boosting less popular attractions and developing new ones.Encouraging visitors outside of peak times of day, season and year similarly lessens their impact. If marketing alone doesn’t work, arrival limits and pricing adjustments might do the job, says Dichter.Repeat visitors know the city better and venture beyond the must-see attractions. Laura Aalto, chief executive of Helsinki Marketing, says establishing a sense of “localhood” is key to a positive and often long-term relationship between a city and its visitors.“Nobody wants to be a tourist, everybody wants to be part-time locals,” she says. “Our job is to create the kind of circumstances, conditions and platforms for visitors who come to Helsinki to meet with the locals and not go to the most obvious attractions.”... which is to say: no hen nights and stag dos. In Barcelona it is known as “turismo de Borrachera” – having a drunken party in a strange city in order to get away with behaviour that would be considered unacceptable at home. Cities sell themselves on the strength of their cheap beer or nightlife at their peril. Amsterdam, for instance, has invested a lot in marketing itself as an arts and culture destination to shake off its reputation as a city-wide red-light district.Aalto says profiling has revealed that visitors who come to Helsinki to engage with a specific interest (“whether that be design, architecture, education or heavy metal music”) are those who will bring the most reward. “Those are the ones who will be our ambassadors for life, who are creating a relationship with the city and maybe come more and more often – they are the ones who are friends of Helsinki.”Growth is too often the measure of a successful tourism industry, says Xavier Font, a professor of sustainability marketing at the University of Surrey. “There is a sense unless we grow, we are not doing very well – but it’s causing huge problems.” He suggests marketing smarter, not necessarily more – such as packages to attract visitors for five days, not just a weekend – and targeted upselling, to draw, for example, visitors to the Sagrada Família to a crypt just outside Barcelona’s city centre.Even tweaks to advertising material can make a difference. Barcelona is still marketing itself with the same brochures it designed for the 1992 Olympics, says Font. “The only thing that’s changed is that they have been translated into more languages. Sure, the history and heritage has not changed – but the way that we consume places has changed a lot.”Adjusting pricing can be a crude but effective means of balancing supply and demand: if a destination costs more to get to, fewer people are likely to go there. Introducing variable or tiered pricing and rates for residents can help to reduce criticisms of cultural elitism or of restricting domestic tourists from accessing their own heritage, says Dichter.Many destinations have also introduced a tourist tax, revenues from which can be used to manage the industry. Font says the benefits of tourism need to be rebalanced in favour of sustainability, not hoteliers: “Why am I willing to pay hundreds of pounds a night to stay in a hotel but only a tenner to go to the Eiffel tower?”However, he cautions that raising or reducing prices can often be a knee-jerk short-term response. “Do it differently. We often mess around with the things that don’t need to be messed with.”Many cities struggling with tourist numbers have placed direct controls on accommodation, whether that by halting construction on new hotels – as in the case of both Barcelona and Amsterdam – or capping short-term homesharing on Airbnb.London, New York, Reykjavik, Amsterdam, Paris and many other cities have introduced limits, set mostly at about three months of the year, to prevent a shortage of housing supply and rent increases for locals. Dichter says he understands the logic of a limit of about 90 days: “These cities are trying to create a natural equilibrium, where you don’t have an economic incentive one way or another.”Companies such as Airbnb and Ryanair often bear the brunt of the blame for how tourism has ballooned beyond control, but that ignores the bigger picture of policies and loopholes that allow them to flourish.Budget airlines can sell flights cheaply as a result of massive tax breaks for the aviation industry, which has driven up not only tourist numbers but carbon emissions. House prices go up and there becomes a shortage of supply when housing markets are deregulated to attract offshore investors. The hotel and construction industries can be symbiotic.“When you allow international corporations to not pay corporate tax in a country, the social impact and cost is just huge,” says Font. “We can blame Airbnb for this, but it’s just the tip of the iceberg – there are a lot of factors that are not visible.”Government resources need to be devoted to sustainable tourism, politicians need to be held more accountable, and residents need to be given the opportunity to weigh in outside of election time. “Because if we wait for once every four years, it’s too late,” he says.An effective strategy for managing tourists is informed by data. “We talk to so many people in the tourism ecosystem and no one has the same facts – not even close,” says Dichter. “If you can’t even agree on how many tourists are showing up, it’s very difficult to have a proper debate.”The more information collected on tourists at every level – national, regional, municipal and sites – the clearer picture of their true costs and benefits, including economic, social and environmental. Dichter points to Amsterdam’s official app, which not only improves visitors’ experiences of the city but reports back on them too.If government and industry bodies actively consult communities on tourists’ impact, it can help to ease antagonism. Justin Francis, the director of the Responsible Travel agency, has proposed that all stakeholders work together to agree on specific signs – “limits of acceptable change”, such as resource shortages or price increases, that could be reviewed regularly – that would denote when a city has reached breaking point.But any measures taken now will have a delayed effect, says Dichter. “The only right answer is to plan.” That means drilling down into the details: “If you want more tourists, how many more? How many hotel rooms will sustain that? What’s your target mix from a nationality standpoint, and how will you work with suppliers to achieve that goal?”Ultimately, residents must be prioritised over tourists for housing, infrastructure and access to services because they have a long-term stake in the city’s success. “You need to put residents at the centre of your decision making,” says Font. “Cities are not the playgrounds of tourists we only want them because they make the city more liveable for residents.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fbdb8628564e399e23e4b386776365db6ab0b9d/0_245_4439_2664/master/4439.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0b31055e467da1452dcbe771d418445","title":"divided france world cup victory macron players","story":"France’s recent history with football has been tightly linked to the struggle over its identity. For decades, politicians have used the ersity of the national team either as a symbol of integration at work, or as a warning of Le Grand Remplacement (the big replacement) – that “ethnically French” citizens are being excluded by those whose roots lie in Africa.Following France’s win, the far-right writer Renaud Camus has retweeted videos criticising ersity in France. More than half the squad are of African origin, including key players Paul Pogba, Kylian Mbappé and N’Golo Kanté, so the team in some ways represents his greatest fears. Yet the scenes of celebration on the Champs-Élysées and beyond show how France has claimed these players. It feels like the breath of fresh air that France has so badly needed, after the trauma following the terror attacks of recent years, and an election in which the far-right Front National made the final presidential runoff. In this context, it would seem logical for Emmanuel Macron to try to use this sporting triumph to bolster his image as a successful, positive and inclusive world leader.But we’ve been here before and most can remember how this played out last time. In 1996, two years before France first won the World Cup, an Algerian Islamist group detonated a bomb on the Paris metro, killing four. The 1998 team were hailed as the answer to the country’s isions and nicknamed “black, blanc, beur” (black, white or Arab), in reference to the players such as Zinedine Zidane and Lilian Thuram who were the children of Arab and African migrants.The players were used as a form of propaganda by the president, Jacques Chirac paraded in front of the media and required to represent a country that was far more progressive and united than France really was. Four years later, Jean-Marie Le Pen shocked the country by making it through to the second round of the presidential elections. If France’s team was representing a united and multicultural country, how could this have happened?Speaking in the 2016 documentary Les Bleus, the 1998 goalkeeper for France, Bernard Lama, raised the point that the young men who had committed the recent attacks in France were French nationals of the 98 generation. The World Cup wasn’t enough to fix the underlying problems and, 20 years on, France has the same ingredients of terror attacks, the far right – and a erse, winning, national football team.The fact is that, as wonderful as football is as a sport, the jubilation of a World Cup win can only be ephemeral, so long as politicians don’t build on the energy it creates. This national win could only be a catalyst for change if Macron decides to act on it.In these places, footballers are hailed as heroes not just when they win a World Cup, but just for signing at a lower league club – for breaking a cycle of poverty when the life chances for young people in these areas are so low. This success has nothing to do with government policies, and everything to do with the skill and determination of the iniduals. France star player Ousmane Dembélé is an example of this. In a recent documentary, Dembélé speaks about his neighbourhood as being his strength. “It’s helped me to become a good person,” he says. “I won’t forget where I’m from because we have dealt with things that other people haven’t.”Within hours of the victory, the cracks were beginning to show. Police clashed with revellers and suspended public transport to the suburbs, preventing many young people from joining in the celebration. If Macron really wants to claim this win, he has to\u0026nbspinvest in these communities to give them opportunities beyond football. The players have proven themselves, twice over, as French citizens, and given\u0026nbsphope to the nation: it’s now Macron’s job to give\u0026nbsphope to their communities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f5dd86af930ca9459a5fc0c01ecd7ffa4a1fe82/0_147_3188_1913/master/3188.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f780eeccc8a6789fa5299f0c4f7b2e74","title":"im a woman about to turn 60 heres what ive learned about life","story":"Never worry about what others think, as they will think it anyway, there is only one anti-ageing serum I would recommend … and don’t lie about how old you areWhat do women really want? To be told: “Good on ya for that Nobel prize.” Too often, people seem to think it is, “You’ve lost weight,” or, “You don’t look your age” – which is just a way of saying: “Well done, you, for not being on this planet long and for not taking too much space on it.”There is a form of insanity that kicks in at the age you are told you ought to start Botox – your mid-20s. That’s when the lies about how old you are start. Geri Halliwell said she was 21 when she joined the Spice Girls she was actually 25. All sorts of people have lied about their age: Joseph Stalin, Nancy Reagan, Sandra Bullock, Eminem.Civilians do it, too. Online dating is ridden with it. People are knocking 10 years off their ages in that old knocking shop. Men add inches to their height, which is fine as long as they spend the whole evening sitting down. Women pretend they are looking forward to their 40th birthday. Big lies, little lies … I have colleagues who are vague about their age. Some of them appear to have had children when they were seven. Miraculous, really. I get why they think the media is not a good country for old women. Few of us are left. So “work” has to be done, constant gym-going, good lighting and avoiding bingo (wings). Toned arms for ever. Still, this is a losers’ game, being ashamed of your own maturity.This is on my mind. I have a big birthday this week. I am older than Nigel Farage – let’s put it that way.

Our culture says yes. It tells me women are past it at 35. It tells me I must age only in the manner of someone who was once a model. It employs a bizarre lexicon of “milfs” and “cougars” that means zilch to me. Or it says: look at Madonna – and I am delighted to. It’s her job, after all, to look and be incredible.I gaze upon our youth, especially in this weather, as they glow with urgency, and I remember all that fondly, but I know that my time is now. The anxiety of menopause has come and gone and let me know that my energy is now for me – that I am responsible for my own happiness. I have spent my disposable income on getting “work” done, not on my face (too late), but on my brain. I went back to college. This is the only anti-ageing serum I would recommend.That doesn’t make me like my belly or my lines any more, but you know what?

But is that the meaning of life? That is for you to decide.We are told that women my age are embarrassing, while men my age are hitting their prime – but surely in this era of self-identification, we all know the inside doesn’t match the outside – and I am actually 14. Hopefully, I will get the documents soon.The only wisdom I have accrued is that it doesn’t help to worry about what others think, as they will think it anyway. Don’t act out of obligation. You are allowed to waste your own time. As Nora Ephron said of a friend who had tongue cancer and so couldn’t eat a last meal: “Have your last meal all the time.” This is how I intend to live.

I was on a train home from Paddington station, and the carriage’s air-conditioning was just about fighting off the heat outside. Most people seemed to be staring at their phones – in many cases, they were trying to stream a World Cup match, as the 4G signal came and went, and Great Western Railway’s onboard wifi proved to be maddeningly erratic. The trebly chatter of headphone leakage was constant. And thousands of miles and a few time zones away in Loudoun County, Virginia, one of the world’s largest concentrations of computing power was playing its part in keeping everything I saw ticking over, as data from around the world passed back and forth from its vast buildings.I was reminded of all this by the recently published book New Dark Age, by the British writer James Bridle. He cites a study in Japan that suggests that by 2030, the power requirements of digital services will outstrip the nation’s entire current generation capacity. He quotes an American report from 2013 – ironically enough, commissioned by coal industry lobbyists – that pointed out that using either a tablet or smartphone to wirelessly watch an hour of video a week used roughly the same amount of electricity (largely consumed at the data-centre end of the process) as two new domestic fridges.If you worry about climate change and a cause celebre such as the expansion of Heathrow airport, it is worth considering that data centres are set to soon have a bigger carbon footprint than the entire aviation industry. Yet as Bridle points out, even that statistic doesn’t quite do justice to some huge potential problems. He mentions the vast amounts of electricity consumed by the operations of the online currency Bitcoin – which, at the height of the speculative frenzies earlier this year, was set to produce an annual amount of carbon dioxide equivalent to 1m transatlantic flights. And he’s anxious about what will happen next: “In response to vast increases in data storage and computational capacity in the last decade, the amount of energy used by data centres has doubled every four years, and is expected to triple in the next 10 years.”These changes are partly being driven by the so-called internet of things: the increasing array of everyday devices – from TVs, through domestic security devices, to lighting systems, and countless modes of transport – that constantly emit and receive data. If driverless cars ever arrive in our lives, those same flows will increase hugely. At the same time, the accelerating rollout of the internet and its associated technologies in the developing world will add to the load. About a decade ago, we were being told to fight climate change by switching off our TVs and stereos. If the battle is now even more urgent, how does it fit with a world in which router lights constantly flicker, and all the devices we own will be in constant, energy-intensive communication with distant mega-computers?And among the big tech corporations, there is one big focus of worry: Amazon, whose ever-expanding cloud computing wing, Amazon Web Services, offers “the on-demand delivery of computer power, database storage … and other IT resources” and provides most of the computing power behind Netflix. This sits at the heart of data centres’ relentless expansion.

They talk about eventually rationing internet use, insisting that people send black and white images, or forcibly pushing them away from binge-streaming videos.

Transition days are children’s first experience of their new big school – the idea is to gently help them to\u0026nbspget used to a new, often daunting, environment, and meet children in their form group.“A transition day should be about reassuring children that they will feel safe at secondary school in September and that the school will\u0026nbspvalue them,” says Finch.Douglas enjoyed the first of his two transition days at Oxford Spires academy, which included investigations in the science lab and a fun dodgeball contest, but on the second day he was faced with a multiple choice reading comprehension quiz, a “write as\u0026nbspmuch as you can in 10 minutes” essay and a spelling test. “He was doing something he had never done before, in\u0026nbspa hall he had never been in before. He was told he could only look forward or down. My son likes tests but even he felt nervous.”Finch says the practice also raises questions about what Sats (the statutory assessments at the end of\u0026nbspprimary school) are for.Oxford Spires is not the only secondary school that has been testing primary school pupils during their transition days this summer in what University of Cambridge professor of education Diane Reay describes as a “shocking but not surprising” trend, as schools try to assess the abilities of their new intake amid concerns that Sats are unreliable. Other parents and teachers across the country, from South Yorkshire to Bournemouth, also reported transition day testing at academies in their area.Alexandra Stevens, a year 6 teacher at a Bournemouth primary school, reports some of her pupils are feeling anxious about the outcome of tests they say they took on a transition day this term. “We spend a lot of time preparing our pupils so that they don’t perceive Sats as worrying or threatening, and can do their best. I don’t think these transition day tests will yield reliable data – and why are children having to do Sats at all, if the secondary schools aren’t using the results as a guide?”Bristol primary school teacher James Walker is considering advising parents not to send their children on transition days to local academies Oasis Brislington and John Williams in future. He says several of his year\u0026nbsp6 pupils – including a child with autism – were distressed by the tests they were forced to sit. “We’ve got a lot of vulnerable children in our school. Transition is a really tricky time for them and it’s important they form good relationships with the new adults in their lives. Some schools are not doing a good job of welcoming our children and making them feel happy and excited about secondary school.”Instead, pupils may start associating their new school with stress and failure. “Children are not going to do their best when unfamiliar adults give them an unfamiliar test in unfamiliar surroundings – and then some could be put straight into the bottom set, based on weak and inaccurate data. A child’s Sats results are a much better measure of what they can achieve. I hope these schools aren’t trying to make sure the kids get low scores in these tests so they can later show that they have made progress.”Reay says transition day testing is an example of “the relentless counting culture” in schools. “Schooling should provide a\u0026nbsppositive climate that enables all children to flourish. If the first day at a\u0026nbspsecondary school involves plunging children into what feels for many like a threatening testing situation, then pastoral duty is being neglected.”A Department for Education spokesperson says: “We trust schools to induct new pupils and determine what support they may need as they see fit. We also expect them to do this in a thoughtful way that does not put undue pressure on\u0026nbspchildren.”Oxford Spires academy’s principal, Marianne Blake, says the tests this summer were a trial and that she would welcome feedback from parents about the arrangements. She says: “We felt this was a potentially valuable way of ensuring tailored support was in place for students when they start in September, rather than part-way through the autumn term. We will fully review the impact of this trial on our students’ progress, and only then will we decide whether to run tests on future transition days.”The multi-academy trust Oasis Community Learning says that, during transition days at its Oasis Brislington and John Williams academies, students enjoy fun activities with their new classmates and teachers, and are shown around the school. They also take a multiple-choice reading-age test on the computer. “The data provided is used alongside Sats and the visits our teachers make to primary schools, to provide an\u0026nbspaccurate and holistic picture of a\u0026nbspchild’s prior and\u0026nbspcurrent attainment. By completing the reading-age test prior to the summer, our students are reassured that their teachers know how best to support and challenge them from the first day, results are not skewed by academic regression over the long break, and, most importantly, it\u0026nbspreduces the need to move students around groups in late September once they have already begun to settle and make new friendships. The vast majority of our parents praise the arrangements.”A spokesman for the NAHT headteachers’ union pointed out that Sats took place only two months ago: “There really is no reason to test this year’s group of primary school leavers again. Transition days should be about acclimatisation and preparing year 6 children to be successful as they move on to secondary school.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36fd48efe75c987748ba485a2265dfad76360768/114_240_2327_1396/master/2327.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46da0c00c33edce217983dbded96a3d1","title":"common cranes here to stay after recolonising eastern england","story":"Model predicts population of UK’s tallest bird could double within 50 years after its return to the east of England following a 400-year absenceCommon cranes which recolonised eastern England less than 40 years ago after a 400-year absence are now here to stay, research has found. There could be as many as 275 breeding pairs of the UK’s tallest bird within 50 years, scientists at the University of Exeter, the RSPB and the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT) predict. Cranes were lost from the UK as a breeding bird in the 16th century as a result of hunting and the drainage of large areas of wetlands, but some returned to the east of England in 1979. Conservationists supported the small population, but they breed slowly and their numbers remained low over the next two decades, leaving the population at risk of disappearing again if hit by problems such as disease. A new population model, published in a paper in the journal Animal Conservation, found that an important part of the growth in numbers until 2010 were new arrivals from continental Europe.Then conservationists began to import eggs and release fledgling cranes in the west of England as part of the “great crane project”, which by 2014 had boosted the UK population with 90 new birds. Dr Andrea Soranio-Redondo, who led the research as part of her PhD, said: “Any small and newly established group is particularly vulnerable to random events such as an outbreak of disease. “Knowing how many there are isn’t enough to predict whether they’re safe. Understanding the interplay between new arrivals, births and deaths enables us to judge the risk they face and predict their future with far more certainty.” Prof Stuart Bearhop of the University of Exeter said: “Of course it is obvious that adding birds will boost the population size, but what we find here is that these additional birds, as they establish themselves and become breeders, are a key element in the future persistence of this charismatic species in the UK.” Schemes to move wildlife such as eggs or chicks from healthy populations to bolster numbers elsewhere were often thought of as expensive and risky. But conservationists said the findings showed that wildlife translocation, alongside other measures such as providing the right habitat, could help accelerate the recovery of species. The next challenge to help cranes, which are now a regular sight in the east of England, Somerset and Gloucestershire, is to ensure enough wetlands for them to breed safely, experts said, urging authorities to restore whole landscapes so there are more, bigger, better quality and joined-up areas of habitat for wildlife.

With forecasters predicting a return to hot dry weather for the rest of July, we are now at a point where we will need to impose some temporary restrictions on customers.”Soaring summer temperatures have seen utilities companies across England urging customers to be careful about their water usage, but United Utilities is the first to announce a hosepipe ban.The “temporary use ban” will apply to customers in Merseyside, Lancashire, Greater Manchester and Cumbria, with the exception of Carlisle and north-east Cumbria’s Eden District.Padley said: “It is not a decision we have taken lightly and we are enormously grateful to customers for having helped reduce the demand on our network over the last couple of weeks, but unless we get a period of sustained rainfall before 5 August these restrictions will help us safeguard essential water supplies for longer.” In Northern Ireland, a hosepipe ban has been in effect since 29 June, with an extra 175m litres of water being pumped into the network in an effort to keep up with demand.Other utilities firms – including Severn Trent Water, South Staffs Water, Anglian Water, Northumbrian Water, Bristol Water and Thames Water – all said they were not planning hosepipe bans when contacted on Monday.The ban in north-west England restricts the use of hosepipes or sprinklers for watering private gardens and washing cars but customers will still be able to use watering cans and wash their vehicles with a bucket and sponge, United Utilities said.Sarah Kent, a Met Office meteorologist, said that other than the odd shower there was no significant rainfall expected in the north-west of England during the next week. “There’s a lot of fine and dry weather in the forecast and with the exception of showers, there’s not any significant rainfall expected over the next week,” she said.A hosepipe uses about 540 litres an hour, as much as a family of four would use in one day, while a sprinkler left running overnight uses as much water as that family would use in one week.United Utilities said the ban was alongside the company’s efforts to maintain essential supplies, including maximising water abstraction from groundwater supplies, moving water around its regional integrated network of pipes, and running a campaign to encourage customers to use water wisely. Carlisle and the north-eastern corner of Eden District are exempt because they receive their water from discrete supply network zones fed by local water sources that have not been so badly affected by the overall lack of rainfall, the company said. • The headline on this story was corrected on 17 July 2018.

But after just a few scenes, all I could say was: Gimme, Gimme, GimmeBenny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus of Abba must over the years have considered what they would do if they were asked to sign off on a second iteration of what can only be called the Mamma Mia! movie franchise – which first appeared in 2008. Perhaps they thought that, in the words of the song: “If I had to do the same again, I would my friend, because quite frankly it’s a licence to print money.”That first film made me break out in a combination of hives and bubonic plague. And to be honest, this new one does have the original film’s plotless melange of feelgoodery, an exotically amorphous jellyfish of a film which is periodically zapped with the million-volt shock of a zingingly brilliant Abba tune.But something in the sheer relentless silliness and uncompromising ridiculousness of this, combined with a new flavour of self-aware comedy, made me smile in spite of myself: there are funny, campy performances from Cher, Christine Baranski, Julie Walters and also Alexa Davies as Walters’s younger self, and some very good lines. People are always running absurdly around a Greek island waving their arms in the air like they just don’t care and it’s always sunny, except when – gasp! – there’s a storm and plans for the relaunch of a tourist hotel are briefly and unimportantly derailed. This film reminded me weirdly in its staging of Kenneth Branagh‘s 90s film version of Much Ado About Nothing, with its golden southern European hues and beaming cast. There’s the same bizarre plot convolutions and holiday-romance departure from reality.After the first film, I noted that the song Fernando was not included and suggested that next time they should include a hearing-impaired character of that name and someone desperately worried should bang a particular percussion instrument and ask of Fernando a certain impassioned question. In fact, Cher sings Fernando now, and addresses it to a bearded Andy Garcia who is the hotel manager and whose first name has been withheld from us until this point. This ballad of the Mexican-American war has supposedly been updated to memories of 1959, with Andy presumably a veteran of postwar Mexican insurrection against the one-party state? Cher has a blonde wig for this number and she looks like Madonna on Xanax singing Don’t Cry for Me Argentina. It is very – and I think intentionally – funny.The setting is the modern Greece in which the fisherfolk sit around, as someone remarks, in joyless subjection to their economic woes. Sophie, played by Amanda Seyfried, is planning to relaunch her hotel but her relationship with Sky (Dominic Cooper) is in crisis. Her emotional worries give her a new insight into how her mum must have felt at her age and this is Donna, played in cameo by Meryl Streep.Half the film will be taken up in flashback to the life of young Donna, played by Lily James. It is supposed to be the late 70s, and she impulsively shows up on this unnamed Greek island, and equally impulsively shags young Pierce Brosnan, played by Jeremy Irvine and then young Stellan Skarsgard, played by Josh Dylan – having already in Paris impulsively shagged young Colin Firth, played by Hugh Skinner. And then of course she gets pregnant, creating the who-is-the-dad mystery which the original stage version borrowed from the otherwise utterly forgotten 1968 film Buona Sera Mrs Campbell, starring Gina Lollobrigida.In the present day, these chaps’ middleaged selves will of course turn up, although this sequel disappointingly shies away from the suggestion that Colin Firth’s character Harry is gay. But the big new character is of course Donna’s mother Ruby, played drolly by Cher, who shows up on the island by helicopter. For some reason.The surreal larkiness is crucially leavened with some nice lines, mostly given to Donna’s mate Tanya, in both her present day form, played by Christine Baranski, and her younger self, Jessica Keenan Wynn. In the past, I have discussed the three stages that Abba have gone through in the public mind: first being reviled, then being ironically liked (this being the milieu of the 1994 Toni Collette movie Muriel’s Wedding and perhaps also Alan Partridge’s 1992 chat show Knowing Me, Knowing You) and finally just flat-out adored as pop geniuses. The Mamma Mia movies are of course sited in the third era, but maybe they are actually reclaiming some of the irony and tongue-in-cheekiness of the second phase, repurposing it as zany surreality.There is, after all, not much else that they can do, given that the juke-box musical format will stretch conventional dramatic credibility to breaking point for just one film, never mind two. (Or three? Four?) This whole thing looks like a preposterous and mad dream you might have after eating your bodyweight in feta. More enjoyable than I thought. But please. Enough now.

I mean, ‘It’s coming home’! I had to say that.”Has the unofficial anthem of England’s perennially underachieving football team accidentally backfired?After the nation took the Three Lions to its heart - and back to number one in the charts - during the men’s national team’s heady run to the World Cup semi-finals, questions are being asked over whether what started off as an ironic nostalgic chant may have been inadvertently perceived as an arrogant boast by rival nations.The ITV commentator Jacqui Oatley described having an argument outside a Moscow hotel following the World Cup final with the former Croatian international Slaven Bilic and the ex-Uruguay player Diego Forlan about the song.She said that both former footballers were adamant that, despite its original meaning, the revival of the song by David Baddiel, Frank Skinner, and the Lightning Seeds made the English “come across as arrogant”.Oatley said she had explained its original meaning to the former players: “It was about England being rubbish at football and a little bit wistful and taking the mickey. The reason it took off this time was because the fans were just happy.”Croatian players cited British media hype around their semi-final with England as an impetus for the victory, with Vedran Ćorluka telling British journalists “it’s not coming home” after winning the match. “If it’s so widely perceived as being arrogant - not just outside these shores but also in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland - then maybe there’s something in it,” Oakley said.“Should that be the song that’s played when England win a match?” If that’s something that stokes up the opposition then is that really in England’s interest?”Anthony Sarver, a features writer for Get French Football News, said Paris-based sports outlets felt the song was hubristic: “What the English might have felt was a melange of national pride and self-deprecation, others took it as the arrogance of golden age-thinking and falling back on the success of the Premier League.“L’Équipe instead saw it and the sensationalization of Gareth Southgate’s subjectively small achievements as embarrassing, with the view in France that ,whilst he had done a good job to give England a semblance of organisation of the kind that an England team has rarely seen before, their favourable route to the semi-final, over-reliance on set pieces and lack of a midfield controller were weaknesses critically ignored by the praise they received in the English press and the excitement of the country’s fans.”In an attempt to diffuse the situation. Gary Lineker, the BBC’s main football host, used a tweet addressed to non English football fans to highlight that it was a “fun song highlighting the lack of success of our football team for decades” and those singing it didn’t truly think England would win the trophy.“I totally get why you might think it was arrogance, but it’s more our self deprecatory sense of humour,” he insisted.Sam Diss, the commissioning editor of the football lifestyle magazine Mundial, said the song’s meaning had changed as England’s underrated team began to work its way through the knock-out stages and memes relating to the song spread across Twitter and WhatsApp groups. “It definitely started as a joke. But if you tell yourself a lie enough you start to think it’s the truth. By Colombia, I’d fully drunk the Coming Home Kool-Aid.“Gary Lineker said it was just another example of British humour but everyone definitely thought for varying lengths of time that we could win it,” he said, admitting a backlash from rival nations was probably inevitable after the tournament. “You can’t act like knobheads for a month and drunkenly slur along to a 22-year old song and then not get it thrown back in your face.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4126b99419f2d2176687a1d102eeb4b51302ff27/0_0_1820_1092/master/1820.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=481dcea81f99ca778dcb47857496d714","title":"the world cup colour chart a photographic journey","story":"Looking back at the highs and lows of Russia 2018 via a rainbow of imagery, from Gareth Southgate to France lifting the trophy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db395978ad1bef6be6669cfdb44a7f3404226ea4/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7191d7d497e289ecf55b6246e348002","title":"france croatia final trophy russia 2018 ends on high world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France’s World Cup final triumph over Croatia, another penalty, another controversial VAR incident, the tournament’s highs and lows and players taking shots to the conkers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfb041c191609e9acbbdd0f726715168348d6948/1046_295_927_556/master/927.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db222dee2935749117ed2eddc01ae210","title":"nigeria poverty stricken families struggle survive","story":"Families living on £1.50 a day or less tell of the hardships of life in the oil-rich nation, which now has the greatest concentration of extreme poverty Nkechi John, 39, lives in a single room with her four children and husband, who is a welder.

I couldn’t even sell all of the cake I made today to make up to 400 naira. “I am tired of life,” she says, adding she can believe poverty is now worse than in India. “The suffering’s too much. The president and government need to do something before we all die.“I try to do some farming, but there is no money to buy fertiliser and the crops have all turned yellow due to the lack of it. And only two of our school-age kids are in school because we can’t afford it.” Uche Joseph Uwaleke, an economist at Nasarawa State University in Nigeria’s central region, explains why there has been an increase in extreme poverty. “There is the issue of insecurity in the north-east. Although the Boko Haram violence has been reduced to a manageable level, local farmers in that region are still afraid of going to farms.“Despite the end of the recession, manufacturing, the transportation sector and agriculture have still not recovered.”He also blames poor governance. “The late approval and poor implementation of the budget is another reason for the growing poverty.

Share your tips for cooling down, as well as your weekend exploits, below the line as usualSorry for the late blog this week, turns out that sometimes when you feel feverish in the heat, it’s because you are actually feverish, rather than just hot. In fact, I seem generally to be de-acclimatising to the heat. The first couple of weeks of the heatwave were just lovely -but while I’m certainly not complaining of the continued sunshine, I’m definitely not converted to the joys of a run in 30 degrees. Running on London streets at the moment feels like running in the Caribbean, only without the cooling sea breezes, beach-based cool down and, well, all of the good stuff.Of course, hot temperatures do affect your running - even if you are used to more tropical climates than the UK. And that’s true for the very best runners too - in fact, a cooler temperature is even better for the super-speedy as they generate more heat. Even just an easy run when the temperature is as hot as it has been recently can feel an ordeal. Personally, I find it hits quite suddenly - the first couple of miles might be fine, but there’s a moment after that where my head just instantly goes from fine to “about to explode with heat”. Dousing a cap in water can help - or just trickling it down the back of your neck. Heading for shady woodland paths is ideal if possible, but alas, London has yet to build me a special shaded tree-lined 400m track. So, what are your tips for hot weather running, and how was the weekend for you? As always, share your stories below the line - and apologies again for lateness.

The company has misjudged its forecast three times in the past 10 quarters.In total, Netflix said it had added 670,000 streaming customers in the US, barely more than half its anticipated 1.2 million subscribers. It also missed its anticipated overseas subscriber estimates by over 500,000.Analyst Daniel Ives at GB Insights said the results were a “near-term gut punch” to the Netflix bull thesis. After years of blowing Wall Street expectations, Ives added: ‘This is a clear speed bump for Netflix as the international miss was most concerning given this is the linchpin to the core growth thesis for the coming years.”In a letter to shareholders, Netflix said subscriber growth in the US through the first six months of this year is still ahead of the comparable period last year. But it also warned that subscriber growth in the current third quarter would likely be around 5 million, again below analysts’ expectations of 6.3 million.With subscription-streaming services now becoming the dominant business model for video content, Netflix is beginning to face competition for content from rivals like Amazon and Apple.Netflix is expected to invest as much as $12bn on content this year, but could face growing competition in the streaming market. Apple is upping its spending on original content in video, music and publishing to $4.2bn by 2022 from $1bn this year. Amazon is expected to almost double its spending on original content from $4.5bn to $8.3bn.The boom in video streaming is causing established Hollywood movie studios to rapidly re-order their business models. AT\u0026ampT is set to acquire Time Warner and both Disney and Comcast are in a bidding war for 21st Century Fox.While Netflix says its anticipates greater competition, it has also been investing heavily in foreign markets, including India. The company also struck a unique deal with Barack and Michelle Obama to produce shows and documentaries.But Netflix has not been immune to turbulence, and moved to fire chief communications officer Jonathan Friedland after he used a racial slur in his conversations at work. Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings later blamed his own privilege for leading him to minimize race issues and said Netflix had work to do to improve.In his shareholders letter, Hastings touted Netflix’s recent Emmys achievement, beating out HBO with 112 nominations. He also praised films like Set It Up and The Kissing Booth, which he said had been viewed by “tens of millions”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bb50feb43aba18ca226809f951e19d6ab324bde/0_91_5950_3570/master/5950.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11857271599dcde37ec14f61062584dd","title":"student loans company repayments calculate","story":"I am having a nightmare with the Student Loans Company.

Then Eddie Izzard said: You’ve won!’I was born Ryan Owen Granville Williams but, because I was lighter-skinned, everyone called me Roni, after the only white character in the film Babylon. I was quite short and if my mates were talking about a girl, they’d say: “Oh, she’s Roni’s size.” So that’s how I came up with the name Roni Size. Getting expelled from school in Bristol was one of the best things that ever happened to me. I started going to the city’s Sefton Park youth centre and they had a drum machine. Suddenly I had something that excited me. Then they got a sampler and I was in the basement all the time, making tunes. We wanted to make music that sounded like the future. So the track Beatbox was just us making drum patterns with our own voices. Brown Paper Bag started off as samples of double bass licks. I chopped them up on the sampler and suddenly there was a song. The title didn’t mean anything. It was just something that came to me after smoking herb, which I did back then. At first, the album went right over people’s heads. One reviewer described it as: “Kids in a bedroom on drugs fiddling around with computers.” But when we started touring, with a bass-player and a drummer, people went: “Wow.” We found out we’d been nominated for the 1997 Mercury prize just after we’d played the Montreux jazz festival. We were up against Radiohead, the Prodigy, the Spice Girls and the Chemical Brothers. Because we were so tired, we moaned all the way to the ceremony, and just scoffed all the free food and alcohol. Then Eddie Izzard said: “I think you’ve won it!” And all the cameras started moving towards our table. We were broke, so winning was the stuff of dreams. When I announced that I was donating the £20,000 cheque to the Sefton Park youth centre, my crew looked at me as if to say: “You’re doing what?” I met Roni at a club in Didcot, Oxfordshire, in 1995. It was one of my first shows and I was the only MC there. “Do you want me to stay on the mic,” I said, “or get off?” He told me to keep going. A month later someone said: “Remember that Roni guy? He’s trying to get hold of you.” I jumped on the train to Bristol and eventually moved up there. No disrespect to Gloucester, my home town, but Bristol was much more exciting. There were lots of clubs and parties – and Massive Attack, Tricky and Portishead were all inspiring each other. I’d grown up with fast music: house, rave and jungle. We took all that energy and put it into a melting pot on New Forms. The collective was just the right amount of chefs: DJ Krush was strings-oriented, DJ Suv brought science-fiction type soundscapes, DJ Die was good at cut-ups, scratches and bass lines, while Onallee was a wonderful singer and songwriter. I feature on Railing and Brown Paper Bag, which was just a working title until I went: “Step to the rhythm made out of brown paper!” It built from there. If it had been called anything else, the rap would have been totally different. The album title was about saying who we were and what we represented, but we had no idea it would have such impact. My strongest memories of the Mercury are the meal – monkfish – and meeting TV hypnotist Paul McKenna. I went: “Wow, I love your show!” And he went: “Never mind my show, tell me about your album!” It felt like we were flying the flag for the entire drum’n’bass scene. The Mercury statue is still in Roni’s front room. We went in as 100-1 outsider kids from the West Country and came out as champions. I wish I’d put a tenner on us."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/488c4a496fb27c393f677d3ba0fc980cbaafb328/0_10_5456_3274/master/5456.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e09d2544b046aebc98141e6d411827ea","title":"weatherwatch heatwaves atmospheric blocking pressure","story":"An occasional series on weather terminology: stationary areas of pressure can lead to prolonged heatwaves and cold spellsThe “beast from the east” cold of late winter 2018 and the arid heat of the UK’s summer so far, are united by one pronounced meteorological phenomenon: atmospheric blocking. Large meanders in the jet stream often lead to the development of huge anticyclones – areas of high pressure that can remain stationary for weeks at a time.A blocking area of high pressure, sitting over Scandinavia and western Russia in February and early March, maintained a static weather pattern and pulled in a conveyor of sub-zero air to the UK. Just four months later, blocking allowed high pressure to settle close to the UK. This has resulted in very warm and extremely dry conditions with some central and southern parts of the UK seeing no measurable rain for over a month. Predicting when and where atmospheric blocking will take place is difficult, although there are some clues. One signal is solar activity, the levels of radiation, sunspots and other solar phenomena that ebb and flow on a periodic 11-year cycle. Studies have shown that, on average, a decrease in solar activity can promote an increase in atmospheric blocking, although the relationship is complex."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a3fac9dfb5fb8c08876ce58761fd28098875b73/0_0_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30481efad219d88cb8d03a12236f6541","title":"british school archaeology iraq nimrud agatha christie","story":"Launched in 1932 the school has spent almost a century uncovering Iraq’s ancient treasures, including the spectacular Assyrian capital at NimrudOn a dark November day in 1929, the nascent British School of Archaeology in Iraq launched its appeal for funds. Central Hall in Westminster was packed to overflowing and the audience was treated to a lantern slide show of recent discoveries in Iraq, followed by a long list of speakers, including the Archbishop of Canterbury and Lady Astor, Britain’s first female MP. Presiding as chairman was Major-General Sir Percy Cox. After the first world war, Cox had served as the first High Commissioner of Iraq at the beginning of British Mandate rule, and it was in this role that he had come to be friends with Gertrude Bell.The British School of Archaeology in Iraq (BSAI) was Gertrude Bell’s idea and she was the reason for this gathering of the great and good. Famous as a traveller and writer, and deeply tangled in the politics of mandated Iraq and the wider Middle East, Bell’s primary passion throughout her life was archaeology. When she died in 1926 she left £6,000 with the trustees of the British Museum to be used to found the BSAI.The appeal for funds in 1929 had a target of a further £14,000 to make the school viable, but the timing was bad just a month earlier the Wall Street Crash had triggered the Great Depression and by the winter of 1931 the fund stood at just £9,359. Nevertheless, just as the British Mandate in Iraq was coming to an end, the BSAI was launched, although on a smaller scale than had been originally intended.The school’s stated goals were focused on enabling British archaeologists and students to work in Iraq or on Iraqi material, through directly funding excavations and by providing scholarships and travel grants. Short of the funds it needed to operate in Iraq, the BSAI struggled through the 1930s until work was stopped by the war. Without its own fieldwork, the school helped Iraqi archaeologists to publish their work through the BSAI’s journal ‘Iraq’.The post-war years smiled on the British School of Archaeology in Iraq. In 1946 the school received its first government funding and in 1947 parliament voted it £4,000, allowing the BSAI to finally buy a house in Baghdad and set up shop properly. Sir Max Mallowan was appointed as the first director and immediately took up residence, along with a secretary, six students and Agatha Christie, Sir Max’s more famous wife. Christie is still noted in archaeology circles for having written the archaeological crime novel Murder in Mesopotamia. Mallowan and the British School spent the next decade excavating the spectacular ancient Assyrian capital at Nimrud, which was partly destroyed by ISIS militants in 2015.The BSAI kept busy in the 1960s with new excavations at Tell al-Rimah and Tell Taya. The school moved to bigger and better Baghdad premises and by the early 1970s it was hosting around 70 students and researchers per year. As well as running a packed excavation programme, the BSAI was a hub for an eclectic range of foreign visitors and diplomats, and a vibrant point of contact between international and Iraqi archaeologists. The school’s library was probably the best collection of books on Mesopotamian archaeology in the Middle East, in addition to having an excellent selection of crime fiction. Baghdad in the 1970s and 80s was a thriving, modern and dynamic city and life at the BSAI was rich and exciting. Trouble, however, was on the horizon in 1968 the Ba’ath party had seized power and life was becoming more and more difficult for Iraqis and foreigners alike. In 1973 a new law required all foreign schools to re-register the British School’s application, along with most of the others, was refused and it was officially closed down. Nicholas Postgate, the director at that time, convinced a sympathetic Iraqi Department of Antiquities to allow work to continue under a new name. Relocated to new premises, the BSAI continued under the alias of The British Archaeological Expedition in Iraq.In 1976 Agatha Christie died and her passing was marked by the BSAI in London with solemn tributes. Her ghost still lingered at the Baghdad HQ, partly in the form of the toilet chair she had had constructed so that she didn’t have to squat over site latrines. Unfortunately, this throne, complete with specially imported toilet seat, is lost to history as it was inadvertently burnt by an intoxicated member of the excavation team on Guy Fawkes night sometime in the late 1970s.In 1977, a new intensive phase of fieldwork began for the school, initiated by a programme of major dam construction in northern Iraq. The Department of Antiquities invited foreign teams to conduct salvage excavations in the vast areas which were to be flooded and the BSAI swung into action. Compared to current projects, fieldwork was on an epic scale, with teams maintained in the field for six to nine months of the year, employing large numbers of local workmen. The work was hard and sometimes unpredictable on one occasion the Iraqi authorities decided to test the Eski Mosul Dam without informing anyone first, meaning that villagers and archaeologists alike were forced to save what they could and flee a wave of rapidly rising water.The Iran-Iraq war introduced new dangers and challenges through the 1980s. Food supplies were erratic and the BSAI staff had to queue with everyone else for essentials like bread and eggs. Without diplomatic contacts or company fixers life at the school was tough there was no running water and frequent power cuts. The increasingly shabby school house became home to collapsing furniture, spiders, termites and fleas. From the roof, staff could watch the fall of Iranian Scud missiles into the Baghdad suburbs. Life was ever more restrictive it was dangerous to carry a map or a camera, all letters were opened and read by the Iraqi censors, and the government minister in the house next door was killed after falling out of favour. Iraqi archaeologists no longer visited, although BSAI staff still passed on books and journals when they could. The eruption of the First Gulf War in 1990 brought an end to international archaeology in Iraq. The British School locked its doors in Baghdad, hoping to return soon, and shifted fieldwork to Syria and Bahrain. This began a period in which the purpose of the BSAI fundamentally changed. Alarmed by the first flush of looting which swept sanction-hit Iraq in the mid-1990s, the BSAI found itself becoming increasingly involved in what would become an ongoing heritage crisis. Instead of funding British students to go to Iraq, the BSAI started to fund Iraqis to come to study in Britain. The school sent academic books and periodicals to Iraqi universities, which were cut off from international scholarship, and funded conservation work at the Iraq Museum. After the US invasion in 2003, the BSAI set up a major fundraising effort to help Iraqi heritage and two new aims were added to the school’s constitution to assist Iraqi colleagues and to inform and engage the public about what was happening to Iraq and its cultural heritage. At the height of the post-Saddam looting, disaster struck for the BSAI. Since its first parliamentary grant in 1946, the school had become increasingly dependent on government money rather than its endowments and subscribers. By the early 2000s the school had long relied on a large annual block grant from the British Academy, but the model of giving large sums to schools and societies, rather than targeting specific projects, was falling out of favour, as to some extent were institutions like the BSAI, which were considered too narrow and to some could appear antiquated, with a lingering odour of colonialism. British Academy funding was reduced through the late 1990s, halved in 2007 and withdrawn entirely in 2009. Frustration at the BSAI was enormous as they watched the same UK government which had done little to prevent the looting and ransacking of Iraqi sites and museums after the war pull the plug on one of the few UK organisations which was doing anything about it. The British School of Archaeology in Iraq faced extinction after 75 years. In the event, the British School didn’t die but managed to reinvent itself. In 2007 it was re-founded as the British Institute for the Study of Iraq (BISI) no longer restricted to archaeology and history, no longer focused on facilitating British archaeologists, but on promoting Iraqi heritage and culture and on assisting Iraqi heritage specialists through partnerships, collaborations and scholarships. With considerable difficulty the financial crisis was at least partially overcome through a combination of fundraising, realising assets, and substantial support from the British Museum. Allowed to retain its office space at the British Academy, the BISI could continue to function, although on a reduced level.Ten years on, the work of the British Institute for the Study of Iraq is now well established. Forty Iraqi researchers have benefitted from visiting scholarships to the UK and BISI organises frequent events to promote Iraqi culture. BISI has played an important part in the return of international archaeologists to fieldwork in Iraq after a generational hiatus. It has also had a major role in the establishment of the new Basra Museum, opened just a few months ago, very much in the spirit of Gertrude Bell, who herself founded the Iraq Museum in Baghdad. None of this, however, would have been possible without the network of contacts and the good will generated through the BSAI years. Although BISI no longer engages in the grand-scale excavation projects of its past, the current approach of BISI, focused more on helping people and their heritage and less on putting large holes in archaeological sites, is what Iraqi heritage needs in the short and medium term. Gertrude Bell’s British School of Archaeology in Iraq may have gone through a lot since its inception in 1926, but it’s still very much alive and perhaps more relevant than ever."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6116ae2e76d71db6ca933b4c9ceb79a2826bd179/306_131_1460_876/master/1460.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9eb12e1c0649eb81416496ce59cccdc0","title":"england india odi decider world cup mark wood","story":"Mark Wood says England will use the deciding match of the one-day series against India as a dress rehearsal for a potential knockout match when they host next year’s World Cup.It will be highly instructive then to see how they cope under pressure and encumbered by a major injury blow after the opener Jason Roy was rated only a “30-70” chance to recover from the lacerated little finger on his right hand sustained fielding in his side’s series-levelling victory at Lord’s on Saturday.Roy’s misfortune – and the pessimistic prognosis given to him by England suggests he is almost certain to miss out – gives an unexpected opportunity to James Vince two months after he was discarded from England’s Test squad.The Hampshire batsman became surplus to requirements following a disappointing winter in Australia and New Zealand when his weakness outside off stump was brutally exposed.But after decent 50-overs form for his county, including a knock of 171 in last month’s Royal London One-Day Cup semi-final against Yorkshire, Vince was called into England’s one-day squad as cover once Dawid Malan, himself an injury replacement for Alex Hales, was commandeered by England Lions on Sunday.Now Roy’s injury means Vince is on the verge of winning his sixth ODI cap, and first since October 2016, when this series against India, currently standing at 1-1, concludes at Headingley on Tuesday.Sam Billings, who was called up as further batting cover late on Monday, appears the only barrier to that happening.Billings’ last ODI appearance came in the defeat against Scotland in Edinburgh last month but he appears behind Vince given the vacant slot would be as an opener, not his preferred role, and he has been parachuted into the squad at such a late stage.The absence of Roy, who has 416 ODI runs at an average of 52 this summer, is a setback for England as they seek to win their eighth 50-over series in succession.Wood, though, says the winner-takes-all nature of this match will offer Eoin Morgan’s team invaluable preparation before next year’s World Cup.England won their last one-day series decider against New Zealand in Christchurch in March and, as the world’s No 1 ranked team, are favourites to do so again in Leeds.Asked if this match might have an impact on the five-Test series between England and India to come this summer, Wood said: “I think for the Test-match side of things, it is great to get certain people out or get runs against them but it is more of an impact for the World Cup.“If we can treat this game as a semi-final, a must-win with the pressure on, we can learn what we are doing wrong if we don’t win or what we are doing right if we do. Over the past year we have dealt with these situations well and hopefully we can carry on that trend tomorrow.Big games require big players to come to the fore and for Ben Stokes, the most expensive overseas signing in Indian Premier League history, Headingley offers a stage for the all-rounder to show he is completely over the torn hamstring he sustained in May.Stokes returned for the T20 series decider against India in Bristol this month but has so far failed to take a wicket in three matches and his only significant score with the bat came in the opening ODI at Trent Bridge last week when he hit the slowest 50-over half-century for England in 13 years.However, Wood believes his Durham teammate is close to his best. “I think it’s a chance for Ben to prove how good he is again,” he said. “He doesn’t need to – everyone knows how good a player he is – but obviously coming back from a bit of time out, he’s probably desperate to do well and be that match-winner again.“It takes a bit of time to get your form and your rhythm back so I’m sure the more he plays the better he’ll get. India are a quality team so maybe they’ll have a game plan for him and it might just take him a little bit of time to work out certain situations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01eda63ab910396472498872530e3fa5d4da5520/0_280_4047_2428/master/4047.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e9a1afa66599c700a53ed9ae4be07fc","title":"brittany lincicome barbasol championship golf","story":"The American is up against male golfers at the Barbasol Championship this week, and she hopes she can inspire more girls to take up the gameBrittany Lincicome just wants to be happy. In order to achieve her goal, the two-time major champion tries to live a normal life, and her Instagram give you a glimpse of that philosophy. There’s the the occasional golf post, but it’s mostly filled with pictures of her husband, friends from the tour, videos of her hedgehog, and the occasional photo of her perfect manicure.\u0026nbspIt’s her love of the quiet life that means Lincicome doesn’t try to bring unwanted attention to herself. So when she was invited to play on a sponsor’s exemption at the PGA Barbasol Championship this week, she was reluctant. “I actually called my agent, my husband, and dad to get their input,” she said.While many players would have jumped at the opportunity, Lincicome thought about some of the pushback that may come as a woman competing on the men’s tour – particularly after the negative reaction to comments she made last year before the Women’s US Open. The tournament was at Donald Trump’s course in Bedminster, New Jersey, and Lincicome said she hoped the president wouldn’t make an appearance because she felt it would ert attention away from the golf. It’s fair to say that not everyone agreed with her thoughts, and she took a break from Twitter afterwards.Now though, Lincicome is focused on the Barbasol Championship. She isn’t the first woman to play against the men. Babe Didrikson Zaharias first played on the PGA tour in 1934. Later the world No 1, Annika Sorenstam, competed at Colonial in 2003, where she experienced serious pushback (Vijay Singh, for example, threatened to withdraw if he was paired with her). Most recently there’s Michelle Wie, who played in a handful of PGA tour events, her first being the 2004 Sony Open when she was only 14.None of the women before Lincicome made the cut in a PGA tour event. She is aware of that fact, but is not letting it faze her as she gets ready to tee off this Thursday. “I’m focusing on enjoying the experience, and having fun and not putting extra pressure on myself.”Known as “Bam Bam” on the circuit, Lincicome is ranked 10th for driving distance on the LPGA tour, averaging 269.5 yards. This figure is impacted by the fact that she often has to hit a three-wood or hybrid off the tee since LPGA courses aren’t always driver-friendly. That suggests that she may hit it almost as far as some of the guys on the PGA tour, and she may have enough power in the tank to handle the 7,300 yard course at the Barbasol Championship.Lincicome doesn’t want to pile on unnecessary stress before the event, but she believes female golfers are held to a higher level of scrutiny, particularly if they’re playing alongside men. “A lot of people equate the quality of golf to how far someone hits it, and distance is such a huge part of the men’s game. But there isn’t a lot of conversation about the women’s side of the game and how accurate we are. I’m hoping that me playing in this tournament will expose more people to women’s golf and that golf is much bigger than just distance,” she says.Some people believe Lincicome’s invitation is a grab for attention by a tournament that is up against the Open in the schedule. Lincicome doesn’t see her participation as a gimmick though. “Listen, I’m stepping outside of my comfort zone. The par fives are like my bread and butter on the LPGA because I can go for most of them in two. I’m going to be playing the par fives as three-shot holes at this PGA event,” Lincicome says. “Also, I am putting myself out there in a different kind of spotlight.”That’s a place that Lincicome isn’t particularly drawn to because she doesn’t want the focus to be on her gender: just on her golf. With that in mind, she sees the benefit of bringing more attention to the LPGA and perhaps inspiring girls to take up the game."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3804dad93e9009653f2aa1804d2bf7e37026bfb6/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=975c803c99efaba3146a7739463a5120","title":"la course 2018 action from the alps live","story":"Van der Breggen is hitting speeds close to 80kph with only 8km to go to the finish now.Van der Breggen’s lead is just five seconds over Van Vleuten as they flash past the chalets on the descent.

And even more testing, it turns out, for anyone attempting comedy based on a shared and certain vision of those categories and depending on the collective recognition of deviation from them for laughs.Sacha Baron Cohen, the inventor of parodic luminaries such as Ali G, Borat and fashionista Bruno, is back with a new set of characters – using heavy prosthetics this time, to disguise his now well-known face – in Who Is America?. As with his earlier creations, they are designed to dupe and manipulate prominent people into saying unfortunate things and test the limits of inidual gullibility. And, as with his earlier work, the characters themselves are brilliantly done. In the opening episode, he produces Billy Wayne Ruddick Jr, the founder of an “alt-right” conspiracy theorist Infowars-a-like website, who hates Obamacare because it forced him to go to the doctor and find out he had “two types of diabetes, obese legs and chalky deposits” wet bag-hat wearing liberal Nira Cain-N’Degeocello (“I’m a cisgender white heterosexual male, for which I apologise”) ex-con Rick Sherman, who paints with his own faeces and “ejaculatorate” and former Israeli army colonel Erran Morad, keen to extend his child-arming Kinder s programme into the US. They are all convincing, committed performances, meticulously prepared and backed up by formidable wit and intelligence that allow him to pivot and follow wherever his patsy seems poised most fruitfully to take him.But also, as with his earlier work, it is not always clear who or what the target is, and, more often than not, the interviews seem to end up proving the strength of people’s politeness rather than the weakness of their principles. They probe the limits of their patience rather than of their gullibility or self-belief. This was faintly tedious and frustrating back in what I think it has become reasonable to call simply the Before Times, when no more than ordinarily misguided and incompetent buffoons ran the world and our problems existed in no more than three manageable, humanoid dimensions instead of bursting forth from a shadow cyberstate. Back then, what you saw in the world was largely what you got. But tempora mutantur, nos et mutamur in illis, which is Latin for: “We’re all fucked now, so things have to change.”Worse still is the segment with “Cain-N’Degeocello”, who sits down to dinner with Trump supporter Jane Page Thompson and her husband in their South Carolina home and asks not one question about their continued support of the man likely to be impeached before the cheese course. Instead, he paints himself as an increasingly extreme liberal, who encourages his daughter (“Malala”) to free-bleed on the US flag and whose partner is having an open affair with a porpoise. The Thompsons’ smiles become fixed, but he is a guest in their home and they treat him as such. Thus all Baron Cohen succeeds in doing is humanising two Trump diehards. Is this anyone’s preferred outcome?Partial redemption, at least, comes in the final segment (after a dismal interaction with the faecal artist and a gallery owner in Laguna Beach, which requires her to sit through the sound of off-stage huffings as he produced one of his “works”). Morad (“Are liberals using school shootings to further their anti-tragedy agenda?”) gets various gun nuts in and outside Washington to promote arming pre-schoolers. “Fill the Puppy Pistol by pushing his lunchbox into his belly and sending the naughty me for a really, really long timeout,” says one, joyously. The gun lobbyist Larry Pratt notes that if children are young enough, “if they haven’t developed a conscience yet, they can make very good soldiers”.The final, most insoluble problem presents itself: it would be funny only if it weren’t so frightening. Most of what they say is already on record and has been publicly cheered to the rafters by people whose views aren’t going to change by the addition of some minor logical absurdism. If it is being played for laughs, it is a venture that needs to stick to embarrassing people with rude pictures. If it is aiming for satire, it needs a clear, worthy target and an unerring aim. Maybe the much-hyped coming confrontations with Sarah Palin and Roy Moore will refine the scattergun approach. Fill the Puppy Pistol, and take your shot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d6f66197712174023653613ec15feb1f5580579/0_57_1533_920/master/1533.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35804c6618b07a64d50711fbf9979cee","title":"always go slightly too far what makes ambush tv work who is america","story":"Sacha Baron Cohen’s Who Is America? follows a long line of TV troublemakers who fooled guests into self-sabotage, but his scattergun approach risks missing the markIf you’re going to pull TV pranks, it helps if you’re punching up. And you can’t set your sights much higher than the president of the US. Furthermore, if you’re going to prank any US administration, it may as well be the leadership grouping centred around the uniquely unstable cocktail of ego, malevolence, incompetence and absurdity that is Donald Trump. Sacha Baron Cohen’s new series, Who Is America?, may not make it as far as the big man, but his ambition is clear. He did get as far as Sarah Palin who, hilariously, has complained that Baron Cohen “duped her”.Baron Cohen and Trump have previous. Somehow, Trump not only survived but prospered after his 2003 encounter with his character Ali G, who tried to pitch him a glove designed for wearing while eating ice-cream. This encounter has only acquired resonance in retrospect. Ali G’s various provocations rarely carried much in the way of moral weight. For nostalgic lefties of a certain age, there’s still a great deal of pleasure to be derived from watching him being gently schooled by a magnificently earnest Tony Benn (“Is it called the welfare state because it’s well fair?”). But, in fact, most of Ali G’s work was just gloriously daft. With Candid Camera having launched way back in 1948, the ambush prank show has deep roots. But variations on the format went into overdrive in the 1990s, a decade that, surely not coincidentally, saw celebrity culture spiral out of control. The form ided into three distinct strains. There were celebrity botherers, such as Paul Kaye’s berserk red carpet wraith Dennis Pennis. There were the old-school public pranksters, still taking their cue from the decidedly trad likes of Game for a Laugh. And then there were the worthy likes of Mark Thomas, who used pranks to punctuate and enliven admirable but often slightly dry activism. Then Chris Morris changed everything. In 1997, Brass Eye redefined the notion of TV celebrity pranking and rendered it almost obsolete. Brass Eye was ludicrous, hilarious and satirically deadly. The true colours of many public figures were revealed – they only fell for Morris if they were gullible (David Amess), careless (Bruno Brookes), desperate (Wolf from Gladiators) or all three (too many to mention). Brass Eye was one of those very rare TV programmes to actually cause a change in media law. An amendment informally known as the Brass Eye clause – which allowed interviewees to be misled for the purposes of entertainment – was incorporated into the broadcasting code. Artistically, Brass Eye opened up a space into which dozens of imitators duly leapt. Many were dismal, but Baron Cohen instantly stood out, for his immersion in character, his eye for the absurd and his sheer nerve. So, what makes a prankster work? What separates Ali G from Trigger Happy TV? Often, it’s intangible: you either warm to them or you don’t. But there are a few ground rules. For a start, the softer the targets, the funnier, swifter and more generous the prankster has to be. Humiliating unwitting and undeserving members of the public is rarely a good look. For example, Billy Eichner’s periodically inspired Billy on the Street works because his marks are usually laughing, too. Second, understand your shelf life. Pranksters are TV’s fireflies. Like a punk anthem in human form, Dennis Pennis was obnoxious, brutally effective, frill-free and over in a flash. Baron Cohen effects regular and complete metamorphoses. Morris has simply moved on. Also, the stakes have to be reasonably high. Baron Cohen’s Borat singing what he claimed to be “the Kazakhstan national anthem” in front of a horde of furious rednecks at a rodeo in Texas definitely qualifies. The rag-week japesters of Revolting trying to make a point about the Daily Mail by harassing bewildered BBC employees during their lunch breaks definitely does not.Finally – and perhaps most importantly – always go slightly too far. Morris did not only attempt to buy fictional drugs off real-life drug dealers. He attempted to buy fictional drugs off real-life drug dealers wearing a nappy and a massive red balloon on his head. It’s here that Baron Cohen usually wins and, it appears, has won again. Who is America? has been billed as “the most dangerous show in the history of television”. Normally, this would sound hyperbolic. But, in this case, who knows? Like it or not, in satirical terms, the Trump White House (and its many bottom-feeding minions who Baron Cohen seems to have duped) represents the biggest of big game. If Baron Cohen is going to top this, Vladimir Putin had better keep his eyes peeled for an unfamiliar Ukrainian diplomat with an unplaceable accent and a slight air of mischief. Go on, Sacha, we dare you.

Here is our ranking of the most exciting Over the weekend, BBC One revealed its entire autumn drama slate. In a 90-second trailer filled with all manner of gunfights, car crashes and lazy-lidded, moody glances, 15 shows were unveiled at once. But which should you be most excited about? Here’s a ranking.The good news is that Les Misérables has an incredible cast (Dominic West, David Oyelowo, Lily Collins and Olivia Colman). The better news is that it won’t be a musical. But the bad news? First, it’s yet another Andrew Davies adaptation. Second, it’s sodding Les Misérables. As popular as this will be, you’ll absolutely be able to live without it.Pretty much all of the above goes for The ABC Murders. There’s a big star headlining – John Malkovich will be playing Hercule Poirot – but the thought of yet another Agatha Christie adaptation is enough to make you seize up with total boredom. It’s worth pointing out that this is not a musical either. Which is a shame, because at least if we got to see Malkovich belt out a jaunty number called Let’s All Go to Bexhill in a dodgy European accent, we would have something to talk about.Hey, guess what? Luther’s back! What’s that? You thought the last series of Luther was the final series? And the series before that? No way, buddy. In the new series, Idris Elba will rub his face and overuse everyone’s name a lot. And we will only watch because there’s a chance Ruth Wilson will return, even though she won’t because she never does. I never thought I’d say this, but Luther might be outstaying its welcome.Even though the only people who care about television shows about newspapers are the four remaining people in the country who still work for newspapers, Press is a television show about newspapers. It’s written by Doctor Foster’s Mike Bartlett, which possibly means it will start gripping, get silly and then end in a daft manner. Still, even if it’s bad, at least it will give journalists something to tweet about, so that’s something.Jenna Coleman and Ewen Leslie star in an adaptation of Helen FitzGerald’s 2013 novel. Which is all well and good, except The Cry is about a missing baby. Coming in a year that’s already filled to the absolute gills with dramas about abduction, The Cry will have to go to enormous lengths if it plans to break any new ground.Informer is a contemporary drama about a counter-terrorism officer who forces a young second-generation Pakistani man to become, you guessed it, an informer. Informer is written by new writers Rory Haines and Sohrab Noshirvani, which is exciting, and stars Paddy Considine, which is very exciting. Of all the shows announced on Sunday, this is the one we know least about. Don’t come running to me if it’s bad, basically.A three-part adaptation of Andrea Levy’s epic novel, this has all the marking of An Important Work About Slavery. Set in Jamaica in 1838, it’s told from the perspective of a woman who lived through the end of slavery. The Long Song has the potential to delve deep into an era of British history that people like to pretend didn’t happen. The book was one of the best of 2010, so fingers crossed the series follows suit.In which Ruth Wilson stars as Ruth Wilson’s grandmother. If that sounds mundane, it’s worth pointing out that Ruth Wilson’s grandmother was unknowingly married to a spy who kept an entire secret second family from her. It’s an incredible story on its own, but seeing Wilson play her own relative – with all the inter-familial strife that it’s bound to cause – is what will push this over the edge. Thanks to the low-level Oscar buzz surrounding her performance in Hereditary, Toni Collette is having something of a year. There’s a good chance that Wanderlust will further cement it, too. Written by playwright Nick Payne, Wanderlust is an exploration of relationships, lust and monogamy that’s already been described as “authentic and revolutionary”. It has the potential to be really quite special.It says a lot about the BBC’s drama slate that this would have topped the list in any other year. This will be a faithful (period) adaptation of HG Wells’s classic sci-fi. It will star Rafe Spall, Eleanor Tomlinson and Robert Carlyle, and what’s promised to be a fleet of genuinely scary aliens. Even if War of the Worlds ends up tipping over into unintentional silliness, it’s still bound to be an entertaining watch. If it’s even half as scary as The Tripods, it might be time to invest in rubber underpants.Two words: Jed Mercurio. Mercurio’s Line of Duty was a work of such ridiculous tension that you could easily binge yourself to death on it. Bodyguard is Mercurio’s story about a war veteran (Richard Madden) tasked with protecting a home secretary (Keeley Hawes) he appears to fundamentally disagree with. That’s about all anyone knows, although, if Mercurio stays true to form, you won’t so much watch this as hyperventilate into a paper bag while it’s on in the background.Another two words: Sally Wainwright. Everything Wainwright touches is magnificent, and she’s working from some remarkable source material here, so expectation couldn’t be higher. Gentleman Jack tells the story of Anne Lister, a 19th-century Yorkshire land owner and mountaineer who wrote a 4m-word diary and suffered endless harassment for her sexuality. Lister’s Wikipedia page alone is a ridiculously fun romp, so in Wainwright’s hands – and with Suranne Jones playing the lead – this will almost definitely be one of this year’s best.Killing Eve you already know about. It’s Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s dramatic follow-up to Fleabag that has just netted Sandra Oh an Emmy nomination. It’s an unconventional cat-and-mouse thriller that, for a time, had a perfect Rotten Tomatoes rating. This would be higher on the list, except it’s been out in the US for ages and anyone who really wanted to see it would have found it by other means by now.Yes, Doctor Who is still Doctor Who a decades-old childrens’ programme about a time-travelling professor. Yes, for every good episode ever made, there has been a dozen objective duffers. But, even with all that taken into consideration, there still won’t be a scripted drama this year that gets nearly as much attention. Not only is there a new showrunner in Chris Chibnall, but there’s a new Doctor this year. And she’s a woman. So far, Jodie Whittaker has been the perfect Doctor but that’s only because all she has had to do so far is wear a nice coat and smile enigmatically. Doctor Who won’t be perfect – it never is – but its overhaul is exciting nonetheless.For the most part, The Little Drummer Girl seems perfectly formulaic. It’s a stately John le Carré adaptation that stars all manner of respected B-list actors that very transparently hopes to mop up some of The Night Manager’s residue. However, it’s being directed by Park Chan-wook. Singlehandedly directed by Park Chan-wook. It’s his television debut and his bold, provocative, gorgeous sensibility is what will make this one of the most highly anticipated programmes of the year. It might not be a masterpiece – Park has had his fair share of misfires, and not all movie directors cope well with television – but it’s going to be absolutely unmissable. Try to stop me watching this and I’ll fight you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f23f92e1753721a57062f67a81e5c114edc89db/0_0_2442_1465/master/2442.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d18f42e9af4ada5dd9532dfd7a51c99","title":"sacha baron cohen channel defends who is america against claims of mocking veterans","story":"Showtime, the US broadcaster behind the comedian’s new project, says claims from Sarah Palin that the show made fun of disabled former servicepeople are falseThe broadcaster behind Who Is America?, Sacha Baron Cohen’s new TV show, has said the claim that the comedian made fun of disabled war veterans is erroneous and that Sarah Palin’s account of being filmed for the show is inaccurate.A spokesperson for Showtime, the US channel that airs the programme, said there had been “widespread misinformation” about Baron Cohen’s character Billy Wayne Ruddick Jr PhD, a parody of an online conspiracy theorist, who interviewed Bernie Sander’s in the show’s first episode.“Baron Cohen did not present himself as a disabled veteran, and viewers nationwide who watched the premiere on Sunday can now attest to that,” the spokesperson said. “In Sunday’s episode, during an interview with Senator Bernie Sanders, Baron Cohen in character as Dr Ruddick was asked by the Senator if he is disabled, and he stated that he is not and uses a mobility scooter to conserve his energy. “In addition, Baron Cohen never presented himself as a veteran of the US military to former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin during the booking process or during the filming of her interview, and contrary to her claims he did not appear in a wheelchair. In both the interview with Governor Palin and the interview with Senator Sanders, he did not wear military apparel of any kind.”In a Facebook post Palin wrote: “Yup – we were duped. Ya’ got me, Sacha. Feel better now? I join a long list of American public personalities who have fallen victim to the evil, exploitive, sick ‘humor’ of the British ‘comedian’ Sacha Baron Cohen.”Baron Cohen responded by posting a letter from Billy Wayne Ruddick Jr PhD, which read: “I did NOT say I was a War Vet. I was in the service – not military, but United Parcel, and I only fought for my country once – when I shot a Mexican who came onto my property.”The Showtime statement came after a billboard designed by rightwing artist Sabo was erected in Los Angeles. It depicted Baron Cohen as an amputee in a wheelchair, alongside the quote: “Sacha Baron Cohen walks away with a hit ... and a touch of stolen valor.”The term “stolen valor” refers to people who claim falsely to have served in the US military.Sabo told the  in an interview in 2017 that he believes “leftism is a mental disorder” and that he is “fighting the good fight” with his campaign of pro-Trump graffiti across Los Angeles.“Stolen valor” was also referenced by the conservative pundit and former congressman Joe Walsh, who was also duped by Baron Cohen and claimed that the comedian was mocking disabled war veterans.“Dressing up as a wounded veteran is absolutely stolen valor, his tactics are disgusting,” he tweeted. “I totally get @SachaBaronCohen’s gig. He’s a comedian, and he can be funny, but mocking a disabled veteran to spoof @SarahPalinUSA is a serious matter. I am just telling you what I encountered – it was much of the same she experienced.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1a11414c7f798fafae92140ce8deb16d0f88595/111_0_607_364/master/607.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bf374c04b44a45caffc8bf1a9ba6983","title":"the right to sit indian law change allows women workers to rest","story":"Mainly female workforce in shops not allowed to sit, lean against a wall or use a liftCybil Wilson has worked in one of Kerala’s big, shiny, brightly-lit sari shops for 10 years.Her salary at the shop, in Trivandrum, has been consistently low but it is the pain and swelling in her legs that troubles her the most. Her employer forbids Wilson, and the other 120 female sales assistants working across the four floors, from sitting down during a 12-14 hour shift.“We can’t use the lifts either. All customers pay on the ground floor for their purchases and we have to accompany them so we are up and down the stairs all day. A few times, when we did use the lift, customers complained about having to share it with us,” said Wilson.Now the Kerala government has announced it will amend its labour laws to include a clause obliging employers to let women sit – the result of a fight by a women’s union for “irippu samara” (the right to sit in Malayalam) for these unrepresented shop workers.Most owners of sari shops and other retail outlets forbid women, the bulk of the shop workforce, to sit. Even leaning against a wall can be punished. Lunch is 30 minutes. Toilet breaks are strictly limited. Talking to colleagues can lead to salary deductions. Employers monitor CCTV footage to check for compliance.The women’s union, called Amtu, was set up by Viji Penkoot, the leader of a women’s collective, Penkootu, when the male-dominated unions in the state ignored the issue.She began agitating for the right to sit eight years ago, when a sales assistant in Kozhikode who leaned against a wall while a customer pondered which sari to buy, had her pay cut by 100 rupees (£1) for the “offence”. “The women are careful not to drink too much because they cannot go to the toilet when they want to.

On 4 July, the Kerala state cabinet, reacting to street protests by shop assistants, announced it would amend the existing law, which fails to specify which amenities should be provided to sales assistants, to include the right to sit. “It’s our policy to protect the interests of all our women workers and this gap in the law had to be plugged,” said Thozil Bhawan, a labour commissioner. The new law will stipulate a minimum monthly starting salary of 10,000 rupees (£110), an eight-hour day, a chair or stool, an afternoon tea break, and a lunch break, with a duration yet to be decided by the Kerala cabinet, be provided."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c821b34aaf650dd67f6a94d537c96aabb6e3f49/0_334_4760_2858/master/4760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7844981a054c32ba3ae8bc0f2116f803","title":"hong kong moves to ban citys first pro independence party","story":"Hong Kong National Party must explain why it should not be barred, in escalation of push to silence dissent against ChinaHong Kong is taking unprecedented steps to ban a pro-independence party, in the government’s strongest action yet against the movement pushing for separation from China.Police on Tuesday delivered documents to Hong Kong National Party founder, Andy Chan Ho-tin, detailing their recommendations to the city’s secretary of security that the group halt operations.The development marks the first time since the former British colony’s return to Chinese rule in 1997 that it has sought to outlaw a political organisation.A letter addressed to Chan said security officials believed the party should be shut down “in the interests of national security or public safety, public order or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others,” according to photos of the documents posted on the group’s Facebook page.In a press conference, Hong Kong security secretary John Lee said if the party is banned, anyone who attends meetings or gives money to the group could be punished with a fine of HKD$50,000 ($6,400) and two years in jail.“In Hong Kong we have freedom of association, but that right is not without restriction,” he said, according to Hong Kong Free Press.Chan, 27, a former Occupy Central activist who participated in a wave of pro-democracy protests in 2014, had already been barred from running in legislative elections in 2016. The party, started in 2016, calls for “an independent and free Republic of Hong Kong.”Chan has until 7 August to explain in writing why the party should not be banned, according to the documents. According to some, under the city’s mini-constitution, independence is a violation of the “one country, two systems” framework under which Hong Kong has operated since its return to China from British control.Under the system, Hong Kong is meant to operate under a “high degree of autonomy” with its own laws, courts, and freedoms. Critics say those freedoms are quickly being erased. After the street protests that shut the city down for 79 days in 2014, also known as the Umbrella movement, candidates advocating a range of pro-democracy views from self-determination to all-out independence have been banned from running or arrested. The Hong Kong National Party said on its Facebook page: “Today we Hong Kongers stand in opposition to our enemies, these Chinese colonisers and their puppets in the current Hong Kong government, and it is this antagonism that defines our movement.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41b2db556d1c1e73454fa3cb2dac476ba31ad5b6/0_143_2432_1459/master/2432.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6588ad95b1868d12fb9d18c03d90d110","title":"india inspection missionaries of charity homes mother teresa","story":"India orders examination of all institutions run by her charity after claims against two staffIndia has ordered the immediate inspection of all childcare homes run by the Missionaries of Charity, the Catholic congregation established by Mother Teresa, after employees at one shelter were accused of selling babies for adoption.The inspections were announced by the ministry for women and childhood development after a Missionaries of Charity home in Jharkhand state was shut this month following the arrest of a nun and a social worker employed there.Sister Konsalia Balsa and social worker Anima Indwar were accused of having already sold three babies from the home, which provides shelter for pregnant, unmarried women. They were accused of trying to sell a fourth baby, a two-month old boy born in March, for about £1,325. The parents, a couple from Uttar Pradesh state, were told the proposed adoption was legitimate and that the money was for hospital expenses.The Missionaries of Charity, established in 1950 by Mother Teresa – now Saint Teresa of Calcutta – declined to comment on the inspections but earlier said the congregation was appalled by the baby-trafficking claims.“We are completely shocked by what has happened in our home in Ranchi,” a statement from the order said. “It should have never happened. It is against our moral convictions. We are carefully looking into the matter.”Police say Balsa has confessed to her role in the trafficking case but the bishop of Ranchi, the Jharkhand state capital, said this week the confession was extracted under pressure and accused the police of “treating the whole of Mother Teresa’s organisation as a criminal gang”.Political leaders in West Bengal state, where the order is based, have also claimed the case is part of an anti-Christian agenda pushed by the ruling Bharatiya Janata party, which has a Hindu nationalist ideology.The Missionaries of Charity stopped facilitating adoptions in India in 2015 after government reforms that removed obstacles for single, orced or separated people to adopt children.India has more than 230,000 children in official and unofficial shelters, according to the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, but estimates of the number of orphans in the country are as high as 30 million.Despite a waiting list of about 15,000 parents, only 2,671 adoptions took place between the beginning of 2016 and March this year because the process is notoriously slow, requiring a clearance from a court that can take up to four years to be delivered in India’s overburdened legal system. The result is a thriving and lucrative hidden market in babies.Officials admit they do not know the size of the market. In February last year, police in West Bengal arrested the heads of an adoption centre who they accused of selling at least 17 children to couples in Europe, the US and Asia.

Polls conducted in May suggested the no vote will win, though there is a significant proportion of the population still undecided. Goa called the referendum a “question of dignity”, saying: “As long as a single Kanak person is standing, he will fight for his freedom. That should tell you the importance of this day, and the symbolism of this referendum.”There was violent unrest in New Caledonia in the 1980s, as a result of pro-independence sentiment, which resulted in the deaths of 21 people during a hostage crisis in Oueva.If it fails the New Caledonian people will be allowed to hold two further referenda on the question of independence: one in 2020, and if that is unsuccessful, another in 2023. If successful the FLNKS would like to dismantle the current economic system, which Goa called the “French system”, saying it was “based on an economy of exploitation”.“We will take back control of our natural resources and our key sectors, currently controlled by French multinational companies, to ensure a more equitable distribution of wealth by exploiting our main resource, nickel, from which we only draw salaries at the moment.”New Caledonia, which is about two hours by plane from Brisbane, holds about a quarter of the world’s nickel deposits.Goa also took aim at Emmanuel Macron, who visited New Caledonia in May, saying that “after 164 years of colonisation he recognised that New Caledonia was a jewel”.However, Goa said that if it became independent he hoped New Caledonia could become “ambassadors for Oceania” to France and Europe and he wanted to “safeguard the status quo with the two regional powers, Australia and New Zealand”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9214346191da242f78b7093c7b8049c7ac68ddf/0_0_4122_2473/master/4122.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0463efb8910b17c3c12810c026ccf8b4","title":"putin accuses uk of ungrounded accusations over novichok","story":"President says London has not provided evidence to back up claims that Moscow was behind poisoning of four people – one fatallyVladimir Putin has accused Britain of making baseless allegations against Russia over the former Soviet spy and three other people poisoned, one fatally, with the novichok nerve agent in Salisbury.Asked in a Fox News interview about the British government’s assertion that Moscow was behind the novichok attack on the former spy Sergei Skripal, Putin said London had not provided any evidence to back up the claim.“We would like to get documentary evidence but nobody gives it to us,” Putin, speaking through a translator, told the US network after a summit with Donald Trump in Finland.“It’s the same thing with the accusations of meddling in the election process in America,” he added in reference to claims that Russia interfered in the 2016 US presidential election which was won by Trump.Putin suggested the case could be driven by domestic issues in Britain, saying: “Nobody wants to look into these.”“We just see the ungrounded accusations – why is it done this way? Why should our relationship be made worse by this?”The former Russian double agent Skripal and his daughter Yulia collapsed in Salisbury on 4 March after being exposed to novichok. Both have since recovered.On 30 June Charlie Rowley and his partner Dawn Sturgess fell ill not far from the Skripal attack after being exposed to the same nerve agent. Sturgess died on 8 July.Sturgess’s son, Ewan Hope, had called on Donald Trump to raise his mother’s death with Vladimir Putin.Russia has denied poisoning the Skripals, sparking a diplomatic row that has led to tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions between Britain and its allies and Russia.Police are investigating whether the novichok that Rowley and Sturgess were exposed to was from the same batch used against the Skripals.Rowley remains seriously ill in hospital but his brother has told the BBC that the 45-year-old fell ill after picking up a discarded perfume bottle.“What kind of bottle?

The Dáil has already passed a vote in favour of holding a referendum to enshrine the public ownership of water, but the referendum bid has been paused to allow for advice from the Attorney General.It is understood one of the options discussed in Government is to enshrine the public ownership of the water utility in the Constitution. This would overcome concerns about the implications for private water sources and schemes of a broad constitutional provision guaranteeing the public ownership of water.The emergence of a political consensus on the future of Irish Water comes as drought conditions across the country have emphasised the need to improve water infrastructure.

Photograph: Matt CardyAFPGetty Images\u0026nbspTheresa May’s government caved in to hardline Brexiteers in Jacob Rees-Mogg’s European Research Group (ERG) by accepting four amendments to a customs Bill. They rule out a customs union with the EU without primary legislation say Britain can’t collect tariffs for the EU unless the EU does the same for Britain demand that Britain must have a separate VAT policy to the UK and rule out different customs arrangements for Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Conservative Remainers, outraged by the government’s capitulation with the Brexiteers, voted with the opposition on some amendments so that two passed with a margin of just three votes.The prime minister says the amendments make no difference to the Chequers plan because they reflect government policy. But Brexiteers think they have killed it, pointing out that it is now under fire from both wings of the party, with former education secretary and Remainer Justine Greening rejecting it on Monday.The amendment on collecting tariffs for the EU does appear to contradict the Chequers plan and last week’s White Paper, which did not demand reciprocity for the EU. More importantly, the Brexiteers’ show of strength serves as a reminder to the prime minister that they could torpedo any deal she brings back from Brussels.The amendment ruling out different customs arrangements for Northern Ireland is in conflict with the EU’s backstop proposal, which would treat Northern Ireland as part of the EU customs union after Brexit. But May has already rejected that proposal, asserting that no British prime minister would ever agree to impose a border in the Irish Sea.This amendment was nodded through on a voice vote on Monday night, reflecting the support of many Labour MPs for the prime minister’s position. But as negotiations over the backstop continue in Brussels over the next few weeks, the EU side will play down the impact of a different customs and regulatory regime for Northern Ireland in the hope of reaching agreement.The EU’s position remains that, without an agreement on the backstop, there will be no withdrawal agreement and no transition period after Brexit.Conservative Remainers plan to take their revenge on Tuesday by tabling an amendment to a trade Bill that would keep Britain in a customs union with the EU if no agreement to keep trade frictionless is agreed by January 2019. If Labour and the other opposition parties back the amendment, it has a chance of delivering just the second defeat to the government on a Brexit vote (the first was last December when MPs voted to give themselves a say on the final deal).Parliament is due to break up for the summer next week but the government wants to start the holidays five days early, partly to head off any move against May’s leadership.Brexit negotiations continue in Brussels throughout the summer with both sides saying they want to agree a deal by October. This week’s shenanigans at Westminster have weakened May’s hand in Brussels and made a deal in October less likely.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

A fan will also pull air around corners, as in our home.“The overall goal is to pull the warm air out while drawing cool air in once the outdoor temperature drops below the indoor temperature. Fans use hardly any power compared to AC.”  Mr Lebo added that while pointing the fan outside the window may seem counterintuitive to some, it is a lot more effective than the standard method.“The standard way simply pushes warm air around the room but we perceive it as cooling because moving air feels cooler than still air,” he says.“My technique of forced cross ventilation actually cools indoor air down by drawing in air cooled for free by nature that is just outside from late afternoon onward.”It could be time to turn that fan around He added: “Just make sure the bedroom windows are the ones with the air entering! The outward facing fan must be in the far end of the dwelling.”The UK enjoyed the hottest day of the year on Tuesday as temperatures peaked at 30.6C (87F), with the heatwave showing no signs of abating.\u0026#39We call it torture class\u0026#39 – passenger groups battle aviation authorities over shrinking plane seatsHosepipe ban anger as water company accused of ignoring leaks to boost profits Vladimir Putin refuses to touch list of new election meddling indictments as he dismisses \u0026#39utterly ridiculous\u0026#39 Russia investigationHeroic Thai army doctor praises \u0026#39polite resolve\u0026#39 of trapped boys First hosepipe ban of summer to hit north-west England after weeks of firefighting on Saddleworth MoorComment: The other social care time bomb: unpaid family carers are close to breaking pointUS politician denounces Sacha Baron Cohen\u0026#39s TV guns prank as \u0026#39sick fraud\u0026#39Bill Browder: British investor singled out by Putin at Trump summit says Russian leader \u0026#39rattled\u0026#39Trump tells Fox News it\u0026#39s \u0026#39a shame\u0026#39 he and Putin were asked about Russia \u0026#39witch hunt\u0026#39True story of how Prince Philip\u0026#39s DNA solved Russian Romanov murder mysteryDeadly great white sharks and oceanic white-tips to arrive in British waters by 2050Comment: The humble loaf of bread gives us an insight into who we are Volcanic \u0026#39lava bomb\u0026#39 hits tour boat in Hawaii, leaving 23 injuredPutin says he has \u0026#39never even heard the names\u0026#39 of Amesbury Novichok victims Burmese farmers demand compensation for \u0026#39stolen\u0026#39 landTrump-Putin summit: How presidents put Cold War past behind them to put on a united frontDonald Trump condemned for \u0026#39shameful\u0026#39 and \u0026#39 treasonous\u0026#39 show at Putin summitOne million over 50s lost to the workforce because of age bias, MPs warnChildren’s books must have more black characters, Arts Council funded report says We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"digitalservices@telegraphHead of Digital Publishingdigitalservices@telegraphMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

He studied for 13 years at the Dar ul-Uloom Deoband, the most influential Muslim seminary in south Asia, speaks fluent Pashto and wears local dress.After working for the BBC\u0027s Pashto service in the 1990s and creating another popular soap called New Home, New Life, he then set up his own production house, Pact Radio, in Jalalabad in 2004.With a passion for Pashto radio and a mission to find “traditional solutions for modern problems” his soaps have in the past tackled women\u0027s rights, militancy, the rule of law and health.Health issues have also become a favourite of British soaps, with Coronation Street and The Archers recently tackling sepsis and several storylines revolving around mental health.“You can actually bring up issues in a soap opera which you can\u0027t bring up in day to day journalism,” he said.Recent plot lines have seen characters debate polio vaccination and question hearsay that drops are harmful. Extremists have preached against the global vaccination programme and health workers have been attacked in Afghanistan and Pakistan.“Pashtuns will just believe anything you tell them and that\u0027s the whole problem actually.“Whatever the facts say, they don\u0027t believe facts, they believe hearsay, they believe rumour and that\u0027s what the problem with polio is.

And then if I make that team, well, I don\u0027t know what I\u0027ll promise after that. Maybe the ing or something.Eddie Pepperell\u0026#39s runner-up finish at Gullane saw him qualify for The OpenPepperell, who turned professional in 2011,  joked that his qualification “saved him” from doing 5 Live but admitted that he had been looking forward to being on the other side of the microphone.He said he had last played in Gullane in 2015 and I played well the last time I was here and the similarity is I haven\u0027t played a practice round and I stayed in Edinburgh both times,” he said.That seems to be the secret for me in Gullane  just go out and have nice meals in Edinburgh, drink a bit of wine and then come here and play for four hours.”Pepperell, who won this year\u0027s Qatar Masters, had been due to be a part of the BBC’s on-course team, providing coverage as a summariser for two days this week.He is known for his sense of humour and intelligence, penning a well-received blog about the sport that offers an articulate window on the life of a young professional, from the loneliness of hotel rooms to the pressure of playing for you sole source of income.Ben Gallop, head of BBC Radio and Digital Sport, said: “It’s fantastic news that Eddie has qualified for the Open Championship.

campaigners.The £250million project is expected to take the traffic away from the small town of Arundel, West Sussex, solving congestion and giving the local economy a boost.But opponents warn that Highways England’s preferred route for the new dual carriageway, which will cut through a section of the South Downs National Park, will cause significant damage to wildlife and ancient woodland.Campaigner Emma Tristram, who has submitted an application for a judicial review of the decision, told The : “It would be incredibly damaging and the worst of the three options, having a major adverse effect on wildlife, the countryside, the villages it will tear through.“It’s absolutely terrible. This countryside is a paradise, full of bats, badgers, barn owls… It is completely illogical to throw it away for the sake of a six minute delay.”Daniel Carey-Dawes, senior infrastructure campaigner at the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: “Carving up the countryside in order to prevent a six minute delay is an excessive and unnecessary response.“Even if the proposed bypass provides some temporary relief for this section of the A27, evidence shows that the building of more and bigger roads often induces new traffic on those roads.”.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}The delays that take place at Arundel not only affect local people but the economy as a wholeNick FieldThe South Downs National Park Authority has also applied for a judicial review, claiming that Highways England has not considered the various options in equal depth.Its chair, Margaret Paren, believes any scheme should take vehicles out of the park, rather than through it, causing “significant damage.”Highways England insists that the proposed bypass would save eight minutes and 12 minutes on journeys in each direction on the A27 at Arundel, currently “one of the worst traffic bottlenecks on the south coast.”It said more than 21,000 journeys were made on that section of the road every day, which was expected to rise to 26,300 by 2041 and confirmed that current delays were six minutes.Britain\u0026#039s best national parks – and how to visit themProject manager Sophie Hartfield said: “A better A27 will not only draw traffic away from other, smaller roads through the national park, it will also reduce traffic in and around Arundel’s historic town centre.”Nick Field, from the pro-bypass pressure group One Arundel, said: “Nobody wants to have a road built near them, there is no perfect solution.“The A27 ahread goes through the park.

They managed to dig five metres deep although they had nothing to eat,” he continued. Dr Pak Loharachun was one of the final ers to emerge from the caveThe team was discovered, after surviving alone for ten days, by British cave ers John Volanthen and Rick Stanton. They were then given energy gels and medical food to strengthen their weakened bodies ahead of a daring attempt to e them to freedom through a twisting labyrinth of flooded passageways.  Despite the alternate boredom and terror of being trapped underground, the children were always well-mannered and put their trash in black plastic bags after every meal, revealed Dr Pak. Their football coach, Ekapol Chanthawong, 25, had a “beautiful heart,” he added. “I saw from the first day that Ek waited for the boys to satisfy their hunger first. He gave his meal to the young.”After being imprisoned in the cave for over two weeks, and rescued in a petrifying e through murky, freezing floodwater, Dr Pak said he was confident the boys would “grow to become excellent citizens, contribute to the country and bring a good reputation to it in the future.”The rescued boys pay tribute to Saman Kunan, who died during the operation to save themDr Pak has been hailed as one of the heroes of the hour for his selfless actions in the rescue effort. He reportedly helped to cheer them up, recording the boys’ smiles and greetings in a video clip that was shared with the outside world. The doctor, who is married with his own son, was one of the final ers to escape from the cave after the last of the survivors had been safely extracted close to 7pm on July 10. He and three other Thai ers emerged from the cave last Tuesday night to huge cheers from a waiting crowd.However, the success of the rescue was also tinged with sadness as the recovery teams paid tribute to Saman Kunan, 38, a former Navy Seal er who suffocated underwater while delivering air tanks.On Sunday, the Wild Boars, who are still recovering in hospital, wrote messages of thanks on a picture of Mr Kunan, crying as they were told of his death for the first time. The football team has been given the all clear by doctors and is due to be released from hospital on Thursday.   Please review our commenting policy\u0026#39We call it torture class\u0026#39 – passenger groups battle aviation authorities over shrinking plane seatsHosepipe ban anger as water company accused of ignoring leaks to boost profits Vladimir Putin refuses to touch list of new election meddling indictments as he dismisses \u0026#39utterly ridiculous\u0026#39 Russia investigationFirst hosepipe ban of summer to hit north-west England after weeks of firefighting on Saddleworth MoorUS politician denounces Sacha Baron Cohen\u0026#39s TV guns prank as \u0026#39sick fraud\u0026#39Comment: The other social care time bomb: unpaid family carers are close to breaking pointBill Browder: British investor singled out by Putin at Trump summit says Russian leader \u0026#39rattled\u0026#39Trump tells Fox News it\u0026#39s \u0026#39a shame\u0026#39 he and Putin were asked about Russia \u0026#39witch hunt\u0026#39True story of how Prince Philip\u0026#39s DNA solved Russian Romanov murder mysteryDeadly great white sharks and oceanic white-tips to arrive in British waters by 2050Comment: The humble loaf of bread gives us an insight into who we are Volcanic \u0026#39lava bomb\u0026#39 hits tour boat in Hawaii, leaving 23 injuredPutin says he has \u0026#39never even heard the names\u0026#39 of Amesbury Novichok victims Burmese farmers demand compensation for \u0026#39stolen\u0026#39 landTrump-Putin summit: How presidents put Cold War past behind them to put on a united frontDonald Trump condemned for \u0026#39shameful\u0026#39 and \u0026#39 treasonous\u0026#39 show at Putin summitChildren’s books must have more black characters, Arts Council funded report says Facebook moderators accused of turning blind eye to under-age accounts We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/17/08/Ed-Sheeran.jpg","title":"ed sheeran forbes rich list highest earning solo musician","story":"Created with Sketch.Singer-songwriter beat fellow pop stars Taylor Swift and Katy Perry, and was ranked among the top 10 celebrity earnersClick to followThe Independent CultureEd Sheeran has been ranked among the highest earning celebrities in the worldEd Sheeran has been named as the highest-earning solo artist, taking in an estimated £83m last year.The singer-songwriter earned more than fellow pop stars Taylor Swift and Katy Perry, according to Forbe\u0027s new World\u0027s Highest-Paid Celebrities rich list.It means Sheeran\u0026nbsphas jumped 62 places from last year, placing ninth on the full list of top-earning celebrities such as Coldplay and U2, along with football stars Lionel Messi and Christiano Ronaldo.\u0026nbspHe was the most-streamed artist of last year thanks to his third album\u0026nbspDivide,\u0026nbspwhich was powered by hits including lead single Shape of You, Castle on the Hill, Galway Girl and Perfect.Ed Sheeran: career in picturesEd moves to LondonEd Sheeran releases his EP You Need Me in 2009 including the song \u0027You Need Me, I Don\u0027t Need You\u0027, which would go onto become the second, Platinum single from his debut album +.In February 2010 Ed Sheeran toured with Example during which time they recorded the viral \u0027Nando\u0027s Skank\u0027 and Sheeran released his Loose Change EP, which features his future debut single \u0027The A Team\u0027.April 2010, he impresses Jamie Foxx after performing an open mic at his LA club The Foxxhole, receiving an invitation to stay at his house, record music and appear on his radio showEd Sheeran signed to AsylumAtlantic Records and released his debut album + (Plus) in September 2011.

The nature of our future trading relationship with the European Union straddles so many Tory totems from the role of business to the European Court of Justice to the border with Ireland. As a consequence an internal party “deal”\u0026nbspthat took two years to put together fell apart within two days and now we are once more the laughing stock of Europe with only a matter of months before we leave.Reforging 40 years of economic, political and societal links in a constructive, inclusive and forward-looking way would be a challenge for any government but is clearly far beyond the capacity of this one. As a government in waiting, it is Labour’s job not only to hold the government to account but to set out what our approach would be. This is the work that Keir Starmer and Labour’s Brexit team has undertaken, exemplified by the amendments our party tabled to the Great Repeal Bill. But it is also my job as shadow minister for industrial strategy to consider what Brexit means for our economic future and to place decisions in that context. And that has to mean an economic future that\u0026nbspincludes everyone, and does not merely carry over the regional and social ides that helped deliver the referendum result in the first place.To achieve this we need to look back even as we look forward. And to look outwards to the world even as we consider how best to maintain a close relationship with the European Union.The industrial landscape of Britain today is the product of a succession of industrial strategies or non-strategies, each of which was ultimately unable to deal with the reality of the larger world economy. Britain entered the 20th century hoping to maintain its position as the supplier of manufactured goods to the largest empire the world had ever known, a strategy that could not be sustained given the scale of US industry and the understandable desire of the rest of the Empire to build its own industrial base. By the 1960s, British industry was increasingly focused on our domestic market, but even that more limited “strategy”\u0026nbspproved untenable in the face of more efficient and larger scale foreign competition from the United States, Japan, Germany, Korea\u0026nbspand ultimately China.In response, the Tories under Margaret Thatcher and her successors, and to a lesser extent the 1997 Labour government, pursued a kind of “anti-industrial strategy”. This substituted first North Sea oil and then City of London financial services for industrial competitiveness. North Sea oil was a finite national asset that delivered the expected temporary economic boost. The impact of our burgeoning financial sector was more complex. It brought substantial benefits in jobs, revenues and social capital, particularly to London. It also drove the “financialisation”\u0026nbspof our economy.Financialisation\u0026nbsp– the anti-industrial strategy The way in which financialisation proved to be an anti-industrial strategy is admirably set out in leading economist Mariana Mazzucato’s new book The Value of Everything. In it she describes the “two faces of financialisation”.The first of these is the way in which the financial sector has stopped resourcing the real economy – instead of investing in companies that produce “stuff”, finance is financing finance. Why lend money to a manufacturer that may fail when you can make a bet on some options hedged with other options that virtually guarantee a return in a few weeks? The owner of a medium-sized manufacturing business gave me a striking example of this recently. His high-street bank was initially supportive when he requested a loan for new manufacturing equipment, which would significantly boost productivity. Once the bank realised that the equipment would not be something they could sell on should he go bankrupt, their interest drained away entirely. It was willing to lend based on liquidation value, but was not willing to take a risk on a living business. In a financialised economy, capital tends to flow towards standardised securities rather than actual operating businesses that present bespoke risks.But it is not only financial capital that is erted from the real economy. Human capital is sucked in too. When I graduated from Imperial College in 1987, I would estimate that only about 10 per cent of my electrical engineering cohort went into industry. The majority went into management consultancy and finance, which paid better as well as having clearer career paths. Recently the dean of an engineering department told me that was still the case and asked how I could expect engineers to go into engineering when finance paid so much better and was quite honestly the only way a graduate engineer could ever hope to buy a home in London.I responded that they should come to Newcastle where not only could they buy a lovely home on an engineer’s salary, but also be within a few minutes of some of the most beautiful countryside in the world and at the heart of a concentration of culture that rivals far bigger cities. I recognise the dean’s point – with so much financial engineering demanding money and people, real engineering doesn’t stand a chance. But it is real engineering that drives industrial productivity.Financialisation is not just a problem because it drains resources away from industry. In a financialised economy, investors with short-term horizons tend to have more control over firms. This results in less reinvestment of profits and rising burdens of debt that, in a vicious cycle, makes industry even more driven by short-term considerations. In effect, this kind of finance is not neutral but changes the nature of what it finances.This was seen just recently with the GKN takeover by “turnaround company”\u0026nbspMelrose. An estimated 20 to 25 per cent of the shares in GKN were in the hands of hedge funds, many of which were expected to back the takeover – with the firm Elliott Advisors, owning 3.8 per cent\u0026nbspof the company, explicitly doing so. The bid was won by 52 per cent to 48 per cent. And Melrose itself is not run in any long-term interest other than maximising shareholder value: it has a long history of operating as a “turnaround firm” and almost a third of its own shares are held by hedge funds. The vote was essentially a referendum about the time horizons of British industry, and Britain lost.So when bankers and chancellors talk of having learned\u0026nbspthe lessons of the financial crisis they are wrong both at the macro and micro level. With UK national debt twice what it was in 2007 and household debt to disposable income at a record high, 10 years after the crash of\u0026nbspthe global economy, finance is once again at the heart of an existential threat to our way of life.Financialisation and inequality Even before the crash, this “anti-industrial strategy”\u0026nbspdrove social and geographic inequalities. Levels of income inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient reached a pre-crash peak of 0.35 in the 1990s and, while improving slightly, remained high in comparison to the Sixties throughout the 2000s. Regional inequality was also a significant feature of the pre-crash economy, with data from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research showing a gradual rise throughout the 2000s in the difference in gross household income between regions. In 2005, average household income in the North East was 14 per cent below the UK average, while in London it was 20 per cent higher.Gini Coefficient 1961-2016 – 1 is the most unequal score, 0 is the most equal\u0026nbsp(Institute for Fiscal Studies)The Tories were either indifferent to these inequalities or at best felt they were an acceptable price to pay. Labour, under previous leaderships, believed that redistributive policies could make it all come out right in the end, and flagship programmes such as Sure Start and working tax credits certainly helped. But both approaches were fundamentally mistaken. Financialisation turned out to be a house built on sand – unable to generate enough wealth to compensate for the abandonment of the rest of the economy, and vulnerable to boom and bust cycles. Ultimately, the financial crisis of 2008 and the global economic crisis it spawned showed that the ideology of finance – that financial markets and institutions, left to themselves and the profit motive, would efficiently allocate capital – was a pernicious fantasy.British industry—creating real value in the real economyBut that was not the whole story. While\u0026nbspmetropolitan London came to comprise 40 per cent\u0026nbspof the British economy – and a 40 per cent\u0026nbspheavily dependent on finance and professional services – something else was happening in the rest of the country. Britain’s entry into the European Union, and the survival in parts of Britain of a culture favourable to engineering and manufacturing, fostered the growth of certain sectors of British industry as part of a larger integrated European industrial base. The supply chains of large European firms such as Airbus, Boeing and BMW are substantially British. Nissan’s Sunderland plant is the final destination for parts manufactured across Europe and produces more cars per worker than any other factory in the European Union. And GKN, itself one of the world’s oldest engineering firms, is a key supplier to international aerospace and automotive firms – including European giant Airbus, which warned against the Melrose takeover. Factories engaged in producing components and sub-assemblies and assembling components from elsewhere in Europe are now critical to the prosperity of much of Britain. Figure 1 shows just one of BMW’s many supply chains.Such integration requires frictionless borders but also agreed standards to define everything from the acceptable frequency of electromagnetic radiation to the atomic composition of a given chemical. Leaving the European Union will not mean less regulation simply more duplication. As they scramble to recreate existing EU agencies and regulations, businesses and government departments are realising that far from Brussels bureaucracy being imposed upon Britain, the European Union was effectively based on the “shared back office services”\u0026nbspmodel that Whitehall now champions for local government.In many ways, British agriculture has followed a similar trajectory to British car manufacturing, where British farmers have been able to successfully compete on both quality and price in markets defined by EU food safety rules. For example, British farmers export far more wheat flour to the EU – approximately 250,000 tonnes last year – than they do to non-EU countries – approximately 6,000 tonnes. The same goes for other agricultural products such as barley (one\u0026nbspmillion tonnes versus 50,000 tonnes) and oats (16,000 tonnes versus 4,000 tonnes).The EU is the largest importer and exporter of food in the world. As an EU member state, our farmers have benefited from preferential access to this market through exemptions from the tariffs and quotas imposed on non-member countries. And with 85 per cent of seasonal agricultural workers in the UK coming from Bulgaria and Romania, agriculture is one of the UK sectors most heavily dependent on freedom of movement.Food and drink is Britain’s largest manufacturing sector and Europe’s complex rules of origin guidelines could lead to a “hidden hard Brexit”\u0026nbsprequiring the restructuring of food manufacturing supply chains even if we secure preferential access.\u0026nbspAgriculture and manufacturing are both more important outside of London and particularly around the very market towns that have been most “left behind” by the new economy.As Britain contemplates how to engage with the world before, during and after Brexit, we need to understand the trade policy choices we make will drive the shape of our economy and are therefore also industrial policy choices, choices that will shape the very nature of what work we do, the health of our communities\u0026nbspand the way we live for decades to come.  The benefits of a customs union The Labour Party is united in supporting a customs union with Europe. We believe it will bolster our current industrial strengths and offer the possibility of continued industrial revival in certain sectors. We should not be complacent about this approach. Our place in the larger European manufacturing economy will still depend on our ability to innovate and to invest, so that British firms successfully manage and not just participate in supply chains. And this will depend on our learning the lessons of the financial crisis so that our financial markets and institutions actually invest in productive sectors.Unfortunately, the government continues to act as if the only issues in financial regulation are safety, soundness and fraud. While these are obviously important issues, they completely miss the question of whether our financial system is effectively channelling capital to productive and innovative investment. And this is the whole point of a financial system. A financial system that simply parks money in risk-free assets or honestly gambles on sporting events, would meet the characteristics the Tories have established but would still be a total failure. As Mazzucato argues, the traditional policies we have seen create a “healthy financial sector (bailed out, ring-fenced, and restructured) in a deeply sick economy”.Implications for industrial strategy of the alternativesLast week’s visit by President Trump to Britain revealed that he thinks the UK-US relationship is “the highest level of special”. Arch Brexiteers argue that he offers an alternative to a customs union with Europe: a free trade agreement with the United States, which, as a consequence of Nafta\u0026nbspwould really be a free trade agreement with all of North America. But while\u0026nbspthe US economy is of comparable size to the EU in GDP terms, $19 trillion (£14 trillion)\u0026nbspcompared to $17 trillion, they have different sectoral compositions and regulatory standards. Going in this direction would lead to substantial changes in the structure of the British economy.Earlier this year, trade experts at Harvard University published a report that included a candid assessment of obstacles to a US-UK free trade agreement. Its authors, including former shadow chancellor Ed Balls, reached the conclusion that it is “highly unlikely that a free trade deal between the US and the UK will be secured in the near term”\u0026nbspand, in addition, “the likely potential benefits for British businesses are less than often suggested”.The report focused on likely US demands for access to British food markets and likely British demands for access for British firms to US financial and professional services markets. These demands map the likely direction a US-UK free trade agreement would take both countries. Britain is attractive to the US as a market for agricultural products and for goods manufactured through US-controlled supply chains. Britain is also seen by some as a source of relatively low cost financial and professional services. Without an EU customs union, American business does not see Britain as a manufacturing platform – British wages are too high given the distance to the North American market. Labour costs per hour in manufacturing are on average £27 in the US and £23 in the UK – a £4 difference that does not compensate for transport costs.In a UK detached from the European market, the role of British industry in European supply chains will therefore not be replaced by similar roles in US-based supply chains. This is the critical point for UK manufacturing – we cannot replace European supply chain integration with North American supply chain integration.In addition, if British food safety rules are relaxed as part of a trade deal with the US, it is likely that cheap American agricultural products will significantly displace British agriculture. So we will eat chlorinated chicken from Arkansas, bake with GM flour from Dakota\u0026nbspand barbecue antibiotic drenched beef from Illinois. US farming is largely in the hands of mega industrial organisations. Agriculture is a much greater proportion of US GDP than it is of UK GDP. There are farms in Texas that are bigger than major UK counties – 500 square miles, for example. We cannot compete with agriculture on that scale without harming our landscape and bioersity, especially given that we already use substantially more of our land in percentage terms on agriculture than does the US. If our markets are opened up to US agricultural products, UK farming will either adapt to US food safety practices and scale or our agriculture will diminish greatly. If we were to follow the bidding of the arch-Brexiteers and take the US as our model partner it would be the end of our landscape and bioersity as we currently know it.In the place of agriculture and industry, there will be a US market for British financial services and other professional services such as\u0026nbsplaw, accountancy and management consulting. However, just as we have seen the integration of British manufacturing into European firms, we will likely see a wave of mergers and acquisitions in services as British firms are acquired by US firms seeking to serve the US market with British professionals. As a consequence, while\u0026nbspmanufacturing and agriculture would suffer, services and finance might not remain in British hands, especially given the current takeover regime that substantially limits the scope for government protection of UK businesses.A Britain without a customs union with the EU and with a free trade agreement with the US would have less industry, less agriculture, but more finance and more service sector jobs. It would likely be a Britain of growing regional and social disparities, and a Britain more vulnerable to financial instability. After all, it was the high concentration of financial services in the UK economy that meant we were hit particularly hard by the last financial crisis. If the UK economy consolidates further around finance, then we will become even more vulnerable.Turning from North America some look to the Commonwealth as an alternative future that harks to our past. We have strong ties to English-speaking Commonwealth countries around the world – economic ties as well as ties of language, immigration and history. In a digital world, we have the possibility of building networks of innovation that could contribute both to our own industrial competitiveness as well as the competitiveness of our partners.Countries as erse as Nigeria, Australia and India are all racing to be centres of technological innovation and to solve pressing problems in areas such as energy and education. In a sense, if we are open to our former colonies as partners, and generous with access to our own centres of innovation, we could perhaps create alternative pathways to competitiveness for our industry.But those same countries have requested access to the UK through preferential visa arrangements as part of any free trade agreement. India has requested an increase in the number of visas issued to skilled Indian workers and allow students to stay for longer after graduating, but so far government has refused calls to relax visa rules even within the current framework. Australia and other Commonwealth countries want their citizens to be granted the same rights as Europeans: to live and work in the UK after Brexit.Building a competitive commonwealth innovation network effectively requires the opposite of our current attitudes towards the Global South. Commonwealth leaders have criticised the government’s – reported – characterisation of post-Brexit trade as ‘Empire 2.0’. This was reflected in our treatment of the Windrush generation, which, in a sense, like our approach to Brexit, threatens to close critical doors to a better future for British industry and for Britain as a whole.Whether we look to North America or the Commonwealth, into our past or forward to the type of economy we want to become, the arguments bring us back to a customs union with the EU and an industrial strategy that will help rebalance the economy and provide the directed investment to get it growing again. The billions poured by the Bank of England into quantitative easing have signally failed to do this.A Labour government would invest £250bn over 10 years through our National Transformation Fund, and set up a National Investment Bank, as well as a network of regional development banks to channel investment into productive enterprises across the country, unlocking productivity and creating growth.Royal family release official photos from Prince Louis’s christeningPrince William and Prince Charles ‘refused to meet Trump’A history of tense meetings between US and Russian presidentsWe need to understand as we approach critical decision points around our trade policy and our financial regulatory policy\u0026nbspthat these are choices that will shape not just our relations with the outside world but Britain itself – that choices labelled trade policy or immigration policy or financial regulatory policy are in fact industrial policy, agricultural policy and economic policy.The Tory party ideologues are in no state to set out a vision for our future economy, far less to rationally assess the policies needed to make it a reality. Financialisation has proven to be an economic dead-end, creating wealth for the few at the expense of social equality, regional balance and long-term productivity growth.To build a more competitive and equal Britain post-Brexit we need a deal that strengthens our productive sectors such as manufacturing rather than one that deepens financialisation and risks our long-term prosperity. We also need a real industrial strategy based on our regional strengths that enables investment in the productive economy, delivering jobs in our towns as well as our cities that creates value regionally and nationally that can be shared by all.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Yet only a year or two ago we were told by many (rather gleefully in some cases) that the influencer was dead or at least in crisis.Earlier this year, this seemed to be confirmed as the owner of the White Moose Cafe in Dublin turned the tables on\u0026nbsp22-year-old YouTube vlogger and influencer Elle Darby, by exposing her demand for five free hotel nights in return for exposure.His public burn spoke for many: “If I let you stay here in return for a feature in a video, who is going to pay the staff who look after you?” The twitter-mob turned on influencers. Who were they? How do they get away with it? Do they actually earn money?When the influencer marketing industry began (around 2008-10, attest the form’s historians) the notion took hold that like celebrity endorsement before it, aspirational people could become marketing tools, accessing the consumer mind as if a recommendation from a friend.YouTuber with 139,095 subscribers, was refused a free hotel stay (YouTubeElle Darby)As one observer put it:\u0026nbsp“They emerged almost overnight and in 10 years have gone from a small network to a worldwide community.” Some sources suggest that there is now a baseline of 1.1 million influencers worldwide.\u0026nbspMediakix estimated\u0026nbspthe industry was worth more than $1bn\u0026nbsp(£750m)\u0026nbspin 2017. Malcolm Gladwell’s coinage, “the tipping point”, was used a lot in meetings.\u0026nbspBy about 2014, a baffled world had started to understand influencer marketing, but the industry’s breakthrough year was probably 2016 when, as Hamda Issa-Salwe of Bravado, part of Universal Music Group, found when she did a research thesis called Investigating the Use of Influencer Marketing on Social Media.“It began to soar,” she says. “Google classified ‘influencer’ as a breakout keyword with a 5,000 per cent month by month increase in the number of times the search term ‘influencer marketing’ was typed.”Also in 2016, it was established that Kendall Jenner was paid an estimated $300,000 per social media post. Advertising agencies took more careful notice of influencers and Instagram –\u0026nbspfounded in 2010 – became the key station of the social media cross, along with other key platforms\u0026nbspsuch as YouTube, Snapchat and Pinterest.Even the fustiest legacy-media type can now see the point. The barrier to entry is low. All you need is a smartphone and a certain brio. And the research seems to add up. According to Nielsen, 84 per cent\u0026nbspof consumers trust opinions from people they know, while 70 per cent\u0026nbsptake action based on other consumer’s opinions online.vlogger Zoella reportedly has a net worth of £2.5m (InstagramZoella)The Association of National Advertisers found that 75 per cent\u0026nbspof members already work with influencers, and the growing industry will take 20 per cent\u0026nbspof the total global marketing budget by 2023.No wonder that 82 per cent\u0026nbspof millennials hope to become influencers at least, according to a survey by London-based dating app CLiKD.\u0026nbspSo the money’s talking, and influencers can do well.It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rentAs Anthony Svirskis, CEO\u0026nbspof TRIBE and a juror on the\u0026nbspSocial and Influencer award says:\u0026nbsp“On a post by post basis, brands should expect to pay £50 for someone with 3,000 followers and upwards of £300 if someone has more than 100,000 followers.” Small wonder the market is seething with aspirant influencers.\u0026nbspYet influencers are still derided as being without any particular skills: even that they’re the apotheosis of the entitled “Me” generation, spreading paid-for blandishments in vocal-fry vlogs on YouTube.While it’s hard to blame someone who travels the world in return for Instagram snaps, is there an influencer bubble waiting to burst? Paul Dyer, of marketing company Lippe Taylor, believes it will, as trust has disappeared from the sector in the sceptical Facebook-Cambridge Analytica era.“There is tremendous value in influencer marketing,” he said recently. “However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls out.”Indeed, there have been several influencer #epicfails, perhaps the most notable being\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspFestival, the ill-fated 2017 Bahamas musical festival that paid Kendall Jenner and Bella\u0026nbspHadid\u0026nbspto drum up support.\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspbombed and the repercussions are ongoing.There’s also an undergrowth of freebie-hunting influencers harassing hotels and providers. Some hotels – the\u0026nbspDusit\u0026nbspThani\u0026nbspresort in the Males among them – now use weeding out processes. “When they work hotels love them,” says one travel PR.\u0026nbspThe influencer economy … is a market irrationality. Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money“Influencers are uncritical and often share films and photographs that would otherwise be paid for. But there’s a trust problem.”There are other cracks in the influencer edifice as brands begin to ask questions about the business efficacy of influencers. As publicist Mark Borkowski says:\u0026nbsp“More brands are beginning to realise that influencer activity doesn’t necessarily drive ROI.”And the pain is on both sides, he adds. “It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rent.” Anti-influencers are coming of the woodwork –\u0026nbspand they’re not all crusty oldies with a grudge.“The influencer economy … is a market irrationality,” wrote Sam Biddle of Gawker in 2016. “Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money.” As for bots and fake followers, that’s a real problem.Fyre Festival attendees locked in airport ‘for their own safety’At Cannes, Unilever’s chief marketing officer Keith Weed called for industry action to clean out the influencer stable, and vowed never to use influencers found to be buying followers.So the sands are shifting. Hamda Issa-Salwe says that while influencer activity remains hard to define and audit, it’s still growing. Although trust and authenticity (the great influencer bon mot) are major factors, brands still spend a lot on influencers: after all,\u0026nbspInstagram has more 800 million monthly active users.And the influencers themselves are fighting back. It’s a new industry: of course legacy dinosaurs wouldn’t get it. It’s just another marketing tool. And what are –\u0026nbspsorry, were –\u0026nbspnewspapers half the time, but a vehicle of paid-for information?“Indeed, there’s a growing distrust of traditional media advertising,” says Harry Hugo, cofounder at The Goat Agency, Europe’s leading influencer agency, which claims to be growing at a rate of 600 per cent\u0026nbspa year.“Just look at the rise in ad blockers, investigations into media transparency and big networks like WPP struggling. Influencers can be one of the most trusted, and therefore highest converting, information sources for people.”\u0026nbspAlso, we jeremiahs just don’t get the craft and graft that goes into an influencer’s brand persona, adds Florencia Lujani, influencer marketing manager at agency We Are Social London.“People struggle to see why brands would pay money to partner with influencers for something which appears relatively simple,” she says. “But it takes time and effort, talent, passion and commitment.”\u0026nbspAnd even the thorny issue of disclosure –\u0026nbspthat is, whether you should know what someone is being paid to promote –\u0026nbspis a smaller issue than is often supposed, says Svirskis. “Influencers are very compliant of requirements to disclose and are often represented by an influencer agency.”There is tremendous value in influencer marketing. However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls outMost importantly of all, influencers make money for clients. Currently, the average ROI of influencer marketing is £7 back for every £1 spent, says Amelia Neate of Influencer Champions.\u0026nbspSo,\u0026nbspdo you have to be pretty? “It’s definitely not reserved for those with looks,” says Svirskis. “The cheesy smiles are long gone.” It’s about style and tone, he says, and as the industry matures it’s moving beyond lifestyle products like travel, beauty and fashion to finance, automotive –\u0026nbspeven dog food.“There are new influencers emerging every day, in every single vertical,” says Lujani. They’re marshalling themselves into communities: mummy bloggers, healthy eaters, sports fans – why, possibly even news organisations.\u0026nbspWith the maturation of the influencer world comes a shakeout: Influencer 2.0, if you will. Sheer numbers don’t matter so much anymore.\u0026nbspThe smart talk is now about engagement and micro-influencers,\u0026nbspthose with fewer than 100,000 followers and possibly as low as 5,000, but with proper peer recognition.\u0026nbspYouTuber Alfie Deyes came under fire for his recent video, ‘How I lived off £1 for a day’ (YouTubePointlessBlogVlogs)“Data shows that influence by measure of engagement actually increases as the audience size reduces,” says Svirskis. In a hedge-betting strategy, brands now prefer to work with 50 micro-influencers rather than one mega-influencer, and brands are taking influencer management in-house as influencer marketing moves into the mainstream.If children are obese then blame food manufacturers, not ZoellaInvestigation promised into Trump campaign data firmThree arrested after Facebook group raid cannabis field – only to Sexist men who abuse women on Facebook and Twitter are compensating“Most new industries go through periods of turbulence as they form foundations,” says Svirskis, who thinks that many of today’s influencers will become tomorrow’s creative directors and entrepreneurs.He has a point.

Throughout most of prehistory, food gathering and processing appears to have been carried out in order to ensure that food consumption was safe and provided more energy than it cost people to make. It was essentially carried out to produce a net energy gain.But now, archaeologists have discovered the world’s oldest bread – that was cooked and probably eaten in what appears to have been some sort of ultra-early ceremonial or religious complex.The discovery – at an archaeological site known as Shubayqa 1 in what is now desert in northeast Jordan – is particularly significant because wild cereal bread does not produce a net nutritional gain.It would have almost certainly cost the prehistoric people at Shubayqa 1\u0026nbspmore energy to make than they would have gained by consuming it.It is therefore likely that it was among the very first special\u0026nbspfoods to be made not primarily for nutrition – but mainly for cultural and potentially social or ideological reasons.The bread – made 3,500 years before the birth of agriculture –\u0026nbspis from an area and a time associated with the world’s oldest monumental stone buildings (constructed between 15,500 and 14,000 years ago).The buildings – which were not typical of the majority of houses of that era – were probably constructed for communal ceremonies and rituals (perhaps including feasting associated with celebrating or commemorating the dead). The rare stone-built complexes normally have human burials adjacent to or beneath them.The particular building that the bread was discovered in was around eight metres in diameter – and had a well-made stone-paved interior.In the building’s hearth, the archaeologists found evidence of food consumption (given the probable purpose of the building, potentially communal feasting).The food debris includes gazelle, water fowl and hare bones, wild mustard seeds, charred tubers and fragments of at least three different types of unleavened flatbread. It is therefore likely that any special communal meals celebrated there involved feasting on meat and roasted tubers wrapped in or eaten with flat bread in much the same way that people still often consume food in the Middle East and South Asia today.It is also conceivable that this probably ritualised early conception of bread in the Middle East 14,400 years ago represents the genesis of the long-standing religious importance of bread consumption in (or originally associated with) that region.In Judaism, ritually important bread was kept in a portable House of God (a sophisticated tent known as the Tabernacle) before the first great stone temple was built in Jerusalem – and of course special bread is still eaten every Friday evening throughout the Jewish world and a type of unleavened flatbread (called matzo) is still eaten by Jews at Passover.In Catholicism, unleavened communion bread is regarded as part of the body of Jesus – and in Lebanese Arab Christian tradition, a special bread called qurban is still used in ceremonies to commemorate the dead.At least three or four different types of flatbread have been discovered at Shubayqa 1.\u0026nbspA total of 254 fragments were found in the hearth of which 100 were analysed. Of these, only 24 yielded data on their composition. Of that sample, 75 per cent\u0026nbspwere made purely of wild wheat (probably wild Einkorn), 12.5 per cent\u0026nbsppurely from wild barley and 12.5 per cent\u0026nbspfrom a mixture of wild wheat and the tubers of a species of the large bull-rush-like plant, sedge.However, because lots of mustard seeds were also found in the hearth (and it is known from much later Middle Eastern evidence that such seeds were used in bread-making), it is conceivable that some of the other bread fragments at the site were made from wheat (or barley) mixed with mustard seeds.It is likely that barley was the most common wild grass available in the Shubayqa area at that time, and yet the early bread makers at the site appear to have chosen quite deliberately, in the main, to gather wheat. That may be a very significant choice – because wild wheat seeds have much more gluten in them than wild barley and would therefore have made bread dough with a greater degree of plasticity, thus allowing the making of much thinner flatbreads. The bread fragments discovered suggest that they were successfully making flatbreads which were just 5-7 millimetres thick.The entire process of bread-making was (and indeed still sometimes is) nutritionally relatively uneconomic. Harvesting wild cereals, separating the seeds, grinding them, making the dough, flattening the dough and cooking it was an energy and time consuming activity which would not, on consumption, have produced a net energy gain for the people of Shubayqa 1.The Shubayqa discovery may well therefore represent a profound change in human eating practice – away from the purely nutritionally utilitarian and towards a more culturally, socially and perhaps ideologically determined culinary tradition that is the norm throughout most of the world today.The site has been excavated by a team headed by Dr Tobias Richter of the University of Copenhagen. However, the analysis and identification of the bread was carried out by Lara Gonzalez Carretero of University College London’s Institute of Archaeology and Dr Amaia Arranz Otaegui of the University of Copenhagen.The Institute of Archaeology’s Prof Dorian Fuller, a leading expert on prehistoric cereals, said: “This discovery demonstrates that food became something that was valued for more than just calories. It reveals that people over 14,000 years ago had begun to consume food for social, cultural and potentially ideological reasons.”The discovery is also very important because it predates the first agriculture by some 3,500 years. All the cereals being harvested at Shubayqa 14,400 years ago were wild varieties, almost certainly growing in wild stands.The discovery suggests that bread-making probably in the end helped motivate people to start cultivating and domesticating cereals – a development that ultimately led to the birth of agriculture. That is the opposite to what academics had previously thought. Up till now, prehistorians had believed that agriculture led to the invention of bread. The new discovery suggests that the truth is likely to have been the other way round.“The production of a bread-based cuisine was one of the motivations behind people developing agriculture in the Middle East. It is from the Middle East that agriculture and bread spread to Europe and North Africa,” said Professor Fuller.In the 15th millennium BC bread was almost certainly a totally new food, although the relatively rare harvesting of wild cereals for toasting and possible use in porridge form had occurred, perhaps intermittently, since around 23,000 years ago in the Middle East and in China.“Shabayqa 1 is important not just because it has the earliest evidence for bread but also because it has some of the earliest stone buildings in the world,” said the director of the excavation, Dr Tobias Richter, associate professor of Near Eastern Archaeology at Copenhagen University.The discovery of the world’s oldest bread at the Shubayqa 1 site\u0026nbspis being published\u0026nbspin the US journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\u0026nbspThe prehistoric bread discovered at Shubayqa 1 is some 5,000 years older than the previously oldest known bread, also from the Middle East.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But there is a greater mystery at the heart of the idea, too.Though scientists know an incredible amount about that expansion,\u0026nbspand have studied in fascinating detail the rate at which it is happening,\u0026nbspit is still not clear how quickly that expansion is happening. And that is not because we do not know enough – rather because the vast amount we do know does not seem to agree.In fact, as scientists get more precise measurements of that rate, known as the\u0026nbspHubble constant, they become more confused. And recent ultra-precise measurements have suggested that some mysterious, new and undiscovered physics might be at work in the universe.Repeated findings from measurements using technology such as the Hubble Space Telescope have found strange discrepancies in the speed of expansion. Repeated findings have discovered that the universe appears to be expanding faster now than it was just after the big bang.The strange discrepancy looks like a mistake. But it becomes more clear as the results become more precise that it is in fact not a bug but a feature of the universe, as\u0026nbspNobel Laureate Adam Riess\u0026nbsphas put it.The discrepancy – which relies on work done by\u0026nbspLemaître\u0026nbspdecades ago – is something like measuring the height of\u0026nbspa child when it is three years old, then meeting the same child again when it is older and finding that it is far more tall than you would ever expected it to be.A whole host of explanations for this strange effect have been proposed. Almost all of them rely on the 95 per cent of the universe that remains dark and mysterious to us – the parts of the cosmos that we know through theory that are there, but which we have never directly seen.The strange effect could be the consequence of dark energy, which scientists already think is powering the expansion of the universe. It might be that dark energy is pushing galaxies apart with more strength, suggesting that the Hubble constant, so important to\u0026nbspLemaître\u0027s work, is not really a constant at all but changes through time.Or it could be caused by a mysterious\u0026nbspsubatomic particle, travelling through the universe at the speed of light, but which we have not yet seen. Yet another suggestion is that dark matter could interact with normal matter in ways we didn\u0027t understand before.Scientists don\u0027t know which of these is the case – or if the explanation is something else entirely. But it does appear that there is something very strange and as yet undiscovered happening in the universe, acting as it expands.Whatever it is will sheds new light on the expansion of the universe\u0026nbsp– an already stunning discovery when it was first proposed by\u0026nbspLemaître, and one that becomes all the more awe-inspiring as we learn more about it.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The water company said these methods use only a fraction as much\u0026nbspwater.\u0026nbspUsing a hosepipe for an hour will utilise 540 litres of water, which is roughly the same as the amount a family of four gets through in one day. Leaving a sprinkler on overnight can get through as much water as a family of this size uses in a week.\u0026nbspPeople in Carlisle and the north Eden Valley are exempt from the ban. Their water supplies are at reasonable levels as they utilise discrete supply network zones from local sources, which are not connected to the integrated network which serves the rest of the region.\u0026nbspCustomers can check if the ban affects their area by visiting www.unitedutilities.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Neither the government or the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), with its considerable enforcement powers, are intervening in the recruitment sector where so much of the evidence demonstrates unlawful ways of working.“The public sector struggles to retain older workers when it should be leading the way, but the EHRC is not investigating whether the public sector equality duty is being met. We want it to do so.”The report calls\u0026nbspon the government to work with the EHRC to agree specific enforcement actions.It also urges\u0026nbspa mandatory approach to flexible working, adding: “We recommend that flexible working be the default from the time jobs are advertised onwards. Many older workers often take on a range of caring responsibilities.“The government should therefore introduce a statutory entitlement to five days’ paid carer’s leave, and a longer period of unpaid leave, to help stop those caring for a loved one falling out of the labour market unnecessarily.”The MPs said that given the recruitment crisis in some parts of the public sector, the EHRC must undertake an urgent\u0026nbspinvestigation\u0026nbspinto ways of working that are resulting in\u0026nbspthe lack of retention of older workers, and ensure that this is not the result of discriminatory practices.Commenting on the report, Ms Miller said: “Age discrimination in the workplace is a serious problem, as many older people have discovered.“Yet despite it being unlawful for more than a decade, the scale and lack of enforcement uncovered by our inquiry is both alarming and totally unacceptable. The government and the EHRC have failed to get to grips with this.”She added: “As a country we face serious challenges recruiting and retaining an experienced and skilled workforce.“Until we tackle discrimination against the growing number of over 50s, they will continue to be consigned to the ‘too old’ pile instead of being part of the solution.”Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said\u0026nbspage discrimination was “still rife”, with 36 per cent\u0026nbspof 55-64 year olds feeling like they’ve been disadvantaged or treated negatively because they were perceived as being older.\u0026nbsp“A lot more needs to be done to combat the negative stereotypes of older workers,” she said.“It goes without saying that if you work fewer hours you will earn less, and for older workers who are compelled to do less work than they would like, it could make it a lot tougher to cope with any rise in state pension age, let alone have any spare income to save for their retirement.”Dr Brian Beach, a senior research\u0026nbspfellow at ILC-UK who gave oral evidence to the committee, said: “Tackling ageism in the labour market and promoting age-friendly employment standards are vital steps to ensure that older people have the opportunities they want to work in later life.\u0026nbspUK news in picturesTheresa May arives to open the Farnborough AirshowNovak Djokovic lifts the trophy after winning the men\u0027s singles final match against Kevin Anderson at WimbledonFar-right protesters demanding the release of jailed EDL founder Tommy Robinson brought chaos to central London after blockading a bus being driven by a woman in a headscarf during the marchUS President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa during their meeting at Chequers in BuckinghamshireUS President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump arrive in the UKEngland manager Gareth Southgate and his players look dejected after they lost their World Cup semi final match against Croatia at Luzhniki Stadium in MoscowSerena Williams celebrates after winning against Camila Giorgi during their women\u0027s singles quarter-final match on the eighth day of Wimbledon.

CCTV footage shows the attack and moment he was left for dead.The tragic death that triggered the #JusticeJunior campaign has inspired New York State Senator Luis Sepúlveda and Assemblyman Victor Pichardo to propose Safe Havens for Endangered Children legislations, also called \u0027Junior\u0027s Law\u0027.Speaking alongside some of Junior’s family members outside at a press conference at the bodega where he sought help, Mr Sepulveda said more needed to be done to protect children in danger.We want to make sure that any business owner or their employees who encounter a situation involving a minor who has been abused or may be in danger has a duty to try to help,” he said. Community businesses should be safe havens for our youth. They should promptly notify police.”\u0026nbspHe added that another measure of the bill would ensure that small businesses to have first aid kits on hand “to help those who are injured to save lives”.The proposed bill has the support of Junior’s father Lissandro Guzman, who said in a statement: I feel very content and with all my heart I hope the bill that carries my son\u0027s name gets passed so it can prevent situations like this from happening again and so we can create more security for our beloved children.”If passed, businesses that fails to “provide a safe refuge for a child who had physical injury inflicted upon him or is in imminent danger of such injury until authorities arrive,” would face penalties.In the wake of Junior’s murder much of the anger was directed at the bodega, where he had sought refuge from the gang members. Surveillance footage from inside the Cruz and Chiky Grocery store showed the moment he rushed\u0026nbspinto the store and jumped over the counter.Store owner Modesto Cruz said at the time that he tried to help the teen by letting him hide behind the counter, but the gang threatened him.World news in picturesHugo Lloris lifts the trophy after France beat Croatia 4-2 in the World Cup final in the Luzhniki Stadium in RussiaGermany\u0027s Angelique Kerber beat seven-time champion US player Serena Williams in the Wimbledon final.

She insisted the amendments did not change her plan.And tonight she avoided a humiliating defeat in the House of Commons by just three votes, just minutes after it was revealed the Government is set to table a motion to bring forward the Parliament\u0027s summer recess in an apparent bid to stave off a leadership coup.\u0026nbspIn the latest departure, North Cornwall MP Scott Mann quit as a parliamentary private secretary in the Treasury ministerial team yesterday hours before the debate on the Customs Bill.Following the resignations of Cabinet minister Boris Johnson and David Davis, Mr Mann was the 10th Tory frontbencher to quit the Government within nine days following the furious row over the Brexit plan set out in a white paper discussion document.Brexit news: Theresa May is desperate to avoid a Tory leadership coupIn his resignation letter to the Prime Minister, Mr Mann wrote: I fear the elements of the Brexit white paper will inevitably put me in direct conflict with the views expressed by a large section of my constituents.I am not prepared to compromise their wishes to deliver a watered-down Brexit.Mrs May accepted the amendments after talks with Jacob Rees-Mogg and Sir Bernard Jenkin, leading figures in the backbench European Research Group, yesterday.The amendments were tabled by the pair along with former Cabinet minister Priti Patel and Iain Duncan Smith.The quartet had been leading critics of Mrs May\u0027s Brexit plan, which proposed a common rulebook with the EU covering trade in goods after Brexit.One of their proposed amendments demanded that the EU should collect British tariffs on imports in exchange for a commitment in the plan for UK border officials to collect EU tariffs in a scheme to avoid extensive customs checks at the Irish border.Another amendment demanded that a future customs union with the EU can only be set up with approval by Parliament.Other amendments also sought to enshrine in law a commitment that Northern Ireland will not be treated differently from the EU and a promise that the UK will not become part of the EU\u0027s VAT regime.Brexit news: Theresa May has avoided a humiliating defeat in the CommonsA spokesman for the Prime Minister said: We are accepting them because we think they are consistent with the white paper we published last week.Senior Tory MP and leading Eurosceptic Sir Bernard Jenkin said: These amendments were only ever about clarifying Government policy, that the UK will not join a customs union with the EU, nor agree to split Northern Ireland from the UK for customs purposes, that we are leaving the EU VAT regime, and any customs arrangement with the EU is not one-sided.By accepting these amendments, the Government does no more than confirm our understanding of stated Government policy.Ms Patel, who tabled the amendment calling for reciprocal action on collecting tariffs, said the Government\u0027s acceptance was constructive.We have been calling for change, we have been calling for more engagement and the wider arguments to be heard, she said.But fellow backbencher Peter Bone, another signatory to the amendments, described yesterday\u0027s events as a shambles and called for the entire Brexit plan agreed at Chequers to be dropped.He said: I can\u0027t possibly dress it up in any other words than it\u0027s an absolute shambles and a self-inflicted shambles by Number 10.But the Government\u0027s acceptance of the amendments enraged pro-Brussels Tories last night.In angry clashes in the Commons, former business minister Anna Soubry said: It is my firm view that it is deeply regrettable that this Government has accepted those amendments even though they cleary seek to undermine if not regret the great advances that have been made in this white paper.She claimed that Mr Rees-Mogg and his Eurosceptic allies were now running Britain.Brexit news: The Government may bring forward the summer recess in a bid to avoid a coupMs Soubry said the Government was frightened of about 40 hard, no deal Brexiteers who should be seen off.She told the Commons: Members on the frontbench and across this place should be shaking their heads with shame - this is the stuff of complete madness.And the only reason that the Government has accepted these amendments is because it is frightened of somewhere in the region of 40 Members of Parliament - the hard, no deal Brexiteers, who should have been seen off a long time ago and should be seen off.These are people who do not want a responsible Brexit, they want their version of Brexit - they don\u0027t even represent the people who actually voted Leave.The consequences of this are grave, not just for our country but also for this party.Labour MP Stephen Kinnock accused the Prime Minister of dancing to the tune of the European Research Group.Mrs May was capitulating and her plan was dead in the water, he said.The Prime Minister gathered her cabinet together ahead of a crunch Brexit showdown at her country retreat at Chequers in Buckinghamshire                    PA1 of 14Members of the cabinet and government officials gather at ChequersBut Mrs May insisted the amendments do not change the blueprint agreed at her country residence.She told MPs: He is absolutely wrong in his reference to the agreement that was reached at Chequers, I would not have gone through all the work that I did to ensure that we reached that agreement only to see it changed in some way through these Bills.They do not change that Chequers agreement and the minister from the despatch box later today will be making that clear.Ministers were last night understood to be considering an attempt to start the Commons summer break early in an attempt to shore up the Prime Minister\u0027s position.Whitehall insiders said a plan to table a motion calling for the house to rise on Thursday could be tabled for MPs to vote on within days.It was cut short the sitting, which had been due to run until next Tuesday, giving less time for Tory plotters to gather support for a motion of no confidence in the Prime Minister.One MP said the move was being actively considered while a Whitehall source said: It might be possible.A Labour source said of the early summer recess plan: \u0026ldquoTheresa May sounds like she is running scared of her own MPs.

I even took him up on the rostrum in sales and got him to play with the gavel. The bear, star of the much-loved 1950s children\u0026rsquos TV show that famously ended every episode with the line \u0026ldquoBye bye every body, bye bye, will be sold with an estimate of \u0026pound2,000 to \u0026pound3,000.This is despite being slightly the worse for wear after getting \u0026ldquorather messed up on The Sooty Show, according to Corbett.And it\u0026rsquos perfect timing because this year is Sooty\u0026rsquos 70th birthday.The cheeky bear was created by Corbett in 1948 when he bought a yellow puppet on Blackpool\u0026rsquos North Pier for seven shillings and six pence (37.5p) to entertain his children on holiday.                Antiques Roadshow star has an emotional reunion with Sooty                One of the oldest surviving Sooty puppets expected to fetch thousands Later he used soot to blacken its ears and nose, hence the name Sooty.The rare early puppet has come to auction thanks to a friendship that blossomed in Blackpool in the 1950s and that led to two children having their very own real Sooty to play with throughout their childhood.The newly discovered Sooty is known to be one of the first used by the puppeteer, whose son Matthew eventually took over his father\u0026rsquos iconic act on television.It was given in 1957 to the Blackpool-based musician Arthur Abbott whose stage name was Art Johnson.Art was a friend of Corbett\u0026rsquos, whom he had got to know in the seaside town\u0026rsquos holiday heyday in the 1950s and 1960s when stars such as Jimmy Tarbuck and Morecambe and Wise entertained in its theatres.Art\u0026rsquos son Dr Steven Abbott, 58, from Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, says: \u0026ldquoMy dad worked as a pianist in an awardwinning big band and smaller ensembles at venues around Blackpool.\u0026ldquoMy mother Mona took a job on the Central Pier as an usherette. They knew or met the stars of the day, including Ken Dodd and Harry Corbett, who was also a pianist and worked on cruise ships for a while.PAFITS LIKE A GLOVE: Harry adored his creation\u0026ldquoThey got to know each other through working in the summer shows in Blackpool and my dad helped him with some music ideas. He gave him the Sooty puppet to say thank you.The letter of thanks that Corbett wrote to Art, on Sootyheaded writing paper, reads: \u0026ldquoJust a line to say thank you very much for the list of tunes which came in very, very handy on the cruise. I have great pleasure in sending you one of the Sootys which I have used on television.\u0026ldquoActually he was in a programme where he got rather messed up and he has since been washed. \u0026ldquoHowever when he has a brush-up I am sure he will look very nice.\u0026ldquoAgain, many thanks and best wishes \u0026ndash Harry Corbett.The puppet was given to Art two years before Steven was born and when his sister Lorraine was 16 months old.NCHANDING OVER: Matthew with (l-r) Sooty, Sue, Scampi, and Sweep\u0026ldquoThe puppet was in our toy box, adds Steven. \u0026ldquoWe knew he was a genuine Sooty from the TV show but were allowed to play with him.\u0026ldquoAfter my sister and I left home my mother kept Sooty as a reminder of when we were children.In fact Mona Abbott, who died eight years ago at the age of 81, having outlived her husband by 22 years, lost Sooty for a while.When she found him again she sat him in pride of place on her sofa.\u0026ldquoMy parents have both now passed away and we thought it would be nice to let someone else enjoy the magic of Sooty, says Steven.This is the second time the auctioneers have had the privilege of selling a Sooty glove puppet once used by Corbett.In 2008 the TV presenter, writer and magician Richard Cadell, who bought the rights to the Sooty brand, paid \u0026pound3,100 for an original Sooty.Charles Hanson, owner of Hansons Auctioneers, recalls the auction well. \u0026ldquoIt was the first time I\u0026rsquod accepted bids from a puppet, courtesy of Mr Cadell\u0026rsquos Sooty, and seen under-bidders drenched by a water-pistol, he reveals.BUT the dream eventually turned into something of a nightmare for Harry Corbett, who died in 1989. According to Matthew, Sooty inspired such strong affection in his father that he loved him as if he were one of his own children.He would drill air holes in his travelling boxes and would even apologise to Sooty if he dropped him.Even after he\u0026rsquod relinquished ownership to his son, Harry found it hard to endure life without him. \u0026ldquoOne day he turned around and said to me, \u0026lsquoIf I can\u0026rsquot work with Sooty again there\u0026rsquos no point in carrying on living\u0026rsquo, Matthew once recalled.And that is why Corbett was still performing on stage hours before he suffered a fatal heart attack at the age of 71.\u0026ldquoI want to get something straight, the venerable but frail entertainer told that final capacity audience at the Pavilion Theatre in Weymouth, Dorset.\u0026ldquoMatthew is Sooty\u0026rsquos very good friend \u0026ndash but I am Sooty\u0026rsquos dad.Sooty will be sold in a toy auction at Hansons Auctioneers, Derbyshire, on August 22.

theoretical grounds the universe was expanding, which was later confirmed observationally by Edwin Hubble, in what is known as Hubble\u0026rsquos Law.He is also credited with proposing the concept that the universe expanded from an initial point, which he called the \u0026ldquoprimeval atom or \u0026ldquothe Cosmic Egg, exploding at the moment of the creation.His theory was presented in one of his academic papers in 1931, and it is now widely known as the \u0026ldquoBig Bang theory.The astronomer and professor was born on July 17, 1894, in Charleroi, Belgium, and began studying civil engineering at the Catholic University of Leuven at the age of 17.His academic studies were interrupted when he signed up to serve as an artillery officer in the Belgian army during World War One.Following the conflict he studied physics and maths at university along with preparing for the diocesan priesthood.He completed his doctorate in 1920 and was ordained as a priest in 1923.He became a post-graduate student in astronomy at the University of Cambridge in 1923, before spending the following year at Harvard College Observatory in the US.Georges Lema\u0026icirctre and Albert Einstein attended a series of seminars in California in 1933Mr Lema\u0026icirctre returned to Belgium in 1925 and became a part-time lecturer at the Catholic University of Leuven, where he started to work on his groundbreaking research.He published his cutting-edge theory that the universe was expanding in his famed report in 1927, but it did not specifically link to the notion of the Big Bang theory.He later suggested the universe had expanded from a single point, which he referred to as the \u0026ldquoPrimeval Atom.In 1933 Mr Lema\u0026icirctre attended a series of seminars at the California Institute of Technology along with world-renowned scientists including Albert Einstein.After outlining his theory of the universe\u0027s creation to the scientists, Mr Einstein is reported to have said: \u0026ldquoThis is the most beautiful and satisfactory explanation of creation to which I have ever listened.One of the most fascinating things about the universe is how little we really know

She was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia and died a few days later. Gemma was just 40 years old.Simon had to tell their eight- year-old son Ethan that his mum was dead, and the two of them have been trying to cope ever since.Everyone mourns the death of someone they have loved and adored in different ways.There’s no timetable for grief, and no “one size fits all” way to get through the whole soul-crushing experience. For Simon, the death of his wife felt like a physical illness and being in intensive care.He decided to leave his job at Sky Sports to be with Ethan full time and they now both have an unbreakable bond.Simon is obviously very ­protective of his young son, but that works both ways.Ethan will often tell his dad that he is OK even when he is really suffering and missing his mum, because he doesn’t want Simon to worry about him, or to add to his dad’s pain.He sounds like a remarkable young lad who is a credit to both of his parents.For Simon, one of the worst things about Gemma’s death is the acute loneliness.After he has put Ethan to bed and he is in the living room, there’s no Gemma on the sofa watching TV or just chatting about the mundane events of the day.He often breaks down while making dinner for two rather than three, or emptying the dishwasher or doing other household tasks they used to share but that he now has to do by himself.It’s those little things that bind us together, and that we miss so very much.Simon told me that there are those who have simply not been in touch since Gemma died. It’s not because they don’t care, but because they just don’t know what to say to him and Ethan.It was interesting to hear him say that the most comforting sympathy he received was from a woman he bumped into in the supermarket, who knew Gemma from meeting her at the school gate.She simply told him that it was “utter crap, totally unfair and completely f*****g hellish”.And it is.When someone you love dies, it is utterly s**t and it does no harm to say that.Telling a bereaved person you are sorry for their “loss” is well meaning and comes with the best possible intentions, but we “lose” car keys, credit cards and dog leads.Those we loved are ripped from our arms and our hearts and it feels like the end of the world.Those feelings don’t really ever go away — you just somehow learn to live with them.We need to somehow try to make that process more bearable. So don’t avoid a devastated husband, a mother whose child has died or an elderly widow who is mourning her soul-mate.Talk to them and check in with them, because one day you will need them to comfort you.Essie, portrayed by Kaye Wragg, above, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and had to undergo a complete hysterectomy, giving her no chance of ever having a much-yearned-for child of her own.Kaye gave her usual cracking performance, utterly believable and deeply moving. This storyline will have helped raise awareness of a cancer that is known as the “silent killer”.I hope we see more of Essie, as I always looked upon her as the quiet heart of Holby.If you missed this episode, make sure you go to the BBC iPlayer to catch up.WE’VE all had them – those house guests who overstay their welcome and are a complete pain in the bum.The disgruntled visitors who don’t like the food and complain the bed is too hard and won’t do a hand’s turn to help with the dishes or buy the odd loaf or bottle of wine.The ones where you do a jig when they have left and vow: “Never again.”So I sympathise with poor Mr and Mrs May, who have been putting up with the Trumps – veritable guests from hell.He’s the worst possible bullying boaster and you can imagine him dominating the conversation and being demanding and boorish.She has all the personality of a fembot and looks bored and disinterested at all times.Having the Trumps to stay was never going to be the easiest of rides for our PM and her husband.Aside from the thorny political discussions – and this week he has ripped up the rulebook and sold her down the river – there’s the distressing business of making small talk with this odd couple.I can just imagine Donald blowharding and manaplaining over pre- dinner drinks while poor Theresa becomes even more strained and develops a red stress rash on her neck.Her hubby Philip probably ended up talking to Melania about the weather.Trump has to be kept entertained like some bored little emperor, but you don’t want him to have too good a time that he will want to visit again soon.It’s a thorny one.Theresa has had the toughest of times recently, but she is made of strong stuff. While she might look a little tired around the eyes, our PM is no quitter – unlike the men who have let her down and put their own interests above those of the country.It might be trivial but I hope our PM can take some comfort in the fact she looked sensational in that sizzling red dress she wore to greet Trump.Theresa won the style battle with much younger ex-model Melania, who looked like a cut-price Belle from Disney’s Beauty And The Beast.Although Trump got it spot on as the Beast.FOR once this week, it wasn’t some poor actress who’d eaten a bowl of pasta for lunch and had a small, rounded belly being body-shamed.Russell Crowe was the subject of gleeful mirth by people who feel better about themselves by mocking others.Admittedly, the former buff star of Gladiator has piled on the pounds and looks like Thomas Markle’s older, larger brother. But by all accounts he’s chunked up for a movie role.Gladiator was 18 years ago and even Hollywood stars grow older and bigger. It appears, however, that equality in Tinseltown now means both women AND men being derided for not remaining visions of perfection and having the audacity to age.TODAY Serena Williams strides on to Centre Court to play for her eighth Wimbledon Ladies singles title.I have never seen a more majestic athlete on a tennis court since the heady days of my girl crush, Martina Navratilova.Serena is simply sensational and being a mother has made her even more hungry to win.It’s astonishing to think that just ten months ago, after the traumatic birth of her daughter and following multiple surgeries, she could hardly walk.Despite all she has gone through, I’ve never seen any athlete better prepared physically but also mentally.Serena can taste that title and no one is going to get in her way.I don’t envy her opponent, Angelique Kerber, today as it’s not just Wimbledon up for grabs.Serena also has her 24th singles grand slam in her sights, which would equal the record set by Margaret Court.Mrs Court was a hell of a tennis player but, as it turns out, not a great human being.She is a self-styled pastor in Australia and her views on gay rights and same-sex marriage are deeply distasteful.She claimed transgender children are the work of the devil, leading Martina Navratilova to label her “racist and homophobic”.So for that and so many other reasons, I’m firmly backing Serena today.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was also Donald Trump’s view in The Sun.But yesterday the PM convinced him otherwise. And she insisted “there will be no limit to the possibility of us doing trade deals around the world”.How are both positions possible? How will we enjoy such flexibility?How will our courts be supreme if we still heed ECJ rulings? How will we have total control of immigration if some EU workers can still come in as they see fit? And what will she do next if Brussels rejects it all?Leave voters’ rising anger is fuelled by the suspicion that behind the repeated assurances we are being stitched up.Mrs May must explain why we’re not. Explain how she talked round a doubting Trump. Explain how we will seize the opportunities Brexit presents. If she wants to admit her plan isn’t ideal but it’s the best there is, this is her moment.It’s time for honesty, not spin. The PM owes it to Britain. DO Remainers really not get the difference between President Obama giving his view on Brexit and President Trump doing so?Obama was egged on by Downing Street in 2016 to try to skew a democratic vote in favour of one side. He told us, falsely, that backing Brexit would put us last in the queue for a US trade deal.Trump’s argument in The Sun two years AFTER the vote was simply that Leave won and he doubted Mrs May’s strategy would fulfil on the verdict.He may be wrong. But Obama definitely was. Because once Trump replaced him, Britain hit the front of the US queue — a position only now threatened by staying tied to Brussels.Happy to help, Remain fans. WE wondered if President Trump might try to shoot the messenger when he realised how embarrassing his world exclusive Sun interview was to his host Mrs May.We’re used to that, of course. We’re not as used to seeing Mr Trump have the grace to back down when one of his “fake news” jibes is proved wrong, as it was yesterday.That’s not just a special moment. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In pubs, in shop windows, on cars, on scaffolding, on hats and shirts and flying above 10 Downing Street.And nobody was sneering at our flag now. Just guessing, but I doubt if anyone will be sneering at that flag any time soon.Not even Labour’s Emily Thornberry.What a ride. What a month-long high. What an adventure for those of us who are old enough to remember 1966 and also for the children who will remember this as the first World Cup they watched.Fifty years from today, those kids will still remember how they felt when England won a penalty shootout against Colombia, and when Kieran Trippier bent it better than Beckham after five minutes against Croatia.And they will remember to their dying day exactly what it felt like when we knew that England was not going to the final.The tears are real but so is the pride. And the pride — even more than the disappointment — is the overwhelming emotion today.England played with big hearts, true grit and the fearlessness of youth.They come home not as legends to rival the boys of 1966 but with their heads held high. Their nation is proud of them.And yes, it is only a game. It is not a war. Nobody died.But at a time when our nation is more horribly divided than at any time in modern history, we were reminded what a great country this still is, and how much we have to be proud of, and how much there is to love.And it was not your imagination — England was united once again.“Our country has been through difficult times in terms of unity,” said England’s young manager in his thoughtful, softly spoken manner.“Sport — football in particular — has the power to help that.“We’re a team that, with our diversity and our youth, represents modern England.In England, we have spent a bit of time being a bit lost as to what our modern identity is. I think we represent that modern identity and hopefully people can connect with us.”Gareth Southgate is right about the healing power of sport. This World Cup brought us together in a way we’ve not experienced since the London 2012 Olympics.But 2012 was before the bitter wounds of Brexit.It is Gareth Southgate himself who is the main reason this country has rallied around this England team.Southgate with his courtesy, his decency and his Yoda-like intelligence.Southgate,  who talks about “owning the process” and “managing our energy” — it is quite difficult to imagine the former England manager, Big Sam Allardyce, being comfortable with that kind of 21st Century dialogue. Southgate with his dapper shirt, tie and waistcoat combo, as suave as a suburban James Bond.Southgate who carries himself as if he is the living embodiment of Rudyard Kipling’s most famous poem.“If you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those imposters just the same . . . you will be a man, my son!”Even as England were celebrating their very first win in a World Cup penalty shootout, Southgate took time to comfort Mateus Uribe, one of the two Colombian players who had missed their penalty.This was more than an act of sportsmanship. It was an act of humanity.Because we all knew that Southgate has been there.The abiding memory of Gareth Southgate as a player — the one moment that everyone remembers — is in Euro 1996, with his shoulders sagging inside a grey England shirt and his spirit smashed after missing a penalty (we never recall the players who were too cowardly to step up and take a penalty — history gives them a pass).Stuart “Psycho” Pearce had known penalty redemption — missing in Italia 1990 but scoring in Euro 1996. Southgate’s redemption has been infinitely more convoluted.There was an image that went viral of the 25-year-old Gareth Southgate after just missing a penalty in 1996 being comforted by the 47-year-old Gareth Southgate who shook up the world in Russia in 2018.If this World Cup has gone some way to healing our divided nation, it has also gone a long way to healing the pain that Southgate has endured for half a lifetime.It is true what they say ­— success is not final, failure is not fatal.The manager was well served by this young team, who were light years away from the central casting image of the Premier League footballer — the pampered, wag-shagging, blingtastic, Bentley-crashing, multi-millionaire airhead.These England footballers — even the star striker, Harry Kane, who would cost a minimum £100million if Real Madrid came knocking — were clearly of and from the working class.They hail, every one of them, from modest beginnings. Most of the squad — 15 — paid their Premier League dues while out on loan in the lump-kicking lower leagues.“Barnsley, Leeds, Bolton, Blackburn,” said Southgate. “We’re lads who have come from those places.”This England team are not ordinary boys — they are elite professional athletes — but they have all been ordinary boys, and there was a humility about them, a work ethic and total lack of pretension that made you believe they will never forget their roots.And if they come from everywhere from the North East to Yorkshire to the Essex/East End borders, they also come from every kind of family.There were those who grew up in solid nuclear families with both mum and dad and siblings present, and those who were raised by single mums, and those who are from domestic chaos.Raheem Sterling’s father was murdered in Jamaica when he was two, and Dele Alli escaped the turmoil of his riven family life by moving in with his best friend’s family when he was 13.Their backstories are as diverse as our nation, but every one of them has grafted to get to the top.Sterling was berated for having an assault rifle tattooed on his leg but nobody ran harder or longer for the England cause than Raheem.When you watched his mesmeric, lung-busting runs, how could you not warm to him?How could you not forgive one dumb tatt?“Good lads,” said Southgate of his England squad, those boys from the Mersey and the Thames and the Tyne, from Bury and Leeds and Sheffield, and once again he said it all.They are good lads and we cheered them, and celebrated with them, and in the end, we shared their pain because it was our pain too, even in defeat against Belgium yesterday.They were a band of brothers and for one magical sun-drenched summer month, they lit up our nation.This World Cup was a roller-coaster ride that grabbed you by the scruff of your replica Three Lions shirt from the first match against Tunisia and refused to let go until the end of extra time against Croatia.They came SO CLOSE — Croatia led England for 11 minutes.That’s how agonisingly near we were to saying, “Bonjour, Monsieur,” in today’s World Cup final.It was gloriously entertaining, but it was also far more than just entertainment.It felt like Gareth Southgate and that young England team represented the very best of us.We learned — or we were reminded — that decency is not weakness, sportsmanship is not soft, and you need never feel one twinge of shame if you give your all.And we learned that we love our national game with a passion that can never be denied.I honestly thought we would win it.Typical England fan!I believed that this was the year we added the second World Cup winner’s gold star to the team shirt.When the England players were chucking around rubber chickens at a training session just before the Croatia semi-final, I thought it was a tension-busting masterstroke.It wasn’t to be.But this England team have been through the full range of human emotions — from joy to despair, hope to disappointment, and this country has been with them every step of the way.The struggle continues, the dream will never die.I reckon 50,000 England football fans will already be making plans to go to Qatar in 2022.This World Cup will be remembered for breaking our hearts and uniting our nation.And a grateful, emotionally exhausted country has just two words for those Three Lions.Thank you. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One able to set its own laws and control its borders.The idea of taking diktats from European courts, having no border control, and being unable to strike free trade deals — while paying Brussels £39billion — is not the Brexit people voted for.Mrs May should look at our poll today to see the bloody nose the Tories could be dealt at the next General Election.Unless she starts being honest with the country, then she will cause further disillusionment among voters, potentially opening the door to Jeremy Corbyn…Ushering in Britain’s first Marxist PM should not be a legacy Mrs May wants. EXPECTATIONS were not high before the World Cup began — for once.With the pressure lifted off the players’ shoulders — combined with Gareth Southgate’s leadership — our boys played with passion and determination.Despite yesterday’s loss to Belgium, they were real ambassadors for England.Meanwhile, the FA are set to apply for the 2030 World Cup.

Genomic editing involves altering certain sections of DNA within a woman’s egg or a man’s sperm before fertilisation in a lab.Alternatively, an embryo can be edited after fertilisation. The resulting changes would be passed down through future generations.Genomic editing is legal in the UK for research purposes but embryos must be destroyed after 14 days and cannot be implanted in the womb.Research is at an early stage and the science is not yet advanced enough to produce a designer baby with a checklist of characteristics.But the Nuffield report calls for more debate to assess support for the practice, saying it is important the law stays ahead of the science.It also says the technique should be strictly regulated, done in the context of a clinical trial, and licenced on a case-by-case basis.Committee chair Professor Karen Yeung said: “There is potential for heritable genome editing interventions to be used at some point in the future in assisted human reproduction, as a means for people to secure certain characteristics in their children.“We have concluded that the potential use of genome editing to influence the characteristics of future generations is not unacceptable in itself.“However, the possibilities it raises could have significant impacts on individuals, families and on society.“It is important that governments and public authorities step up and address these possibilities before people start asking to use this technology.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The first ever officially identified British meteotsunami hit the Cornish coastline in June 2011.Professor David Tappin of the British Geological Survey said: Most tsunamis are geological, where you have a vertical movement on the seabed which can be caused by an earthquake, like in Japan in 2011, or a landslide.Meteotsunamis, however, are created by weather. You need a small, rapid change in atmospheric pressure of just a few millibars, if you get one of these then it can change the sea surface elevation by a few centimetres."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000420905377-e1531774409462.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"no deal brexit card is already on the table for theresa may the widely misunderstood wto","story":"In particular, by tying us into EU regulatory standards on goods, it would make it difficult to secure Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with other countries, including the United States.Nevertheless, you could argue that this minimal Brexit is better than nothing, and some Leavers have. But this surely depends upon what the other possibilities are. This deserves the serious analysis that Mrs May and her team have apparently not given it.There are broadly two options. The first is to accept one of the off-the-shelf arrangements. The one that most closely accords with achieving a full Brexit, corresponding to what people voted for two years ago, is the recently agreed EU deal with Canada.This is not ideal for us, but it is pretty good. It might be possible to add some bells and whistles that extend the scope of the agreement, particularly with regard to services. This is what is known as “Canada plus”.With or without the plus, this would give us tariff and barrier-free trade between the EU and the UK while ending free movement of people, the payment of substantial sums to Brussels each year and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, while enabling us to sign FTAs with whoever we wanted to.Interestingly, the EU offered us the Canada deal earlier this year but this was turned down by the Prime Minister, supposedly because it wasn’t ambitious enough and because it would not provide a solution to the supposed “problems” concerning the Irish border.Since then, Mrs May’s ambitions have decayed to the delivery of abject surrender while not saying so.As to the Irish border, it has been clear for some time that these “problems” have been manufactured by the Remain-leaning establishment precisely as a way of blocking a full Brexit.There is no need for a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland. It is perfectly possible for goods to move freely across the border, relying on pre-registration and subsequent random checks.There is already a soft border between the Irish republic and Northern Ireland with regard to currencies, duties and tax rates. This would continue.Of course, it is possible that the EU will not now agree to something like the Canada deal. And the clock is ticking.In that case, there is another perfectly viable option, namely “no deal”. After all, as Mrs May used to say, “No deal is better than a bad deal”.In fact, this “no deal” expression is potentially misleading. It doesn’t mean that we couldn’t or shouldn’t have a deal on anything with the EU, including landing rights for planes, participation in various joint bodies, etc.What it means is simply that we would leave the EU without an agreement on trade, and operate under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.The WTO option is widely misunderstood. It should hold no terrors for us. We currently do the bulk of our trade with non-EU countries under WTO rules. And if we left the EU without a deal we would not have to hand over the £39billion “divorce settlement”.Moreover, the WTO option leaves substantial areas of policy choice, including over what our tariffs are. We could decide to drop tariffs on particular goods but not others for instance, on cars, which currently incur tariffs at ten per cent, and/or on car components, where the rate is five per cent.Or we could decide, unilaterally, to drop all our tariffs to zero.We could start to negotiate FTAs immediately. Just because we fail to secure a trade deal with the EU before next March does not mean we can never secure such a deal.Indeed, we could put the EU “at the front of the queue” for trade deals. We would be able to conduct negotiations without the pressures emanating from the ticking clock imposed, arbitrarily and ridiculously, under the Lisbon Treaty.Of course, trading under WTO rules would still leave the much-dreaded “trade frictions” and possible delays at the border as we lose the supposedly huge advantages of Single Market membership. But these frictions have been massively overblown by the UK establishment. WTO rules oblige members (including the EU) to facilitate frictionless trade.John Mills, the Eurosceptic economist and Labour donor, has come up with estimates of border costs that are a fraction of the official ones.His view is especially worth noting because, unlike the civil servants behind the official view, he runs his own very successful business importing large amounts of consumer goods. I know whose estimates I believe.Some critics will say that this is all very well for finished goods, but not for the businesses that operate complex supply chains. To listen to them you would think that these only operate within the EU.In fact there are complex supply chains operating across the world. They seem to manage without common currencies, single markets and all the other paraphernalia so beloved by the EU.Meanwhile, umpteen countries around the world sell huge amounts into the EU without being members of the Single Market. How do they manage to overcome those pesky barriers, I wonder?Whatever difficulties may occur in the immediate aftermath of a full Brexit, this does not represent the final destination.

Not ideal conditions today - there were lots of jellfyfish blooms and rain squalls along the way.Yesterday\u0027s final swim was a disappointment. We picked the wrong current to follow around the last section of The Lizard - the most southerly point in Great Britain - so after one hour and 20 minutes of hard graft, I\u0027d made virtually no progress.After the poor swim, we anchored out at sea so we could catch an early tide this morning. However, we finally found success! Our craft\u0027s skipper, Stephen Praetorius, and I managed to locate the missing offshore current, which meant I could fly 3.4 miles (5.5km) in one hour and 20 minutes.We are now back on track and we are definitely one happy crew again. My support vessel Aquila has travelled to Falmouth for much needed water and supplies. We are now down to our emergency water rations.I went out again this evening and swam straight into a good current, swimming 3.2 miles (5.1km).A pod of four dolphins including two young ones joined me for a few minutes, and were only metres away.I could hear their clicking under the surface.:: Day four - 4 miles (6.5km)Today was a crucial day for the first week of The Long Swim.I rounded Lizard Point, the most southerly point in Great Britain and a place renowned for its treacherous waters.Although things appeared calm on the surface, they were rather more turbulent underneath.Whirlpools and eddies caused an up-swelling of cold water. The temperature when the swim began was 16C (61F), and when I came out of the water after 79 minutes it had dropped to 12C (54F). Although our images show me swimming straight towards the rocks, the tide was actually perpendicular, pushing me 90 degrees sideways.Big up to skipper Stephen Praetorius, who navigated our craft and me safely through on the morning spring tide.I have never experienced such strong currents. It was like swimming in a flooding river.This evening swim then started well - we saw pods of dolphins and a sunfish - but after that it didn\u0027t go to plan. I started swimming on the wrong current, which made me swim even slower than I would have done if there\u0027d been no current at all.After struggling against counter-eddies for nearly an hour and a half I had covered only a couple of kms.I made the call to stop and try again first thing in the morning - a move we had not planned. This means we couldn\u0027t motor to Falmouth for the evening to replace our water, power and get food. We have now run out of water and are on our emergency supply bottles, having anchored in the small village of Coverack.The plan for tomorrow is to do a swim early to make up for the lost time.:: Day three - 9 miles (14.5km)Glassy sea on a beautiful Saturday in Mounts Bay, with a perfect spring tide current, which helped propel me toward Lizard Point.The crew continued fine-tuning the jellyfish watch and are now on a rota. It is difficult to keep focus after 20 minutes and very easy to be hypnotised by the motion of the sea and you glaze over in the glare. I have an active mind while swimming and I like to keep track of my thoughts. Occasionally I stop to shout a word or phrase for the crew to write down - something to trigger my memory later.The stream of consciousness can get quite interesting!Now heading back to Mullion Cove again, we will be heading back out in the late afternoon to pick up the GPS point for the evening swim.Overall, a phenomenal morning swim and it feels as though we are banking kilometres. All happy on board. I am back in the water this evening and hopefully this will take us to the edge of Lizard Point.This evening was all about the Lizard. Do we shoot it tonight, making the best that the spring tide can give, or do we take a measured approach and leave it for the morning?Today\u0027s swim was shorter, but fast, sometimes I was swimming at over four knots - that\u0027s 7.2 kph.Overall another happy day, as we say goodbye to Mounts Bay.:: Day two - 8 miles (12.8km) Another two good sessions in the morning and evening, in very fair conditions. I will be doing two swims a day and slingshotting around Land\u0027s End.I had a few periods of jellyfish activity - the biggest we saw was longer than our shortest crew member.I was stung on my arms, which we treated with vinegar after I got out of the water - it made me smell of fish and chips!We ended up setting up a jellyfish watch, with spotters armed with whistles.:: Day one - 6 miles (9.8km) Today was a day of ironing out the swim procedures. This involved working out communication between me in the water and my team, adhering to the verification protocols, working out actual distance covered versus distance swum - it\u0027s difficult to swim in an exact straight line.In total I manage to cover 6 miles (9.8km) of my journey, although this is less than the actual distance I swam.This was the first day when all nine members of the campaign were on board, and over the next few days we will learn much about the teamwork and processes that will help us get through the entire expedition.Another first today was my first jellyfish sting. It got me right on the crotch.We ended the day by sitting at anchorage just off Mousehole, finishing up dinner and getting in an early sleep before we move back to the GPS point at 4.30 am for the next swim at 6.00am. :: The eve of the swimYou are either a pioneer or a follower you can\u0027t be both. And if you are a pioneer, you know all about worry.If something has been done before, you know it\u0027s possible. If you don\u0027t know something is possible, you worry about it.I\u0027m about to embark on a swim with significant risks and consequences - financial, reputational and environmental. So there hasn\u0027t been a night in the last month that I haven\u0027t woken up.A few nights ago I was using the worry hours to plan, and remembered something Mike Tyson once said: \"Everyone\u0027s got a plan until they get punched in the mouth.\" I have a plan to try and swim 10km per day. But when I swim into my first bloom of jellyfish, that plan will become flexible.I know that I\u0027m going to get sunburnt. I\u0027m going to be frozen, I\u0027m going to be stung, and I\u0027m going to become mentally and physically exhausted. Have I done too much preparation, or not enough?What if we get the tides wrong, get caught in a counter eddy and find ourselves going backwards? This is a notoriously dangerous coastline, with the shipwrecks to prove it.Did I mention that half my expedition team is new, and half has no sailing experience?In those waking worry hours I also remembered the Stockdale paradox. Admiral Stockdale was an American pilot who was shot down in Vietnam and spent eight years in a POW camp. He said that the people who survived had two important qualities.First, they always believed they would be freed. Second - and this is the paradox - they had no optimism. Because the people who did have optimism - the people who hoped they would be free by Easter, then by Thanksgiving, then by Christmas, and had those hopes dashed over and over again - those people didn\u0027t survive. The people who survived were the ones who confronted the brutal reality of their situation.I have to face some brutal facts when I look at the chart of our 560km swim route. This is the longest swim anyone has ever done, adhering to Channel Rules in water this low temperature. I honestly don\u0027t know how I\u0027m going to do this. But I do believe I\u0027ll see the white cliffs of Dover. So that\u0027s the paradox that\u0027s going through my mind.The swimming is only part of the challenge. We\u0027ve also had to co-ordinate with sponsors, raise funds for the expedition, recruit the right people for the team, and deal with the media... all the while juggling private lives with unexpected domestic crises. As if all that wasn\u0027t enough, after six months of campaign planning and preparation, we learned that Donald Trump is coming to London on the day I start swimming. We certainly hadn\u0027t planned on such a big media story distracting from our message.Because the message is the reason I am doing this swim. The truth is we are failing our oceans. And it\u0027s only through bold and courageous action that we\u0027re going to be able to protect them properly. \"Piecemeal\" protection is not going to safeguard our seas. We need an enormous shift in business and government and the public to be able to do this.There are challenges ahead. But as English Channel crossing pioneer Captain Webb said, nothing great is ever easy.I\u0027ll keep that in mind as I strike out for Dover."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-papers-17-july_4363883.jpg?20180716220730 ","title":"usain bolt in the running to join australian football team","story":"Bolt, who is widely considered to be the greatest sprinter of all time, has long had an ambition to play professional football.Since retiring from the track in 2017, the Jamaican athlete has trialled with Germany\u0027s Borussia Dortmund and Norway\u0027s Stromsgodset teams.

The Prime Minister narrowly avoided a Commons humiliation by giving in to Brexiteer Tories. After fearing the Brexiteers led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, had the Parliamentary numbers to win amendments on the customs bill, Mrs May decided to adopt those clauses as part of the bill.  This sparked a backlash from pro-EU MPs, who said the PM had “capitulated”. Her majority was slashed to just three as pro-European Tories protested about the Prime Minister’s concessions by voting against her. The first of those amendments, which would prevent the UK collecting duties for the EU unless Brussels agreed reciprocal arrangements passed with 305 votes in favour, and 302 against.  There were 14 Tory rebels who voted against the Government-backed Tory Eurosceptic clause including defence procurement minister Guto Bebb - who dramatically resigned at the door of the lobby. The Eurosceptic Conservative MPs’ amendment to stop the UK from joining the EU’s VAT regime, was also approved by a majority of three - 303 votes to 300. There were 11 Conservative rebels who voted against. but Mr Bebb was not one of them. But the Customs Bill itself passed by 318 votes to 285 - majority 33.  It comes after Theresa May produced a plan at her Chequers country residence which would keep the UK closely tied to Brussels’ rules on goods and food which angered many of those who supported Leave. A number 10 source said ahead of the votes last night. “We have accepted the amendments because we believe its consistent with the approach that we set out.” Labour’s shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: “Theresa May has now lost all moral authority in order to scrape through tonight by three votes she sold out ot hard Tory right and tore up the White Paper she published only days ago. “Craven cowardice not worth of a Prime Minister. We can’t go on like this.”  But Remain-supporting Labour MP Chuka Umunna praised Mr Bebb for quitting his government role, saying: “It’s good to see a minister putting his country before his party and his career. More should follow his example. “This is a question of who governs Britain: the Tory backbench Brexiteers or the people? More and more Tory MPs are saying it should be the people not some hard Right minority”.

Two of those were largely uncontroversial and passed \u0027on the nod\u0027 - with no need for a parliamentary vote. But the other two went to a vote - and passed by an incredibly narrow margin.  1) Stopping the UK collecting duties for the EU - unless Brussels agreed reciprocal arrangements The Eurosceptic Conservative MPs\u0027 new clause 36, to prevent the UK collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU unless the EU agrees to collect them for the UK, was approved by 305 votes to 302, majority three.

But you\u0027ll need a lot more than protests to get rid of the obese orange loofah, who\u0027s just announced he will run for a second term. Because his time in office is not as limited as you might think.  The generally-accepted truth is that US presidents can serve only two terms of 4 years each. But this is not a rule. It\u0027s a convention, underpinned by the 22nd amendment to the US Constitution. And that amendment actually limits the time in office to a theoretical 10 years, if someone wanted to push it by replacing another president for 2 years less one day. And while you\u0027re struggling with the idea of a whole decade of Trump, consider this - an amendment can be amended.  Now, it\u0027s a tricky business. And if you\u0027re one of those who hates Trump and pays attention to history, you\u0027ll be about to zip down to the comments and talk about constitutional checks and balances, how it must get through Congress, he can\u0027t even get the wall paid for, Foxy you have taken leave et cetera. But if there\u0027s one thing the Republican Party has shown so far, it\u0027s that they are prepared to let Trump do almost what he pleases if it keeps them in power. Only a few have resigned on principle, only a few state publicly he\u0027s a fool, and by and large they have flown in his slipstream in return for undoing all those abortion laws, tax regulations and other things they dislike. The Democrats, meanwhile, are disorganised. There\u0027s no credible leader, no unifying message, no prospective opponent to dismantle Trump\u0027s edifice of bulls***.  Which means he heads into the November mid-terms in first place with every chance of more power in Congress. Every single House of Representatives seat is up for grabs, along with a third of the Senate - most of them Democrats.   Don\u0027t talk to me of your Russia investigation, or your federal and state probes into witness tampering or campaign funding or who did what when.  Not only has Trump managed to devalue them by doing even worse things in public - telling Canada to piss off, stepping on the Queen, trying to destroy NATO - they\u0027ll take years to grind through the US legal system.   Donald Trump lied or misled you at least 5 times in his interview with Piers Morgan  Already this year Trump\u0027s used the power of presidential pardon to free a former Republican aide who obstructed justice. Last year he pardoned a sheriff who rounded up migrants without any reasonable suspicion of a crime, and who had been convicted for contempt of court.  His aides have been discussing in public Trump\u0027s legal power even to pardon himself, and he\u0027s just about to make the Supreme Court an ultra-Conservative arbitrator of his actions. So if Russian collusion, or any other of the numerous crimes his team have been accused of, get as far as the Chief Oompah-Loompah there\u0027s no guarantee that the mud will stick.  US politics has a history of non-adhesive mud.  We\u0027re still looking at an absolute maximum of 10 years, right? Not necessarily. If he doesn\u0027t amend the amendment, he can find ways around it. There is precedent for the imposition of martial law, suspension of the US constitution and even getting the same result without actually having to do either, by asking Congress to approve it and them being terrified enough to do as requested.  Donald Trump says he intends to run for re-election in 2020 - and doesn\u0027t think ANYONE can beat him  Abraham Lincoln did it in 1861 at the outbreak the American Civil War. Congress approved of all his measures - including giving the military the power of arrest and summary trial - without any official declarations.  Dear old Donald only this week compared himself to Honest Abe, claiming he had better polling than the bearded abolitionist even though there was no such polling in his lifetime.  That\u0027s before we move on to the Founding Fathers, those men who led the War of Independence and framed the constitution so there could be no more tyranny. They were quite keen on the idea of a president-for-life and didn\u0027t want term limits in the first place.  So now we have a definite 4 years of Trump that looks likely to be 8, with a possible extension until 2026. You have a lack of credible opposition, and criminal investigations that won\u0027t bear fruit for a long time.  On top of that we have an obvious route for a PR campaign invoking the spirit of the Benjamin Franklin, George Washington and Abe Lincoln, and a constitution which states in Article 1, section 9: The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.  Now, is there any sort of invasion or rebellion Mr Trump might like to get people worried about?  Mexicans, protesters, Muslims, women, and immigrants of hues other than white all seem to exist in greater numbers, and more volume, than Mr Trump seems to like. You can see him typing the tweet, can\u0027t you?    All we have left to wonder is whether or not this man, who lied about his height in order to pretend he is not morbidly-obese and worries what you think of his tiny hands, is vain enough to WANT to stay in office forever.  Well, in 2016 while running for office he told a rally in Ohio: I’m just thinking to myself right now: we should just cancel the election and just give it to Trump, right? What are we even having it for?  And in March, after meeting President Xi Jinping a month after a successful campaign to change the Chinese term-limit laws, Trump announced: He\u0027s now president for life. President for life. No, he\u0027s great. And look, he was able to do that. I think it\u0027s great. Maybe we\u0027ll have to give that a shot some day.  He was joking both times, of course. But then he was joking about Barack Obama\u0027s birth certificate, and joking about a wall, and joking about running for president - once. If you joke about something shocking, actually doing it then seems less bad.

The former Lib Dem leader was speaking to 100 people in an abbey in Dorset while MPs backed a divisive Hard Brexit by just three votes last night.  Current leader Sir Vince Cable also missed the vote because he was in a meeting. Party sources refused this morning to say where he was or what he was doing. The anti-Brexit campaigners were absent despite changes to Theresa May\u0027s Brexit plan passing by a tiny majority in a day of House of Commons chaos. Events changed rapidly through the day over the amendments to the Customs Bill, which Tory Leavers made in a bid to wreck Mrs May\u0027s plan for \u0027Soft Brexit\u0027.  First the amendments were doomed to fail. Then Theresa May decided to back them to stop a Brexiteer revolt. Then, finally, Labour decided to vote against them - setting up the last-minute showdown. In the end the key amendment - making it illegal for Britain to collect customs tariffs on behalf of the EU, unless the EU reciprocates - passed by 305 votes to 302. That meant if Mr Farron and Sir Vince had turned up, just one more Remainer would have needed to join them for it to be blocked. Three Labour Brexiteer rebels - Frank Field, Kate Hoey and Graham Stringer - also backed the amendment. If two of them had switched, the vote would also have been blocked.  Mr Farron dramatically quit the Lib Dems to remain faithful to Christ last year after he was embroiled in a row for refusing to say gay sex wasn\u0027t a sin. Canon Eric Woods, of Sherborne Abbey, confirmed Mr Farron gave the talk - entitled \u0027illiberal truths\u0027 - last night and at least 100 people turned up. He told the Mirror: Homosexuality was not mentioned once, either by him or by anybody in the audience. But he added: He was talking about values in contemporary society and the increasing intolerance in society.

Most of the arms were parachuted into France by Allied airmen.

Even amid the many better-documented battles, moments of tactical ingenuity and individual acts of heroism, Operation Sherwood is astonishing - a high-wire act for the brave men involved that could have resulted in them being captured and executed at any given moment. The plan was terrifying in its simplicity to hide 500 downed bomber pilots under the noses of the Nazis in a forest in occupied Europe - just yards from a German base. But in the circumstances, Operation Sherwood was neccesary. In 1944, as preparations were being made for D-Day, the British Directorate of Military Intelligence Section 9 - aka MI9 - were trying to work out how they could best protect the lives of bomber pilots on the run in France.  A young officer at the British intelligence agency came up with an audacious project to hide them in plain sight - in Freteval Forest, some 100 miles south west of Paris. The Allied airmen would have to survive on meagre rations, have barely any communication with the outside world and they had to live in almost total silence to avoid being discovered. Nobody knew how long they would need to be there but it would likely be months. If it worked they would be liberated after D-Day. However, if it failed, they’d be executed on the spot as spies. The amazing story is told in ‘The Hidden Army’, the first book to be written about the miracle of Operation Sherwood.  It reveals how the mission nearly came to a catastrophic end after only a few weeks when the British and American servicemen hiding in the forest almost came to blows. As tensions rose, the friction between these Transatlantic cousins, who were supposed to be on the same side, threatened to jeopardise the very security of the operation. While the Americans viewed the Brits as lazy, drunken layabouts, the Brits saw the Yanks as arrogant, trouble-making and cocky. Operation Sherwood was the brainchild of Airey Neave, a young MI9 officer and the first Englishman to escape successfully from Colditz.  Once Neave had persuaded his bosses that the plan was achievable he sent two Belgian agents into occupied France to prepare the forest camp. Local Resistance members would provide additional food and offer a level of protection for the men while supplies would be parachuted in by the RAF. Basic tents were put up, straw mattresses laid out, rudimentary table and chairs made and holes dug for toilets. A natural spring would give the men their water supply. On D-Day itself, as Allied forces landed on the Normandy beaches, the first thirty Allied airmen entered the forest camp.  They were soon joined by dozens more, each day bringing a new contingent into the camp. They had been discreetly brought from their Paris hideouts by train, accompanied by guides from the French Resistance, then taken the last few miles across fields or through country lanes. It was a perilous journey but, remarkably, only one American and his female guide was ever caught, and despite interrogation at the hands of the Gestapo they never revealed the existence of the camp. Today, only one veteran of Operation Sherwood is still alive. 94-year-old Ray Worrall remembers it like it was yesterday and is in no doubt how extraordinary the whole plan was. “It’s been described as a miracle,” he says. “I think it probably was.” But the miracle very nearly turned to disaster.  By late-July 1944 there were over 100 British, American, Canadian and Australians already in the forest. But under the summer sun, with rations low, having to sleep five to a tent, only being able to talk in whispers and the constant threat of discovery by the Germans hanging over them, tensions began to rise, particularly between the British and the Americans and the two nationalities threatened to come to blows with the risk the commotion would lead to the discovery of the camp by the Nazis.  To the British, who had been at war longer and suffered accordingly, the Americans were becoming big-headed, cocksure and impossible to live with. “There was a lot of American airmen in the forest,” remembers Worrall, “and they knew better than anyone they were going to win the war. You know how the Americans talk. It was getting peoples’ backs up terribly.” Violent confrontation was becoming a very real possibility, although with little in the form of radio contact, MI9 appeared totally unaware of the situation brewing. Quickly cliques began forming in the camp with the Americans being far from impressed by what they saw of their British colleagues. One of the downed America pilots recalled that “discipline did not seem very good amongst the British and there was a lot of bitching going on.  The ranking British officers tried hard but did not seem able to control their men. A lot of them were drunk every night on calvados or cognac. Nobody did any work if they could help it.” Failed parachute drops didn’t help the situation with rations low and their supply of cigarettes running out also. Cliff Hallett, one of the British aircrew in the forest, remembers the frosty atmosphere well: “The English had had enough of the showing off of their transatlantic cousins. As far as they were concerned everything in America was twice as big, twice as good, twice as nice as in England. They naively stated that in actual fact only they could win the war. They did not want to hear that they had not wanted to know about events in Europe until Pearl Harbour.” With matters coming to a head something had to be done before violence broke out and the camps’ location revealed to the enemy. The man put in charge of the camp, Flight Lieutenant Pete Berry, who before the war was a tobacconist in Piccadilly, had only one option. His decision was to build another camp within the forest solely for American use. It would separate the two nationalities and diffuse the potentially dangerous situation brewing. The Americans were all for it and within days they had moved to another area of the forest and had not only set up camp but had also constructed their own rudimentary golf course in the trees. Over the coming weeks the atmosphere within the forest became bearable again, although the threat of discovery was a constant shadow hanging over the men.

Richard Allen, described as a menace at the wheel was found hiding in bushes by police just over an hour after ploughing into a 71-year-old woman in Sutton Coldfield , on July 12 last year. The lady was flung in the air and suffered multiple, serious fractures, including a broken hip and has never truly recovered from her injuries. Allen was seen glancing back at the woman lying in the street but sped away from the crash and dumped his bike at a mechanic’s garage near his home address. Witnesses said Allen - who was banned from the roads in 2001 for dangerous driving - tore through the town centre’s 30-zone at what some witnesses estimated to be in excess of 50mph.  He was caught after a quick-thinking member of the public noted down the Honda CBR’s registration number and just after 1pm a police sniffer dog tracked from his home address in Walsall, to dense undergrowth where he was found hiding. Examination of the 38-year-old’s mobile phone revealed more shocking examples of his recklessness at the wheel, including one video clip showing him laughing while driving at 140mph on the M69 in an Audi TT while filming. In the footage Allen – identified by a distinctive tattoo on his arm – can be seen taking a drag on a cigarette - which meant he had no hands on the wheel despite speeding at twice the motorway limit.  In interview, Allen – a labourer working on a building site in Sutton at the time and had ridden to buy lunch from Greggs – denied responsibility and claimed the lady walked out in front of his bike, reports Birmingham Live .   However, collision investigators spoke to several witnesses who described seeing Allen accelerating into the woman without braking – and after a four-day trial he was found unanimously guilty of causing serious injury through dangerous driving. Allen was jailed for four-and-a-half years for the collision, plus an additional year for each of the three other dangerous driving incidents shown on his mobile phone. He was jailed at Birmingham Crown Court on July 12 – exactly a year to the day since the collision – and disqualified from driving for a decade. Detective Constable Karl Davies from West Midlands Police’s Collision Investigation Unit, said: “Richard Allen was a disqualified driver who shouldn’t have even been on the road, let alone driving in such a dangerous manner. “The judge described him as ‘a menace to decent law-abiding road users’ and he left his victim lying in the road having suffered very serious injuries and multiple fractures.

Only hours earlier, the two-year-old had allegedly been diagnosed with a mild viral infection by a GP after suffering from a nasty cough.  Her family claim the doctor didn\u0027t check her heartbeat before she went home, where her condition worsened, the Hull Daily Mail reports.  Eva, from Hull, East Yorkshire, had been suffering with the cough for a week, which had prompted her parents to take her to the GP surgery.  They were allegedly told by the doctor that the cough would pass, but the very next day, they discovered their little girl clutching her heart. “We took her to the doctors on the Friday, and by Saturday afternoon I had to race her to A\u0026ampE and within five minutes they had her in a room and were putting drips in her, said Eva’s dad, Louis Garland. “She was clutching at her heart and you could hear it pounding, and we were told it was going nearly double the speed it should be. She had pneumonia in her left lung. He claimed: I just can’t believe the GP didn’t check her heartbeat or anything, and just let her go home.”  Eva was taken to the doctor\u0027s shortly after 4pm last Friday by her mum, Jodie Dixon, amid concerns about her cough. And after seeing the GP, the youngster was reportedly diagnosed with a mild viral infection that would pass. However, she ended up spending the entire weekend in Hull Royal Infirmary after her parents rushed her in on Saturday. She is now undergoing a strong course of antibiotics following her release from hospital yesterday. “I went into the doctor\u0027s on Monday morning because I couldn’t sit back and let them get away with sending her home,” said Lewis.

Jim Warny, who is originally from Belgium but lives in Ennis, Co Clare, returned from the rescue mission on Friday to a hero\u0027s welcome. Mr Warny, who has been cave diving for 20 years, has opened up about the length of time it took to reach the boys inside the cave through flooded sections from five metres to 350 metres long. In his first in-depth interview, which airs on RTE Radio 1 on Tuesday, the father of one described the intricate rescue mission that gripped the world.  After he was asked by the British Cave Rescue Council to help the Thai navy Seal divers, Mr Warny was on a plane within a few hours.  Speaking to presenter Philip Boucher Hayes, he said: It was always in the back of my head that I would get the call - I happened to see that one of the guys out there was active on Facebook and I text saying, \u0027I\u0027m here if you need me\u0027 and he replied instantly saying, \u0027How quick can you be\u0027?  I said two hours, and then five minutes later I was packing my bags to go and flew out the following morning. After arriving at the Tham Luang caves, Mr Warny saw first-hand how difficult and complex the conditions were. Visibility couldn\u0027t get any worse, it was zero visibility, he said. I wasn\u0027t out of my comfort zone, it was more the psychological part of being responsible for a human life.  The initial part where most of the military personnel and non-diving were based was about a kilometre in, mostly walking, wading and one short section that was initially flooded that they had pumped out. You would have to wade through, just enough to keep your head above the water.  Then the cave diving starts and it\u0027s varied between fully flooded sections - the shortest part was five metres long and the longest was 350 metres long. It was a mix of flooded sections and sections where you would swim on the surface. There was one section where we had to get completely out of the water and put the boys on a stretcher and try to carry them for 200 metres. With little time to prepare the young boys, a number of the divers carried out tests with schoolchildren in a local pool to determine which mask to use.

Travellers returning to Manchester Airport were met with smashed windows in a crime spree targeting around a dozen high end cars.  It came just a few days after Greater Manchester Police confirmed they had received at least four reports from holidaymakers who had returned to find their car windows broken and their had been vehicles raided.  It is believed around a dozen high class cars – including Mercedes, BMWs, Audis and Range Rovers – were broken into at the Terminal 1 multi-storey car park overnight on July 7.  Peter Rawlings returned from a trip to Benidorm with his partner last Thursday to find his car had been smashed into by thieves, reports the Manchester Evening News .   Peter, 45, from Middlewich, had paid \u0026pound96 for seven days at the car park. When he returned, he found his rear window had been completely smashed and a jacket had been stolen from the back seat. Peter said: “I came back from holiday last Thursday and went to go and put our suitcases in the boot of the car and then saw the glass on the floor and my side window had been put through. “As I was stood by my car another family came through and found that about 11 cars had all had their back windows smashed through. “I rang the airport security immediately and they said they had had a spate of break-ins and told me not to worry about it. “On the way home I then received a text message from GMP to say they couldn’t take my case any further even though there is CCTV in the car park.  “I spoke to airport security again, but they just advised me to fill out a complaint form and someone should get back to me within 10 days. “The car park is advertised as a safe and secure and that your car is left in safe hands so when you return from holiday you expect it to be in the same condition. “I had a beautiful jacket that my late wife left me and that was taken from the back of my car. “I have had to pay \u0026pound85 to get the window fixed and I was forced to take the day off work so overall I’ve had to fork out about \u0026pound600.” A spokesman for Manchester Airport said: “We are aware of a number of vehicles being damaged and we are assisting GMP with their enquiries.” "},{"url":null,"title":"parents pay tribute kind generous","story":"NewsParents pay tribute to \u0027kind, generous, gentle\u0027 son who died after balcony fall in MagalufThe teenager fell 65ft after a night out in the Spanish party town\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByJessica Walford22:24, 16 JUL 2018Updated22:26, 16 JUL 2018NewsThomas Channon, 18, fell from walkway at the Eden Roc apartment complex (Image: SOLARPIX.COM)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA Welsh teenager who died after falling 65ft from a balcony in Magaluf has been called a model son by his devastated parents.

Leesa Dean said she suffered a blood infection and scars after being bitten by the insects which had infested the holiday accommodation. The 43-year-old mum claims the chalet at Pontins\u0027 Prestatyn Sands Holiday Park in North Wales hadn\u0027t been cleaned before she and her friends arrived. She told the Daily Record it was covered in mouse droppings, there was mould on the windowsills, dirty dishes were left in the sink and leftover rotten food was on work tops.  Leesa, from New Cumnock in Ayrshire, has shared photos showing her arms, back and neck covered in what she claims are bed bug bites suffered during her \u0026pound1,277 stay in May. Other snaps she claims are from the chalet show mouse droppings on the floor, rotting bananas and a stained mattress. Leesa said: “I was shocked at the state of the place and it was pretty clear it hadn’t been cleaned for our arrival.  “It was absolutely disgusting. I complained to reception but was told there would be no cleaners on the site until the following day. “Our only option was to go to a nearby supermarket to buy products and scrub the place ourselves. “At 4pm the following day, the cleaners finally showed up but by that point we’d already gutted the place.”  Leesa claims she began to feel unwell over the next couple of days and then broke out in a rash. She said she feared it was an allergic reaction to something she had eaten but, by the time she was checking out to go home, she was covered in bite marks all over her back, neck, shoulders and groin. Leesa added: “I’ve never encountered bed bugs before and the journey home was horrendous.  “I had to continuously stop the car to be sick and apply cream to sooth my arms and shoulders, which were on fire. “Thankfully, I managed to get an emergency appointment with my doctor because I was in agony. “By this time the marks were all over me and I was so distressed.  “After blood tests and an examination, I was told I had come into contact with bed bugs and that can only have been from the mattress I slept on while on holiday. “I was totally disgusted. Knowing I had spent time lying in an infested bed turned my stomach. It was just awful.” A few days later Leesa returned to her doctor and was told they had caused an infection in her blood, she said.  She said was given steroid cream and put on a course of strong antibiotics, and says she has been left with scarring from the bites. Leesa added: “W’ve been to the camp several times over the years and I’ve never experienced anything like this. “We know it’s not a five-star luxury resort but I still expect it to be clean. We paid a lot of money to stay in a filthy apartment.  “From start to finish, the entire holiday was awful. I’d never return.” Leesa claims the experience has left her feeling depressed, anxious and ashamed of her appearance. She said: “I can’t show off my shoulders or back because I’ve been left with scars. I feel disgusted at how I look.

The 19-year-old has since been flitting between houses with three-month-old Freya Mia, who was born prematurely on April 22. The young mum says she had complained to the council about problems with mould at her home in Sweet Dews Grove, east Hull, before giving birth, and Miss Desborough says workmen came and applied “special paint” to resolve the situation.  However, after leaving hospital with Freya Mia in tow, the teen was forced to leave the flat after finding the mould had returned, and she said council officers told her it was because she was boiling the kettle, reports Hull Live .  “I’ve had to move all my furniture out of the property because it’s attacking everything,” she said. “I’ve had to throw my baby’s clothes away because even they’ve got mould on them. “The council told me it was my fault because I was boiling the kettle and creating condensation but I have a newborn baby – I can’t make her feed without boiling the kettle.  “It makes you feel sick and dirty and it’s not just in one room – it’s everywhere.” Miss Desborough says her house has once before been targeted by vandals, so she is apprehensive about opening windows in case they get smashed again. After moving out, she now splits her time living with her dad, her grandmother and Freya Mia’s father in the house he shares with his mum. All the young mum says she wants to do is provide her daughter with a stable upbringing in a family home but she says she feels she cannot do this in the flat. “I can’t get settled or get her in a routine. She hasn’t even got the room to play because I can’t take her toys everywhere with me. It’s horrible. “She was in intensive care after she was born so I am trying to do everything I can for her to ensure she has the best life. “But I want to protect her too and the council just don’t seem to be bothered. Both of her parents have asthma and we are worried she will have it too.  “I can’t sit in that flat with mould knowing it might put her in danger.” Miss Desborough says she has asked the council for a swap but to no avail, and she says she now faces being evicted from the property altogether. She says she collects the post every two days from the property but has missed appointments with the surveyor and her annual gas safety check is overdue. Miss Desborough said: “The flat is due an annual gas safety check and I rang them up so many times to arrange it. “I said I can be there but they couldn’t give me a specific time and now I keep getting letters saying I am going to be taken to court. “I have no fixed address and I can’t stay there because of the issues I’m having and Hull City Council are fully aware of this.” The authority says it must service boilers annually. If they are unable to, they may have to resort to legal action.  A spokeswoman said: ”As a landlord Hull City Council has a legal duty to service boilers every year. We take this matter very seriously as it could be literally a matter of life and death.  We make numerous attempts to contact tenants to gain access to do this work, but unfortunately in a very small number of cases we have to resort to legal action to gain access. Currently out of over 23,000 properties that require servicing only three are currently outstanding.

Tyrone Doran and girlfriend Amy Ferguson were each doing more than 100mph on their way home when stranger Farid Ferdosian decided to chase them down in his Mini Cooper.  A court heard witnesses formed the view they were racing on the A1 Western Bypass but a judge sentenced them on the basis they were not.  As Ferguson sped along the dual carriageway, a lorry indicated and began pulling out into the outside lane and because of her speed she could do nothing to avoid crashing into it, the Chronicle Live reported .   Ferdosian’s Mini then also crashed into the HGV while Doran’s VW Bora hit the Mini, flipped over twice, knocked over a lamppost and came to rest on the embankment. Despite leaving a scene of carnage, miraculously they all escaped with only minor injuries.  The “frightening” episode of dangerous driving - police said they reached speeds of up to 120mph - was all captured on Ferdosian’s dash cam and footage revealed weeks earlier he had been doing 116mph in a 40mph zone. Now all three have been given suspended sentences at Newcastle Crown Court for their parts in the crash two days before Christmas last year.  Recorder Jeremy Barnett said: “This is a terrible case of driving at speed for no reason in the early hours of the morning when you, Amy Ferguson, in a rush to get home, driving at a ridiculous speed, not racing but keeping up with your boyfriend, with no regard for other road users. I’ve seen the dash cam footage of your driving and it was frightening. How you got to walk away from this I don’t know. That footage is the most frightening I’ve seen.”  The judge, who described the driving as “horrific”, said he had planned to lock them up but changed his mind, partly because Ferguson is now pregnant. It was shortly after 1.30am on December 23 that the crash happened near the Kingston Park junction of the A1 northbound carriageway. Witnesses described seeing Ferguson’s white Seat Ibiza travelling at high speed, followed by Doran’s VW Bora. Prosecutor Michael Bunch said: “A burnt orange Mini came down the slip road at Stamfordham Road and moved straight across the line at speed and caught up with the Bora. “The Bora pulled into lane two, going side by side with the Seat. “One witness said it looked like they were racing each other.”  Another witness saw the lorry pulling out and forcing the Seat into the central reservation and the Mini then hit the back of the HGV and span into the middle of the road, followed by the VW hitting the Mini. All three drivers were taken to hospital but the most serious injury was to Ferdosian, who suffered a bruised kidney. Other clips from his dash cam revealed that on October 18 on Lemington Road, Newburn, he did up to 116mph in a 40mph limit.  In the Manchester area he was also recorded hitting speeds of 130mph and 140mph, although he faces no charges for that. When interviewed by police Ferdosian described his driving as “stupidity”. Ferguson initially blamed the lorry driver for pulling out while Doran made no comment. All three admitted dangerous driving and Ferdosian also admitted two offences of speeding.  Fedorian, 32, of Westgarth, Westerhope, Newcastle, was sentenced to 12 months suspended for 18 months with 70 hours unpaid work and a three year driving ban. Ferguson, 20, and Doran, 23, both of Woodside Avenue, Seaton Delaval, were each given nine months suspended for 18 months with 40 hours unpaid work and 18 month driving bans. Brian Hegarty, for Ferdosian, said: “He was driving at a speed which was irresponsible and he accepts it was stupid and all concerned were lucky they walked away with limited injuries.” Mr Hegarty added that Ferdosian has two young children, manages a family store, has no previous convictions and had a clean record before this. Kate Barnes, for Doran and Ferguson, said they were expecting their first child in October.  She said Ferguson was an inexperienced driver who accepts she was driving far too fast but they deny they were racing, adding: “The events which took place were not of their making. “They are both of good character and have written letters and express the lesson they have learnt from this. “They both appear to have encouraging futures. They have made a terrible mistake.” Following the case, investigating officer PC Ronnie Brown said: “The footage that we have released speaks for itself. The standard of driving was appalling and was clearly endangering other road users.

Artist Joel Alvarez sent models down the runway at Miami Swim Week in rather inventive, very skimpy bikinis made of TAPE. The photographer-cum-designer presented his range of “swimwear,” in the form of one and two-pieces and even mankinis made of nothing but tape in bright colours and metallics. Created by fashion house, Black Tape Project, the sticky collection may be discernible as non- bathing suits from a far, but up close it was clear that it was in fact strategically placed tape, and not fabric, that covered the models’ most intimate areas.  Joel reveals on his website that he started his project back in 2008 after a model requested a photoshoot, in which she’d be covered in black tape.  “So I basically wrapped her in black electrical tape,” he said. “Mind you she looked like 2 Christmas hams wrapped in rubber bands when I was done. I\u0027d never show you these images! BUT It sparked an idea in my head.”  According to The Daily Mail, Joel then began taking photos of Hooters waitresses covered in the electrical tape, before moving on to incorporate a variety of tape for more shoots. He sold his work in Miami nightclubs, then taking them international to Ibiza, France, Norway and Canada.

You\u0027ve got to tread the fine line between selling yourself without coming across as a complete wally who\u0027ll be ridiculed by all who swipe (left, alas) on you. In fact, the perfect profile pressure is so high. that there is a wealth of helpful articles dishing out advice . Common pitfalls include mirror selfies, badly cropped-out exes (you\u0027re not fooling anyone, mate) and clich\u0026eacutes like I live life to the fullest. Then there are some less common pitfalls, like TERRIFYING people with some odd requests in your bio... Take Nicole, for example. The 26-year-old registered nurse apparently posted a profile on Tinder saying she was looking for a lifetime partner who is really hardworking, humble, healthy and trustworthy.  Nothing wrong with that. Many of us strive or the same thing. Then it appears she makes some more, erm, niche requests. The lucky man must also have both lungs and kidneys and a heart with a sinus rhythm... Oh, and don\u0027t be a smoker or take any substance that could damage the liver. People were quick to point out there is something a little creepy about the detail Nicole goes in to.          That said, being a nurse, it\u0027s perhaps natural that she\u0027s after someone who takes care of themselves. So if you fit the bill, and aren\u0027t at all perturbed by Nicole\u0027s bio, then maybe she\u0027s the woman for you?

Screams and shouts can be heard before passengers are plunged into darkness and run for cover. Moments earlier lava had oozed into the sea and sent molten rock raining through the roof of the boat named \u0027Hot Shot\u0027. The sight-seeing vessel was showered with smaller bits of volcanic debris and cinder from the explosion, which also sent rocks and debris flying towards the 49 passengers. Eyewitness video footage shows a towering cloud of steam and ash billowing into the sky, followed by the glow of red-hot embers and flashes of lightning. It is being described as the worst casualty incident to date from the ongoing eruption of the Kilauea Volcano.  One woman\u0027s leg was broken when the \u0027lava bomb\u0027 landed on the roof of the vessel and smashed into the seating area, said Hawaii County Fire Department Battalion Chief Darwin Okinaka.  The woman, in her 20s, was airlifted to hospital for emergency treatment, family members told Hawaii News Now .  Three other passengers were also taken to a medical centre, while others suffered burns and scrapes, according to the state Department of Land and Natural Resources.  Will Bryan, who was on the boat with his girlfriend Erin, told the BBC : As soon as you saw it coming there was no time to move and the worst part was you\u0027re in a small boat.  So as you\u0027re getting pelted with this lava there is nowhere to go. You only have like 20 feet [6m], and everyone is trying to hide at the same spot. It was actually rather terrifying.  For a little bit afterwards there was just chaos, and the captain tried to do what he could to keep everyone calm but you can\u0027t. Erin\u0027s face was covered in soot and my back was hot. It was just scary. The boat was just off the Big Island of Hawaii on Monday when the fusillade of volcanic lava came crashing down. Authorities said the vessel was operated by Lava Ocean Tours, which charges about $250 (\u0026pound188) a head to watch lava flow into the sea from a tour boat. The incident is being investigated by the U.S Coast Guard and Hawaii County Police.  Video from the scene captures the moment the explosion happens and shows the sky full of black thick smoke before screams are heard and panic ensues. Pictures also show the sheer scale of the damage, including charred debris on seats and the gaping hole in the boat\u0027s roof.

However, it wasn’t to be as while he rummaged in his bag to find the ring, he was interrupted by a group of German tourists.With the mood killed, they went to the beach, but after sunbathing for just 10 minutes, Craig said they should go back to the hotel because he was too hot.He chose the balcony of their room which overlooked the lake to ask Aimee to become his wife.Aimee couldn’t even answer and instead simply burst into tears of happiness.After careful planning by the couple, the morning of the wedding arrived and the sun was shining.Aimee said: “When I woke up and saw the sun I was so happy that I was getting my outdoor wedding.“It made the photos taken by Burfly Photography from the day look really green and beautiful.“We had a flower wall created by Celebre which was stunning and it would have been a beautiful backdrop for the ceremony too.”The bride was accompanied down the aisle by stepdad Graham and the ceremony conducted by humanist Neil Anderson was the highlight of the day.“We made sure that the ceremony wasn’t boring and it was very personal,” said Aimee.“Neil was absolutely incredible and delivered our story in a fun way.“The night-time reception was brilliant but the day-time was our highlight.”The pair took to the floor to have their first dance as a married couple to The Verve’s hit song Lucky Man, which was performed by band Paper Tiger.Craig and Aimee would like to thank their wedding planners Katy and Fiona, videographers I Do, bridal shop Annarose and all their family and friends.Aimee added: “I wouldn’t change a thing about my wedding.

We trained twice on Friday so there were heavy legs,” he said.“I think we have to play quicker football, especially in the front.

The dress.Jenna Longmuir is a consultant at AnnaRose Bridal on Bank Street in Dundee’s city centre.There she acts as a “professional bridesmaid”, according to her eight-year-old son Mason, as she supports soon-to-be brides to say yes to the dress.She began her career at the bridal store five years ago and Jenna admits there are many perks to her job, including attending glamorous fashion shows in London.She said: “I have to say one of the best parts of my job is going to buying shows twice a year. Myself and owner Anne get to go to these really glamorous catwalks and decide what dresses we want to stock.“It is amazing. You get so excited about what potential brides are going to be wearing but you have to really think about which dresses are going to suit our market most.”When working with excited brides Jenna knows that a personal touch is incredibly important in making their decision as special as possible.She explained: “Your wedding is the most important day of your life and picking your dress is a massive part of the organising.“To work in a bridal store you need to be knowledgeable to help build trust with your bride.“We take lots of time getting to know our brides and building up a relationship with them so we can best advise the girls on what dresses might work for them. We aren’t here just for a sale.“Girls need to trust me, as it is a very personal experience and also when we get behind the curtain to try on dresses it’s not very glamorous so they need to feel comfortable with me.“Myself and Anne are both young but we have kids and have bits of our bodies we don’t like, so I think we are very relatable to a lot of the brides who come in, which is really important.“It is also a very emotional time for the brides and their families and I get very emotional too when they find their dream dress — I’ve definitely cried alongside brides. You build up such a close bond with them it is fabulous when you have helped them feel beautiful.“It is just amazing being in a job where you can be involved in all the love stories and build friendships with lots of different people.“How could I not love my job?”Although the glitz and glamour of fashion shows and couture gowns make Jenna’s job enviable, she admits that some aspects aren’t quite as glam as you would think.“When you get behind the curtain with a bride to try on dresses it is actually a very physical job. Wedding dresses are heavy and when helping a bride into layers and layers of a dress you are sweating.“It is definitely not like in the films when everyone sits with a glass of champagne, although we sometimes do that too, it is actually very hard work and you are doing fittings for hours every day.“It can also be very hard when we can’t find a bride’s dream dress, sometimes what they want just does not exist in a dress.

most violent street","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThree streets which host a number of city centre pubs and clubs can today be revealed as Dundee’s most violent.Police were called out to South Ward Road to deal with assaults more than any other street in the city between 2015 and 2017.A total of 162 incidents were recorded on the street, which is close to a number of nightspots, including 21 serious assaults.On Seagate, there were 142 assaults reported to officers and 93 on Nethergate.Police were also called out to attacks on Hilltown 58 times and Strathmartine Road 53 times.The statistics were revealed after we asked Police Scotland for a list of streets where assaults were most commonly reported over the last three years.South Ward Road, Seagate and Nethergate – all in the city centre – and South Road in Charleston appeared on the list every year.David Glass, president of Dundee Licensed Trade Association, said he believed better policing is helping to keep trouble at bay in venues.There have also been efforts in recent years to make venues safer with information about troublemakers shared through the Duncan pubwatch initiative.Last year, pubs rolled out a “yellow card” system that gives those who cause problems a warning, while “red cards” can see them banned for a year.Mr Glass said: “The yellow card system got people talking about the fact that you can’t go about causing bother.“Every now and then we see police on the beat and we’ve always said that we would be more than happy to see more police out on foot.“Even just them popping in to see how things are helps in the long run.“I realise resources are tight and they can’t have officers out all the time but I think it does seem to be getting managed better.” In the last three years, the number of assaults reported has fallen by 18%.Chief Inspector Nicola Russell of Tayside Division said: “We regularly review analytical data to ensure our resources are deployed in the right place and at the right time.“We have a comprehensive policing plan in place and additional patrols are carried out during times when it is typically busier, including weekends and holidays.“We work closely with our partners and the licensed trade to identify issues at an early stage and to allow us to respond to them appropriately.“Sadly all too often alcohol plays a part in offending behaviour and we know that consuming too much alcohol can lead to people becoming more vulnerable either as a victim or perpetrator of crime.“My message is clear and that is to know your limits and stick to them.”A spokeswoman for Dundee City Council said: “Wherever possible we lend support to Police Scotland on a number of issues.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b4c5cb6783c2.jpg ","title":"two girls taken to ninewells after freak accident with their

office meetings and picnic lunches have been taking place in an Inverness park after it threw open its usually locked gates to the public.The Northern Meeting Park is currently holding a two-week trial to gauge interest in securing greater access to the Victorian landmark.The site in Ardross Street is currently open each day between 8am and 8pm and thanks to the recent spell of hot weather, scores of people have been taking advantage.The temporary opening has been organised by the Love This Park campaign group which is exploring the possibility of transferring ownership of the park from Highland Council to a community-run group, with the aim of transforming it into a vibrant green space and breathing new life into its dilapidated buildings.Leading campaigner Jon Ford said up to 150 people visited the park each day last week, the busiest times being lunchtime and after 5pm.\"I am absolutely delighted with it,\" he said.\"It was never going to be about numbers for me. What will happen is that one person turns up and uses it and then another and another.\"We have had one wee lad learn to ride his bike here as he was too frightened to learn anywhere else. We have had people playing Frisbee.\"A lot of people from the Highland Council offices have being coming here for lunch and Cheshire House have twice been here with a group of their people.\"Many have said they have been here for events but find it is a completely different place when it is a piece of grass. They are loving it and enjoying the peace and quiet.\"Others have used it as a thoroughfare as part of their daily commute while the Northern Constabulary Pipe Band also took the opportunity to hold its rehearsals in the park one evening.The idea of a community buyout is being driven by the Northern Counties Cricket Club, one of the park\u0027s main users.Mr Ford, who is a club member, believes such a move will be good for the club, the community and Inverness \u0026ndash and the buildings which are deteriorating.\"Without investing time and money, they could be mothballed and if that happens, we would not be able to use the park,\" he said.\"To me, a community buyout is common sense. We have to look to the future.\"The park cannot just be seen behind locked gates.\"Tuesday 17 Jul 2018 11:34 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116610.jpg","title":"Lottery money helps youngsters get tech savvy","story":"\u0026nbspMerkinch Enterprise has been awarded a \u0026pound2500 grant from the Scottish Children\u0027 Lottery.The money has been invested in an interactive smart board for the nursery at its Fliperz Day Care Centre, which also has after-school services.It can be used for drawing, writing, technology skills and games.Stacey Proctor, childcare manager at Fliperz, said: \"The grant from the Scottish Children\u0027 Lottery has helped us immensely.\"The children are becoming more familiar with the modern world of technology and are showing a great interest in the interactive board.

He has also raised concerns at Westminster about such firms on several occasions.He said: \"People should not be charged inflated fees when they have paid for parking in good faith.\"The British Parking Association confirmed to me in person it is their view that people should not be charged if they have made an error inputting their registration.\"This guidance must be heeded by parking operators and, where it is not, there needs to be greater enforcement.\"He added: \"It is high time that operators like Smart Parking were removed from our city centres once and for all.\"The MP was responding to the case of Roger High, from Nottinghamshire, who failed to persuade Smart Parking to overturn a charge issued to him and will now have to cough up \u0026pound100.He said: \"In my appeal I explained that I had transposed two of the letters [in my registration number] and the fact that the registration number was so similar to my postcode that it was easy to make such a small slip.\"I was appalled and livid to receive an email rejecting my appeal, even though they acknowledged that I had purchased a car parking ticket, on the grounds that I had not purchased it for the correct registration number.\"Visiting the area frequently to see family, Mr High insisted Smart Parking\u0027s actions \"would not change\" his love of this part of the world.However, he revealed the experience had left him \"miserable and depressed as well as outraged\".Highland Council trading standards officer William Paul, who has been involved in long-running discussions with Smart Parking, said he was surprised to hear about Mr High\u0027s problems, believing there had been positive changes at the site.It is understood ticket machine key pads have been made bigger to reduce the chance of errors and new software aims to eliminate charges being issued when easily detectable genuine mistakes are made.\"We are encouraged by recent improvements in the operating procedures of the car park and to be fair to the company, these improvements do seem to be making a difference,\" he said.\"We are assured that these improvements are based on a firm commitment to resolve the previous reported issues, including incorrect vehicle registration mark (VRM) entries.\"He encouraged any drivers affected by charge notices to follow Smart Parking\u0027s appeals system and, if necessary, report the matter via the Citizens Advice Consumer Service on 03454 040506 or at www.citizensadvice.org.uk/scotland/consumerA spokesman for Smart Parking said: \"It is a contractual requirement for motorists to input their correct registration mark when parking at Strothers Lane Car park and failure to do so is a breach of the terms and conditions of parking there which can result in a Parking Charge Notice being issued.\"However Smart Parking acknowledges that motorists can make minor mistakes when entering their registration and as such working closely with Highland Trading Standards, has put in place measures to try to identify genuine mistakes against actual registration marks using the car park. Where the mistake is minor and the actual registration mark can be cross referenced Smart parking will endeavour to identify this and not issue the Parking Charge notice.\"Motorists are encouraged to double check their registration number before entering it and if those using the car park have entered a registration mark and subsequently received a Parking Charge Notice they are encouraged to engage with Smart Parking through our British Parking Association accredited appeals process.\"Tuesday 17 Jul 2018 11:34 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116630.jpg","title":"Schoolgirls inspiring bid to wipe out racism","story":"\u0026nbspA DETERMINED eight-year-old has been praised after taking an inspirational stand against racism in her community by personally removing a vile message she found defacing a local mural.Breagha Gowans spotted the anti-Muslim slur scribbled on the wall of an underpass near Culloden Wood while out for a walk with her mother Michelle.After the pair had a chat about what exactly the message \u0026ndash which the Courier will not print \u0026ndash meant, the youngster decided to step up and take it upon herself to erase it, gathering a bag full of cleaning equipment for the job.\"I wanted to clean up the graffiti because I have a friend at school who is Muslim and I didn\u0026rsquot want her to be upset,\" she said.\"I wanted to be kind towards others.\"The underpass where Breagha spotted the graffiti passes below Barn Church Road and is covered in a colourful mural in a deliberate bid to dissuade would-be vandals from defacing the walls.After scrubbing the wall clean again, she appealed to everyone to show more respect towards those around them.\"Please don\u0026rsquot do it because it is hateful and no-one likes bullies,\" she said.\"It isn\u0026rsquot good to hurt people\u0027 feelings and I didn\u0026rsquot like to see something that would make someone feel bad.\"Breagha\u0027 father is Inverness South councillor Ken Gowans who said he was proud of the way she had decided to tackle the problem head-on.\"I told her it was fantastic \u0026ndash though like a typical eight-year-old she was off doing something else,\" he said.\"Breagha and her class have been learning about different religions at Inshes Primary School and she has a very strong sense of justice and fairness.\"It is a testament to what they are teaching in school.

A friendly at Inverness Caley Thistle on Wednesday had to be called off due to injury problems.Summer signing Stephen Gleeson (knee), Niall McGinn (thigh), Mikey Devlin (groin) and Frank Ross (groin) are injured.The Reds are still awaiting the full results of a scan which will reveal the extent of Gleeson’s injury.He will miss tomorrow’s friendly with Cove Rangers, but the Dons are still hopeful he could feature against Burnley in the Europa League second qualifying round, the first leg of which is on July 26.Another summer signing, Chris Forrester (groin), and Sam Cosgrove (calf) were also injured but are expected to be fit to face Cove tomorrow.So far this summer the Dons have only signed three players with £200,000 outlaid for the capture of Forrester from Peterborough United.Republic of Ireland international Gleeson was secured on a free. An SPFL tribunal will decide the training compensation due for teenager Lewis Ferguson who signed from Hamilton.Polish defender Krystian Nowak is currently training with the Dons and is set to feature as a trialist in tomorrow’s friendly.The 24-year-old is a free agent having had his contract with Greek side Panionios terminated earlier this summer.Aberdeen also had a bid for Doncaster striker John Marquis, understood to be for £250,000, rejected.Boss Derek McInnes confirmed that bid was the highest the Reds could go to and they will now look at other potential targets for centre-forward.Celtic and Rangers have both invested heavily in their squads this season.But Considine insists the heavy spending of the Old Firm will only inspire Aberdeen.He said: “Celtic always generate so much money through their transfers and whatever.“You expect it from them.“Due to the situation with Rangers they haven’t been able to do that, but this year they have. It is great to see and is healthy for Scottish football.“A strong Rangers is good for the league.“It also brings us on.“In the past few years or so we have still remained second so regardless of what they are going to spend we are still going to challenge this season again.”Aberdeen’s preparations for the Euro tie with Burnley conclude with a friendly against West Brom at Pittodrie on Friday.The Baggies were relegated to the Championship at the end of last season.Considine said: ”When we play West Brom here that will be a good indication of what is coming.“Although they were obviously relegated, in my eyes they are still a Premier League team.“That will be a good test for us and will show where we are at and what is coming opposition wise.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/07/5b48aaf9adf64-442x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet could you give a forever home to any of these animals","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAre you looking to get a new pet?

","title":"campaigners welcome plan to take back control of waters","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA north-east campaigner has welcomed the government’s plan on how fishermen can take back control of Scottish waters following Brexit.Former member of the Cod Crusaders Carol MacDonald has backed plans that were unveiled by the UK Government last week.The Fraserburgh-based Cod Crusaders were set up in 2002 to fight for fishing rights in the north-east.Carol made a return to campaigning this year, working with fishing communities around the country.The UK Government has proposed a series of measures including ending the controversial discards policy for dead fish caught by accident and a new model of quota allocation.Plans also outline how the UK will try to ensure that EU states do not demand access to British waters in exchange for allowing fish to be sold in European markets.Carol said: “Anything giving the fishing industry a chance to thrive outwith Europe and the failed Common Fisheries Policy gives our dependent fishing communities a far greater chance of survival.“The government must prioritise a recovery plan to help struggling communities introduce a regeneration plan to act as an antibiotic to clear our communities from the European bug.”The UK Government was accused of selling out the sector earlier this year after agreeing to keep current quota arrangements during the Brexit transition period until December 2020.There will also be a bid to move to a new system for quotas getting away from the common fisheries policy to a system the government says is more fair.A UK Government spokeswoman told The Evening Express that since 2012 it has invested £174 million across the UK in 295 Coastal Communities Fund projects.She said: “Our fishing industries are the beating heart of our coastal communities and Brexit will give us the chance to revitalise areas while becoming a world leader in managing our resources while protecting the marine environment.We are now working with the Scottish Government on the longer-term future of EU programmes, such as the European and Maritime Fisheries Fund, to ensure support our fishing fleets.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"new ballot after airport staff are offered pay deal","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeen airport workers are to be balloted on an improved pay offer after talks to avert strike action ended.More than half the 252-strong workforce at Aberdeen International Airport had planned to take part in a strike after 88% of workers rejected the latest pay deal.However an improved pay offer was made during the discussions yesterday and will now be taken to a workplace ballot.The talks were led by conciliation service Acas, who were contacted by the airport to mediate between both parties.An Aberdeen International Airport spokeswoman said: “An improved offer was made to Unite and they have confirmed they will take the enhanced offer to a workplace ballot.\u0026#8220We expect to hear the result within 24 hours.”Regional officer for Unite Tommy Campbell said: “The dispute, under the auspices of Acas, has resulted in a revised offer which will be put to Unite members to decide if the new offer is acceptable or not.\u0026#8220The consultation organised by the unite workplace representatives aims to conclude tonight.”If the strike action was to go ahead, it would see around 170 workers taking part, including security and airfield operations, airside services, firefighters and passenger service agents.Unite members have rejected two wage offers over the two previous years, saying they are below inflation increases.In 2016, a potential strike by workers over pensions was averted after talks between union bosses and airport chiefs resulted in an “agreement in principle”.There were fears industrial action could lead to major disruption at the north-east gateway at the height of the summer season.The airport recently unveiled a much bigger and improved

More than 360 volunteer hours have already been completed in the garden, and a community group is running a summer programme of activities.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lawrie says opportunity knox for russell as the scot is the man in form after stunning play off victory in the irish open","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeen\u0026#8217s Open champion Paul Lawrie is hoping to watch another Scot challenge for golf’s oldest Major at Carnoustie.And of the five home hopes in the field – Russell Knox, Grant Forrest, Sandy Lyle, Scott Jamieson and Lawrie-mentored Stonehaven amateur Sam Locke – the 1999 winner is backing Knox to be high up the leaderboard.The world number 49’s form appears to be peaking at the right time after he won the Irish Open two weeks ago at Ballyliffin, following it up with a couple of good rounds at the Scottish Open at Gullane over the weekend.However, Lawrie, 49, who pulled out of a return to the scene of his famous triumph as he continues to fight a foot problem which has plagued him for seven years, doesn’t think the fearsome Angus links will suit Scottish players any more than the rest.He said: “I don’t think it matters whether the weather’s nasty or if it’s good (for who wins).“These guys are the best and can adapt their games to any conditions, any course, any set-up.“I don’t think it favours home players or away players.“Russell Knox is our best player at the moment in the world rankings, so hopefully there will be a Scot up there.”US-based Knox looks a likely member of the Ryder Cup team later in the year, such is his form.Lawrie’s foot problem – which he says gives him no control over his left foot when he’s swinging – started just before he played for Europe in the Miracle at Medinah in 2012.The Aberdonian, who is also struggling with a herniated disk in his back, is resting up ahead of becoming eligible for the over-50s seniors tour in January and doesn’t plan to hit any golf balls for at least another couple of months.He then intends to seek specialist treatment if his injuries don’t improve.However, Lawrie did manage to get a sneak peek at Carnoustie ahead of the world’s best golfers descending on it this week, and he’s predicting low scoring.Lawrie said: “I was down with (his sponsor) Loch Lomond Whisky doing a couple of days’ filming.“There wasn’t an awful lot of rough and it looked quite sparse.“They obviously still had a few weeks where it might grow a little bit.“But the course looked magnificent.“It’ll be pretty hard and firm, but the forecast is good for the week I hear.“So if the course stays the way it is just now and the forecast stays the same, scoring will be pretty good round there.“That’s what links courses are. If there’s no wind and it’s in good nick, these guys are the best in the world, scoring will be low.“But if the wind picks up a little bit and there’s a bit more rough, it’ll be a different story.”Lawrie will also be at Carnoustie during the Championship working in the Loch Lomond tent and performing media duties.Locke, 19, deservedly made his way into this week’s Open field after winning final qualifying at the Renaissance Club in East Lothian.The amateur, who works in the coffee shop at the Paul Lawrie Golf Centre at South Deeside Road, is mentored by Lawrie and has been developed at the centre.Lawrie described Scottish Amateur champion Locke as the amateur “all the Scottish boys are trying to chase and beat” at the moment, adding he’s “talented, works hard and wants to play at the highest level of the game”.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/06/18, 3:50 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The last thing David MacInnes sees himself as is a hero.Be we believe differently.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"exciting shinty at the macaulay sixes","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 22/06/18, 8:15 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowNo fewer than 29 youth shinty teams travelled to Oban\u0026#8217s Mossfield Park for the annual Macaulay six-a-side competition.The winners of the main competition for P7 and under were Inverlochy, who defeated Taynuilt 1-0 in the final with Taynuilt taking the Oban Celtic Shield.The Alastair Campbell Shield for P5 and under was won by Braxi Boys from Inverlochy who defeated Bute in a very exciting final after extra time by one penalty to nil.The Macaulay Development trophy was won by Rockfield Rapids.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scrum for burgers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 7:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Mid Argyll Rugby Club had its annual end-of-season barbeque and awards ceremony at the Ropework park on Sunday June 24.The kids from P4/5 and P6/7 that played a big part in winning the league and runners up in P4/5 also received medals.Of the primary six and sevens, player of the year went to Murray MacDonald, most improved player of the year went to Aileen Barr, the coaches award went to Campbell Shaw and best newcomer went to Rhys Coffield.Of the younger kids of primary four and five, the player of the year award went to Arran Martin most improved player of the year went to Fergus Bennet the coaches award went to Jorja and Jemma MacDonald and best newcomer went to Logan Cinnamond.On top of their awards, all the kids were also given a new training top sponsored by Jewsons.The players also clubbed together to get all the coaches a gift each.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays sale of the summer gets underway","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/07/18, 6:37 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe famous Inveraray summer sale has started.On Monday June 25, Inveraray’s parish church hall opened its doors, brimming with exquisite odds and ends.Ornaments, sports equipment and anything else you can think of can be found at the church for a fair price.Volunteer Wilma Wood said: \u0026#8216Anyone looking for something in particular can give us a shout.

The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

Thanks also to everyone at MacPool, Argyll Cafe, Bargain Zone, Danny\u0026#8217s, Ferguson\u0026#8217s Butcher, The Archway, Crinan Cycles, Argyll Pharmacy, Square Peg, The Sweetie Jar, Dalriada Home Hardware, the Post Office and Maureen Roy for donating the great raffle prizes and Councillor Dougie Philand for being an excellent quiz master.And, of course, my appreciation to everyone who came along and took part.The event raised £120 which will help Lochgilphead Community Council put on this year\u0026#8217s festival on Saturday August 4 on Lochgilphead front green.Thank you everyone.Brian MacLennan, Lochgilphead Community Council.Sir,I have been working hard to address issues raised by my constituents. I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

On a lovely summer evening the rafters of Strachur Memorial Hall dirled to the sound of pipers showing off skills learned during the week in front of proud family members. John Kelly of Dunoon performed his master of ceremony duties with his usual wit and dexterity.An award, presented by his family in memory of the late Niall Campbell, is presented each year to the pupil who has shown the biggest improvement in the eyes of the tutors.

The biggest cheer of the day was reserved for this year’s Queen Chloe Macdonald, who together with her Princesses Caitlyn Prentice and Cara Mackie were introduced to the crowd by Rev Robert Macleod and Councillor Anne Horn.Tarbert’s new Royal Family then led the famous festival parade where locals and visitors alike dressed up and joined in with this year’s Heroes and Villains theme.  Pirates and superheroes watched on as Cruella De Vil and her dogcatcher tried to capture more Dalmatian puppies. And the Batmobile was hot on the trail of the Joker who was seen heading through the village with Poison Ivy.One of the festival’s most eagerly anticipated events is the cookery demonstrations, once again led by Mike Leslie of Kilsyth’s Coachman Hotel. The market area was packed as cooks got some professional tips on how to prepare and cook seafood.While the adults tucked into some of Tarbert’s finest fish and shellfish, younger festival-goers were being wowed by the gravity defying Clan Stunt Bike Team, before learning new skills in the circus workshop.Highland dancing displays plus performances by festival regulars Mid Argyll Pipe Band ensured there was something for everyone, before Sunday’s Beer on the Pier, where party people of all ages packed Tarbert’s quay, ready to be entertained.Girl band Feeva promised and delivered ‘cheesy tunes’ and were closely followed by Scotland’s number one Take That cover band, Could It Be Take That, to keep the party atmosphere going. Local band The Democrats brought the curtain down on this year’s festival in style.With just three people in the festival committee it fell to organiser Margaret MacNeill to comment on this year’s event saying: \u0026#8216Thank you to everyone who came and joined in with this year\u0026#8217s Seafood Festival. This weekend is about celebrating the heart of Tarbert and we’re delighted so many people came to join us.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12468674.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_240218grant_07JPG.jpg","title":"maybole super school one step","story":"NewsMaybole super-school is one step closer to being builtCouncillors have approved the results of a public consultation in the town that will see a 1400-pupil campus erected at Carrick Academy.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson15:27, 10 JUL 2018NewsNew Carrick Academy artist impression (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA \u0026pound42million super-school has taken a step closer to being built in Maybole.

St Cuthbert’s Primary – where parents responding to the consultation issued a rejection of the move – would also relocate but operate as a stand-alone school. A bid for funding will now be made to the Scottish Government. A total of 87 written responses were received during the council’s consultation that officials noted was “low considering the size of Maybole with a population of 4,700 people”.  Council schools spokesman William Grant said: “There is a general agreement of all schools to come together. “Where we had a more mixed response regarded the possible move of the swimming pool. “It is important as we progress the design that too much is not crammed in to this new campus. “It must be open and spacious.” Maybole Tory councillor Ian Campbell hailed the project as a “wonderful step forward”.

Bids of \u0026pound1.5million are being sought for Enterkine House, perched above Annbank. The luxury four-star retreat, which boasts 74 acres of land, employs around 50 staff. Kirk House and Steading, a six-bedroom farmhouse currently used as overspill accommodation for the hotel, is also included. Agents Christie \u0026amp Co and Galbraith said the plot offered “potential for development under a new owner”. It follows a long-running noise battle at the hotel which saw bosses spend \u0026pound80,000 soundproofing their wedding marquee. Council chiefs were told that slapping an 11pm curfew on party bands could put the hotel out of business.  But they finally got the all-clear earlier this year and revealed plans to build a permanent structure. However, the hotel is now being offered to the market. Bob Cherry, a partner with Galbraith, said: “The purchaser of Enterkine would find it relatively straightforward to continue the current business, which is well-established, and there are further opportunities for diversification or expansion of the tourism and events facilities on the estate, subject to the necessary consents. “This is a beautiful estate with a thriving hotel business and potential for further development.” Brian Sheldon, of Christie \u0026amp Co, added: “The market for country house hotels such as Enterkine House has vastly improved in recent years. “Its location in South Ayrshire and within such an enviable estate and countryside will attract local, regional and potentially international operators. “Whilst the business is trading well, there is certainly scope for further growth.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"royal troon golf club make","story":"NewsRoyal Troon golf club make generous donation to hospital unitIt follows a charity 18-hole golf event with Troon Portland and Troon Ladies, writes Charlene Bennie.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post15:39, 10 JUL 2018News\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRoyal Troon Golf Club has made the generous donation of \u0026pound1k to Crosshouse Hospital’s Acute Stroke Unit.

Andrew Power, club captain of Royal Troon, said: “We chose to donate to the Acute Stroke Unit as three of our members were in this unit over the last year and are all now recovering well. The word from them is that they got the best of care and were delighted we chose to donate to the unit” During the event, Stroke and TIA (Transient Ischaemic Attack) information packs were handed out, making it a great opportunity to spread awareness of how to act when someone is suffering from a stroke.  Andrew added: “We had a great day, great weather and we were glad we made a good amount for a good cause.

The dad-of-three said: “It was so funny.

That’s the shock ultimatum delivered by warring SNP councillors to their embattled leader. Douglas Campbell has been ordered to regain control of his split ranks during the council’s summer break. It comes as rival camps “fight like rats” to wrestle the council’s power base back on track. A racism storm and failed coup on Councillor Campbell has plunged the SNP into crisis. And the Post understands another plot to oust the leader is now brewing. It follows all SNP group members signing a declaration of support for their under-fire boss just two weeks ago. But a party insider has revealed growing disquiet is threatening to tear the group apart.  Within hours of the public show of support, Cllr Campbell was being placed under increasing pressure to step down of his own accord, rather than face another bruising challenge from within, the Post has learned. A senior source said: “People agreed to fall in line and sign the declaration for the sake of the bigger picture. “But it’s widely accepted that a change is required and this can’t go on. “The group is in a position where people will fight like rats to get what they want. “However, the even bigger concern is trying to keep the administration intact.” Worries over a potential walkout from Labour colleagues has, until now, ensured enough SNP support behind Cllr Campbell. A potential change in the their leadership is thought that have strained relations with administration partners, who have indicated they are happier working with Cllr Campbell.  But the Post understands that Cllr Campbell’s Labour past is forming a big part of the problem for the SNP leader as he battles factions within his new party. And a new warning – issued as councillors left for their summer break – stressed that he must crack the whip among his troubled ranks. The source added: “It was made very clear that if he doesn’t, the matter will be taken out of his hands. “The party is being crucified every week and it cannot be allowed to continue. “Some see Douglas as being far too close to Labour and that is undoubtedly a big issue for him. “Either way, he’s been given the message in clear terms that he needs to get everyone behind him and on the same page.” When asked about the warning, the group’s depute leader, William Grant, insisted: “This is news to me.” Cllr Campbell added: “Cllr Grant responded to your enquiry that ‘This is news to me’ and I have nothing to add.” "},{"url":null,"title":"town-centre-building-set-for-facelift","story":"THE owners of a Bridge Street building in Kelso have applied to give their town centre property a makeover.\u0026nbsp\nDavid and Graeme Brechin, of Grant Avenue, Edinburgh, have applied to Scottish Borders Council for permission to renovate and repair the exterior of 6 Bridge Street.\u0026nbsp\nThe building is home to commercial properties, with a women\u0026rsquos clothes shop and charity shop occupying the ground floor, and the upper floors are divided into office accommodation.\u0026nbsp\nThe application outlined the aims of the proposal: \u0026ldquoRecently stonework had fallen off the building resulting in building standards involvement on public safety grounds and a scaffold has been erected.\n\u0026ldquoVarious options for repair have been considered, including renewing all the damaged stone with new natural stone indents but with 75 percent of the elevation delaminating it is prohibitively expensive and disproportionate to the capital value of the premises.\u0026nbsp\n\u0026ldquoRepairing individual stones in lithomix was also consider but is also not possible because of the large proportion of the fa\u0026ccedilade needing repaired.\n\u0026ldquoThe option the applicant wishes to pursue is for a more extensive render repair by cutting back virtually all of the facing stone, fixing an expanded metal base then expertly and uniformly stucco-rendering the fa\u0026ccedilade, scoring it to simulate ashlar stonework.\u0026nbsp\n\u0026ldquoCareful treatment around the window dressing, decorative eaves cornice and quoins will be carried out prior to the render coat application by a reputable, local stonemason, who will replace or repair the decorative stone to retain the character of the building.\u0026nbsp\nThe application will now be considered by Scottish Borders Council planning officers.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"noel-gallagher-tribute-band-to-play-galashiels-gig","story":"NOEL Gallagher fans in the Borders will be feeling supersonic as a tribute band rolls with it into the MacArts centre in Galashiels next week.\nThe band, named Acoustic Gallagher will be in town on Friday, July 13.\nThe gig will celebrate the songwriting talents of Oasis, as well as playing well-known classics and B-sides including Wonderwall, Champagne Supernova and of course, Don\u0026rsquot Look Back in Anger.\nDoors open at 7.30pm and music starts at 8pm.\nTickets\nare \u0026pound10, and are available by calling the box office on 01896 756852, or can be booked online at www.ticketsource/date/483994\nincluding \u0026lsquoWonderwall\u0026rsquo, \u0026lsquoChampagne Supernova\u0026rsquo, \u0026lsquoThe Masterplan\u0026rsquo, \u0026lsquoIf I Had a Gun\u0026rsquo, and of course, \u0026lsquoDon\u0026rsquot Look Back in Anger\u0026rsquo.\n\u0026lsquoSome might say\u0026rsquo that the Manchester band\u0026rsquos classics will receive an airing, along with work from Noel\u0026rsquos solo act, the High Flying Birds.\n\u0026lsquoWhat a life\u0026rsquo fans will also be in for a treat at the gig too.\u0026nbsp\nAdditionally, a licensed bar will be in operation on the night.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"galas-gareth-has-a-wicked-time-with-west-end-star","story":"AN aspiring performer from Galashiels has realised a lifelong dream by sharing the stage with one of musical theatre\u0026rsquos biggest stars.\nNineteen-year-old Gareth Williams, who is currently training for a BA (Hons) degree in Musical Theatre at The MGA Academy of Performing Arts in Edinburgh, was given the opportunity to provide backing vocals for West End and Broadway star Kerry Ellis during her 20th anniversary concert at The Queen\u0026rsquos Hall in Edinburgh.\nKerry is widely considered to be the one of musical theatre\u0026rsquos biggest stars and has previously starred in Wicked, We Will Rock You, My Fair Lady, Miss Saigon, Oliver!

Galashiels has been especially hard hit, with its proportion of vacant retail units now standing at 15% representing a total of 37 empty stores.\nHawick and Selkirk lag not far behind, with 14% apiece of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core activity area is retained but that the scope of activity allowed be expanded to include professional service businesses, non-profitable institutions and leisure activities.\nThe outcomes of those proposed pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels would then be used to draw up similar proposals for other towns.\nFootfall figures % change from 2007 to 2017:\nHawick

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.

Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.

Walter, who lived in Prestonpans with Janet, was just 60 when he died. He had been diagnosed with the disease only 29 days earlier.  Wife Janet has vowed to continue campaigning to raise funds and awareness in her husband\u0026rsquos memory.  She said: \u0026ldquoI cannot thank everyone enough for the support they have given me and my family over the past 18 months.  \u0026ldquoRaising awareness of pancreatic cancer is just as important as the fundraising and I would urge everyone to learn and understand the symptoms of this \u0026lsquosilent cancer\u0026rsquo.

A spokesman for the Dunbar RNLI said: \u0026ldquoHe and his partner had been enjoying a barbecue on the beach.  \u0026ldquoWhen the barbecue cooled they moved it elsewhere but the man stood on sand where the disposable tray had been sitting.  \u0026ldquoThe heat of the sand was such his feet blistered.  \u0026ldquoCrew members used burn bags to protect the man\u0026rsquos feet as they, with help from two surfers, transferred him to the lifeboat.  \u0026ldquoThey then headed to the nearby chalets at Shore Road, where an ambulance crew was waiting to treat the man for his injuries.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.  Angela, who has been Paul\u0026rsquos full-time carer, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom incredibly proud of Paul.  \u0026ldquoDespite his challenges he just gets on with things and has achieved his degree.  \u0026ldquoHe has had a tough life but he does not give up and is an incredibly caring young man.  \u0026ldquoNothing is going to stop Paul.  Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.  Paul is hoping to get a job based in computer security once he finishes his studies."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8024055.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"couple-get-permission-to-turn-old-bar-back-into-pub","story":"  Michael and Wendy Peters took over the Gardeners Arms in Haddington in 2011 when its licence had come under review because of problems experienced by previous management.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.  James Hughes, who currently runs Dunbar Golf Club, asked the board to consider transferring the licence to him as he revealed ambitious plans to invest \u0026pound50,000 in the business with a view to eventually taking ownership of the property.  Mr Hughes told the board that he was preparing to sign a five-year-lease of the pub with its current owner in a deal which would allow him to buy it at the end of the lease.  He said that there were plans to renovate the building to open it up more and make it a family-friendly site.  Mr Hughes told the meeting: \u0026ldquoWe plan to make it a good country food and beer premises.  \u0026ldquoIt is in an area steeped in history with [Belhaven] Brewery and a popular tourism area, and we want to turn it into a good welcoming family pub.  Mr Hughes, who has been at Dunbar Golf Club for several years, told the board he had more than 23 years of experience in the licensed trade and had worked in Edinburgh before moving to East Lothian.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.

The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.

Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.  Michael Johnson of Nottinghamshire created \u0026lsquoThe Mussel\u0026rsquo with input from local schoolchildren, and its installation was recently highlighted in the Courier. He has been making artworks for public places since 1991 and has now completed more than 180 commissions for both rural and urban sites throughout the UK and Ireland.  Mr Goodfellow added: \u0026ldquoThis is a work of outstanding beauty that truly complements the town and its cultural heritage.  East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Arts Service formed a working group to select and commission artists to create the new public artwork. The group included representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership, Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Conservation society, East Lothian Council officers, councillors and other community representatives.  The artists were commissioned to undertake the work, which is being funded by Tesco with \u0026pound38,000 for each of the two sculptures, as part of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art Policy."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8046040.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"queen-named-ahead-of-dunbar-rnli-lifeboat-day","story":"  This year\u0026rsquos Lifeboat Queen is 14-year-old Beth Mackay, with attendants Mia Thomson, 11, and 12-year-old Anushka Demer.

Dunbar and East Linton ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire encouraged members of the public to go along and have their say.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.  Another major project could be the creation of \u0026ldquoa low-key but iconic \u0026lsquogateway\u0026rsquo feature which would welcome walkers off the John Muir Way and into the park. That would require special funding applications.  Stuart Gibb, area manager of Dunbar and East Linton Area Partnership (DELAP), said that consultation had already taken place with groups such as DELAP and the town\u0026rsquos community council, as well as various departments of East Lothian Council.

Five of those who lost weight suffered a \u0026ldquosignificant loss, according to the report by the Care Inspectorate officers who visited the home during an unannounced three-day inspection in May.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership confirmed it had suspended admission to the home following the report, which has now been fully revealed, after it emerged last month the home had been ordered to make urgent improvements after inspectors raised \u0026ldquoserious concerns.  HC-One, which operates the home, says it has introduced a new home manager and it pointed to some of the more \u0026ldquopositive comments in the report which acknowledged staff were praised for their approach to residents.  A spokesperson for HC-One said: \u0026ldquoThe health and wellbeing of our residents is our highest priority and we take all feedback from the Care Inspectorate extremely seriously. We are pleased their full report included some positive comments about the home, particularly noting our staff team are \u0026lsquokind and caring\u0026rsquo in their approach to residents.  \u0026ldquoWe also recognise we need to do better in some other areas. To do this, we have a new home manager in place who is being supported by the wider management team, and we continue to work closely with the Care Inspectorate and relevant authorities as we implement our improvement plan.  \u0026ldquoWe are pleased significant positive progress has already been made, and are confident the home is in a better place than at the time of the original inspection.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue working hard each and every day so that we are consistently providing the standard of care that Residents deserve.  \u0026ldquoThe Care Inspectorate have recently returned to the home to commence a new inspection, and we look forward to demonstrating the positive changes to them.  Drummohr is the second nursing home in East Lothian operated by HC-One to have admissions suspended in two years.  In 2016, Tranent Care Home was temporarily stopped from admitting new residents by the partnership, which oversees adult care services, after reports of residents being ignored as they asked for help to eat, with others eating with their fingers because of a lack of cutlery or being unable to cut their food themselves, while others were seen wearing clothes soiled or left unchanged after spilling food on themselves.  The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo. The four areas were quality of care and support environment staffing and management and leadership.  An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe wellbeing of residents is always our paramount concern and in this case we will continue working closely with Care Inspectorate to ensure that HC-One delivers the required improvements as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoAs an interim measure, we have decided to suspend new admissions to Drummohr to enable staff there to focus on what needs to be done. They will be supported in this by a multi-disciplinary team from the partnership."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8061096.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"bus-mounts-pavement-in-tranent","story":"  The 62-year-old, who was driving an empty Prentice coach at the time of the incident, is understood to have taken ill at the wheel as it pulled out from a bus stop.

WHAT do we remember of our childhood in our later days? Think for a moment of the key happy memories which have framed your childhood. They are often simple ones involving play outside. Sadly, research is showing that children are increasingly less able to explore and play in the outdoors.  There are various reasons for this and there is a horrible irony at the centre of it. We have become far more obsessed with material things, it\u0026rsquos all around us. We are literally buying into the idea that happiness is about purchase and we are passing this on to our children.  It\u0026rsquos in our brains that the economy needs us to spend our money on things we don\u0026rsquot need. We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.  But it was tinged with a sense of sadness that the magic is something being lost to so many of us, and indeed that so many of the magic places are themselves being lost.  But my melancholy did not last long. It was a day of joy and we thanked the wood as we left."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8067093.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"day-two-of-the-aberdeen-standard-investments-scottish-open-at-gullane-golf-club","story":"  Rock is 13-under-par, two shots better off ellow countryman Tyrell Hatton.

The Proposal of Application Notice (PAN) is the first step in the planning process, with the idea of housing on the site, off the A6093.  The land outlined for the development is identified for housing in the new Local Development Plan and, according to the developers, will be designed to integrate with the Letham Mains development.

Now the 29-year-old from Macmerry works with the likes of Hearts defender John Souttar, Motherwell star Chris Cadden and Rangers midfielder Greg Docherty on the mental side of their games.  He told the Courier how the drastic change in career came about: \u0026ldquoWhen I was a PT people used to come to me and ask for a diet plan or a training plan.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquod say \u0026lsquohave you had one of these before?\u0026rsquo and they\u0026rsquod tell me they\u0026rsquod had seven or eight.

I then went to Thailand on a course and it\u0026rsquos all gone from there.  John, a former Ross High School pupil, initially worked with youth football clubs across the county while trying to make a breakthrough to top-level players. He said: \u0026ldquoI sent messages, filled out contact forms and heard nothing until this time last year, when John [Souttar] got in touch.  \u0026ldquoI think there is a bit of a stigma because it\u0026rsquos psychology and people think you\u0026rsquove got to have a \u0026lsquoproblem\u0026rsquo but it\u0026rsquos not about that.  \u0026ldquoI focus on three things: mindset, the player as a person and their performance. I believe that a better person is a better player so what they do off the pitch is massively important.  And he explained how he worked with players on an individual basis, saying: \u0026ldquoI get to know the players.  \u0026ldquoSomeone could be struggling with self-confidence, or we all know what social media is like \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos where I come in to help them.

The 63-year-old passed away on March 2, having been minister at St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

Mrs Reid, known as Kit, told how she exchanged early memories of her nursing career and the transition into the NHS with the royal guest.  She said: \u0026ldquoMy first pay was two pound notes and a 10 shilling note. The week before national health it was seven (shillings) and six (pence).  Mrs Reid, of Haddington worked as a nurse from 1946 until 1952 and spent some of her career at Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Royal Hospital for Sick Children. The grandmother of five, with triplets in Seattle and a grandson in Saskatchewan, Canada, and a further grandson at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u0026ldquoThe Duke was absolutely normal.  \u0026ldquoHe spoke to me and asked various things about the work I had done.  \u0026ldquoObviously he had been briefed because he asked me about the pay and for what felt like a long time he spoke to me.  \u0026ldquoHe was just so charming \u0026ndash it was the thrill of a lifetime, the whole thing.  \u0026ldquoI met so many wonderfully interesting people \u0026ndash people from Orkney and Shetland, from all over Scotland, with their own stories to tell.  \u0026ldquoIt was just absolutely wonderful \u0026ndash I even got to walk on a red carpet.  Mrs Reid said that the NHS had made a massive difference to the way of life across Scotland and said she was \u0026ldquoall for the NHS.  The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.  Mrs Reid added: \u0026ldquoWe weren\u0026rsquot allowed to live out of hospital, we had to stay in the nurses\u0026rsquo homes.  \u0026ldquoI loved it \u0026ndash I loved the camaraderie, I loved the company, I loved everything about it.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot all drudgery and hard work, we had lots of fun into the bargain.  The evening reception, attended by 700 people, was one of a series of events taking place around the UK to mark 70 years since the health service was founded.  During the engagement, Prince William watched a short film about the history of the NHS and listened to singing by the NHS Forth Valley Nurses Choir."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8064994.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"rugby-stars-take-on-golfers-at-gullane-ahead-of-scottish-open","story":"  Scotland caps Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings faced off against South African Dean Burmester and New Zealander Ryan Fox in a \u0027rugby vs golf\u0027 challenge.\u0026nbsp  Kinghorn and Hastings kicked rugby balls around the championship course, while Fox and Burmester got some practice in earlier this week, with the rugby stars coming out on top 2-1.\u0026nbsp  Below is a video of the challenge. . .\u0026nbsp      Rugby \u0026#127386 Golf    With @LeuchieHouse and @MNDoddie5 as the official charities this week, we decided to have fun with a little #RugbyGolf challenge \u0026#127945\u0026#9971 pic.twitter/eCH0KBEjin  The Scottish Open\u0027s two charity partners this year are the My Name\u00275 Doddie Foundation, set-up by former Scotland rugby star Doddie Weir following his diagnosis with Motor Neurone Disease and Leuchie House, the North Berwick-based national respite charity of which Adam\u0027s dad Gavin Hastings is patron."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8070351.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"all-the-latest-from-day-three-of-the-scottish-open-at-gullane","story":"  He carded a two-under-par 68 in his third round today (Saturday) to lead the tournament at Gullane Golf Club.\u0026nbsp  He\u0026rsquos a shot clear of a six-strong group that includes American Rickie Fowler, the 2015 Scottish Open\u0026nbspchampion at Gullane.

At Islay Ales they produce a range of both cask and bottles conditioned beers. The bottled beers are real ale in a bottle. The beer is neither filtered nor pasteurised prior to being bottled and therefore continues to ferment and mature in the bottle. This process produces sediment in the bottom of the bottle.    They have recently started to make use of the fact that many individuals have bottled their own whisky on Islay and are looking for something special to do with the empty cask. They fill these casks with part of a brew and then allow the influences of the whisky and the wood to act on the beer by maturing it for at least six weeks up to almost three months, depending on the requirements of the customer.  This year Islay Ales were delighted to have been asked by WW100 Islay to produce an ale to commemorate the ending of the First World War and to remember those lives lost in the tragic sinking of two troops ships off Islay  Visitors are more than welcome to visit the Brewery, they are happy to show how the beers are brewed in the 4-barrel plant, which produces 1150 pints (640 litres) at a time. Depending on what day you come to the brewery you could see the brewing in action or it might be the casking, bottling or labelling, all of which takes place on site.  Before or after a tour of the brewery you can sample some of the available ales, sometimes Islay Ales might even have some on draught for you to try. You can also purchase bottles of the beers as well as Thistly Cross Cider. If you are looking for presents or something to remember them by, the Brewery shop has a range of clothing, glasses and other items.    The Brewery and shop is open from 10.30 to 5.00 Monday to Saturday during the summer but only to 4.00 in the winter. They generally do not open on Sundays unless a special request has been made.  A large number of establishments on Islay take the ales, either in bottle form or on draught so when you come to visit the island you are sure to be able to find Islay Ales near to where you are staying.  www.islayales  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The Brander Lodge  Nestled within a scenic and tranquil location, The Brander Lodge offers comfortable and stylish facilities for those looking to relax and explore.

In a letter to European Tour tournament director Mike Stewart, Jardine wrote that Poulter \"arrived in a shower of expletives\" and asked where his ball was.  \"I told him and said that I had not ventured into the bush for fear of standing on it,\" Jardine wrote. \"I wasn\u0027t expecting thanks, but I wasn\u0027t expecting aggression either.  \"He told me in essence that I should have, his reasoning being that if I stood on the ball it was a free drop, whereas if he did it was a penalty.  \"Basically I take no s*** from no man. Industrial language doesn\u0027t bother me, but truculent aggression does.  \"I\u0027m not asking for him to be fined, because I don\u0027t see the point of that. However I would like him to be reminded that even though most of the world knows you\u0027re an a*******, there\u0027s no need to go proving it to the rest.  \"I will take his apology as read, but if he wants to make it in person, I\u0027m not hard to find in Gullane.\"  Poulter responded with a post on social media on Sunday, writing on Twitter: \"Extremely sad to see a marshall has wrote in and complained about me aiming abuse at him on the first hole.  \"I asked if he found my ball and his response was \"it\u0027s in there somewhere\" \"I didn\u0027t want to step on it\" I replied \"if you stand on it I can replace it without penalty but if I stand on it I will get penalized\"  \"Venting at myself like I do at times, I said a couple of choice words aimed at myself. I do not abuse Marshall\u0027s.

Such was the anger of some pro-EU Conservatives at Mrs May\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquocave-in to the Brexiteers that one, Guto Bebb, the Defence Minister, resigned so that he could oppose the Government. He becomes the 10th person\u0026nbspto resign over Brexit.  In other votes, Labour\u0027s new clause 11, which aimed to establish securing a customs union with the EU as a negotiating objective, was defeated by 316 votes to 289, a majority of 27, and the SNP\u0027s new clause 16, requiring the Scottish Parliament\u0027s consent to implement several powers in the Bill, was defeated by 316 votes to 36, a majority of 280.  Eurosceptic Conservatives had earlier proposed four changes to the UK Government\u0027s Customs Bill aimed at imposing strict conditions on Mrs May after she produced a plan at Chequers that would keep the UK closely tied to Brussels\u0027 rules on goods and food.  Just hours before MPs were due to vote on the amendments to the Taxation[Cross Border Trade] Bill, proposed by the European Research Group[ERG] led by ardent Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, No 10 announced it would not be opposing them, claiming they were \u0026ldquoconsistent with the PM\u0026rsquos Brexit blueprint.  Three of the changes - to maintain the Union and not allow a customs border down the Irish Sea, to take the UK out of the EU\u0026rsquos VAT regime and to guarantee there would be no new customs union with the EU without primary legislation at Westminster \u0026ndash seemed to roughly align with the Chequers compromise.  But the fourth - a refusal to collect tariffs on behalf of another country without reciprocity across the continent so that the EU would collect duties on behalf of the UK \u0026ndash did not not least because the EU27 would not agree to giving Britain preferential treatment.  However, No 10 pointed out a section of the White Paper to justify its argument of consistency.  It reads: \u0026ldquoThe UK proposes a tariff revenue formula, taking account of goods destined for the UK entering via the EU and goods destined for the EU entering via the UK.  This, a Downing Street spokesman, made clear the idea of reciprocity was hard-wired into the Chequers Plan.  Yet the paragraph goes on to say: \u0026ldquoHowever, the UK is not proposing that the EU applies the UK\u0026rsquos tariffs and trade policy at its border for goods intended for the UK.  During Commons exchanges, Mrs May - in response to Labour MP Stephen Kinnock\u0026rsquos claim that she had \u0026ldquocapitulated to the Tory hard Right - was adamant the Brexiteer amendments did not change her Brexit blueprint.  \"He is absolutely wrong\u0026hellipI would not have gone through all the work that I did to ensure we reached that agreement only to see it changed in some way through these Bills. They do not change that Chequers agreement, she declared.  But not everyone was convinced. Her Tory colleague Anna Soubry, a leading Remainer, told MPs it seemed Mr Rees-Mogg was now \u0026ldquorunning Britain.  In contrast, Priti Patel, the former International Development Secretary and a prominent Leaver, who tabled the amendment calling for reciprocal action on collecting tariffs, said the PM\u0026rsquos move was \"constructive\".  Her Brexiteer colleague Peter Bone denounced the Chequers Plan as an \u0026ldquoabsolute shambles and called on his party leader to take it off the table.  Kirsty Blackman for the SNP accused the PM of being \u0026ldquoheld hostage by the Tory Brexiteers and suggested the Conservative Government was riding roughshod over Holyrood\u0026rsquos voice on EU withdrawal.  The Aberdeen MP said while businesses were desperate for clarity over endless Tory confusion, \u0026ldquowe get only in-fighting and a prime minister, who caves in to her extreme hard Brexit wing.  Outside the chamber, one Brexiteer source boasted how Mrs May\u0027s move on the Customs Bill had confirmed \"Chequers is dead on arrival\".  Earlier, the PM faced a call from leading Remainer Justine Greening, the former Education Secretary, to facilitate a second EU referendum given the parliamentary \u0026ldquodeadlock but No 10 made clear the Government would not agree to such a move \u0026ldquounder any circumstances.  The powerplay over the Customs Bill is just one of several potential flashpoints this week.  After the votes on the Customs Bill, MPs will on Tuesday debate the Trade Bill and the issue of whether Britain should remain in the European single market.  On Wednesday, following the last PMQs of the parliamentary session, MPs will debate Britain\u0027s future relationship with the EU and Mrs May will later appear before the Commons Liaison Committee made up of Committee Chairmen.  It is thought David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary, and Boris Johnson, the former Foreign Secretary, will sometime this week make personal resignation statements in the Commons, which will pile more pressure on the PM.  The danger to Mrs May has been underlined by the disclosure that Brexiteers have set up a WhatsApp group to co-ordinate voting tactics, organised by Steve Baker, who last week quit his job as Brexit Minister over the Chequers plan.  It has been suggested more than 100 MPs have joined the group, a number which is more than double the 48 needed to submit letters of no confidence in Mrs May to trigger a leadership contest.  Meanwhile earlier in the day,\u0026nbspScott Mann, the Cornwall MP, became the ninth person to quit their post in protest at the Chequers Plan. The ex-ministerial aide to the Treasury and a former postman, said he would not \"deliver a watered-down Brexit\"."},{"url":null,"title":"from-home-baker-to-the-boss-of-a-biscuit-factory-how-morven-rose-to-the-top-of-the-confectionery-world","story":"  It was the start of a lifelong love of baking which has seen her rise to the very top of the confectionery world after being appointed as the manager of her own biscuit factory.  Morven Burden, 27, from Drumoig in Fife has been handed the keys to a massive plant in Romania that churns out millions of biscuits a year.  It is a far cry from her first homemade attempts as a child, but is the icing on the cake for the Scot who fared better in the kitchen of a five-star hotel in St Andrews where she was a pastry chef during her summer holidays from university.  Ms Burden is in charge of 250 employees and admits that despite graduating with a degree in economics, a career which involved baking was always her preferred option.  Now she produces three million biscuits a year, which is rather more than the desserts she produced for weddings at the luxurious Fairmont Hotel.  She said: \u0026ldquoI used to make what I call pretend biscuits and cakes, which basically saw me go through my mum\u0026rsquos cupboards and grab any ingredients before tossing them altogether and seeing what happened.  \u0026ldquoAlthough they weren\u0026rsquot edible it started something and I\u0026rsquove always wanted to work in baking ever since.  \u0026ldquoWhen I was at university, I wrote to all the hotels asking for a summer job in the kitchen. I would have quite happily just washed dishes, but the chef at the Fairmont said they wanted a pastry chef and that was the start.  \u0026ldquoI was once crowned the Brandy Snap biscuit queen and held a record of making 2,000 by hand in a single shift.  \u0026ldquoI loved it, especially weddings and other big events, and it was a natural step to make when I graduated to go into biscuit production.  After leaving university, Ms Burden started at a McVitie\u0026rsquos factory in Carlisle where popular brands such as custard creams and bourbons are produced in their millions, before she joined the massive plant in Harlseden in London where they produce the famous digestives. Like many others would do if they were in her position she admits that she \u0026ldquosamples her favourite biscuits off the production lines.  But after eating so many of one biscuit, she becomes sick of them and moves on to another brand.  She becomes sick of that one too and them moves along the lines doing the same before a craving for the first one starts again and the sequence begins again.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt is very tempting and we do eat the biscuits until we get sick of them but we soon find our appetites again. Everyone\u0026rsquos the same and we\u0026rsquove all been guilty of eating a whole packet of biscuits in one go.  \u0026ldquoThe sheer scale of how we in the UK love biscuits became clear when I started in London and we were producing something like 100,000 digestives a second, mainly for the British market.  \u0026ldquoI often asked that surely we couldn\u0026rsquot eat that many biscuits, but apparently we can. Every country likes eating biscuits, but they just have different tastes.  Just before Christmas last year, she received a phone call from the head of pladis, the firm that owns McVities, asking her to take over a plant in the Romanian capital of Bucharest.  She is the youngest factory manager at the multi-national at the age of just 27.  But she does not regret the move and is enjoying life in Romania.  She added: \u0026ldquoThe people have been very friendly and have taken to my management style very well as it is very different to what they are used to.  \u0026ldquoMaybe it\u0026rsquos a throwback to the Communist era, but management in Romania is traditionally very regimented and the workers like the fact that I involve them in decision making.  \u0026ldquoIt is a smaller site than I\u0026rsquom used to but we still produce around three million biscuits a year and we have plans to grow the business four-fold.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos very different to where I intended to be at this age as I thought that I would automatically go to the McVities factory in Glasgow seeing as I\u0026rsquom a Scot. But I\u0026rsquom glad I\u0026rsquom getting to travel.  To someone who oversees the production of millions of biscuits a year the last thing you would expect her to do when she gets home is eat a biscuit let alone have a favourite.  But she does and unsurprisingly perhaps, her favourite is not one of the better known ones in the market.  She said: \u0026ldquoI like all sorts, most of the kinds that everyone else likes, but I love chocolate gems which are small and filled with chocolate.  \u0026ldquoThey are my absolute favourite. They might not be that well known, but they should be. Mandy Major, the factory manager at pladis\u0026rsquo Aintree site in Liverpool, has acted as a mentor to Ms Burden through her career at the firm.  She said: \u0026ldquoSince joining us as a young graduate, Morven has shown true passion for the business and our sector. She has begun a remarkable career leading complex and varied manufacturing projects across pladis\u0026rsquo sites, and we\u0026rsquore immensely proud that she is taking on this new role in our global family, bringing all her expertise to Romania."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-to-face-fresh-commons-test-just-hours-after-customs-struggle","story":"  The Prime Minister was hit by a late night ministerial resignation following a\u0026nbsptorrid day of Tory divisions when she \u0026ldquocaved in\u0026nbspto Eurosceptic demands.  Further challenges lay ahead as pro-EU Tory amendments to the Trade Bill go before MPs on Tuesday.  Late on Monday, Mrs May saw off defeat by just three votes on two key changes to the customs bill after a Remainer backlash in the warring party.  Defence minister Guto Bebb voted against the Government, effectively quitting his frontbench role.  He is the tenth in a series of MPs, ranging from star names to minor players, to have quit since the Chequers\u0026rsquo agreement on Brexit, though the first Remainer to go.  Mrs May had earlier bowed to Brexiteer demands to stem a threatened uprising on the bill.  But the string of concessions infuriated Conservative Remainers who refused to back the amendments to the legislation.  Some 14 Tory rebels voted against the Government-backed Tory Eurosceptic clause that would prevent the UK collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU unless it agreed to do the same.  An amendment that would stop the UK from joining the EU\u0026rsquos VAT regime saw\u0026nbsp11 Conservative rebels.  Mrs May inched through with the support of three Labour MPs,\u0026nbspFrank Field, Kate Hoey and Graham Stringer, on both.  In bruising Commons exchanges, Remainer Anna Soubry accused Mrs May of \u0026ldquocaving in to Eurosceptics.  The Tory former minister told the Commons: \u0026ldquoNobody voted Leave on the basis that somebody with a gold-plated pension and inherited wealth would take their job away from them.  But as tempers flared, Ms Soubry was told she \u0026ldquoain\u0026rsquot no Margaret Thatcher by Sir Edward Leigh when she invoked the late premier\u0026rsquos support for free trade.

Bosses say they now want to add a new conference centre and extend the exhibition space, warning that \u0026ldquostanding still is not an option in the competitive conference market.  They say they have applied for planning permission in principle and are in funding talks with the city council and Scottish and UK governments over the proposal.  SEC chief executive Peter Duthie said: \u0026ldquoWe believe there\u0026rsquos an opportunity to do something world class with the venue, to be ambitious and to capitalise on an industry that Scotland is already successful in.  A feasibility study looking at the proposals has been carried out.  Mr Duthie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll be looking to build an additional 5,000 sq metres of exhibition space, extending our exhibition halls, and effectively build a new conference centre but connected into the existing facilities.  \u0026ldquoOne thing that will do is allow us to stage two events simultaneously of scale.  \u0026ldquoAt the moment, if we have a conference in for the week, pretty much that\u0026rsquos it. We believe the market is big enough that if we had the equivalent facility we could stage two at once and thereby significantly increase the economic benefit.  He said he hopes to have reached \u0026ldquoa meaningful position with regard to securing funding by the end of the year.  \u0026ldquoWe are living in a world where competition in the conference industry worldwide is increasing significantly, Mr Duthie said.  \u0026ldquoStanding still is not an option. Scotland really needs to invest to move forward, but we\u0026rsquore well placed to do that with the facilities we have here, the location of it, the transport links, the increasing hotel provision, which is already being driven through the city, and the team we have here as well.

Graham, 52, told the Press Association that she finds the lack of opportunities available to her \"hugely frustrating\".  She added: \"Because women in their fifties and older are basically more or less invisible when it comes to television. Actually no - television is actually quite revolutionary.  \"Film is the worst.

It was delayed from earlier this month because Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe cancelled going to Brussels over a disaster in south-western Japan caused by extremely heavy rainfall, with more than 200 people dying in floods and landslides.  European Council president Donald Tusk and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker will also attend a gala dinner at the prime minister\u0026rsquos official residence.  Both sides are heralding the deal, which covers a third of the global economy and more than 600 million people.  Prices of European wine and pork will fall for Japanese consumers, while Japanese machinery parts, tea and fish will become cheaper for Europe.  The deal eliminates about 99% of the tariffs on Japanese goods to the EU, but remaining at around 94% for European imports into Japan for now and rising to 99% over the years.  The difference is due to exceptions such as rice, a product which is culturally and politically sensitive and has been protected for decades in Japan.  The major step toward liberalising trade has been discussed in talks since 2013, but the timing of the signing is striking as China and the US are embroiled in trade conflicts.  The US is proposing 10% tariffs on a 200 billion dollar (\u0026pound151 billion) list of Chinese goods.  That follows an earlier move by Washington to impose 25% tariffs on 34 billion dollars (\u0026pound25 billion) of Chinese goods. Beijing has responded by imposing identical penalties on a similar amount of American imports.  Besides the latest deal with the EU, Japan is working on other trade agreements, including a far-reaching trans-Pacific deal.  The partnership includes Australia, Mexico, Vietnam and other nations, although the US has withdrawn.  Japan praised the deal with the EU as coming from Mr Abe\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoAbenomics policies, designed to wrest the economy out of stagnation despite a shrinking population and cautious spending. Japan\u0026rsquos growth continues to be heavily dependent on exports.  The foreign ministry said that by strengthening ties with the EU, Japan hopes to vitalise mutual direct investment, fight other global trends toward protectionism and enhance the stature of Japanese brands.  The EU said the trade liberalisation will lead to the region\u0026rsquos export growth in chemicals, clothing, cosmetics and beer to Japan, leading to job security for Europe. Japan will get cheaper cheese, such as Parmesan, gouda and cheddar, as well as chocolate and biscuits.

While I appreciate that Inverness is the larger and most busy airport, there is a real public perception that, at present, Inverness gets a lot of public money spent on it in terms of development and jobs, to the detriment of other regional airports.The Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP added: \u0026ldquoI have consistently made the case that Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport should be considered as a real possibility for the future of the air traffic control service in the Highlands, not least because of the real benefit and impact it would have on the socio-economic climate of the county.\u0026ldquoWe need sustainable, quality jobs and I am worried that this decision will limit many who have seen themselves as having a career in the aviation industry in the Highlands to only being based in Inverness.Mrs Ross added: \u0026ldquoIn May, the rural economy and connectivity committee, of which I am vice-chair, took evidence on this issue and were assured by the then minister, Humza Yousaf, that a full consultation and scoping exercise would take place and that there would be no decisions made until this work was carried out.\u0026ldquoI was very disappointed to learn of the decision to base the new service in Inverness, which seems like a real kick in the teeth to smaller airports that have been working hard to train, support and develop the expertise in their ATC staff.Trudy Morris, chief executive of the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was also unhappy with the decision.She said: \u0026ldquoWe were extremely disappointed by the Hial board\u0026rsquos decision to select Inverness in principle as the location for a planned centralised air traffic management facility. Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport would have made an excellent base for this facility, and would have offered an opportunity for Hial to reverse the trend of centralisation of public services in Inverness.\u0026ldquoIt is our understanding that Inverness offered significant benefits to Hial with regard to retention of existing and recruitment of new staff, and we can appreciate why this proved to be a significant factor in the decision-making process. Unfortunately the end result will be a loss of skilled jobs from the rural communities which most need them.Ms Morris added: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the future for the north Highlands is looking bright, with significant investments in oil and gas, renewables, tourism and indeed the airport itself, we feel this is a missed opportunity to maximise these. We will be working closely with Hial, public agencies and local businesses over the coming years to understand and address the impact that this decision will have on the north Highlands.Inverness was picked as the preferred location for a new state-of-the art air traffic control centre following a study by consultants.Tuesday 17 Jul 2018 11:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116574.jpg","title":"High calibre medical staff recruited in Caithness","story":"\u0026nbspNHS Highland yesterday confirmed the full and part-time appointments, which include two advanced nurse practitioners and a physiotherapist.Bill Fernie, chairman of Caithness Health Action Team, said: \u0026ldquoIt is definitely good news that the posts which were empty for a long time are being filled and that is welcomed by us.\u0026ldquoThis is a success for NHS Highland but it has been a long time coming.

The recruitment of three GPs is particularly remarkable considering a quarter of GP practices across Scotland have vacancies.\u0026ldquoThe recruitment of all the clinicians will improve the continuity of care provided by the practices while introducing access to a specialist primary care physio at the three sites.\u0026ldquoReducing the reliance on temporary locums will enable NHS Highland to save money while improving care.

I found countless deserted and remote beaches piled high with it \u0026ndash plastic bottles, cotton-bud sticks, fishing gear, plastic bags, she said.\u0026ldquoThe worst-affected beaches in Scotland were on the west coast. On the east coast there was noticeably less on the beaches, but I was still paddling past beaches with nesting birds that had multicoloured plastic littering them.\u0026ldquoPaddling up the north-east coast, and particularly around Duncansby Head, I picked up several large plastic bags.\u0026ldquoThe inland canals were the worst affected. One morning in Wigan I counted 691 plastic bottles just in the first hour of paddling.Cal admitted that the marathon paddle was not without a scary moment or two.She added: \u0026ldquoThe Mull of Galloway paddle was one of the more terrifying moments. Storm Hector was approaching, so I had just one window to get around the Mull.\u0026ldquoI set off at 11.30pm, just as it had got dark, and paddled 14 miles across Luce Bay.\u0026ldquoThe darkness made it very hard to navigate so I used GPS and, once I could see lights on the opposite landmass and the lighthouse at the Mull, I focused on that.\u0026ldquoWith the Isle of Arran, I set off with a five-hour window to get to Arran before a storm was due to come in.\u0026ldquoThe winds were strong the entire time, mostly behind me but enough of a crosswind to make the paddling incredibly challenging and painful. When I was 12 miles across, the waves were almost as big as me and the storm came in early. I was very scared and felt very alone \u0026ndash panic was starting to set in.\u0026ldquoOnce I was within a mile of the island, and knew I was safe, fear turned to exhilaration, and the feeling of being propelled along by 20-30 knot winds was incredible.Tuesday 17 Jul 2018 11:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Water levels as low as 1976 on River Thurso","story":"WATER levels on the River Thurso have been at their lowest in decades during the recent dry spell, according river expert Eddie McCarthy.Mr McCarthy, who retired as river superintendent in 2016, has manned the river for 37 years and says that the dry weather of the past few weeks has resulted in water levels comparable to those in the 1976 heatwave.Levels in 1984 were similarly low.One or two anglers have travelled up for pre-booked fishing trips only to change their plans after seeing the low water.However, overall this has had minimal impact on the river angling business, according Mr McCarthy.\u0026ldquoThe anglers are usually quite hardy, he said. \u0026ldquoThey\u0026rsquoll take their golf clubs up or will go trout fishing.Despite the rain returning on Monday, Mr McCarthy is unsure when the water levels will return to normal. \u0026ldquoWe need 72 hours of proper rain for it to rise.

Pupils at Wick High could also miss out on extracurricular activities, it was stated.At present, Stagecoach runs a service to Gills Bay three times a day, Monday to Saturday, but from next month it will operate twice a day, Monday to Friday. There are additional journeys between Wick and John O\u0026rsquoGroats but they vary according to school hours.A Stagecoach spokeswoman said the company recognised the feedback from the community over its plans. \u0026ldquoThe revised proposals represent a significant investment by Stagecoach, and work will continue to promote these links to encourage a sustainable level of demand. A review will take place 12 months after the start of the new timetable in order to establish the long term future of the bus service to Gills Bay.Trudy Morris, who chairs the Caithness Transport Forum, said: \u0026ldquoWe are very pleased to see that Stagecoach has listened to the local community and agreed to secure the bus link to Gills Bay for a further 12 months. Not only will this bring benefit to local bus users, who would otherwise be isolated in their communities, but it also has potential to benefit the tourist market, providing services to link with the Gills Bay ferry.However, she is concerned about the review in 12 months time and said: \u0026ldquoWe will be working with Stagecoach and the local community to see what can be done to promote usage of the route, and will also be discussing with public sector partners such as Highland Council to see what might be done to secure the route on a non-commercial basis in future.Bill Mowat, the chairman of Gills Harbour Ltd, claimed public pressure had an impact on Stagecoach and pointed out there was strong opposition to the plan.Tuesday 17 Jul 2018 11:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July 16, 2018 at 1:18 pmWith strikes at Aberdeen Airport set to cause widespread travel disruption in the coming weeks, Orkney MSP Liam McArthur has called for compromise when it comes to NHS patients traveling south for treatment.

Last November, Loganair flew Teddy over 200 miles back to Kirkwall for a tearful homecoming with his young owner.Officially launched to mark Teddy Bear Picnic Day, this Tuesday, July 10, the furry keepsakes come with their very own Loganbear luggage tags as well as outfits mirroring the tartan look and feel of the airline’s own uniforms. Throughout the summer months, children will be able to pick between a Logie or Lotti bear once they come onboard a Loganair aircraft, distributed by the airline’s flight crew.The airline is running a number of social media competitions and promotional activity featuring the bears throughout July and August and will also be launching its Instagram channel to showcase the two toys.Kay Ryan, Commercial Director at Loganair said: “We’re very much looking forward to giving some of our youngest passengers a special memory of their trip with Loganair and what better day to unveil the two newest members of our crew than Teddy Bear Picnic day.“Logie and Lotti will be flying with us all summer and our crew can’t wait to introduce them onboard.“Last year the airline did everything it could to reunite a young girl with her lost teddy so this summer we thought we’d try and share some of that joy with children travelling with us.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This could run into millions of pounds and put at risk the future viability of the business.The company have also met with local Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur, to express their concerns about the delay.As the start of this month, as Mr Matheson stepped into the shoes of the previous minister for transport Humza Yousaf, it was announced that lack of agreement between the Scottish Government and Pentland Ferries had led to no discounted fares being introduced in Pentland Firth ferry routes, by the Government\u0026#8217s self-set deadline of the end of last month.Andrew Banks, Managing Director and Owner of Pentland Ferries said: “We want these passenger subsidies implemented as soon as possible but we need to be 100 per cent sure that the scheme complies with state aid rules.  We have never had any subsidy from the government and even though this scheme gives money to the passenger, not the operator, the minister has told us that we would be liable for any repayment if at a future date the scheme is deemed illegal. This could run into the millions and could finish us off.“We cannot take that risk and we have a responsibility to our staff, our community and family to make sure the scheme works for everyone. We want to work with the Minister and his team to discuss a way forward so that we can all benefit from reduced fares. This scheme will be fantastic for our business, attracting more visitors to the islands and making it cheaper to travel to the mainland for residents. So we want this unlocked as soon as possible. We welcome the Minister’s willingness to gain a full understanding of the detail and very much hope to be able to meet him in Orkney soon.”The minister, Mr Matheson, was asked for a response to the comments from Pentland Ferries and Mr Banks. At the time he replied, Transport Scotland said the invitation had not yet been received so the minister could not comment.However, Mr Matheson did say: “The Scottish Government remains committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles. I am conscious that there is a great deal of interest in this issue amongst users of the services. As I begin my new role as Transport Secretary, I want to ensure that I gain a full understanding of the detail — it is already very clear to me that planning to introduce reduced fares on the Northern Isles network has been a complex and challenging piece of work.“As a first step, we will cut fares on the Aberdeen-Lerwick and Kirkwall-Lerwick services from June 30. These reductions will be around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.“On routes to Orkney, it has been necessary to engage with commercial operators on the Pentland Firth. We set out a very fair and reasonable proposal that would maintain competition, enabling them to protect their existing market share. Unfortunately, not all the commercial operators have felt able to agree to our proposals. This means we cannot currently implement reduced fares on any of the routes to and from Orkney without the risk of legal challenge.“This is both disappointing and frustrating, but I am determined to work through the issue to see what more can be done. I have asked Transport Scotland to undertake some further work to see what measures, if any, we can take. As part of that, we are willing to reopen talks with commercial operators.  I will provide a further update to stakeholders and to Parliament as soon as I can, with a view to bringing the full benefits of the scheme to the people of Orkney and Shetland.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This will help reduce the initial barrier of connection for a defined period of time.Two events are planned at the St Magnus Centre in Kirkwall, from 6pm to 8pm on Wednesday July 11 then from 10am to 12pm on Thursday July 12 with a further event at the Doubletree by Hilton, Glasgow Central, from 10.30am to 12.30noon on Friday July 13 and finally, a webinar will take place on Tuesday July 17 from 10am to 12pm.Registration is required for the Alternative Approach consultations via the following link: https://www.ssen-transmission/news-views/articles/2018/6/solving-orkney-s-catch-22/Commenting on the Alternative Approach consultation events, Lauren Milligan, commercial policy manager, said: “As a customer-driven initiative, stakeholder engagement has shaped the Alternative Approach proposal to date.“We want to ensure that we develop a solution that not only works for network companies but also the wider industry and other connection customers and would therefore encourage anyone with an interest in our proposed Alternative Approach trial to register for one of our consultation events.”The final stage of consultation is planned to take place in Autumn on the various components of the transmission reinforcement project in advance of submitting planning applications to the relevant planning authorities, the Scottish Government, Marine Scotland and Orkney Islands Council.The progression of the project is subject to all necessary planning consents and securing regulatory approval from industry regulator Ofgem, with the Alternative Approach trial also subject to regulatory approval.For more information on the proposed Orkney transmission reinforcement, including links to both consultation documents, click here.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It\u0026rsquos not an easy decision.\"We\u0026rsquove listened to customers, colleagues, communities and elected representatives and we continue to do so.\"We\u0026rsquove committed to making no further changes to the size of our branch network in Scotland until at least 2020 \u0026ndash and not to remove or replace, at a suitable nearby location, the branch ATM if there\u0026rsquos no other free-to-use ATM within 1km of the closing branch.\"The way our customers are banking is changing and it is important that we respond to that change. Across Scotland, usage of our branches is down 42 per cent since 2014. Only one per cent of our customers in Scotland visit their branch on a regular weekly basis. Seven in 10 customers are using mobile or online banking.\"\"We recognise that every customer will have different banking needs and we are committed to ensuring all our customers receive the best possible service.\"We\u0026rsquove invested to provide more ways to bank with us now than ever before.\"He added: \"We\u0026rsquove committed to keeping 10 branches open until the end of 2018.\"Johnston Carmichael has been appointed to carry out an independent review into these 10 branches and are meeting with local customers, representatives, employees and stakeholders in all ten communities to understand the impact of each individual closure.\"We have committed to accepting the recommendations of this review in full.\"Tuesday 17 Jul 2018 11:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Depute fiscal Alison McKenzie told Sheriff Margaret Neilson the 15-year-old was being trained in lifeguard skills and it was when they were alone at the pool Russell repeatedly fondled him over his trunks: \"It happened so frequently he could not recall the number of occasions he was molested,\" said the fiscal.The boy didn\u0026rsquot report the assaults and told no-one until many years later as a father of two he received a letter from Russell offering to act as a football scout for his children.The fiscal said: \"The complainer was furious, recalled the abuse he suffered at the hands of the accused, and made a statement of complaint to police.\"Russell admitted assaulting the boy on various dates between 1977 and 1979 at Dingwall Sports Centre Swimming Pool and between May and June 1981 at the Mackay Hostel sexually assaulting a 16-year-old.He further admitted assaulting an 18-year-old by handling his buttocks over his kilt in 1983 at a street in Dingwall and exposing himself to him.He also pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting an 18- year-old at the hostel in 1984 by sitting on his bed uninvited, placing his hand under the bed covers and repeatedly attempting to touch his genitals.Sentence was deferred after his last appearance for reports.Russell is due to appear in court again on August 2.Tuesday 17 Jul 2018 11:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

In more recent times, it has seen the fairytale rise of Ross County from Highland League to Premiership \u0026ndash and a notorious Town Hall appearance by the Beatles when the Fab Four were on the brink of global success.Now, history hunters are being targeted by DCDC which has sought to work with the public to create a new vision of the town.Fascinating facts are being assembled by Dingwall History Society for panels dotting the town and shining light on its rich past.Secretary\u0026nbspSandra MacDonald said: \"Dingwall has a very long and significant history and we have the information available.\"The group will gather facts and suggest significant sites worthy of interpretation but will not have the final say.Mrs MacDonald, whose late husband David \"DD\" MacDonald chaired the society for a decade, said: \"There are the obvious sites like the Tollbooth \u0026ndash the tower and the clock.\"Other sites being considered include the war memorials at Station Square and the Hector Macdonald Monument and Moot Hill in the Cromartie Memorial car park, where the Vikings are believed to have held gatherings.Mrs MacDonald added: \"A board can carry a minimum amount of information but can indicate where people can access far more online.\"DCDC secretary Robin Lingard revealed the heritage trail is one of several items being proposed by the group, set up as a charity two years ago to tap funding pots for improvements. He told a recent open meeting that membership had more than doubled. \"We are very pleased,\" he said. \"I think out of it new ideas will come forward.\"Community activist George Murray, project manager for Dingwall Means Business, targeting the establishment of a business improvement district (BID), said: \"I think the DCDC is the perfect body to spearhead and develop plans like the heritage trail. I see it as being beneficial not only for local community development and participation but also as a way of presenting our community heritage to the world, especially as we get busier with the advent of the cruise tour coaches beginning to discover the town and the success of the NC500 route.\"If suitable funding can be put in place a heritage trail round the area could be a real boon to the town.\"Dingwall councillor Angela MacLean said a trail is \"a fantastic opportunity\" to showcase the town.She said: \"Many of the DCDC group\u0026rsquos wish list buildings are in the ownership of the Highland Council and if DCDC or another local group would like to take over and run of any of these buildings I am more than happy to lend my support. I would also like to congratulate DCDC for the work they have done so far and look forward to working with them to make some of their proposals a reality over the coming years.\"\u0026bull What do you think about the idea?

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4742452.1531823265!/image/image.jpg","title":"poll 40 of scots back snp s claim of westminster power grab","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless.

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone. Let’s hope not.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"scott calls on union to allow medical flights during aberdeen airport strike ","story":"Isles MSP Tavish Scott is calling on Unite to allow lifeline medical flights from the isles to continue through a proposed strike at Aberdeen Airport.\nMr Scott has appealed to Unite’s Scottish secretary, Pat Rafferty, after workers at the Airport voted for strike action in a dispute over pay.\nWorkers at Aberdeen Airport have announced their intention to strike at points throughout late July and August.\nAnd Mr Scott said this would deny NHS patients living in Orkney and Shetland the opportunity to attend scheduled medical appointments in Aberdeen through no fault of their own.\nMr Scott wrote:The strike action would affect not only leisure and business travellers, but also NHS patients travelling from Orkney and Shetland for treatment on the mainland. Any avoidable delay in receiving essential treatment is unacceptable.\n\u0026#8220Many of these passengers have been waiting for their appointments for months if not years, and have no way to access the treatment and specialists they need at home.\n\u0026#8220Travelling out with the isles for medical treatment is already stressful for vulnerable isles residents without the added anxiety caused by cancellations. Rescheduling appointments is not easy for those living in remote communities and patients may have a lengthy wait for another opportunity to travel.\n\u0026#8220The right to strike is an important one and I understand that strikes have to cause disruption in order to be effective.\n\u0026#8220But, I urge your members to carefully consider this compromise: Loganair flights from the North Isles use smaller aircraft which require a lower level of fire service cover.\n\u0026#8220Therefore, Unite members could guarantee a minimum level of fire and security coverage on the proposed strike dates, allowing life-line Orkney and Shetland flights to continue for essential medical travel.\n\u0026#8220I hope further discussions will resolve the dispute before any strike action goes ahead and that the needs of North Isles passengers are at the forefront of your decision making.\u0026#8221\nMeanwhile, Loganair is giving passengers in Shetland the chance to change their flights.\nAbout 170 members, including key airport staff, security workers and firefighters have voted in favour of striking – with more talks expected next week involving conciliation service Acas.\nTwenty-four-hour strikes are planned for Friday 20th July as well as on Thursday 2nd August and Thursday16th August.\nLoganair managing director Jonathan Hinkles said passengers could change their flights free of charge.\nHe said: “Although there is still time for the strike to be averted and we hope it will be, we are offering customers booked to fly to or from Aberdeen on the strike dates the opportunity to change their travel date or route if they wish.\n\u0026#8220This is free of charge and designed to offer certainty of alternatives for those booked to travel.\n\u0026#8220We also have contingency plans to operate Aberdeen flights to alternate airports on strike days if this does go ahead, and will announce details of those if this action cannot be averted. Our website is up to date with the latest information.”\nUnite regional officer Wullie Wallace expected talks with Acas next week. The dispute is over pay for airport workers. A total of 88 per cent of workers rejected the latest pay offer.\nThe union said members had rejected two below-inflation wage offers on the back of below inflation increases over the last two years.\nMr Wallace said: \u0026#8220Aberdeen International Airport’s latest derisory pay offer has been emphatically rejected by Unite members. The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding its hard working employees is by offering more real terms pay cuts.\n\u0026#8220Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities. It’s high time for the company to invest in its employees. Unite remains open to further discussions with a view to resolving the dispute.\u0026#8221\nAn unattributed quote from an Aberdeen spokesman stated: \u0026#8220We have been informed by Unite of their intention to take industrial action on Friday 20th July.\n\u0026#8220This follows the rejection of our proposed pay offer. We believe we have made an offer that is entirely fair and reasonable and we are committed to continuing discussions to reach a resolution acceptable to all parties.\n\u0026#8220We have made contact with Acas which has agreed to mediate between both parties. We are seeking a suitable date to continue our discussions in an attempt to reach a mutually agreeable position.\n\u0026#8220We will, as a matter of course, ensure contingency plans are in place in the event of any planned industrial action.”\nI am amazed that the Scottish Government will allow a union to hold hostage urgent healthcare for 45,000 citizens in Shetland and Orkney.

hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he

chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government will be free to make its own arrangements regarding the design and collection of any replacement tax\u0026rsquo, yet, as we have seen time and time again with this Government, the arrangements on offer, limits the ability of the Scottish Government to make changes to benefit the Scottish economy.\u0026nbsp\nIn his response to the Highland MP, Mr Jenrick confirmed that his department was willing to work closer with the Scottish Government to find a solution to the problem, recognising the commitment outlined in the Smith Commission.\nResponding after the debate, Mr Hendry said: \u0026ldquoI am glad that the UK Government recognises it has failed to hand over APD in a workable way, and that Airport Departure Tax cannot be implemented by the Scottish Government without a solution to this problem.\n\u0026ldquoI hope that the assurances from Mr Jenrick today, are followed up by meaningful action from the UK Government, to enable the Scottish Government to introduce its reduced Airport Departure Tax, while protecting the Highlands and Islands exemption.\"\nTuesday 17 Jul 2018 11:38 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/advert_whfp.jpg","title":"former sabhal mor ostaig chairman","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nFormer Sabhal Mòr Ostaig chair Duncan MacQuarrie was celebrated this week with the first road in the new Kilbeg Village development, Rathad MhicGuaire (MacQuarrie Road) named in his honour during an official ceremony held on Monday.\nThe ceremony was carried out by Kate Forbes MSP and recognised the key role which Mr MacQuarrie has played in the college\u0026#8217s development over many years. Sabhal Mòr Ostaig principal Prof Boyd Robertson said, \u0026#8220This is a richly-deserved honour for Duncan which recognises the hugely important contribution he has made to the development of the college over many years and the vital contribution he has made to the development of the Gaelic language and culture and to the advancement of Gaelic and Gaelic-medium education, both as a teacher and as a former HM Inspector.”\n“Duncan\u0026#8217s critical input to Sabhal Mòr Ostaig’s development in its challenging formative years was marked by his steady stewardship, as a former chairman and his pioneering work, alongside that of his fellow trustees, demonstrated an exemplary vision and commitment without which what is now the National Centre for the Gaelic Language and Culture would not have existed.”\n“For that, all who have benefited from this wonderful and inspiring place, over the intervening years, owe him a great debt of gratitude and it is for that reason we celebrate with him here today.

The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/001WH0607NCA.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league. Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27408  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nFormer Louth TD and republican ex-prisoner Paddy Agnew was in Leinster House for the first time today, 37 years after being elected. \nPaddy Agnew was one of three republican prisoners elected during the 1981 hunger strikes while imprisoned in Long Kesh and taking part in the blanker protest. \nHe was elected in the 1981 general election, topping the poll in the Louth constituency.

We may, if we have the courage, actually have a unique opportunity to create a future beyond division and sectarianism and build a dispensation that serves the interests of all the people who share this island. \nThe former South Antrim MLA also said divisions over the past can be overcome. \n\"If acceptance of a shared history remains a formidable challenge for this this generation, the concept of a share future may be a more achievable outcome,\" he said. \nHe went on to propose that a unique monument to all those killed in the conflict be built at the site of the former Long Kesh prison. \n\"I would offer one suggestion that a memorial or healing wall be established at the listed prison buildings. A sculpture, perhaps modelled on the Washington Memorial Wall, on which could be inscribed the names of every person killed as a result of the 30 years war that ended in 1998. This specially commissioned artwork would enable every victim family to visit the site and to remember and respect and would immortalise the names of all those who had died, of whatever nationality, combatants and non-combatants, those who were killed in Ireland and those who were killed elsewhere.\" \n\nMr McLaughlin also called for a question on a future referendum on Irish unity to be included in the next census, due to be carried out in the north in 2021. \n\"Perhaps the most constructive contribution that a restored Executive, on in their absence, a Secretary of State could make would be to arrange for an appropriate question to be formulated for inclusion in the 2021 census that would permit citizens to declare their support for either of the two constitutional options described in the Good Friday Agreement. \n\"The inclusion of such a question would have no constitutional effect, however the objectivity of the process and collation of responses would be essential to a decision on a referendum on Irish unity and in itself an encouragement for developing rational and thoughtful debate.\" \nConcluding, the veteran republican said now is the time for political leadership. \n\"Clear and affirmative leadership is essential and it is long since time for the political parties in Ireland to initiate a national conversation and to engage and listen to each other as they set out goals, aspirations and entitlements for an agreed future,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27411  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\nThe Occupied Territories Bill - proposed by Senator Frances Black - is expected to pass due to the support of Sinn Féin, Fianna Fáil, Independents and Labour. \nSinn Féin Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile welcomed the legislation, he said: “Goods and services that are only available because of gross human rights abuses and violations of international law should not be available in Ireland.\n\n\"On a daily basis, Palestinian villages are demolished and residents displaced to make way for the construction of more settlements,” he said.\n\"The international community considers the construction of Israeli settlements as illegal under International law and in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention. \n\"An EU report in 2017 outlined that continued settlement building places a great strain on efforts to reach a lasting and just resolution in the region.\"\nSenator Ó Donnghaile described the existence of settlements as a war crime and said the Irish government must comply with diplomatic and economic sanctions against the state of Israel.\n“The Irish government cannot on the one hand condemn these illegal colonial settlements and on the other hand freely trade with them.\n“This is the time for action and to make history.

disturbances that have occurred in the city\u0027s Bogside area in recent nights. \nA rally in solidarity with the local community will be held in the city tonight at 7pm, supported by a range of

people of the Bogside and Fountain and to send a clear message that there is no support for the violence witnessed over the last week. \nMary Lou McDonald made the comments in the Bogside this
