This is where your body is struggling to deal with blood sugar levels, and it is a very clear sign that you are about to develop full-blown type 2 diabetes.I didn’t have any symptoms of diabetes (such as excessive thirst or blurred vision), but my blood sugar levels were far too high.My GP put me on metformin tablets and drugs to control my blood pressure. I was also probably advised to lose a bit of weight. But even then I didn’t listen. It was only when I first met Roy that I finally took notice.         Tucking in: Dave in 2009, eating fish and chips, before he started the diet plan. He said losing weight had reversed his slide into diabetesWe met eight years ago when he was invited to join our TV series as an expert. He took one look at me and my co‑Hairy Biker Simon King and said: ‘You’re both morbidly obese.’It was great TV and the impetus we needed to launch the series in 2012.But what the viewers never got to see was the behind-the-scenes support he gave me. He made it clear that I was looking down the barrel of a gun, and diabetes was one disease I seriously needed to avoid at any cost.Then, off camera one day, he quietly took me aside and told me if I lost weight I could reverse the pre-diabetic state, get off the drugs and effectively protect myself against getting full-blown diabetes.         Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby with The Hairy Bikers Dave Myers and Simon King on December 3I was shocked, but intrigued.This was pretty revolutionary news at the time and it was something I was keen to try.From that point on I worshipped at the altar of Professor Taylor. It wasn’t always easy, particularly when you’re working with Michelin-starred chefs asking you to taste their exquisite mashed potato which basically wipes out your entire daily calorie allowance in one mouthful.Luckily the weight dropped off pretty fast, and within three months I’d shifted more than 3 st (from 114 kg to 95 kg) and Si’s weight dropped by nearly 4 st.         Hairy Biker Dave Myers has undergone a dramatic weight transformation. He said one of his key pieces of advice from Professor Roy is to aim to stay as close as you can to the weight you were when you were 21We felt great, but I noticed the impact first on my blood pressure, which was falling so low I’d end up feeling dizzy when exercising.Just two months into the experiment, Roy advised me to stop taking my diabetes tablets and to come off my blood pressure pills because I’d clearly lost enough weight that my organs were beginning to function normally again. That was a real thrill.Roy’s diagnosis was confirmed at a check-up six months after I started losing weight, when tests showed my blood sugar levels were smack‑bang in the normal category. Just as Roy predicted, losing weight had reversed my slide into diabetes.I’ve worked hard to maintain that weight loss and I’ve had my blood sugar levels tested every six months for the past seven years and the results have remained normal.One of Roy’s most important pieces of advice is that if you want to avoid diabetes, you should aim to stay as close as you can to the weight you were when you were 21.Sadly, I never did get back to the 34 in waist of my youth. But I managed a 36 in waist . . . which wasn’t bad from a starting point of 49 in.I’m still in contact with Roy and he says I could improve my health even further if I lose another 2 st.I might have laughed at the idea a few years ago, but I’m 62 now so I might make a concerted effort to shift that extra weight this spring.        "},{"url":null,"title":"Racism drove Meghan Markle Britain say prominent black Britons","story":"Share this article The Huffington Post published an article headlined ‘Why Black People Think Racism Drove Meghan And Harry To Quit The Royal Family’, while in The New York Times, Afua Hirsch, an author on race, said Meghan’s treatment showed that however successful you are in Britain ‘racism will follow you’.But Trevor Phillips, former chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said it was ‘nonsense’ to suggest the couple were leaving ‘because of racism’.

He feared she\u0027d allow herself to be seduced by fellow cast member John Leyton, who\u0027d had a No 1 hit in 1961 with Johnny Remember Me.Sellers phoned Britt long- distance from Hollywood: \u0027Why don\u0027t you take the day off and come over?\u0027 He assured her he\u0027d clear all this with her producers, he was well connected — and he\u0027d worked twice with Batasi\u0027s director, John Guillermin, on the feature films Never Let Go and Waltz Of The Toreadors.This was bluster. Sellers said nothing to any producer, and Britt later felt she\u0027d been more or less abducted: \u0027He made sure I didn\u0027t go back.\u0027 Her role was re-shot with Mia Farrow. The litigation lasted years, Sellers countersuing 20th Century Fox for \u0027mental distress and injury to his health\u0027.         The couple pictured together in 1965. The compliant, cosy, deferential scene was undermined somewhat by Sellers\u0027s feelings of morbid jealousy — and by the couple\u0027s instant separationMeanwhile, to make himself extra-virile in bed, Sellers, aged not quite 40, was taking ampoules of amyl nitrate, or poppers, which disrupted his metabolism — and on April 7, 1964, he suffered a series of heart attacks.Billy Wilder, who had not hit it off with his star, commented: \u0027Heart attack? Heart attack? You\u0027ve got to have a heart before you can have an attack!\u0027 Sellers was replaced by American actor Ray Walston, the footage all re-done, and Kiss Me, Stupid was a huge flop.Back at Elstead, it was Britt\u0027s job to see Sellers through his convalescence, and to administer his complex cardiological medication.He was an ungrateful invalid. When he found out Britt was pregnant, Sellers said: \u0027I\u0027ve got Michael, I\u0027ve got Sarah. I don\u0027t want any more children.\u0027 Director Bryan Forbes and Nanette Newman, his actress wife, had to talk him out of insisting Britt had an abortion.When she went into labour with Victoria in January 1965, he dumped her on the pavement outside the Welbeck Street Clinic and whizzed off to make What\u0027s New Pussycat. When Britt eventually visited him on the set, she blotted her copybook by mistaking Sellers for Woody Allen — there was a physical similarity, which Sellers found irksome.When he was again mistaken for Woody, by a Hollywood mogul during the making of Casino Royale in 1967, he was next heard from in Sweden. Sellers had gone into hiding with Britt\u0027s parents and refused to return to the film.Sellers was incredibly mischievous in his off-screen life, too.At Elstead, where Britt was sometimes so bored that she\u0027d spend an evening gazing at her reflection in the polished marble of the fireplace, the pair would dine on frozen cottage pie and fish fingers, served by a butler.When Goons fan Prince Charles came to lunch, Sellers hadn\u0027t made provision for his bodyguards, and told the cook to ide His Royal Highness\u0027s portion among his entourage — Charles was surprised to receive an eyeful of food. \u0027Sheer insanity,\u0027 said Spike Milligan.Sellers and Britt made home movies with Lord Snowdon and Princess Margaret — and Sellers asked Snowdon if he\u0027d like to swap wives. Sellers had to settle for a new camera lens instead, and Snowdon got a speedboat in return.Sellers also asked Bryan Forbes if Nanette could be exchanged for Britt, but Forbes managed to laugh off the suggestion.That such a crazy scheme could be broached indicates all was not well. \u0027Being with Peter was like riding on a rollercoaster,\u0027 remembered Britt. \u0027One minute you were flying high, the next you were running low.\u0027Nothing came lower than his doomed efforts to turn her into his one big impossible love, Italian film star Sophia Loren.In 1967, Sellers and Britt went to Rome to make The Bobo, in which he was a singing matador and she was to be a seductress. He insisted she wear a black wig, like Loren\u0027s. This was ridiculous but he couldn\u0027t see it.\u0027You\u0027re a lousy bloody actress,\u0027 he told her. \u0027Why don\u0027t you listen to what I tell you?\u0027 Not exactly morale-boosting comments — which began to be backed up with violence.He stamped on Britt\u0027s wedding ring so often that Garrard, the Queen\u0027s jewellers, got used to having to fix it. He threatened her with a shotgun, ripped up her clothes, smashed her cassette player and carefully took apart her Cartier watch, flushing the cogs down the lavatory.He also chucked her out of hotels — and when her parents came from Stockholm to rescue her after a flare-up on the island of Ischia, he didn\u0027t like to hear them babbling in Swedish, as he felt excluded.Sellers threw her luggage off his yacht, and Bert Mortimer was for ever having to gather up her personal effects. \u0027Our marriage is finished!\u0027 Sellers would cry.Britt fought back, once bashing him over the head with a picture frame. \u0027You hit me with me mum,\u0027 he said, when he saw the cherished photo of Peg on the floor.They were orced in 1968, Britt citing Sellers\u0027s psychological cruelty. He carried on getting married and orced, treating women like cars or cameras, accessories he could replace without compunction when he was fed up.For all his craziness, however, there has not been a comic actor to touch him.From the The Goon Show to Ealing classics, Boulting Brothers films, work with Stanley Kubrick, Inspector Clouseau, all the way to Being There, Sellers remains a comic genius and it doesn\u0027t much matter any more that he was a mean-spirited egomaniac.As for Britt, she became a Bond girl, and starred in Get Carter and The Wicker Man. In Scandal, she is to be glimpsed on a sofa, with tassels on her nipples.She had a long relationship with Rod Stewart and a shorter one with Warren Beatty. In 1996, she auctioned off her memorabilia at Christie\u0027s — including the wedding dress from her marriage to Sellers and the come-hither Polaroids he took on the night they met.\u0027I wanted to get rid of it all,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027m so tired of that sexy, cute little sex kitten, the youthful Britt.\u0027 I can sympathise with that.ROGER LEWIS\u0027S book The Life And Death Of Peter Sellers was made into a Golden Globe and Emmy award-winning film by HBO, where Sellers is played by Geoffrey Rush and Britt Ekland by Charlize Theron."},{"url":null,"title":"Church builds car park two GRAVES","story":"Share this article \u0027A full planning application was made through the local authority and no objections were received.

She talks about homophobia, healing – and finding fun in fictionCarmen Maria Machado is by temperament a fiction writer and writing In the Dream House, her memoir of surviving an abusive relationship, was in some ways a long and horrible experiment. The book, which is ided into fragments each cleaving to a different literary genre, is an attempt, at some 10 years’ distance, to make sense of the experience of her early 20s, when she was not only trapped in a house with a woman who gave every appearance of wanting to destroy her, but trapped in a relationship trope – an abusive lesbian partnership – not widely recognised as even existing.Machado is sitting across from me in the bar of her hotel in New York, on a brief visit from her home in Philadelphia. At 33, she is as far from the version of herself depicted in the book as it is possible to get: happily married to a woman called Val employed at the University of Pennsylvania, and with a thriving literary career – Machado’s short story collection, Her Body and Other Parties, was a finalist for the US National Book Award in 2017. And yet, she says, one of the bleaker side effects of writing the book was the realisation that “Oh, damage can be permanent.”When Machado meets her abuser – the woman is never named – she is completely smitten. The woman is “short and pale and rail-thin and androgynous”. She has a “dazzling smile” and “a raspy voice that sounds like a wheelbarrow being dragged over stones”. She is confident, assertive and socially at ease – all the things that, at that age, Machado is not. The sex is amazing. Addressing herself in the second person, as she does throughout the book, Machado looks back and observes that, “part of the problem was, as a weird fat girl, you felt lucky”.The book is skilful at elucidating the doublethink necessary to stay in a bad relationship – the constant shuttle between wanting to leave and wanting to stay the internal litigation one does to disprove the evidence of one’s own eyes the sympathy one has for one’s abuser. “The world is full of hurt people who hurt people,” writes Machado, who frequently found herself (after being screamed at, chased and bombarded with objects thrown at her head by her girlfriend) in the position of comforting her. And yet she stayed on. As she writes, “people settle near volcanoes because the resulting soil is extraordinary”.The “dream house” of the title refers in the literal sense to the house the women occupy in the midwest, and more generally, to the psychic space in which the abusive relationship unfolds, a terrain complicated by the fact that both partners are women. For Machado, the basic dynamic of any abusive relationship – the tendency of the victim to blame herself and assume she has the power to change things – is compounded by the silence that surrounds abusive lesbian relationships. Not only does she lack a language to describe what is happening to her, but there are times when to confront what’s going on feels disloyal to the very idea of lesbianism – the myth that “to find desire, love, everyday joy without men’s accompanying bullshit is a pretty decent working definition of paradise.”The book’s take on genre – each short section appears under a subhead framing it through a different literary device, for example “Dream House as Soap Opera”, or “Dream House as Comedy of Errors” – speaks to Machado’s desperate efforts to fit her experiences into a pre-existing narrative. At one point, in a section entitled “Dream House as Sanctuary”, she locks herself in the bathroom to escape her girlfriend’s rampage. “I remember sitting with my back against the wall,” she writes, “pleading with the universe that she wouldn’t have the tools or know-how to take the doorknob out of the door.” Meanwhile, the girlfriend batters the door, which rocks on its hinges “with every blow”. It’s a contention of Machado’s that abuse within same sex relationships is homophobic in the same way that heterosexual abuse is fuelled by sexism.It is one of the aims of In the Dream House to fill what Machado calls the “archival silence” around these thoughts by assembling a “rough, working attempt at a canon” of “queer domestic abuse and sexual assault”. This includes anecdotal and academic references to poems, essays, memoirs, such as Jane Eaton Hamilton’s powerful essay “Never Say I Didn’t Bring You Flowers”, Melissa Febos’s essay “Abandon Me”, and the poems of Leah Horlick, as well as legal precedents that exemplify the reluctance of the courts to recognise and prosecute domestic violence within same sex partnerships.One result of this silence, she says, is that it may be that perpetrators such as her ex-girlfriend fail even to recognise what they’re doing as abusive. “I think about that a lot, and I go back to this question of did my ex-girlfriend realise what she was doing? Was she aware of it? I have no answer to that, and I have to be comfortable with having no answer. It doesn’t matter in the sense that the outcome is the same.” Neither does she wish to focus on why her ex-girlfriend behaved the way she did. A person who does that “is in pain of course they’re in pain. Again: does it matter? It’s an interesting question but not one I can begin to psychoanalyse. I’m not her doctor.”Machado focuses, instead, on the task of identifying and articulating emotional damage, which isn’t for the most part even illegal. To her shame, she says, she went through a phase of the relationship when she hoped that she had external bruises to prove that what was happening was real. “I wished that I had a police report, or a black eye. And I recognise that that’s really fucked up but also there’s something about having clarity that feels intoxicating and that I think I wanted and continue to want. And I don’t know what to do with that.”The platonic ideal of victimhood, I suggest, is used across the spectrum to undermine women’s credibility and turn the blame back on them, so it’s not as if bruises would necessarily have clarified things. “So maybe it’s really about the fact that we don’t have the tools to deal with anybody’s trauma the fact that we all think, well, if one thing was different, people would take me seriously or believe me. And the fact is that nobody would believe you.”For a long time, Machado didn’t even believe herself. When, in the book, she is told by a doctor that she needs to lose weight, she misses “the punchline entirely”, she writes, which is that “the weight you need to lose is 105 pounds and sitting in the waiting room with an annoyed expression on her face.” She is increasingly miserable. Her writing breaks down into smaller and smaller fragments, an unconscious reflection of her shattered equilibrium. Machado had good friends who grew concerned for her welfare and a loving family – her father, the son of a Cuban immigrant, is a chemical engineer and her mother a homemaker. But still she couldn’t walk away. (Hers isn’t an entirely tolerant family – a relative once said to her: “I don’t believe in gay people,” to which she retorted: “Well, we believe in you,” something she now finds funny. “I mean she’s just the worst, but also, like, you know, it’s funny. You don’t believe in us? That doesn’t make any sense. You’re not even saying I don’t think it’s OK or all right. You don’t believe in us – that act of denial in existence. It’s interesting.”)In the end, Machado was emboldened to leave thanks to the support of friends and the creeping feeling that her girlfriend was seriously unstable. The sobering thing, she says, is that while writing the book she would occasionally catch sight of herself through the lens of her ex’s perspective. “Vestigial trauma,” she calls it. “Places where I could catch myself thinking in a way that I could tell she was shaping, from the past. Which was really disturbing.”The internalisation of the abuser’s voice can be the worst aspect of an abusive relationship and one that Machado still finds “pretty uncomfortable. It was weird and it remains weird. Healing doesn’t mean undoing things that happened. That’s very painful, and very sad, and the more I think about it, the sadder I feel. But also I’m like, well, you go through life, things happen to you. That’s the human experience.”Can you see yourself as she saw you?“Totally, totally. And also the sense of the book as an act of returning to this old version of myself. I can go up to the old Carmen, but I can’t interact with her to say it’s going to be OK. So there’s this act of trying to access the past and an old way of thinking that doesn’t exist any more.”Machado’s book of short stories, Her Body and Other Parties, was almost impossible to categorise – part gothic horror, part fantasy, part science fiction. It was dark and daring, and fun in a wild sort of way. By contrast, writing In the Dream House felt to her highly restricting. “Fiction, to me, feels like play. Non-fiction is you trying to figure out what you think – to put meaning to things that happened to you, which is really hard. When someone says to you I have an immediately formed opinion about a thing I just heard about, I don’t trust that at all.” It takes her about three years to come up with a solid opinion, she says, to “meditate and contemplate. I write non-fiction so slowly, one essay a year, and I’m really meticulous about it.”Returning to fiction, she says – “to write funny sentences and just create” – has been, perversely, one of the oddest joys of writing the memoir, a reminder of the satisfaction of controlling one’s narrative, and the power of moving on. “I feel so light!”• In the Dream House is published by Serpent’s Tail."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4f087cb4ad2d8e707157690b0704aad31d09a89/0_168_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6fe6016e36fd12397063e2f5eb97f0d","title":"boeing dennis muilenburg 60m stock pension","story":"Boeing’s chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, ousted amid the worst crisis in the company’s history, will depart with stock and pension awards worth more than $60m, the company announced on Friday.Muilenberg, 56, will forfeit stock worth $14.6m, according to Boeing, but is contractually entitled to receive $62.2m in stock and pension awards.“We thank Dennis for his nearly 35 years of service to the Boeing Company,” the company said in a statement. “Upon his departure, Dennis received the benefits to which he was contractually entitled and he did not receive any severance pay or a 2019 annual bonus.”Muilenberg presided over Boeing as two of its top-selling 737 Max jets crashed, killing 346 people. The disasters led to a global grounding for the jet and criticism of the company’s cosy relationship with its regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration.On Thursday Boeing released emails to a congressional committee investigating the tragedies in which its own executives mocked the regulator, joked about safety and said the Max had been “designed by clowns”.Muilenberg was appointed chief executive officer of Boeing in July 2015. He started working as an intern at the company in 1985.The 737 Max, the latest iteration of its popular passenger jet, was Boeing’s bestselling plane ever until two fatal crashes led to its grounding. In October 2018 a Lion Air jet crashed in Indonesia killing all its passengers. In March 2019 another Max crashed in Ethiopia killing everyone onboard.The company is now being investigated by regulators across the world and sued by the relatives of passengers.In congressional testimony last October Muilenberg told lawmakers: “If we knew everything back then that we know now, we would have made a different decision.” He said Boeing officials had asked themselves “over and over” again why they didn’t ground the plane sooner.But evidence has since emerged that Boeing and the FAA were aware of potential problems with the anti-stall software Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) installed on the Max that has been blamed for both crashes.Those issues were ignored even after the Lion Air disaster as the FAA gave Boeing breathing space to address a problem that the regulator predicted could lead to one fatal crash about every two or three years without intervention."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f8e952eb5a8d41f0d50a5c8acc610ce9c3e8c3e/0_382_5724_3434/master/5724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e867b30d6100c176968e8a07863a46c","title":"chinese tycoon cheung chung kiu agrees buy london hyde park mansion record fee","story":"Cheung Chung-kiu in process of buying 45-room property overlooking Hyde ParkA Chinese property tycoon has agreed to buy a 45-room mansion overlooking Hyde Park in London for more than £200m, making it by far the most expensive house to be sold in the UK.Cheung Chung-kiu, who already owns the £1.15bn so-called “Cheesegrater” skyscraper in the City, is “in the process” of buying 2-8a Rutland Gate for between £205m and £210m.The seven-storey property was built as four grand family homes before being converted into one vast residence in the 1980s. The previous owner had been Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdul-Aziz of Saudi Arabia who died in 2011. It has also been home to the billionaire businessman Rafic Hariri, who twice served as Lebanon’s prime minister.When the sale completes in the next few weeks it will officially become the UK’s most expensive home. The record is currently held by Park Place, a stately home near Henley-on-Thames, in Berkshire, which was bought in 2011 by the exiled Russian billionaire Andrey Borodin for £140m. Last year, the US hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin, bought a Grade II*-listed Georgian mansion within sight of Buckingham Palace for £95m.Cheung has yet to decide whether he will use the 62,000 sq ft mansion as his family home or ide it into a series of lateral apartments. If renovated and converted into apartments the property could be worth up to £700m, a spokesman said.“2-8a Rutland Gate is in the process of being acquired by funds advised by the family office of Mr Cheung Chung-kiu,” the spokesman said. “At present no decision has been made on whether the final scheme will be a single house for private client use, or an ultra-prime multi-unit apartment scheme.”The Knightsbridge house, which was built in the 1830s, features approximately 45 rooms including grand staterooms, 20 bedrooms, a swimming pool, private health spa and gym and underground parking for several cars. There are also “several passenger lifts” and a wing of staff rooms.The house is located just south of Kensington Gardens and 68 of its windows have a park view. The interiors were created by acclaimed French designer Alberto Pinto.The property has been vacant since the crown prince died, and was put on the market for £300m. After three years on sale the entire contents of the property were auctioned off, from ornate chandeliers and jewel-encrusted bidets to curtains, doors and four 24-carat gold-plated waste paper bins.Cheung, from Chongqing in south-west China, is the founder and chairman of CC Land Holdings, a Hong Kong-listed company that owns property in China and the UK.CC Land bought the Leadenhall building in the City of London, London’s tallest tower, better known as the Cheesegrater, for £1.15bn in 2017. The company is also redeveloping the site of the former Whiteleys department store in Bayswater, west London.The sale of the Knightsbridge mansion, which has slightly more living space than the size of an American football pitch, was brokered by Gary Hersham, the founder of Beauchamp Estates, who declined to comment.

But the recession, and rising gas prices, led GM to mothball the brand. By 2008 GM was selling fewer than 4,000 a year and the brand was shuttered in 2010.The car became a pariah as the climate crisis took center stage. A 2010 Hummer H2 could manage just 10 miles per gallon of gas.GM’s chief executive, Mary Barra, has said she wants to pave the way for an “all-electric future” at the car company.

The most vulnerable people imaginable are lone refugee children.I’ve visited the camps in Greece and Calais, where I have met many children without families. Some are in refugee camps, but others live rough, in woods, on the streets or even on rubbish tips, with some support from NGOs. I can think of little more frightening than to be a child in a foreign country with no family, unable to speak the language, sleeping rough.We know that thousands of these children have simply disappeared. Others are threatened and abused, or worse. They are often fleeing war, and may have witnessed horrors, torture and the destruction of their communities. If they are not traumatised when they leave their homes, then they certainly are in the aftermath. When I have met them in the camps or in the streets, I have seen that for these children, trauma is almost a universal experience.A small proportion of these refugee children hope to come to the UK because this is the only safe country where they have family. They have a connection here – perhaps the only relations they have.As members of the EU, we are part of the Dublin regulation, which allows lone children within the EU to apply for legal family reunion with relatives elsewhere within the EU. So, for example, a Syrian orphan who arrives in Greece hoping to find an uncle in Birmingham has the right to apply to be reunited with him. But when we leave the EU, we will no longer be covered by the Dublin regulation.When Theresa May’s withdrawal bill was going through parliament, I brought an amendment in the Lords that received cross-party support in both houses. This obliged the government to negotiate that the terms of the Dublin regulation would continue after we left the EU. So when the latest withdrawal bill was published just before Christmas, it was a shock to see that the rights of refugee children to be reunited with their families here had been removed. There had been no mention of this in the Conservative manifesto.Boris Johnson’s withdrawal bill, which passed the Commons unamended on Thursday, leaves the children whose rights have been removed with no means of finding their family in the UK – other than using illegal traffickers or other dangerous routes.The Lords will be debating the withdrawal bill in the coming week and a half, and I will be bringing an amendment to return the original rights to some of the world’s most vulnerable children. Among my Conservative colleagues, I sense there is sympathy for the view that there is no moral justification for preventing family reunion. It seems the government is concerned that my amendment may pass the Lords.If this happens, then the bill will return to the Commons. Public support will be crucial if the Commons is to support the Lords amendment. Filling the mailbags and inboxes of MPs and peers will certainly help, but it’s a really urgent matter because the prime minister has set such a tight timetable.When I arrived in Britain as an unaccompanied refugee child fleeing the Nazis, I never thought I would end up in the Lords. But this country not only allowed me a life and gave me sanctuary, it also gave me opportunity. I certainly never imagined that 81 years later, in the same country that gave homes to 10,000 lone refugee children like me, I’d be fighting for just a few hundred to be allowed to find their families here.• Alf Dubs is a Labour peer and former MP• Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

To sweeten the deal there are substantial sums available to public services that have been stretched to breaking point. Sinn Féin and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) could not have refused this offer, as it would have triggered fresh elections. Neither party wanted another poll for fear of losing yet more support from voters tired of their desire to dominate their communities at the expense of almost anything else.If negotiations in the days to come were to collapse it would pose troubling questions about how much the main NI parties want self-government. With the Stormont assembly not operating, no new legislation has been passed. Civil servants have been reluctant to act. This has not stopped laws being imposed from Westminster. Last summer MPs used amendments to force Northern Ireland to allow same-sex marriage and liberalise restrictive abortion laws. Both were much-needed changes. But it would have been better for local politicians to have made and won the arguments on the ground and reformed the law themselves.Yet the ears of too many of Northern Ireland’s leaders have been so sensitively attuned to the bugle notes of sectarian strife that they cannot hear the clamour of contemporary life. It has taken outsiders – in this case the Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, and the Irish tanaiste, Simon Coveney – to deliver a plan that reflects the priorities of the people living in the region. They have understood that only good and responsive government can defuse the fury that lies behind the first Royal College-backed nursing strike in a century. Or diminish the despair engendered when Northern Ireland tops all the UK tables no one wants to: worst for suicides child poverty and economic inactivity. If this continues, it is hard to see how the current political structure – cast from the 1998 Good Friday agreement to guarantee participation for the unionist majority and nationalist minority – could last. To their credit, London and Dublin have identified problems, come up with workable solutions and coughed up the money. The two capitals have attempted to meet tricky demands, such as those surrounding the Irish language. It helps that the DUP has after December’s election lost the influence it had – or thought it had – over the Conservative party. In doing what the Stormont assembly is supposed to do, the two capitals offer a way to move forward. This requires local politics to change too. After decades of paramilitary violence, the people of Northern Ireland welcomed devolution. However, and with good reason, they appear to be turning against the idea that power sharing is about power being shared out just along narrow community lines. They are aghast at the lack of accountability and transparency in politics.People’s eyes were opened by the “cash-for-ash” scandal that brought down the last assembly. NI ministers acted as if they could spend Treasury cash – to the tune of £490m – with no consequences. Such chicanery was enabled by NI parties willing to go into coalition as long as they looked after their own. This has to end. Parties need a shared vision of where the region is going and the compromises required. In the last three years businesses, trade unions and charities have been essential in motivating opinion on public policy issues. That genie cannot be put back into the bottle. What needs encouraging is the development of a society which is more tolerant and a politics that is genuinely pluralist. The assembly is supposed to have a role in managing the Irish border after Brexit. To do this and much more will need Northern Ireland’s democracy to shape up in a short space of time. One can only hope it can do so."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce75fca1d4f8b22d2a7288d72e30eaab4ef16d4e/0_1798_3358_2013/master/3358.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14f61632992f9b2e602d1313b3d01fbb","title":"south africas garden route discover the most scenic spots","story":"From barnacle-encrusted whales to sweeps of blooming fynbos, the south-eastern coast of South Africa offers the ultimate picturesque road tripSouth Africa’s Garden Route is almost obscenely good-looking. The meandering drive – stretching more than 120 miles from Mossel Bay in the west, to Storms River in the east – takes in dappled forests, still lakes and surf-pummeled beaches. It’s best explored on four wheels, but be sure to take your time. British Airways flies direct to Cape Town, where you can pick up an Avis hire car, belt up and settle into a truly picturesque ride.Humpback whales can often be spotted breaching clear out of the water at Hermanus, just a 90-minute drive from Cape Town. You can even spot whales lolling metres from the shoreline – keep your ears primed for the huff of a humpback whale exhaling right by your feet. The town hosts an annual whale festival each September – when huge southern right whales pass by in large numbers – and there’s even a whale crier, who alerts crowds to the presence of the animals by blowing on a kelp horn. July to October is a great time to see pods of migrating mothers with their calves and, if you’re feeling languid, the Marine Hotel is perfectly situated on a clifftop overlooking the ocean, so you’ll be able to spot barnacle-clad beasts from your balcony.A 40-minute trundle down the road, you’ll find Gansbaai. Known by locals as the Serengeti of the sea, the waters here are bristling with sea creatures, including the marine big five: whales, dolphins, seals, penguins and sharks. The latter can be seen in their menacing masses in Shark Alley – a sliver of ocean that roils with cape fur seals, the great white’s favourite prey.It’s a four-hour journey from Gansbaai to Oudtshoorn, but you’ll have plenty of screensaver scenery to gawp at along the way, including the craggy Tradouw mountain pass and the twisty-turny Huisrivier pass, which clings to the side of a mountain where cape leopards still roam. As well as the Cango Caves – an impressive prehistoric limestone system, dripping with troll-like rock formations, stalagmites and stalactites – Oudtshoorn boasts the largest number of ostriches in the world, with many of the farms offering tractor rides or walks out in the fields with the colossal birds.Head almost due south towards the coast and you’ll soon reach Knysna – a charming holiday town right at the heart of the Garden Route. Here, you’ll find a vast aquamarine lagoon spilling out into the ocean from between two huge sandstone headlands, helpfully known as the Heads. Hike through the lush forest – thought of as the lungs of this beautiful town – or take a trip out on to the water where you can fish, kayak, water ski and swim.A half-hour drive east is Plettenberg Bay. Home to the rocky Robberg Nature Reserve – where you can snorkel with rambunctious seals – a satisfyingly sandy central beach and the Nelson Bay caves, which date back to the stone age. This is also a great place to take part in a township tour (run by Ocean Blue Adventures). Meet up with a local from the Qolweni community and join them on a visit to the township’s Siyakhula crèche, the central shebeen and other lively spots, meeting some of the friendly locals and learning about the township’s rich history along the way. Come evening, stay at the remarkable Tsala Treetop Lodge just out of town – a collection of elegant elevated hideaways decked out in Afro-baroque style and hidden among the canopy of the ancient indigenous forest.Locals like to call Tsitsikamma, just north of Storms River – “the garden of the Garden Route”. An old Khoisan word, Tsitsikamma means “place of much water”, and whether it’s the yawning river valleys, the flinty ocean or the dew-daubed forest that clings to the mountains, this place is most certainly lush. Don your hiking boots for a lung-cleansing hike around this beautiful landscape, then make your final drive to Storms River, where – if the mood strikes – you can mark the end of your epic road trip by hurling yourself off the Bloukrans Bridge – the world’s highest bridge to bungee off.How to bookWith direct flights from London to Cape Town, British Airways Holidays can help make your South Africa fly-drive unforgettable.

But with custard or cream? Should other fruit get a look-in? And is dessert wine gilding the lily?And so here we are, in January, a month as bleak as an interpretative dance production of Threads (musical arrangement, Thom Yorke). You may eke out the stragglers from the Christmas snack stash to console yourself: the sorry Oreos, the orange Matchmakers, the who-bought-these pistachios?, but this is your life now. Work and winter. In Britain. In 2020. Doesn’t feel great, does it?Which is why, this month, How to Eat – part regular series on how best to enjoy Britain’s favourite foods, part humanitarian outreach programme – is focusing on that most comforting of desserts, apple crumble. Superlative self-care in sweetened fruit and nubbly, buttery topping, the crumble is, for all its seeming inviolability in the Bunterish pantheon of great British puds, a surprisingly new addition to the calorific canon. It may even be an American import of sorts (where it is known as apple crisp), given the earliest print recipes for the crisp-slash-crumble are both found in US cookbooks, in 1924 or 1950, depending on who you Google.Those make-do-and-mend origins may explain why, by the 1980s, people were swapping the crumble for cornflakes. An idea almost as bad as contemporary attempts to give the crumble a luxe edge by (kill me!) adding nuts, chocolate, coconut or crushed biscuits to the topping. A few oats – this is not muesli! – may, like a pinch of salt or playing with different ratios of various sugars, add depth to the crumble mix. But, fundamentally, the essence of this favourite of everyone from Luciano Pavarotti to Mark Gatiss, is how simply it pivots around two or three flavours. Crumble, as How to Eat (HTE) will now outline, should not be complicated.You would think in an apple crumble (tip: the clue’s in the name), the fruit would be uncontroversial. It’s apples, right? Judiciously sweetened but still-tart cooking apples (eg bramley), with a third of the total softened in a little reduced apple juice and spices before baking to give the filling a fluffy, almost pureed edge around the larger pieces of fruit. Simple. This is no place for sweet golden delicious, pink ladies and gala eating apples. Such varieties are an unpredictable nightmare when cooking. Some disintegrate readily, others retain a firm shape entirely unsuitable in a crumble.However, home-cooks and anxious chefs, trying too hard to justify their wages, frequently find it impossible to stick to just apples. Blackberries are added, pears, fibrous XXXL rhubarb, raspberries, irretrievably-sour gooseberries. You name it. Someone will throw it in. None of this adds pizzazz. Or maverick new dimensions of flavour. Instead, it invariably creates a muddled meh of fruity confusion where you should be experiencing in pure apply joy.The worst “twist”, an unforgivable act in fact, is to add raisins to your crumble. In hot food, raisins are an abomination.The unnecessary prettification (prissy-fication?) of food, over-elaborate presentation andor a neurotic desire to erase any hint of mess or evidence of human fallibility from the plate, is a subject that deserves a PhD’s worth of analysis. Suffice to say, in apple crumble, as in so many things in life, form should follow function … and flavour. Attempts to “style” a crumble are a recipe for disaster.Inidual apple crumbles served in ovenproof pots or tiny ramekin dishes are mistaken on several levels. First, the unpierced crumble will maintain a dangerous temperature far longer than you would ideally want and, second, where do you put the sauce? In a jug? In another bowl? Why do I have to eat some crumble first before I can pour it in?Even worse, as any chef worth their salt will tell you, are those for-elegant-read-idiotic experiments in deconstructing the apple crumble into its inidual components. The crumble’s very appeal lies in its elements melding together as they bake.It should then be served in such a way that, and preferably in one smooth action, you can scoop up a little sauce, crumble and fruit at the same time. To that end, the only way crumble should ever be presented – aesthetically, think: 1950s farmhouse kitchen – is in great steaming clods in wide, shallow bowls that allow easy access from all angles. Such a rough-and-ready approach embodies the homely vibe you should be looking to convey. Serving your crumble topping-up is preferable, but crumble that in the portioning-out has collapsed on its side is acceptable. Note: clumsily serving it upside down, with the topping at the bottom of the bowl, is taking this aversion to cheffy presentation too far. It smacks of inverted snobbery. Having to dig the crumble out is no fun. It is the best bit.A large dollop of whipped double cream is by far the best accompaniment. You don’t want a sauce that will overwhelm the crumble. You want the crumble topping to stay crispy, not soggy, and in terms of flavour, you want an emollient edge, a lubricating lick of something rich and cooling … yet, ultimately, innocuous. The power dynamic here is not Ant and Dec, Starsky and Hutch, Fabio and Grooverider. The crumble and sauce are not equals. The sauce should never attempt to assert itself as the dominant partner.Some will agitate for clotted cream over whipped, here. Ignore them. Be honest, clotted cream tastes nauseatingly “off” and has all the dense textural allure of toothpaste. It is hideous stuff.As for ice-cream, there is something unappetisingly jarring in that contrast between piping hot crumble and freezing ice-cream. The overt grittiness of the last crumble as it sits in melted ice-cream is, moreover, a poor way to end your crumble experience.Pouring cream suffers from the same issue in the last few mouthfuls. But will you get that far? Single or even double cream can feel oddly “thin” lapping against a robustly muscular apple crumble, while at the same time (unlike whipped cream, which has a lighter, airier profile), use too much of it and its intensely creamy flavour can smother the crumble its nuances lost in that creamy quagmire. Paradoxically, pouring cream is too thin texturally and too much in its flavour.Custard strikes HTE as a bizarre go-to in this context (and in many others). A gently cooling sauce is preferable to one that will seal heat into your pudding. No one wants to wait even longer for their crumble to cool to a safe temperature and, in custard’s case, the sauce will begin to form an unedifying skin as you do. That is even before we get to custard’s cloying and often thickly oily texture, not to mention its unpredictable quality.Like Fray Bentos pies and Heinz tomato soup, any nostalgia you might have for Bird’s custard peters out after a few mouthfuls. It is all a bit vapid. At the other end of the spectrum, when was the last time you ate a posh pouring custard that was smooth as silk and redolent with flavours of fresh yolks and real vanilla? Moons ago, HTE would wager. Is that even desirable? The custard is supposed to be a supporting actor in this heartwarming Sunday-night drama. A brilliant custard will, like cream, shout down the cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, dark sugar and fruit flavours that give a crumble its heady charisma.Except in an emergency (financial, failed gas supply, abduction by kidnappers demanding crumble in 10 minutes etc.), avoid using the microwave to reheat or, worse, “bake” a crumble. If not exposed to the oven’s radiant heat, your crumble topping will not crisp properly and microwaves are notorious for heating high-water content foods, such as fruit, to extraordinary temperatures that deaden flavour. They do so patchily, too. Microwaved food can range from lethally hot to lukewarm, mouthful-by-mouthful.Nothing. You don’t need it. Any crumble will be wolfed in minutes. Dehydration is not an issue. Plus, there a several problematic things going on here – tartness, cream, high sugar content – which make it incredibly difficult to pair crumble with drinks, from tea to best bitter, water to cola. A sommelier would point you to dessert wines, but, let’s be real, most stickies suck. You might drink a sweet wine out of curiosity, you might even find it “interesting” (code for: “I’m supposed to like this, actually it’s awful”), but will it become a regular tipple? No. Dessert wine is a lot of expense for little pleasure.So, apple crumble, how do you eat yours?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e28cb0e04ca74c703fa22c26c2d1f9ccb9a8e3a0/787_751_2698_1619/master/2698.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c52505cda6f597bbd40730ea5e2c72ba","title":"most realistic plant based steak revealed","story":"Vegan alternatives to meat are popular but recreating the texture of steak is challengingThe “most realistic” plant-based steak to date has been revealed, mimicking the texture and appearance of a real cut of meat.The fake steak’s ingredients include pea, seaweed and beetroot juice, which are extruded into fine fibres to recreate muscle tissue. Its producer, the Spanish company Novameat, says the steak will be available in some restaurants in Spain and Italy this year before scaling up in 2021.The enormous impact of cattle and other livestock on the environment has led a swathe of companies to create plant-based alternatives to meat, with the Beyond Meat burger and Greggs sausage roll among the vegan successes. But recreating the texture of whole cuts of meat is far more challenging than ground meat.“I started with steak I think because it is the holy grail of plant-based meat,” said Giuseppe Scionti, founder of Novameat. “It is the most difficult.” The company unveiled a 3D-printed steak in 2018, but the new steak has both the firm, fibrous texture and meaty appearance of a real steak, he said, making it the “most realistic” to date.The company is still experimenting with the taste, but Scionti said the company’ can use the ingredients already used to create convincing beefy burgers from plants. He expects a final formulation in the next few months.The key to the new steak is patented micro-extrusion technology that produces fibres between 100 and 500 microns in diameter. This allows the complex structure of real meat to be replicated, with muscle fibres and fat entwined. Existing extrusion technology produces much larger fibres.The 50g steak produced cost $1.50 (£1.15) to make, similar in price to current supermarket steak in the UK. But Scionti said the cost will drop when the process is scaled up. The company plans to commission a pilot plant in 2021 which can produce 50kg of steak per hour. But to reach a mass market, the company plans to licence its technology to existing food manufacturers who can develop their own recipes.Some plant-based alternatives to meat have been criticised for being as high in fat and salt as the food they are intended to replace. Scionti said plant-based alternatives do not contain cholesterol or the hormones and antibiotics often found in real meat. In future, he said, beneficial ingredients such as omega-3 fatty acids could be added.Novameat is not alone in developing plant-based steaks, with Israel-based Redefine Meat being a leading competitor. Unlike Novameat’s product, the Israeli company’s meat has been publicly tasted, receiving positive feedback, but the firm has not yet revealed a textured steak.Others include Atlast Food, which is using a fungus fibres to create textures similar to meat, and Emergy Foods. Another Israeli company, Aleph Farms, has produced a steak from real beef cells cultured in a laboratory, which, the firm says, will have a much lower environmental footprint than real meat.There is definitely a role for technology that can structure both plant-based and lab-grown meat into more complex products, said Rosie Wardle, at the Jeremy Coller foundation and advisor for CPT Capital, which has invested in Redfine Meat. “I’ve eaten early versions of the Redefine products and they were truly delicious,” she said.Novameat has attracted investment from New Crop Capital, a firm that also invests in some of the best known plant-based and lab-grown meat companies, including Beyond Meat, Memphis Meat and Mosa Meat.David Welch, at the Good Food Institute, which works with scientists and entrepreneurs to create alternatives to animal products, said: “To meet the growing global demand for meat with more sustainable plant-based products, we need to deliver the taste, texture, and appearance that meat eaters want.”He said new technologies such as Novameat’s bioprinting are useful: “They give plant-based meat manufacturers a wider array of tools to mimic all types of meat and seafood.” Scionti said the company aims to produce pork and salmon in the future.Recent scientific studies have found that huge reduction in meat-eating in rich nations is essential to cut greenhouse gas emissions and fight the climate crisis.“We believe it is important to provide an alternative,” said Scionti, who spent a decade researching tissue engineering at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia in Barcelona and other institutions. “This will help in the long term to decrease the need for land, water, energy and, of course, reduce the emissions coming from animal agriculture.“We want to be better than the other companies,” he said. “But we are all in the same boat. We want to be remembered for doing something good at this moment when the planet needs alternatives to meat. ”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1973026fb6df13c8e3f92fa150520b4154009a94/0_104_4738_2843/master/4738.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e69d3b568417d8cc7d73aec2cfbe8a13","title":"waste stale biscuits refrigerator cake recipe tom hunt","story":"Stale biscuits are ideal in no-bake cake bases, crumble toppings or this ingenious fridge cakeI find nothing more comforting than a hot cup of tea and a biscuit. But at the same time, there are few things more discomforting than the soft texture of a stale biscuit. But worry not: biscuits, like crisps, can be revitalised and made crunchy again by blasting them in a hot oven.And if you don’t want to breathe life back into the biscuits via an energy-thirsty oven, you can still upcycle them in a number of easy ways. My go-to rescue recipe is particularly energy-efficient: a good refrigerator cake, spiked with booze, is exceptionally scrumptious and keeps for weeks, if not months. Or use stale biscuits as a cheesecake base (mix 100g leftover crushed biscuits with 70g melted butter, and press into a tart case), as a crumble topping (crush the biscuits, mix with chopped nuts and sprinkle over stewed fruit), or simply crush them over ice-cream.To prolong your biscuits’ life, always keep them in an airtight container, or freeze them if you need to keep them fresh for longer than a few days.The secret to a good refrigerator cake is to get creative by experimenting with different ingredients. I’ve topped these cakes with all sorts of things in the past: pink peppercorns, dried flowers, sweetened croutons, etc, so go as wild as you dare. Try anything you can think of. Puffed rice and other grains such as puffed millet or popcorn work especially well, and look great, too, when caught in the cross-section of a slab of cake.100g dark chocolate100g salted butter4 tbsp honey or maple syrup1 tbsp whisky or other spirits260g stale biscuits, puffed grains, dried fruits, nuts, seeds, etc.Chop the chocolate into small pieces and put in a bowl with the butter, honey or maple syrup and whisky.

Several other clubs are interested, including Paris St-Germain, and Eriksen will meet his agent in the next few days to discuss the offer.Eriksen said last summer that he was ready for a new challenge, telling media in Denmark: “I feel that I am at a stage of my career where I would like to try something new. I have the deepest respect for everything that is happening at Tottenham and it would not be something negative to stay. But I have also said that I would like to try something new.”Tottenham, however, have lost Harry Kane to injury and their manager, José Mourinho, is short of options up front.

The fact the Hammers continue to pursue a return for Darren Randolph despite the Republic of Ireland international being injured perhaps emphasised Moyes knew the extent of those problems already, but either way, they were brutally laid out for him here.Of course that was not the whole story on a dramatic night at Bramall Lane. It seems no Premier League game of significance is complete without a cameo from VAR these days – the fact that this intervention came deep into added time to deny West Ham an equaliser Moyes felt they deserved will have done little to appease him following the end of his unbeaten start in charge.When Robert Snodgrass seemingly scored in injury time, it sparked chaotic scenes among both the away supporters, while Moyes raced down the touchline to celebrate what seemed to be another important point for his new side. However, with the much-maligned handball law enforced by VAR after determining Declan Rice had handled in the build-up, the goal was disallowed. Naturally, Moyes was unhappy afterwards.“It was a good goal to me,” he said. “It looks like a law nobody is enjoying too much, but it looks like there’s a few laws nobody is enjoying too much.” But this was a night with other problems away from VAR too. Lukasz Fabianski suffering a recurrence of the injury which had kept him out for three months – again while taking a goal kick – would have been bad enough.However the fact that his replacement, and the man who is now their only fit senior goalkeeper, gift-wrapped Sheffield United the winner here will have been doubly hard to take. David Martin’s rushed pass was intended for Fabián Balbuena instead, it found its way to John Fleck who kept his nerve, squared for Oli McBurnie and allowed the Blades to move up to fifth with the game’s only goal.“It’s the biggest three points of the season,” said Chris Wilder, who on the day of agreeing a contract extension to 2024, admitted he had sympathy for his opposite number. “To get to 32 points at this stage is great but I feel a bit deflated because that’s happened to us two or three times this season. What their manager has felt, I’ve felt.” All that second-half drama, culminating in Snodgrass’s disallowed equaliser, thankfully overshadowed a fairly forgettable first half.There were few gilt-edged opportunities for either side in the opening 45 minutes, with the best falling to Felipe Anderson, who fired wide after sneaking through on goal. Moyes had opted to match the home side up tactically and while it certainly produced some resilience, it ultimately offered little going forward.Fabianski’s departure – “It looks like a recurrence of the same injury, we’ll have to get the tests done over the weekend,” Moyes said – was the one real talking point: and it turned out to be decisive. When Martin’s sloppy pass led to McBurnie’s fourth of the season, it forced the visitors into a tactical change. Snodgrass came on, West Ham reverted to a back four and with his first touch, his free-kick saw Sébastien Haller score – only to be disallowed by the offside flag. At the other end, Wilder’s side had chances to kill the game, and their profligacy in that regard looked as though it would hurt them deep into injury time.Rice surged forward, played in Snodgrass and he drove past Dean Henderson. That sparked delirium in the away end but of course, there was one final act to be written by Stockley Park. Moyes had barely stopped celebrating by the time VAR concluded that John Egan heading the ball into Rice’s arm constituted handball, which in turn produced the loudest cheer of the night for home supporters.The night began with West Ham supporters taunting the home side with Carlos Tevez chants, owing to the infamous chapter of history between the clubs over a decade ago. As the home fans rounded off the night with renditions of “VAR, VAR” in reply, you suspected that while those deep wounds from the Tevez saga have not fully healed, this frenetic night under the lights will certainly have helped."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dac2197fc3b007af7d7cb7b5bca1cb721e19bc2a/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b2dc3efca80f3be8175586adfc51738","title":"blind date maria jacob","story":"What were you hoping for?A fun evening and a very nice meal.

She tells me she’s had a text from our neighbour.“Apparently our car is sitting in the street with all its windows open,” she says.I look at my phone. It’s not actually that early.“That can’t be good,” I say.I switch on a light and snatch some clothes off the floor. Once downstairs, I pull my boots over bare feet and step out into the bleak silence of a winter dawn, ignoring for the moment the fact that my phone says it’s 9.10. From the front door I can see our car parked a short distance down the street, with all four windows gone. As I approach it, I expect to see pebbled glass spread across the seats, but there is none.

The interior of the car is not just undamaged, but completely undisturbed. Everything is exactly as disordered as ever, like a painstaking reconstruction. I turn the key. The car starts. I hit four buttons at once, and the four windows rise together.“That was weird,” I say to my wife when I get back inside. “You must have just left all the windows down yesterday.”“Why would I do that?” she says.“That is a question you must ask yourself,” I say.“I’m not that mad,” she says. “Not yet.”“Unless,” I say.“Did the bin men take the green waste?” she says.“I didn’t look,” I say.Later that morning, my wife goes to the supermarket, ringing the doorbell on her return. I find her with five bags of shopping on the front step.“Is there anything else in the car?” I say.“No,” she says, handing me two bags. “This is it.”“Did you remember to leave all four windows rolled down?” I say.“Shut up,” she says, walking ahead of me into the kitchen. “They didn’t take the green waste again. It might be because I put potato peelings in it.”“Why would you even do that?” I say.“It could be green waste,” she says. “They don’t know I’m not growing potatoes.”“What’s this?” I say, holding up a strange bottle.“Non-alcoholic gin,” she says. “For Dry January.”“We don’t drink gin when we drink,” I say.“I know, but it’s meant to be good,” she says. “And it costs more than gin.”“Stupid idea,” I say. “I might have one now, though.”“It’s 11,” she says.“It’s non-alcoholic,” I say. “I could have it for breakfast.” The previous day we’d spent the afternoon watching a box set, accidentally getting through six episodes on the trot. After lunch we make an attempt to polish off the rest of series one.As I sip my second fake gin, my mind begins to wander. I do not care for unresolved mystery.

We’re a democracy. I’d rather see us as citizens than as subjects in the 21st century. Let’s talk about what a modern state looks like and what the role of the royal family would be in that,” he said.The bulk of Lewis’s speech was a call for a radical rethink of Labour’s role and approach following its latest election defeat, which he said showed the party “needs to modernise, or it will die”.Lewis currently has only four of the required 22 nominations from Labour MPs to reach the next stage of the process to replace Jeremy Corbyn, the fewest among any of the six candidates. The deadline for nominations is Monday.But asked whether his best hope was another leader adopting some of his ideas, Lewis insisted he was hopeful of progressing, and called for some of the undecided MPs to lend him support to ensure a better mix of ideas in the race.Without criticising any candidates by name, Lewis warned that frontrunners such as Keir Starmer and Rebecca Long-Bailey would struggle to put in place the necessary radical changes to transform a party which, he noted, had only won eight of the 28 elections over the last century.“Do I believe that any of the candidates who are standing are so scintillatingly brilliant that they, on their own, with the tweaking of a few policies, are going to be able to undo 100 years of what has already happened? I’m struggling with that concept,” he said.“People have seen a route map of how they’re going to win. They’ll need this particular section of the Labour electorate to get to the next stage, then this group here, which has this vested interest.“What you begin to do is you begin to build a cage for yourself, and once if you’ve won – yes, you’ve won, but you’re in that cage.”Lewis said Labour needed to become less centralised and more collaborative, warning that debate was being stifled by “sectarianism and tribalism”.“We must come out in favour of proportional representation – not only because it is the fairest way to elect a parliament, but also because it will put into practice our fundamental belief in the value of collaboration and cooperation,” he said.He also called for the Lords to be replaced with an elected second chamber. “How can the public have faith in politics when people like Zac Goldsmith can lose their seat in a democratic election one week, get put in the House of Lords the week after, and be back in cabinet?”Pointing to the long-term decline of traditional leftwing parties in places including France, Germany and Greece, Lewis said a new leader must address “some fundamental issues”, adding: “A few tweaks of policy here, or a slight change of leader there, aren’t going to bring the real change that this country urgently needs.”“We have to accept that democracy is in crisis, that we face a climate catastrophe, and epoch-defining possibilities and challenges from the tech revolution,” he said in the speech. “We can’t have more of the same. The Labour party needs to modernise, or it will die.”A commitment to electoral reform was “the litmus test of Labour’s survival”, Lewis said. “A winner-takes-all politics just doesn’t allow us to deal with the complexities of the world as it increasingly is.”Meanwhile, Starmer will promise on Saturday that his bid to win Labour’s leadership will be focused on defending radicalism, winning trust and becoming relevant.Ahead of the official launch of his campaign, he said: “We have to rebuild people’s trust in Labour as a force for good and real change. We have to take the fight to the Tories and make the case for how our values and ideas can deliver the change Britain so desperately needs.”Starmer will be introduced at his campaign launch by Doreen Lawrence at the Mechanics Institute in Manchester, the birthplace of the British Trade Union Congress.Before the launch, he said: “Labour wins when it glimpses the future. That must be our focus over the course of this campaign.“The challenge for Labour today is to defend our values, retain our radicalism, and to make that relevant to people’s everyday lives. People desperately need and want us to win.” According to the latest Labour figures, only Lewis and Emily Thornberry do not have the necessary level of support from MPs, with Thornberry having nine nominations.Starmer is out in front on 63, followed by Long Bailey with 26, Lisa Nandy with 24 and Jess Phillips on 22."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a3283f2241793bd3428054a9d05ddb646058324/219_573_567_340/master/567.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16eabf46b470411c30973e4c2cc6fc81","title":"sweat and the city londons best running routes","story":"Jog through the history, skyscrapers and wilder corners of the capital for the perfect combination of urban adventure and natural beautyThe beauty of leading a running community like Fly Girl Collective is the chance to turn London into our playground – whether we’re sprinting around picturesque gardens south of the river, or ambling happily past a buzzy cafe in the east before returning later for brunch. We always discover somewhere new, because if there’s anything Londoners can bank on in this mighty city, it’s plenty of wonderful places and trails to run – all offering an assortment of terrain, from knobbly hills to the smoothest footpaths.Ready? Get set, go ...Richmond ParkThe chance to watch deer roaming free is the usual draw of Richmond Park – a certified national nature reserve. Covering almost 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres), it is the largest royal park in London and feels like you’re stepping into a whole new world, especially if you hit the Tamsin Trail. At just over 7 miles (11 km), this well-trodden, gravelly path offers the kind of adventurous landscape that’ll convert even the most committed urban runner to the trail life. You get to enter the wild through woods and fields, and up a few moderate ascents.There are cafes and water fountains along the way if you’re using this as a long run and need a breather – or ert into the park’s woodland garden Isabella Plantation so you can stop and smell the flowers.South Bank and Victoria Embankment loopThis swift jaunt around the Thames reminds me why I call London home. I like to time a run early enough to avoid the tourists, who love the South Bank in particular. For a 5K loop, start at Blackfriars station, run south over the bridge, take a right on Upper Ground, then take another a quick right on to Marigold Alley. You’ll hit the riverside, so turn left to follow the Thames and you’ll get to tread along a flat path as you fly past Oxo Tower, the National Theatre and the surprisingly sandy beaches you can spot at low tide near the Royal Festival Hall. You’ll also catch the bright lights of the London Eye, before climbing the steps on to Westminster Bridge. Turn right under Big Ben so you are now going eastwards on the north bank of the Thames along Victoria Embankment. Stay on the riverside pavement, so you don’t have to stop to cross roads and you can enjoy the great views of the Thames and the City beyond. Check out Cleopatra’s Needle and – on the left – Somerset House, before crossing over the road at Temple station. Continue along the Embankment before finishing up at the peaceful Middle Temple Gardens.Hampstead HeathSimilar to Richmond Park, Hampstead Heath is a leafy, countryside-esque destination that offers escapism from the bustle of the city – but it’s especially my go-to when I’m in the mood to tackle some ruthless hills or to get a bit muddy on the heath’s countless trails. For an obstacle-filled adventure, I like to start from Hampstead Heath overground station, and venture into the heath from South End Road. Follow the path and you’ll soon spot Hampstead No 1 and No 2 ponds – in the summer, you might even be tempted to have a dip. Keep going until you see the path that runs between the No 2 pond and the mixed bathing pond the terrain will become wilder as you start to make the taxing ascent to Parliament Hill. Catch your breath as you take in an impressive view of the capital – you should be able to make out the Gherkin, the Shard and St Pauls Cathedral in the distance. I might do a few hill reps here, then seek out the stunning Hill Garden and Pergola, a hidden gem on the west side of the heath.Victoria ParkLike many runners in east London, I’m a massive fan of Victoria Park. From its vast fields and leafy avenues to the top-notch cafes and restored bandstand, Bonner Bridge, the Burdett Coutts fountain and new play areas, London’s oldest park is still going strong. The terrain’s also nice and flat, which makes knocking out a speedy run such a pleasure. Made up of two parts split by Grove Road, a full lap of the park covers just over 4km (2.7 miles) – but if you have more in your legs, slip on to the Hertford Union canal for eclectic scenes of street art and houseboats as you make your way towards the Lee Navigation. For another change of scenery, you can peel off towards the Olympic Park en route for a calisthenics gym and art installations commemorating the legacy of the 2012 Olympics.Tower Bridge to Islands Gardens via the Thames PathThe London leg of the Thames Path, a pleasant national trail that follows the river, is 79.5 miles (128km) that’s usually tackled in four sections either north or south of the water. Though the entire route is a beaut, the 5-mile (8km) passage from Tower Bridge to Island Gardens is particularly fascinating. The first time I ran along it, I was riveted by how it unveiled the capital’s Victorian past. You’ll head through St Katherine’s Dock and Wapping along cobbled lanes, fly past Execution Dock where pirates were once hung, and be tempted to swing by the Prospect of Whitby pub, once frequented by Charles Dickens. From here, you’ll soon notice how the capital has evolved as you make your way through Limehouse, the glass and steel of Canary Wharf and eventually Island Gardens, where the multi-surface path officially ends.Crystal Palace ParkThe ladies from the Fly Girl Collective ran their first ever race here, so it’ll always be remembered as “very, very hard” – but in a good way. The mixed, hilly terrain of this south-east London park is one of the reasons why it’s a big hit with trail-loving runners. It’s got everything – cheeky hills, grassy and stony paths, and muddy puddles after the rain. Another draw, of course, is the Grade I-listed Dinosaur Court – a quirky collection of more than 30 dinosaur sculptures that have resided in the park since 1854. To see them in all their glory, enter the park from Thicket Road entrance on the south side and do a half a mile (0.8km) loop around Lower Lake. Then, explore the rest of the park by taking the 2.5-mile (4km) circuit around its periphery, taking on some challenging hills, or seek out the infamous Crystal Palace Park maze for a fun ersion before heading back south past the athletic stadium, to swing by the park’s charming urban farm – the goats are particularly curious about passing runners.The Fresh Foam X Hierro v5 is designed to go the distance.

At first I thought it was a stellar eclipse, but the timing was wrong. It turned out to be a planet.”Cukier told CBS: “The planet blocked the light from those two stars, leading to a small dip in the amount of light that reached the telescope. That’s what I noticed at first.” “It was like, oh … there’s something here that was cool. But it’s also not like there’s a single moment of discovery,” Cukier said.Research on the newly discovered planet, known to astrophysicists as a circumbinary planet and now dubbed TOI 1338 b, was presented during the 235th American Astronomical Society meeting in Honolulu.A paper co-authored by Cukier along with established scientists has been submitted to a scientific journal, Nasa said.“TOI 1338 b’s transits are irregular, between every 93 and 95 days, and vary in depth and duration thanks to the orbital motion of its stars. Tess only sees the transits crossing the larger star – the transits of the smaller star are too faint to detect. Its orbit is stable for at least the next 10m years. The orbit’s angle to us, however, changes enough that the planet transit will cease after November 2023 and resume eight years later.”Cukier, a Star Wars fan, has said he hoped this is the beginning of a career in the field.“Our confidence went up and down a couple of times, but by the end of the internship, we were confident that what we found was a planet,” Cukier told ABC News about his and his team’s excited investigations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3520cb736ec32a1c385257e26bc6cca2f200a0c/0_159_2976_1785/master/2976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3bf328f1ff3f75d5ba106dd84efdc08","title":"joe denly england south africa big runs leg spin","story":"• The 33-year-old took his first Test wickets in Cape Town• No 3 batsmen insists big score is ‘just a matter of time’Could Joe Denly become a throwback who reminds us of Ken Barrington or Bob Barber? No, this is not to burden him with being the great Mr Reliable in the middle order like Barrington (who averaged 58 with the bat for England) or another Barber blasting boundaries at the start of the innings in the 1960s while Geoffrey Boycott took the more discreet route. Instead this is a reference to Denly, the bowler.There was once a tradition of English batsmen propelling leg-spin effectively enough to have an occasional impact on a Test match – especially overseas. Barrington took 29 wickets in his 82 Tests, Barber 42 in 28. Others were less successful Keith Fletcher would bowl a few wrist-spinners and mustered two Test wickets. More recently Mike Atherton, who took quite a few wickets for Lancashire in his early days, also finished with two in Test cricket, though initially there were hopes he would take many more. So can Denly be more of a Barrington or Barber than a Fletcher or Atherton in this department?Until the match in Cape Town there was little scope for optimism (though it is worthy of note that Denly takes his first-class wickets far more cheaply than Mason Crane, one of England’s recent specialist wrist-spinners).At Newlands Denly took two important wickets, those of Dean Elgar and Quinton de Kock, his first for England after 12 Tests.However, he recognises his primary role is to score runs and here he is progressing – slowly. Remarkably he has failed to reach double figures only three times in his 23 Test innings, but there have been only three scores in excess of 53 – and, so far, no hundreds.“Certainly, I’m becoming more confident with each game I play, each knock I have. It is frustrating that I haven’t kicked on to get that really big score but I really believe it is just a matter of time if I keep doing the things I’ve been doing, which is being solid up front and building partnerships to allow these guys in the middle order to come in and play the way they can play.”For the moment Denly, an engaging late developer at 33, is doing enough to justify his place in the side as a top-order batsman despite the shortage of really substantial scores he will be playing at Port Elizabeth on Thursday and is currently inked in to go to Sri Lanka. So there is scope for a few more bonus Test wickets along the way. South Africa have named an unchanged squad, meaning they miss their transformation target – six players of colour including two black Africans – for the third Test in a row."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adaf8a0b5723c7c3ae27e564c96dcea25899dbc8/639_246_5347_3209/master/5347.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63a320096db0da4b3aa5f601406f8891","title":"ellie simmonds swimming rio tokyo paralympics interview donald mcrae","story":"“A lot of the time, when I swim, I close my eyes because it is definitely lonely,” Ellie Simmonds says as she considers the emotional, physical and psychological demands she endures in the pool year after year. Simmonds has won eight medals, and five of them are gold, at three Paralympic Games but she should be praised most for her honesty in addressing the brutal rituals of swimming and the sometimes damaging environment of elite sport.She should be commended for the fact that, in a Paralympic and Olympic year, she stands up for herself and her teammates in an often isolating atmosphere that has pushed her to the brink of retirement and which, even now in this interview, can make her eyes fill with tears.Simmonds was born with achondroplasia, a genetic disorder that means she is only four feet tall, but her presence is striking as soon as we meet in north London. “Swimming takes so much out of you,” she says. “I’m up at half four in the morning and I try to be in bed by half nine. Those are not social hours and trying to be a normal 25‑year‑old is really tough. Your friends and family know you’re a professional swimmer, but they don’t always understand the demands. It’s not just about the two-hour sessions in the pool. It’s also about what you eat, your sleep, rest, recovery, physio. All of it is time-consuming.“I’m currently training nine times a week in the water and that’s excluding the gym work and yoga. On a typical Monday I swim from six until 8am. I go from there to the gym and do a session from nine until half 10. I get home about 11ish. Take a nap and have lunch. Swim from half three to half five. I get home at half six. Have dinner. Monday to Fridays I’m practically an athlete every hour of the day. I try and socialise a little on the weekends. Of course each training session in the pool changes. This morning it was threshold tests so it’s about working for a long time at high intensity. Last night was sprint-based.”The 2020 Paralympic Games begin in Tokyo on 25 August and so, less than eight months from competition, Simmonds summarises her typical day in cheerful detail. She is happy to work hard in pursuit of a sixth gold medal – but it is far more difficult when the training environment is sour. Simmonds stresses how content she is now, reunited with her old coach Billy Pye. But four years ago, before and then during the Rio Games, Simmonds hit her lowest point.“I didn’t enjoy Rio. My teammates were great but some of the staff made it a really negative place. It’s hard when you go to an environment and you don’t want to be there. That’s why I had a year out afterwards because I needed to get away from swimming.”Simmonds had already come close to quitting. “I spoke to my parents and my agent a year before Rio. I was like: ‘I don’t want to do this. I want to get away.’ They said: ‘Just grit your teeth for a year. Then you can have your break. And if you want to retire, you can retire then.’ I was in tears. I just hated it.”It says a lot about Simmonds that she still won gold and bronze in 2016. “That was just grim determination,” she says. “And the Paralympics is something else. Performing in front of a big crowd gives you that extra oomph.”Does the adversity preceding Rio make her gold medal in the 200m inidual medley feel more special? Simmonds shakes her head. “I don’t really remember much. I don’t watch my Rio races back. I’ll look at my London 2012 races a lot. But not Rio.”Simmonds is so upset she begins to cry. We stop the interview and, while we talk off the record, I understand how corrosive the atmosphere must have been. It is also understandable that Simmonds does not want to ulge details now, as her focus must be on Tokyo, but it is clear she will eventually speak on the record so no future Paralympic coaches will cause such distress to their athletes.After Simmonds composes herself, I ask if, as one of the senior figures in the last Paralympic cycle, she had been able to challenge her former coaches? “It’s hard. When you’re in a team you’ve got hierarchies – staff who put you down – and it is hard to have a voice. I’m lucky my teammates were so supportive. We were all in it together and we supported each other.”It sounds as if the Paralympians were bullied before 2016? “Oh, for sure. We were professional athletes. The youngest in our group was 17.”The atmosphere surrounding the GB Paralympic swimmers now seems positive and healthy and Simmonds lights up when talking about Pye as her coach again. She has also joined Team Speedo, alongside British swimmers including Siobhan-Marie O’Connor, Duncan Scott, Ollie Hynd and Freya Anderson, in an arrangement where there are training and sponsorship advantages.“Billy was a miner before he was a coach. He’s the happiest guy ever. He’s never grumpy because when he wakes up he doesn’t think coaching is his job. He loves it. Having that kind of person around makes you happy. I radiate that. If someone’s positive, it gets me happy and positive and I perform so much better.”Happiness is the new normal for Simmonds and on Monday she flew with the GB squad to Japan for three weeks. “We’re going to the same place where our holding camp will be before the Tokyo Games. It’s a chance to get used to the environment and the start of a really busy period as I’m racing in Italy in February. In March, there is a training camp in Lanzarote. April is trials for Tokyo. In May I’ve got the Europeans in Madeira.”Simmonds made her winning Paralympic debut at the age of 13 in Beijing. She has been swimming at this elite level ever since – apart from when she took a year-long break in 2017. She spent most of her time away travelling in South Africa, Australia, America and China. “I had been so used to my life being only about swimming. I was so ready to be free from that routine, and figure out what I wanted to do. Lots of people know me as Ellie Simmonds the swimmer. I was ready then, at 21, to figure out what else I was in life.“It was about my whole identity and it changed me hugely. Travelling gives you confidence and opens you up to the real world. When I was younger I would want the next designer bag. But when you travel and meet other people – especially some countries where they don’t have as much as you – it really makes you think. You don’t need the next iPhone.“Going into Rio, swimming for me had been life or death. If I didn’t swim well it was like the end of the world. The year off gave me perspective that swimming is just something I should love. If it doesn’t go right, it’s not the end of the world. When I came back I remember sitting with my agent and my parents and thinking: ‘Shall I retire? Or carry on?’ But I thought: ‘Let’s give it one more shot.’”Simmonds would like to become a teacher one day, after travelling much more, but will she retire after Tokyo? “I was thinking of retiring today actually,” she says with a smile. “But it changes all the time. Last week, when I was with the British team, I thought: ‘I love this. Why not do another four years after Tokyo? But then there are times when your friends are doing things and I’m like: ‘I want to get away but I can’t because of training.’”She is such a fierce competitor that Simmonds will be fully concentrated in the buildup to Tokyo. “For sure. It’s all about the mind and believing in yourself. I just want to go to Tokyo now. I’ve got to nail it in the trials because going to a fourth Games will be special. Then I’ll re-evaluate and set new goals for Tokyo.“People say: ‘Oh, you’ve got more experience.’ But it’s much harder now because you can overthink things. You can feel the pressure more. When you’re 13 or 17 you just go out there and race. But I want to truly focus on swimming, free from stress outside the pool. I am in a good position again. When training’s going really well, or I know I can achieve something, my self-belief is so high. And, when I believe I can do it, I know I’m unstoppable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65864d99e7dac3a5509d945f2e18a670de4eeeb9/0_80_4080_2449/master/4080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27b505032ff8e8428e4a19f820a52d51","title":"bryony frost determined to get off cold list frodon talking horses horse racing tips","story":"The first female rider to win a Grade One race at the Cheltenham Festival has found the going tougher this season but is back in the spotlight at Kempton on SaturdayIf there is a gene for positivity, Bryony Frost has it twice. “It’s a long way off if you look at the top of the mountain sometimes,” she said this week, on the road home from Catterick after finishing fourth and then last on her only rides. “It can be daunting hence why I never set any goals. But, if you make every step a forward one, going uphill and improving in some way or another in life, then you’re doing just fine and wherever you end up is where you end up. But try not to think about where you do end up. Just keep climbing that’s what I live by.”It is a philosophy that has served Frost well in the five years since riding her first winner, in a lowly hunter chase at Musselburgh in February 2015, but some of the forward steps, inevitably, are more significant than others.Victory in the Foxhunters’ Chase at the 2017 Cheltenham Festival prompted the switch from amateur to professional status. Within a year she had her first Grade One winner, at Kempton on Boxing Day, and in March 2019 her second, as Frodon’s heroic success in the Ryanair Chase made Frost the first female rider to win a Grade One at the Cheltenham Festival. She ended last season as the champion conditional, having ridden out her claim with her 75th winner in November 2018.But her zest for the jump jockey’s life remains undimmed and never more so than when a reunion with Frodon is in her immediate future. It is rare to find a horse and rider with such a visible connection and, while their first two outings this season have yet to yield a victory, the Grade Two Silviniaco Conti Chase at Kempton on Saturday offers an ideal platform to rediscover their winning habit with a return to Cheltenham now only two months away.“As a jockey our job is to better our horses’ careers,” Frost says. “Every time you go out, you have to think, what can I do better, how can I make it smoother, where can I find his rhythm, does he like his own space or to be in the crowd with the hustle and bustle?“It’s all about learning their map, and which is the best road to take to get you there as quick as possible. But when you start to develop a connection with your horse and learn his character and the way he likes to do things, and then you click, it’s a magic place to be when you’re out on that track.“But the races you win will probably be the ones with the least problems. It’s races when you finish third or fourth or mid- that are hard to ride, because you’re always racking your head and thinking, where could I have found him half a length and could I have cut the corner a bit more there.“When you win a race, you’re thinking, ‘Well, that was smooth, how cool was that?’, because everything’s gone right, and Cheltenham was like riding a wave. We cruised along, found a rhythm and never came out of it.”Friday was a rare afternoon off for Frost after trips to Exeter, Wincanton, Chepstow, Lingfield, Plumpton and then Catterick in the first few days of 2020. Rare, and not entirely welcome for a rider who lives for the heat of competition, although the inevitable injuries that are part of every jump jockey’s life have helped to adjust her outlook.“It’s taught me patience and to focus,” she says. “You dedicate your life to racing and your horses and analysing races for your horse so you can have the best chance possible. When you take that out of your life, you’re twiddling your thumbs and a bit lost and not sure quite where to go.“You have to dedicate your head to getting your body back, because that’s your career. It taught me how to try to swap my dedication on to myself. I took myself out of my own head and saw my body as my career, and took my emotion away from it all.”Even in the little spare time she has, Frost keeps climbing.“I do a bit of bouldering,” she says. “That’s good for your body and also, you’re only ever thinking about the next move. You can’t think about anything else, just climbing your wall.“But it’s not easy to switch off completely, because it’s what makes your heart beat and what you live for. When you get a hurdle or a fence right, it’s a mega-moment. You just don’t get moments like that in day-to-day life. I wouldn’t want to get up in the morning if I didn’t have a horse involved in my day.”This could be a big Saturday for the colours of JP McManus, which may come to the fore in both of the main betting races, notably Warwick’s Classic Chase. He is represented by the Tom Lacey-trained Kimberlite Candy (3.00), whose preparation echoes that of One For Arthur, the 2017 winner.Like that horse, Kimberlite Candy comes straight from a running-on effort in Aintree’s Becher Chase. With Lacey among the winners, this looks a good opportunity. Petite Power can also go well.1.50 Warwick There ought to be a decent pace on here, which would be a help to Highest Sun, who took a strong hold on his way to winning a two-horse race last time. His form, including third place behind Champ in November, makes him the most promising of these novices.2.05 Kempton Altior’s absence leaves a weak-looking contest seemingly at the mercy of his stablemate Top Notch. But Frodon is rated half a stone higher than that one and can give him a fright if leaving behind the disappointments of his season so far. He was up against it in a handicap in October and couldn’t go with two classy sorts in the closing stages of the Betfair Chase, so he is not short of excuses and perhaps we will see something better here.2.25 Warwick It could be a long way home on this soft ground for Decor Irlandais, a strong traveller who won tidily at Catterick last time. He might get outstayed by Keen On, whose Sandown defeat of Protektorat looks better than it did at the time.2.40 Kempton The first of the day’s two feature handicaps is the Lanzarote, in which McManus’s Notre Pari looks very handily treated. Trained by Olly Murphy, he showed steady improvement until winning tidily on his handicap debut at Aintree last month. It was not a strong race but he won it in the style of a horse with much more to offer. Tight Call is a potential improver at bigger odds.3.15 Kempton The eye goes first to Walt, winner of a better race here last February. But this ground might be a shade softer than ideal for him, so Touch Kick is given a chance to show he’s better than he appeared in the Grand Sefton. He still looks fairly weighted in the right circumstances.3.35 Warwick For a novice who is very unexposed at this distance, Igor seems a big price at 16-1. He was made to look short of pace in a Graded contest at Cheltenham before Christmas but there should be an end to end gallop in this Pertemps qualifier and it can show Nicky Henderson’s charge to better effect."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94cdd136c3c824a47eb3075344124500da5ecfe7/0_301_4322_2593/master/4322.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5fe48d92b042fd22d77e10b54a90b0a4","title":"scrounger review athena stevens finborough theatre london","story":"Finborough theatre, LondonAthena Stevens creates comedy and occasional danger from a real-life incident in this tricksy drama‘Part of being a creative person who happens to have a disability, is that everyone thinks something you’ve encountered should be written as a show.” So writes Athena Stevens in this play’s introduction. She cites daily struggles but also frustration at how it has become her job, as playwright and “victim”, to dramatise them.Here she does just that. In 2015 Stevens was asked to leave a flight because her wheelchair could not be accommodated on the plane. It was returned to her broken.Her character, Scrounger, is subsequently housebound for months, hoping to find justice but increasingly sucked into a vortex of opaque regulation that appears to protect disabled people but contains convenient loopholes. Her well-meaning boyfriend stands by with encouraging homilies but ultimately lets her down in her mission to change the system.Scrounger’s online petitions are signed and her tweets are liked yet change is not mobilised by her supporters. The satire steers into cliche at times, though stays amusing: her boyfriend’s yogic mantra is “inhale the future, exhale the past” while her north London best friend is running a marathon for “Syrian kids fleeing Assad or whatever”.Stevens, who was born with athetoid cerebral palsy, was nominated for an Olivier award for her play Schism. Her tricksy storytelling is given a delightfully non-realist staging here from director Lily McLeish and designer Anna Reid. Stevens narrates while Leigh Quinn dextrously performs multiple characters in Scrounger’s tale, sometimes acting them out, other times mimicking them, alongside a toolbox of sound effects. There is quirky neon lighting, confetti and surreal props including a miniature wheelchair.The fourth wall is broken before Quinn’s entry, in a very different tone, when Scrounger addresses the audience and implicates us as smug, left-leaning liberals with open disdain. “You think it’s brave that I am up here,” she says. It is unclear if this is drama or real life and it is a dangerous moment in the auditorium.Quinn’s arrival leavens the danger and gives the meta-theatre its comic mischief and cuteness. Stevens’ contempt bubbles beneath, erupting again when the stage lights are apparently fused and giving her the opportunity for another direct address. However charming Quinn’s presence is, one wishes for this dark, discomfiting tone to be further explored.It is brave to make a play whose central plot line is a broken wheelchair and an EU regulation.

Employee vetting was practically nonexistent, he added.While the grader began by working in an office, he said the contractor that employed him “after a while allowed me to do it from home in Beijing. I judged British English (because I’m British), so I listened to people who had their Microsoft device set to British English, and I had access to all of this from my home laptop with a simple username and password login.” Both username and password were emailed to new contractors in plaintext, he said, with the former following a simple schema and the latter being the same for every employee who joined in any given year.“They just give me a login over email and I will then have access to Cortana recordings. I could then hypothetically share this login with anyone,” the contractor said. “I heard all kinds of unusual conversations, including what could have been domestic violence. It sounds a bit crazy now, after educating myself on computer security, that they gave me the URL, a username and password sent over email.”As well as the risks of a rogue employee saving user data themselves or accessing voice recordings on a compromised laptop, Microsoft’s decision to outsource some of the work vetting English recordings to companies based in Beijing raises the additional prospect of the Chinese state gaining access to recordings. “Living in China, working in China, you’re already compromised with nearly everything,” the contractor said. “I never really thought about it.”The grading programme, first reported by Vice in August, went a step further than those run by other technology multinationals such as Amazon, Apple and Google. As well as employing human graders to check audio from the company’s voice assistant, Microsoft contractors were also revealed to be listening to calls made using the Skype telephone service, which is owned by the company.An experimental feature enabling live text translation of Skype calls was vetted by humans, Vice revealed, raising the prospects of iniduals making sensitive calls without knowing that their conversations were effectively bugged. Microsoft disclosed to users that the company might “analyse audio” of calls, but not that it would be playing them to human workers.Vice reported at the time that the work was “at least in part work-at-home”. But the extent of the potential security hazards that represented has not been previously reported.Microsoft said in a statement that, since Vice’s reporting in the summer, it had ended its grading programmes for Skype and Cortana for Xbox and moved the rest of its human grading into “secure facilities” – none of which are in China.“We review short snippets of de-identified voice data from a small percentage of customers to help improve voice-enabled features, and we sometimes engage partner companies in this work,” the company said. “Review snippets are typically fewer than ten seconds long and no one reviewing these snippets would have access to longer conversations. We’ve always disclosed this to customers and operate to the highest privacy standards set out in laws like Europe’s GDPR.“This past summer we carefully reviewed both the process we use and the communications with customers. As a result we updated our privacy statement to be even more clear about this work, and since then we’ve moved these reviews to secure facilities in a small number of countries. We will continue to take steps to give customers greater transparency and control over how we manage their data,” Microsoft added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a334550ded2f360102c76873f5905892997bac90/0_0_5000_3333/master/5000.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64ea393b3cc17532bbe351b51de58df7","title":"us citizens in iraq tell us about your situation","story":"We’d like to hear from US citizens in Iraq about their situation following embassy advice to leave the country.

Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, de-facto leader of the Iranian-backed Iraqi militia, the Popular Mobilisation Units (PMU), and close associate of Suleimani, also died in the attack.The killing represents a significant acceleration in the escalation of tensions between the US and Iran. It followed just hours after the conclusion of a two-day siege against the US embassy in Baghdad by PMU militants, which was prompted by a US airstrike camps belonging to a PMU-affiliated militia, itself a response to that group’s killing of a US contractor at an Iraqi army base.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has sworn revenge for Suleimani’s death.The embassy said in a statement that it “urges American Citizens to heed the January 2020 Travel Advisory and depart Iraq immediately. US citizens should depart via airline while possible, and failing that, to other countries by land.”“Due to Iranian-backed militia attacks at the US Embassy compound, all public consular operations are suspended until further notice”, the statement added.We would like to hear from you if you are a US citizen in Iraq, or if you know someone who has been affected by the order to evacuate.Though we’d like to hear from you, your security is most important.

Ranging from 16-year-old school pupils to carers, shuttle-bus drivers and retired rail workers, the French president said these ordinary people would define the next phase of his term in power. They are part of France’s latest democratic experiment: a randomly selected citizens’ assembly that has been promised more power than any other – the ability to set Emmanuel Macron’s policy on cutting carbon emissions, as he faces harsh criticism that he is not doing enough to tackle the climate emergency.“You took a risk in being here,” Macron told them on Friday. “But we must have this debate at the heart of society.”Although Macron has presented himself as a world leader on the climate emergency, France is in fact far from delivering its goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Indeed, the year-long gilets jaunes (yellow vests) anti-government protests began as a crisis in climate policy. Demonstrators first took to the streets against Macron’s new carbon tax intended to urge motorists to change their behaviour. People in the countryside said it was deeply unfair to raise taxes on fuel use where there was no alternative transport to private cars. The tax was abandoned and the government has been struggling to catch up.Macron hopes a sample of everyday French people sensitive to issues of “social justice” can do better at bringing society on board.“This deliberation exercise wouldn’t exist if it hadn’t been for the gilets jaunes crisis,” said Mathilde Immer, who founded the Gilets Citoyens group for more citizen involvement in policy decisions, and who now sits on the climate assembly committee.Over several months, across seven weekends, the assembly members have been briefed by experts and have deliberated on issues including fast fashion, plastics, transport and housing. “This is not a consultation asking for people’s views, we’re asking them to produce concrete, structural measures, that’s what’s original,” said Julien Blanchet, who is overseeing the process.Macron’s party has said involving citizens could even be an answer to populism and the crisis in western democracy.The participants themselves have said they were struck by the human element of the exercise and the sense of making a difference.Romane, 17, a school student from a Brittany village, was in her bedroom one Sunday night last autumn when she was surprised to get a text message saying she had been randomly picked from more than 300,000 phone numbers. Her parents, a farmer and recruitment agent, encouraged her to sign up. It was crucial for organisers to include people under 18.“Climate change is the key issue for our generation and our future,” said Romane, who wants to study management. “At my first sessions, the full sense of the climate emergency really hit me and I was a bit scared, but now I think if we give our all, we can make proposals for change.” Personally, she does what she can. “I try to use public transport, but the nearest bus stop is in the next village so I have to take a car to get there.”Grégoire Fraty, 31, who lives in Normandy, is from what geographers call the French periphery – the hinterland outside cities where gilets jaunes protesters mobilised and which is increasingly targeted by the far right. He grew up in a tower block in a Paris banlieue before moving to the country “for the clean air”, and works helping jobless people get back into employment. He liked working through different opinions to find consensus. “When a Parisian who lives right next to a metro station says, ‘Oh, we need to ban cars’, I might say, ‘Look, when you live in the countryside and have to drive your car 15km to buy bread, it’s something else’.”He said his family used one car, not two, and he now would not take flights for a holiday. “I see myself as the silent majority: someone who does a little bit for the environment, but could do more.” He said it was about getting society on board. “We’re not inventing miracle solutions, we’re just reinventing the workings to make sure solutions will be accepted.”Sylvain Burquier, 45, described himself as a typical “cynical Parisian advertising executive” despite spending his childhood in the Alps. “I’ve become really passionate about the human experience of putting so many different people together. We’re being asked to come up with proposals to basically save humanity, so there’s a lot resting on this! When you take 150 different people, with different complaints and incoherences and indiscipline, and then they get together to produce a work of collective intelligence, I find that remarkable and very touching.”He said inserting new climate elements into the French constitution would be a revolutionary possibility, but there would also be concrete measures impacting people’s everyday lives. The process had reignited his interest in politics and debate. “I’ve got back some of my teenage enthusiasm.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2642d4f6d1f9a015bfb0914c1a6cffc4208603f3/0_93_4033_2420/master/4033.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d96f806600da7a565ba98ab2bf60182","title":"mexico city gold aztec treasure spanish conquistadors","story":"Analysis of gold bar published a few months before 500th anniversary of battle that forced Cortés to beat a temporary retreat A new scientific analysis of a large gold bar found decades ago in downtown Mexico City has confirmed it was part of the plunder Spanish conquistadors abandoned as they beat a temporary retreat from the Aztec capital.Mexico’s National Institute of Anthropology and History (Inah) announced the findings of new tests of the bar in a statement on Thursday, a few months before the 500th anniversary of the battle that forced Hernán Cortés and his soldiers to temporarily flee the city on 30 June 1520.A day earlier, the Aztec emperor Moctezuma was assassinated, prompting a frenzied battle that forced Cortés, his fellow Spaniards and their indigenous allies to flee for their lives.A year later, Cortés would return and lay siege to the city, which was already weakened with supply lines cut and diseases that accompanied the Spanish invaders taking a toll.The bar was originally discovered in 1981 during a construction project some 16ft (5m) underground in downtown Mexico City – which was built on the ruins of the Aztec capital Tenochtitlán – where a canal that would have been used by the fleeing Spaniards was once located.The bar weighs about 2kg (4.4lb) and is 26.2cm (10.3in) long, 5.4cm wide and 1.4cm thick.A fluorescent X-ray chemical analysis was able to pinpoint its creation to 1519-20, according to Inah, which coincides with the time Cortés ordered gold objects stolen from an Aztec treasury to be melted down into bars for easier transport to Europe.Historical accounts describe Cortés and his men as heavily weighed down by the gold they hoped to take with them as they fled the imperial capital during what is known today as the Sad Night, or Noche Triste, in Spanish.“The gold bar is a unique historical testimony to a transcendent moment in world history,” said archaeologist Leonardo López Luján, who leads excavations at a nearby dig where the Aztecs’ holiest shrine once stood.Until the recent tests, scholars of the last gasps of the Aztec empire only had historical documents to rely on as confirmed sources, added López Luján.A more in-depth and technical description of the tests performed on the bar is published in the January issue of the magazine Arqueología Mexicana."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4131656.1578312358!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"on a frosty morning 40 years ago i saw a group of dolphins playing tag","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe shiny black backs that came curving along the waves behind me were those of bottlenose dolphins, out for their own kind of fun. Picture: Michael VineyOn a frosty morning after Christmas in our first winter in the west more than 40 years ago, I went walking north along the shore. An early stretch, once I’d left the strand, was an obstacle course of rocky headlands and ravines, an old grass road scalloped on eroding cliffs and hurdled with the tangled ends of fences.But the whole arc of mountains from Achill to Renvyle were gleaming with snow. And at Carrowniskey Strand, with the wet sand as a mirror, Clare Island floated offshore like a great white sail.Carrowniskey shelves slowly into the deep, its long terraces of breakers piling up into crests that today bring many surfers to this shore. But the shiny black backs that came curving along the waves behind me were those of bottlenose dolphins, out for their own kind of fun.“Then came half a dozen more,” I reported in this column, “cavorting in the wintry surf as if Mayo were in west Africa.” Which tells how much I knew about bottlenose dolphins – or “Huzza Porpoises”, as the headline boldly and ignorantly proclaimed.I had borrowed that phrase from Melville’s Moby Dick and his term for the “hilarious shoals” that so often shadowed his whaler. “If you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish,” he wrote, “then heaven help ye the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye.”My own godless spirit was, indeed, exalted by the exuberance of the “porpoises” playing tag among the breakers and leaping from the water in glittering founts of spray. Their play seemed quite deliberate, a performance for the solitary human figure on the shore, Then they calmed down and swam on.My use of “porpoises” is still mortifying, but I had yet to learn about the mammals of the sea. Porpoises are the commonest and by far the smallest of Ireland’s 24 species of cetacean, and their shoals have little aspiration to hilarity. Some big Scottish bottlenoses even beat them up.My magical visitors, I know today, were from a large social community of bottlenoses based off the coast of Connemara and west Mayo. Some 200 have been photographed for the IWDG’s photo ID catalogue. But 40 years ago, cetacean wildlife was almost blanked from Irish natural history.Before marine scientists and fellow enthusiasts formed the IWDG (Irish Whale and Dolphin Group) in December 1990, the variety and extent of our cetacean life was held in random records of stranded corpses and in the logbooks of a small Norwegian whaling enterprise based briefly on the Mullet, in north Mayo.Today’s research cruises and postmortems have been building the story of cetacean biology, lifestyle and pathology. This action for conservation was implicit in Charles Haughey’s 1991 declaration of Ireland’s pioneering whale and dolphin sanctuary .Just a few weeks ago came results of a study by Galway Mayo Institute and the Marine Institute. It analysed blubber samples from three killer whales, or orcas, stranded dead in Galway, Mayo and Waterford, and from a near-term calf inside one of them.The tests were part of intensive global monitoring of the impact on cetaceans of toxic industrial chemicals and pesticides. The chemical concentrations in the Irish blubber were disturbingly high, but still far from those found in some parts of the Mediterranean and elsewhere. In an earlier world-wide survey of dolphins and porpoises, bottlenoses resident in the Shannon Estuary showed the lowest concentrations of all.As top predators in the ocean, the dolphins, of which orcas are the biggest, accumulate the most man-made toxic pollutants, in particular the persistent polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Their “biomagnification” in cetacea was first detected in the 1960s, when PCBs were still widely used in insulation of electrical equipment.They were phased out in the EU in the mid-1980s, to good immediate effect, but their persistence is still echoed in the dolphins. Reproduction can be suppressed and females pass PCBs into their offspring. One pod of orcas, living between northwest Scotland and Ireland, has not produced a calf in 19 years of observation.Meanwhile, Ireland’s best-known bottlenose, the loyal Fungie of Dingle Harbour, was admitted last September to the Guinness Book of Records as the longest-lived “solitary-sociable” dolphin on record. He first appeared off Dingle in 1983, which puts him as the earliest of 114 living, solitary and mostly bottlenose dolphins engaging with humans on shores around the world. The report on them, Lone Rangers, was prepared by Marine Connection, a UK-based animal welfare charity (at marineconnection.org).Much less eager for human encounters and lately gashed by a boat propeller, Fungie is nearing the 40 years reckoned as the limit to the life for his kind. His relationship with people has been remarkably free of the misunderstandings, sometimes sexual or aggressive, that have marked some Irish bottlenose encounters.For the IWDG, even sociable wild dolphins are best left to wild lives."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Taoiseach\u0026rsquos intentions remain unclear, but pressure is building within both partiesBarrels to be banned outside Dublin\u0026rsquos pubs in a further crackdown on street \u0026lsquoclutter\u0026rsquoCouple had termination carried out at National Maternity Hospital after incorrect test resultMinster for Sport had previously refused to meet Connacht\u0026rsquos demand additional fundingNew figures show 51 additional managers taken on since June amid recruitment curbsDUP, Sinn F\u0026eacutein give their backing to the British and Irish governments\u0026rsquo dealCrumlin children\u0026rsquos hospital postponed treatment for R\u0026eacuteilt\u0026iacuten Reid because of flu surgeTwo potential election dates on either February 7th or February 14th have been mooted in recent days\u0026lsquoWe will never get over it\u0026rsquo: Christine Ryan says company should face criminal punishmentIrish judiciary will be represented at Warsaw protest against Polish government intrusionOccupant of house remained locked in room for considerable period until discovered by a relativeDUP and Sinn F\u0026eacutein have given their backing to the British and Irish governments\u0026rsquo dealHealy Rae convicted of assault after 2017 incident and on committee since June 2019UK students on 202021 courses in Ireland will continue to pay \u0026euro 3,000 registration fee\u0026lsquoImproved terms and conditions\u0026rsquo needed to support \u0026lsquosustainable\u0026rsquo Early Years servicesMixed reaction from Irish language groups to commitment to legislationLabour party confirms it will back Westminster legislation in support of the dealProduct marketed as herbal aid found to contain substance similar to prescription medicineCar in collision with truck on Kilrush to Ennis road"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4136265.1578695764!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"a cold snap election or spring polling fever it s leo varadkar s call","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar ahead of a Fine Gael party meeting on Friday. His meeting with Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin on Thursday evening ended inconclusively. Photograph: Cate McCurryPA Wire Walking back from his meeting with Leo Varadkar on Thursday evening through the corridors that run from Government Buildings to Leinster House, Micheál Martin shared a joke with his chef de cabinet, Deirdre Gillane. The sound of laughter carried further than usual because of the funereal silence. With the Oireachtas not scheduled to resume after Christmas until next Wednesday, few were around the Dáil. Fewer still were there after 7pm.Some of those TDs who did travel to Leinster House this week emptied their offices in anticipation of an impending election. Others confessed to weighing up whether they will actually run again or instead retire.Martin was relaxed as he returned to his office. Neither he nor Varadkar carried the air of wrestling with a decision. Meanwhile, their TDs became increasingly convinced as the week wore on that a February election is likely. Martin is understood to have told colleagues afterwards that he could not read Varadkar’s intentions – which was probably exactly what the Taoiseach wanted. They will meet again next week.Varadkar wants a Martin guarantee of actual support for the Government – instead of just abstaining – on some Dáil votes and his backing for a number of policies, including property tax reform, in exchange for an agreed election date. The demand is politically impossible for Martin to accept, perhaps intentionally so, although both Varadkar and Martin say an agreed list of legislation can be passed before voters are asked to go to the polls.Further pressureRural Independents will put down a no-confidence motion against Minister for Health Simon Harris in early February, putting further pressure on Varadkar. More likely, Varadkar will seek a dissolution of the Dáil on his own terms and without any agreement with Fianna Fáil. Varadkar, however, has given little away in private. Ministers have attempted to second-guess his intentions from conversations with him, whilst also trying to figure out if any of their Cabinet colleagues knew more than they do.Speaking after the Cabinet meeting in Marino this week, one senior figure said their fear that they were out of the loop was assuaged by the fact that others were clearly just as clueless about the Taoiseach’s plans.TDs asked after the whereabouts of President Michael D. Higgins, should a visit to the Park be necessary The President, as it happens, was on a short holiday break, returning to Ireland on Saturday. Ministers, like all others, were instead left to look for hints that the ground is being readied for an election – such as the tweaking of election tickets and the announcement on Friday of €77 million in sports grants for larger infrastructural projects. In some instances, more cash was found over and above the official sports grants list. Connacht Rugby was unhappy that it was getting €10 million for its stadium, not €20 million. Pressure was exercised. The extra €10 million was found just minutes before the grants were announced.Thoughts have already turned to the campaign to come. A presidential Leo-versus-Micheál-style contest will suit both. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael TDs welcomed the news that both will take part in a head-to-head debate, believing that will help squeeze support for smaller parties.Neck and neckFor now, people in Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil believe they are neck and neck. Advantage will be hard won, though this week’s Royal Irish Constabulary controversy has been a gift for Fianna Fáil, and left Fine Gael TDs trying to explain that they would not commemorate the Black and Tans.Though they enjoyed Fine Gael’s discomfort immensely, Fianna Fáil TDs do not think it will decide voters’ minds on polling day. “It was the best thing in three years for geeing up our grassroots,” said one frontbench member.Fianna Fáil TDs, like their members, are eager to be let off the leash to attack Fine Gael after years of keeping it in office. “This is a choice: either them or us,” said one TD, although it will not be so simple. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are unlikely to poll above a combined 60 per cent, with Sinn Féin, Labour, the Greens (seen as a particular threat to Fine Gael in middle-class areas) and others competing for votes and seats.In response to Fine Gael claims that Fianna Fáil is lacking in serious policy, senior figures in Martin’s party say they will only launch their policy offering during the election campaign proper.Those in Government believe a short campaign is too late to land policies and say voters need to be introduced to new proposals over months, not days.“They aren’t Apple – it isn’t launching an iPhone,” said one source, adding that Fianna Fáil has yet to outline why voters should actually support Martin, instead of just rejecting Varadkar. The voices of caution in Fine Gael, who believe Varadkar should hold on until the spring before going to the polls, point to hospital waiting lists and the difficulties associated with a winter election, such as recruiting canvassers on cold nights.Third termFine Gaelers have long compared the coming contest to the 2007 election, when what was believed to be an unpopular Fianna Fáil-led government held on for a third term after a late campaign swing.“If we were to believe the top-of-the-head brigade, the election will be about how s**t everything is,” remarked one Government figure, before pointing towards the strength of the economy and the Government’s handling of Brexit.A senior Fianna Fáiler countered that “it’s not always about the economy”, with a belief in the party that the main battlegrounds will be housing and health.The winning and losing of the election may be in defining the ground on which it is fought. Fine Gaelers tell themselves that, just as in 2007, the swing back to the Government may not come until the final week of the campaign. If the danger of a winter election lies in overcrowded hospitals, then the benefit is in Brexit. Fine Gael is already emphasising its Brexit team of Varadkar, Simon Coveney and Helen McEntee, and Varadkar has warned that Boris Johnson may pursue a hard Brexit.A potential Johnson-Varadkar meeting in Belfast to mark the restoration of Stormont is mooted in Fine Gael circles, and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen will also visit Dublin next week. If an election is called in the coming days, Brexit could frame the beginning of the election, as well as the end. A polling day of February 7th or 14th would see Brexit actually take place in the final, crucial weeks of a campaign, with Britain leaving the EU on January 31st. But against all the noise, supposition, conjecture and debate, the choice – to go now, or wait until spring – is Varadkar’s alone.

Photograph: Getty ImagesBoeing employees mocked federal rules, talked about deceiving regulators and joked about potential flaws in its Boeing 737 Max as it was being developed, according to confidential messages delivered to US Congress investigators.Faced with ever-mounting criticism, the company expressed regret at the embarrassing communications, including one that said: “This airplane is designed by clowns, who are in turn supervised by monkeys.”Two Boeing 737 Max aircraft crashed in five months over 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people – including Lahinch, Co Clare-born Michael Ryan – which has resulted in a worldwide grounding order.The messages are highly embarrassing for the Seattle-based firm, which has already lost its chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, and faces the prospect of multibillion dollar fines and compensation claims.In one 2018 email, suggesting that employees concealed problems with simulator training machines from the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA), an employee said: “I still haven’t been forgiven by God for the covering up I did last year.”In another exchange between employees before the crashes occurred, an employee said: Would you put your family on a Max simulator trained aircraft? I wouldn’t.” In a third, employees questioned the design of the Max, and even denigrated their own colleagues in exchanges during the course of 2017. “This airplane is designed by clowns, who are in turn supervised by monkeys,” wrote one.In a fourth, an employee warned in March 2018 that he would not lie to the FAA , saying: “Will leave that to people who have no integrity.” Replying, a superior said: “I’m sorry, that is not acceptable. Your integrity is priority 4.” Disturbing picturePeter DeFazio, the Democratic chairman of the House committee on transportation and infrastructure, said: “These newly released emails are incredibly damning. They paint a deeply disturbing picture of the lengths Boeing was apparently willing to go to in order to evade scrutiny from regulators, flight crews and the flying public, even as its own employees were sounding alarms internally.”Responding, Boeing said “some of the sentiments” expressed in the messages did not match the company’s values. “This will ultimately include disciplinary or other personnel action once the necessary reviews are completed.”On Tuesday, Boeing finally recommended simulator training for 737 Max pilots instead of relying on software programmes. Simulator training costs hundreds of dollars per hour and can dissuade airlines from buying certain aircraft.

It was extraordinary the way people mixed with each other afterwards,” he said.Two years later a mass was held in Granard, Co Longford in 2010 organised by former garda James McCarthy for deceased members of the RIC.Killed on dutyThe church was packed. Mr McCarthy went with retired inspector Gerry Lovett to host an event in Glasnevin Cemetery at the graves of two RIC men who had been killed on duty.They noticed there was no memorial for the RIC or the DMP, the two forces that policed Ireland between 1836 and 1922. A committee was formed and the Harp Society was founded.The society, which has a committee of seven and approximately 250 members, first came to public attention during the Easter Rising commemorations in 2016. On Easter Monday, the first fatality in Dublin of the Rising, Constable James O’Brien of the DMP, was remembered.That event led to one of the best unscripted moments of the commemorations. As the society was laying wreathes at the gates of Dublin Castle, Freya Connolly, the great-granddaughter of Seán Connolly, laid flowers beside it. Connolly, who was also shot dead on the day, led the Citizen Army in the attack on Dublin Castle.There was no official commemoration to remember the policemen who died in the Easter Rising, but the Harp Society decided to regroup for the War of Independence centenary.It began hosting an interdenominational memorial service every year. “We kept sending out invitations. For the first time the Minister (Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan) came this year.”Several widowsThat event was held in Mount Argus Church in Dublin. Afterwards the Minister met several widows of RUC officers who had been killed in the Troubles.“He said he was moved by that. He realised probably for the first time how raw all of this is,” Mr Herlihy said.The Harp Society, he stressed, had “no hand, act or part” in the now-postponed State ceremony. “The only thing we knew was that the event was in Dublin Castle. It was also supported by the Taoiseach. We expected that he might have attended.”It is clear from the response to the proposal that some sections of Irish society do not see the RIC and the DMP in the same light as the Harp Society does. Mr Herlihy maintains that they were respected police forces up to 1919.“The RIC and DMP were two of the most sought-after jobs up to the turn of events in 1919. From Soloheadbeg they came under increased attack. They were sitting ducks,” he said.AmbushTwo RIC constables – James McDonnell and Patrick O’Connell, who hailed from families in Cos Mayo and Cork respectively – were killed in the Co Tipperary ambush of January 21st 1919, the first engagement of the War of Independence .“There are countless cases like this. There are 100 families I know like that. We would like that there was a memorial in a secure place that they could attend.”The Harp Society is still hopeful that the commemoration service will go ahead as Mr Flanagan has stated that it will.In any case the RIC and DMP will certainly be remembered during the Decade of Centenaries.The British-based Police Roll of Honour will host a service in St Paul’s Cathedral, London on April 29th, 2022 to mark the centenary of the disbandment of the two forces."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4136332.1578696744!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach pledges extra 10m to new connacht rugby stadium","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA CGI view of the redeveloped Sportsground provided by Connacht Rugby.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has pledged an extra €10 million to Connacht Rugby to build a new stadium over and above the limits of a grant scheme from Minister for Sport Shane Ross.The announcement came on Friday evening amid renewed speculation in recent days that Mr Varadkar may call a snap general election.Last month Mr Ross decided to award €10 million each to Leinster and Connacht for their plans to build or refurbish stadiums, along with €1.5 million to Munster Rugby for floodlighting and an indoor training centre.However, he refused to meet Connacht’s demand for an extra €10 million for its project, arguing that rugby could not be given a greater share of the €77 million sports infrastructure grants that were announced yesterday given other demands.It has been known in Government circles that Connacht was unhappy with the limit put in place by Mr Ross, and Government sources said Mr Varadkar gave the go ahead for the additional €10 million, but insisted the decision is “fully justified” because Connacht’s application was the “second highest scoring project”.‘Great excitement’Sources said talks have been ongoing between Connacht and figures on the Fine Gael side of government and the move was announced yesterday by Sean Kyne, the Government chief whip, and Hildegarde Naughton, who are both local party TDs. Mr Kyne, a minister in the Taoiseach’s department, was particularly cited by club officials.A decision was made to find additional money for Connacht elsewhere, above Mr Ross’s grant, and it is understood that the funds will come from the Government’s Project Ireland 2040 plan.The pledge to Connacht Rugby by the Taoiseach will be made in writing so that the club can borrow a further €10 million to complete the 12,000-seater stadium at its Sportsground home on College Road in Galway.Saying the decision had prompted, “great excitement”, the club’s chief executive, Willie Ruane said in a statement last night that he wanted to “fully acknowledge the very significant support” received from the Taoiseach.In his announcement yesterday, M Ross said the €77.4 million given to 25 projects had been decided “following a rigorous assessment process with the highest scoring applications receiving grant offers”.“The fund provides a robust and transparent mechanism for the allocation of funding to develop the best high quality sports facilities across all regions,” Mr Ross said.Two projects in, or near to Mr Ross’s constituency – the Beckett Civic Centre and the Tibradden Road sports centre will receive more than €10 million.Last May, Mr Varadkar, along with Ms Naughton and Government Chief Whip Sean Kyne, were told during a visit to Galway that the new stadium could not be financed unless the State put up €20 million."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4136076.1578674440!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"where to now after the debacle over the ric dmp commemoration","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMembers of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC)  in Waterford in 1917. Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan was forced to postpone a  commemoration for the RIC and the Dublin politan Police.   Photograph: A. H. Poole CollectionBefore a decade of commemorations began in 2012 of the years around the creation of the State, then taoiseach Enda Kenny was only too well aware that it could exacerbate tensions and revive ancestral hatreds. In a bid to ensure that pitfalls could be avoided and consensus created, the government set up an expert advisory group under the chairmanship of the chancellor of the National University of Ireland Dr Maurice Manning. Given that North’s Stormont Assembly and Executive and the Belfast Agreement institutions were then working reasonably well, the government believed that any commemorations should use the Northern peace process as a frame of reference. However, the experts refused “point blank”, arguing that a sanitised, whitewashed version of Irish history should not be presented for fear of causing offence. “We were into commemoration. We were into history. We were not into politics. We said no,” Manning said in 2016.The system worked well for years: the 1916 commemorations drew huge crowds and moderate debate, prompting an interest amongst new generations in the events that led to the foundation of the State and the role of Irishmen in the first World War.However, the Government’s attempts to keep contemporary politics out of the commemorations imploded this week where Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan was forced to postpone a proposed commemoration for the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) and the Dublin politan Police (DMP).The recriminations have been ugly and have left nobody happy. Many people were outraged that the service would have remembered those who served in the Black and Tans and the Auxiliaries since their dead are included in the toll of 555 killed during those years even if they were not the primary focus of those behind the plan. Meanwhile, unionists, some of them gleefully, have complained that the affair has illustrated that anti-British sentiment in the Republic still runs deep. Mr Flanagan has been taken aback by the “nastiness and vitriol” that his proposal generated. In its guidance for the second half of the Decade of Centenaries (2018-2023), the expert advisory group recommended that the State should ration itself to a small number of key centenaries and leave the rest to local commemoration groups.This was vindicated by the Soloheadbeg commemoration in January 2019, which by common consent was respectfully handled by local people. It saw relatives of the ambushers mingle with relatives of the two RIC men shot dead in the opening action of the War of Independence. The State events as proposed are one for the War of Independence truce (July 11th, 1921) one for the Civil War, two for the coming into being of the State (January 1922 and December 1922) and one for when Ireland joined the League of Nations in September 1923, which will end the Decade of Centenaries. The Government has added another to the list. There will be a State ceremony to remember Cork’s involvement in the War of Independence around the centenary of the death of the city’s lord mayor Terence MacSwiney in the autumn. This week’s unseemly row does not auger well for the years ahead. There will be many difficult commemorations which will test people’s tolerance and respect for differences. This is particularly true of the North. August marks the centenary of the beginning of pogroms which followed the shooting dead of Det Sgt Oswald Swanzy in Lisburn in 1920. This provoked a sectarian backlash against the Catholic community which spread to Belfast. Some 450 people were killed between 1920 and 1922 in an orgy of violence which matched the intensity of the Troubles. Mutual respectThe centenary of partition and the foundation of Northern Ireland (June 1921) are certain to be bitterly contested. The new document New Decade, New Approach has a provision to mark the centenary of Northern Ireland in a “spirit of mutual respect, inclusiveness and reconciliation in line with the principles for remembering”. DUP leader Arlene Foster has already stated that she wants 2021 to be a celebration year, declaring that Northern Ireland has “endured” and “succeeded”. Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald has said republicans will have no part in any attempt to celebrate the anniversary. Northern historian Dr Eamon Phoenix, a member of the Government’s advisory group, said the Decade of Centenaries had been well handled to date in the North, with many cross-community events in 2016 to mark the Easter Rising and the Battle of the Somme. That was when there was an executive in place. “From this year down to 2022, opinion is bitterly ided. The RIC commemoration shows the kind of problems that lie ahead. As somebody involved in public history north of the Border, we have achieved quite a bit. The big challenge is in a way about the birth of partition.” He suggested that both communities could coalesce around the centenary of King George V’s speech at the opening of the Northern Ireland parliament (June 22nd, 1921) in which he stated: “I appeal to all Irishmen to pause, to stretch out the hand of forbearance and conciliation, to forgive and to forget, and to join in making for the land which they love a new era of peace, contentment and goodwill.” Potential landmineThe next potential landmine for whatever Irish government is in power is a proposal for a State commemoration for the Truce (July 11th, 1921) which ended the War of Independence.The advisory group has recommended a “formal commemoration for all of those who lost their lives during the War of Independence”. There are many people who will object to any attempt to morally equate those who died fighting for Irish freedom with those who opposed it. Will this be an Irish-only commemoration or will the British be involved? Where will it be hosted? What format will it take? The Civil War commemoration will be another one that will need careful handling when that centenary rolls around in June 1922. The advisory group has recommended that the approach should be a “reflective and a reconciliatory tone that recognises that neither side has the monopoly on either atrocity or virtue”. The group has advised that just one State ceremony should take place to remember those who died in the Civil War. The rest should be left up to inidual communities. Fianna Fáil TD Éamon Ó Cuív, the grandson of Eamon de Valera, said he grew up in a household where the sincerity on both sides of the Civil War was respected. As a member of the all-party group on commemorations, he says wide consultation will be critical in the years ahead. “The biggest lesson that we can learn out of this for the next four years is start your discussions early, be sensitive to the nuances of situations, and don’t go ahead until you have got all reasonable opinions on board.” He believes the personal tragedy of those who died opposing Irish independence should be recognised, but there is a “fundamental difference” between commemorating iniduals and commemorating organisations opposed to independence. Hierarchy“There is no hierarchy of victims but there is a hierarchy of causes, and the cause of Irish independence and protecting and defending Dáil Éireann set up by the Irish people by democratic choice was a noble cause from where I come from, and is something that I believe should be positively commemorated.”This is not the first time there has been a rumpus over commemorations. The Easter Rising commemorations began with the debacle over a promotional video which featured none of those involved in 1916, and was famously dismissed by Prof Diarmaid Ferriter as “a historical shit”. The video was reshot, lessons were learned, and, by common consent, the 1916 commemorations went well.If the coming years go as well, few will remember what happened this week."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Prince Harry and Meghan split: Ditching of the Royal Rota could leave us all the poorerNigel Farage: I\u0026#39m not sure I can face another uphill battle against our corrupt EstablishmentIran plane crash: Tehran admits it \u0026#39unintentionally\u0026#39 shot down planeTrainline locks horns with Virgin over \u0026#39split ticketing\u0026#39What happened to Flight PS752?

A week after spiriting himself out of Japan hidden in a music box, the former chairman of Nissan held a two-hour press conference in Beirut, where he declared: “I am innocent of all charges!”“There goes another corrupt, rent-seeking corporate embezzler,” was what I thought I would think. But to my surprise, after hearing some of his arguments, I began to reconsider. This is either evidence of Mr Ghosn’s extreme deviousness (and my gullibility) or a sign that the case against him isn’t quite as watertight as Nissan would like.The tycoon spent a while complaining about life in Japanese jail, which sounded like a fairly standard jail experience though probably rather different his usual presidential suite. Then he addressed some of the accusations levelled against him.He made no attempt to deny that he was living it large, hopping around the world on private jets, renting penthouses and throwing sumptuous parties in places like the Palace of Versailles. His case is that Nissan knew about all of it. To that end, he presented various documents – though they did flit across the screen rather quickly – suggesting an authorised paper trail following his excesses around the world. His arrest, he contended, was intended to make him the fall guy for Nissan’s ailing fortunes and a growing conflict between Japan and France over the Renault-Nissan alliance.Read more | Ghosn awayThere will now probably never be a trial. So it boils down to which scenario you think is likelier. Either Mr Ghosn siphoned tens of millions of pounds out of the company, accumulating the use of four private jets, at least four luxurious properties, a yacht and a huge pot of money to be paid out to himself in future, without Nissan having a clue. Or the superstar chairman, who had transformed Nissan from a sinking ship into one of the world’s leading carmakers, turned himself into a corporate Sun King, benefitting from a form of legal corruption that granted him outrageous liberties.It is genuinely unclear to me which scenario is correct. Perhaps the lesson from it all is this: if your senior managers start partying in Versailles and buying company jets with the registration code, N155AN, you might want to consider an early retirement scheme and a corporate clear-out. The “Versailles” stage is a sure sign that the rot has set in.Xi\u0027s personality cult is getting lost in translationWhen China’s premier Xi Jinping came to visit the UK in 2015, David Cameron was caught on camera writing cheat notes to himself on his speech. Next to “Xi”, he had written “She”, giving himself a phonetic reminder of how to say his guest’s name.Something tells me that, in 10 years’ time, none of us will have trouble remembering the correct pronunciation of Mr Xi’s name. When he visited Britain all those years ago, Mr Xi was just the latest dry bureaucrat chosen to be the most powerful face of China’s Communist Party. Clever, professional Sinophiles assured us that Beijing had left behind those embarrassing days of airbrushed “dear leader” Mao posters and one-man cults. Modern China may not be democratic, but it was developing its own rule of law and government by technocrat (and maybe, they implied, this was even better).This analysis, it turns out, was a load of absolute twaddle. In fact, Beijing is now ratcheting up the cult of Mr Xi to levels last seen in the Mao era, including by the use of a newish title: “People’s Leader Xi”.According to the China monitoring service Sinocism, this title began to appear in early 2018 on state media sites, just before the Communist Party removed the 10-year-term limits standing in the way of Mr Xi’s ambitions. But its roll-out then seemed to be deferred for reasons unknown.Now, it’s safe to say that “People’s Leader Xi” is firmly back in the ascendant. Sinocism reports that the Chinese-language read-out from the Politburo’s recent end-of-year “democratic life” meeting included a section on Mr Xi, tactfully excluded from the English version, that lauded his genius and referred to the “People’s Leader’s heartfelt feelings for the people”.This was after the Politburo had held an earnest discussion on the crucial importance of “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era”, the mandatory ideological “education” in which all Communist Party cadres are schooled after they have learnt their Marx and Mao.Over here, we tend to call Mr Xi the Chinese “premier”. There is a reason for this oddity. Mr Xi’s most important role, the one from which he derives all of his power, is that of general secretary of the Communist Party. In China’s system, the party comes before all – the government, the state and the people. But it sounds extremely weird to Western ears to refer to the world’s most powerful man as a “general secretary”.So we are left with “premier”. Despite the awkwardness of this arrangement, however, I cannot quite see “People’s Leader” catching on over here. It just sounds rather, you know, evil.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

It’s as if they think the threat of climate change is simply science fiction rather than sad reality.”Mr Bonelli said he would write to Unesco in Paris to raise the alarm about the risks posed by the project to the Dolomites’ World Heritage status, which was granted in 2009.Luigi Casanova, the honorary president of Mountain Wilderness Italia, a conservation group, said: “No one really believes that ski lifts and cable cars will replace car traffic in the mountains. They will simply attract more and more tourists at whatever cost to fragile areas.”Currently, the world’s biggest ski network is considered to be Les Trois Vallees in France, which boasts 600kms of pistes spread out between Meribel, Courchevel and Val Thorens.The biggest ski area in North America is Whistler Blackcomb in British Columbia.Prince Harry and Meghan split: Ditching of the Royal Rota could leave us all the poorerNigel Farage: I\u0026#39m not sure I can face another uphill battle against our corrupt EstablishmentIran plane crash: Tehran admits it \u0026#39unintentionally\u0026#39 shot down planeTrainline locks horns with Virgin over \u0026#39split ticketing\u0026#39What happened to Flight PS752?

At worst, I’ll end up with a broken leg and a wardrobe full of Lycra’, says Will KirbyOut-and-out epiphanies are rare occurrences, but as I stood with my face deeply embedded in the armpit of a complete stranger in the early hours of the morning for the third time that week, I had the strangest feeling that I was, in fact, done with commuting on the Tube.There were other signs of course – like being kneecapped by the men in suits desperate to get onto the train before anyone has got off, or the passive-aggressive call to ‘move down please!’ at every stop as I consider how I could possibly make all 6ft of myself any smaller to allow for more space, or the unrecognisable smells that could honestly be anything from last night’s takeaway to this morning’s missed shower, or being late because of another series of red signals, or the 37 suitcases I had to negotiate because someone’s decided to move house, or looking at my bank balance and realising these joys are costing me more than £40 a week. I don’t know. But whatever it was, I realised then and there that I needed to find another way to get to work.\u0026nbspSo I did some investigating. A commute can make or break your day so it’s important to get it right. Walking was an option (healthy, free) but would have taken almost two hours each way, which would mean spending more than 12 hours a day either going from, to, or being at the office. I could jog, but, sadly, I hate jogging. The bus is doable, and a cheaper option than the Tube, but would involve three separate buses that aren’t very reliable. Which leaves me with one option. The bike.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSeven things no-one tells you when you start cycling to workInitially I wasn’t sure whether I wanted to join the fluorescent, Lyrca-clad hordes that zoom around the capital at breakneck speeds. I’d never really ridden a road bike before, let alone had an argument with a car or a bus about who’s on whose side of the road. How was I going to fit in if I’d never even owned a pair of mirrored sunglasses and didn’t really know what Strava was?! But it didn’t take long to realise that there are some massive benefits that outweigh any nerves or doubts about taking to the road on two wheels.Firstly, it’s healthy. Even a short cycle at the start and end of the day is exercise you probably wouldn’t otherwise have done, and it makes so much more sense to combine your fitness with your commute rather than trying to carve a slice out of your day to go to the gym. It also makes you feel good – if you take a look around the office first thing in the morning, it’s easy to spot the bright faces who’ve biked into work in amongst those who spent at least part of their morning under the ground.\u0026nbspIt is also better for the environment. Public transport, for its many faults (see above), is certainly greener than driving myself to work every morning, but there’s only so long you can tell yourself it doesn’t have a carbon footprint. Transport for London uses more electricity than anything else in the city, consuming enough power to fuel around 360,000 homes each year. By ditching my Oyster, I can hopefully shed with it that last ounce of green guilt.\u0026nbspWhy I\u0027ve pledged to go flight-free for a yearWhy I\u0027m going vegan for 2020This year I pledge to buy local and eat with the seasonsAnd I may as well do what I can to reduce pollution in the city where I live, even if it is on an inidual scale. A recent study found the capital’s poor air quality leads to around 1,000 hospital admissions for asthma and serious lung conditions every year, and another revealed that around four Londoners are hospitalised every day due to asthma caused by air pollution. Breathing London air is like smoking 160 cigarettes a year, according to the British Heart Foundation, and when you then consider that pollution on the Tube is around 15 times worse than above ground, it’s got to be a good idea to spend as little time down there as you can.\u0026nbspThe combination of a bit of light exercise and avoiding the toxic fumes that swirl around beneath the capital also reduces the chance of a heart attack and other cardiovascular diseases. In fact, if the same number of trips were made by bike as they are in Denmark (26 per cent of all trips that are less than 5km), it could save the NHS a staggering £17 billion within 20 years.So, I’m going to give it a go. At best, I’ll get fit, rediscover a long-lost hobby and do my bit to tackle the growing climate crisis. At worst, I’ll end up with a broken leg and a wardrobe full of Lycra. I’ll keep you posted.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

How did things get so bad in my kitchen?’ asks food writer Julia Platt LeonardI avoid cleaning my refrigerator like other people put off doing their taxes. I wait until it’s a sea of plastic containers, cling-film-wrapped onion halves, teetering jars – until I can’t find the mayonnaise or remember where the parmesan cheese is. Only then, when I can’t fit another thing inside, do I take it all out.\u0026nbspI throw out the piece of salmon skin I was going to give to the dogs. I toss out something spore-covered (carrots? meatballs?) and another item I think used to be a solid but is now liquid. Judging by the amount of mould, you’d think I was starting up a penicillin laboratory.And each time I chuck out an uneaten leftover or a floppy cucumber I feel ashamed – ashamed at the waste. As a food writer, I know better.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, about one third of the food produced in the world – a whopping 1.3 billion tonnes – is wasted or lost. In richer countries we waste as much food as sub-Saharan Africa produces. I’ve interviewed farmers, written about food policy and yet I’m part of the problem.I see myself standing before a food waste deity (picture Greta Thunberg with a white beard) and am forced to look at the piles of food I’ve wasted. It’s not a pretty picture. How did things get so bad in my kitchen?Why I’ve decided to start cycling to workI went to cooking school and worked in professional kitchens so FIFO – “first-in, first-out” – was my mantra. Food came in and we prepared and served it to ensure that waste was kept to a minimum. We labelled containers and made prep lists so nothing was missed. The walk-in fridge was kept clean, for hygiene reasons of course, but also so we knew what we had and ordered accordingly. My fridge? A disaster zone.I wasn’t raised to waste. My maternal grandparents came from western Kentucky, got married during the depression, and would no sooner have wasted a morsel of food than they would have walked down the street naked. When things were really tight, my grandmother reused coffee grounds and gave cucina povera a decidedly southern twist. My mother was the same, serving a meal one night, leftovers the next, and if necessary ‘must-go’ servings on the third.Food that’s not eaten either goes down the drain, is incinerated or ends up on a landfill where greenhouse gases are generated. That’s waste. But it’s also a waste because land, water, labour and energy were spent to create the food I binned. It’s also food that could have fed other people.My food waste, whether it’s the mystery container wedged in the back of the fridge or the past-sell-by date beans on my cupboard shelves, must stop. That’s why I’ve committed to reducing my food waste in 2020.Why I\u0027m making my home more eco-friendlyThat means getting a handle on what comes in my kitchen and what goes back out. It also means taking a critical look at the food choices I’m making. If I want my kitchen to be more sustainable then it’s time to ask some tough questions. Where do the foods I eat come from? What impact do they make on the earth? Can I justify eating avocados or pouring almond milk on my cereal? And the elephant – scratch that, cow – in the room, can I be an ethical omnivore?I’m going to learn more about food labelling to find out what it tells us, and what it doesn’t. I’ll figure out how to cut down on plastic in my kitchen and waste in my cooking. I’ll embrace my leftovers and think before I buy.I’ll make my kitchen and my cooking more sustainable in 2020, one meal at a time.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They are therefore happy for IMG to offer the rights to screen these games to the Football Association or another appropriate body so that the games can be viewed for free by the public with immediate effect.Finding a free platform became the responsibility of the FA, with IMG understood to only be mandated to sell betting streams.It’s understood that any free platform will need to be geo-blocked to prevent users from outside the UK accessing the streams, in order to protect overseas deals struck by IMG.The FA\u0027s \u0027Heads Up\u0027 mental health awareness campaign was promoted ahead of last weekend\u0027s third-round ties, which given the link between problem gambling and mental health issues was especially embarrassing for the governing body.Sports minister Nigel Adams, who joined the chorus of criticism and calls for the FA to reconsider the deal, welcomed the announcement from the betting companies on Thursday, writing on Twitter: I welcome this statement by BetGameCouncil following my remarks in the Commons this morning. It\u0027s now over to FA \u0026amp IMG to ensure that fans can view these FA Cup games without needing to register for or to place a bet.Additional reporting by PAThe latest football headlines direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Parasite was awarded the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture in a Foreign Language at the ceremony on 6 January, and won the esteemed Palme d’Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. The film has been tipped for the Oscars, including as a strong contender for the Best Picture category.Created with Sketch.19 films to look out for in 2020 Show all 19Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An intoxicating and romantic drama about lovers on the run, Queen \u0026amp Slim marks the first feature film from Melina Matsoukas, the director responsible for music videos including Beyoncé’s “Formation”. Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith are the unlikely couple thrust together on a go-nowhere blind date, only for tragedy to transform them into folk heroes roaming across the USA searching for shelter. It’s a spellbinding debut. (Adam White) Guaranteed to be one of the major players in next year’s Oscars, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite works better the less you know about it. What you should know is that it is a devilishly inventive deconstruction of class, brimming with energy, dark humour and nervous tension. (Adam White) Rising from the ashes of the aborted Universal Monsters multiverse, which was due to star Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise, this rebooted Invisible Man uses the iconic branding to tell the smaller and far more intriguing story of a woman on the run from her invisible ex. Elisabeth Moss is the domestic violence survivor convinced that her supposedly dead boyfriend has merely mastered the art of invisibility. Leigh Whannell, who directed 2018’s wonderfully inventive sci-fi thriller Upgrade, is behind the camera. (Adam White) A Quiet Place would surely have been better off as a standalone film, but the financial success of writer-director John Krasinski’s B-movie-style horror tale put paid to that. This isn’t to say there’s no more story to tell. In fact, Krasinski made no secret of the fact he had a whole universe he could one day explore, and sure enough, joining returning stars Emily Blunt, Millicent Thomas and Noah Jupe (so brilliant in Honey Boy) are new additions in the form of Cillian Murphy and Djimon Honsou.

No Time to Die, Craig’s final outing as the super-spy, also boasts an intoxicating array of talent on and off screen, from Cary Fukunaga on directorial duties, to a script co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge and cast newcomers including Ana de Armas, Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch. (Adam White) Little is known about the plot for Antebellum, the feature film debut of artists and music video directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz.

(Adam White)719 The Woman in the WindowAn adaptation of the pulpy bestseller (which itself was engulfed in mystery when a New Yorker feature claimed its author, AJ Finn, had extensively lied about his personal life and history), The Woman in the Window puts Amy Adams centre stage for the first time since 2018’s Sharp Objects. She’s an agoraphobic psychologist convinced she has witnessed a murder across the street from her apartment. Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Brian Tyree Henry co-star. (Adam White) Watchmen star Yahya Abdul-Mateen III continues his incredible ascent with the starring role in this remake. Produced by the ubiquitous Jordan Peele, the new Candyman revives the hook-handed killer originated in 1992’s genuinely terrifying Bernard Rose film, but with a black and female director and predominantly black cast – which ought to mean the frustratingly ambiguous racial themes of the original can finally be given their due. (Adam White) The sequel to 2017’s mega successful Wonder Woman is a rare thing: a DC film worthy of excitement. The first outing saw Patty Jenkins become the highest-grossing woman director in cinema history, and she’s looking to beat her own record with a follow-up centred on the Amazon princess’s battle against a villain named Cheetah (Kristen Wiig in her superhero film debut). That Jenkins describes it as “a grand tentpole like they use to make in the 1980s” is reason alone to mark its release on your 2020 calendar.

Jamie Foxx is a struggling musician who finally gets his big break, only to experience a freak accident that propels him into a mysterious netherworld in which souls are imbued with talents and passions, before being implanted in newborn babies. It looks gorgeous, is potentially insane, and is co-written by Tina Fey. (Adam White) Hours after the first reviews of both Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Cats took over social media, Warner Bros dropped the trailer for Tenet, Christopher Nolan’s top secret espionage thriller. It’s fair to say plenty of sunshine was stolen – and for good reason. Tenet marks Nolan’s return to the mind-melting thrills of Inception and, while the plot remains unknown, it seems to focus on a team of heroes who must rewind time to prevent the outbreak of war. Sign us up. (Jacob Stolworthy) Tom Cruise is taking a (short) break from carrying out impossible missions in 2020. Instead, he’ll return to the cockpit for a sequel to the daddy of all Eighties films, Top Gun. There’ll surely be an element of “teach new dogs old tricks” in the Joseph Kosinski-directed film as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell mentors a new generation of US Navy fighter pilots. We’re hopeful the result will – wait for it – take our breath away. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1319 Barb and Star Go to Vista Del MarIt’s not the Bridesmaids sequel everyone begged for nearly a decade ago, but Barb and Star is its spiritual follow-up at least. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumulo, the women behind the 2011 smash, write and star in this new comedy, playing two best friends who venture out of their small Midwestern community for the very first time. They soon get mixed up in a villainous plot to kill an entire town, while Jamie Dornan and Damon Wayans Jr also star. (Adam White) 1419 The Many Saints of NewarkWhether you like it or not, a film prequel based on The Sopranos is being released in 2020. The presence of David Chase, the HBO show’s creator, goes a long way to abate any concerns fans might have, and it’ll at least be a fine chance to explore the mobsters’s family history. The film is expected to focus on Dickie Moltisanti, the father of Christopher, whose memory loomed large over the series. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1519 Last Night in SohoEdgar Wright is adding “psychological horror” to his filmmaking repertoire with Last Night in Soho, a neon-soaked thrill ride starring quite the ensemble (Anya Taylor-Joy, Matt Smith, Diana Rigg). The intriguing plot focuses on a young girl for whom “time falls apart” after she’s somehow transported to the 1960s. It sounds like a cult hit in waiting. (Jacob Stolworthy) The feel-good West End smash is transformed into a feel-good movie, with Richard E Grant, Sarah Lancashire and Sharon Horgan leading the story of a teenage boy who overcomes insecurity by embracing drag. Newcomer Max Harwood portrays the title character. (Adam White) Regardless of whether you’re a keen follower of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or not, The Eternals should pique your interest. Sure, it may be spearheading a brand new phase of Marvel franchises – there really is no end to the studios’ box office stronghold – but it features what has to be one of the most eclectic casts ever seen in a superhero film: Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry and Salma Hayek.

(Adam White)Whether the limited series will entail a spin-off of the feature film or an English language remake is unclear. Bong and McKay will be working to produce the series from CJ Entertainment, the studio behind Parasite, McKay’s Hyperobject Industries, and Kate Street Picture Company, a production house founded by Bong’s producing partner, Dooho Choi.Although things appear to be moving quickly for Parasite’s TV adaption, HBO’s corporate sibling TNT is still in the long process of adapting Bong’s previous feature film, Snowpiercer. The drama series, to which Bong is not attached, has been in the works for over four years and has already faced a number of hurdles including a change in director and network.Parasite is Bong’s seventh feature film, all of which have also been widely praised by both critics and the public. Others include the drama-mystery Mother, drama-comedy Barking Dogs Never Bite, and most recently the heart-wrenching drama-sci fi, Okja.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In chasing the source of the strangely uniform pulses, a team of geologists in Germany have painstakingly reconstructed the collapse of what is believed to be one of the largest magma reservoirs in the earth’s upper mantle.The collapse occurred as a result of the birth of a huge volcano on the sea floor, which the team say is the first time scientists have\u0026nbspproperly observed such an event.The volcano entered the world several months before the seismic hums were detected, to the rumble of thousands of “seemingly tectonic” earthquakes – including one large magnitude 5.8 event – near Mayotte, an area relatively bereft of seismic activity for some 4,000 years previously.Then came the mysterious pulses. Scientists now calculate that with their arrival, Mayotte – which has a population of more than 250,000 people – also began to sink and shift eastwards, moving almost 20cm to date.Amid various fantastical suggestions for what could be responsible, the idea that the pulses could be linked to volcanic activity began to gain traction. Sure enough, in May 2019 a group of French researchers discovered the existence of a new underwater volcano near Mayotte.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Lewis says that while Corbyn\u0027s leadership contributed to Labour\u0027s heavy defeat in the December election, the problems in the party\u0027s heartlands go back decades and must be addressed Corbyn’s constituency neighbour and friend, Emily Thornberry, has been critical of the party’s Brexit stance, but has remained loyal to the leadership and has represented the Labour Party on various overseas visits. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner has joined the contest for deputy leadership of the party. After ruling herself out of running for the leadership, the Ashton-under-Lynne MP launched her bid for deputy warning that Labour faces the biggest challenge in its history and must win or die. She is close with leadership contender Rebecca Long BaileyShadow sport minister Rosena Allin-Khan said Labour need to listen with humility to lost voters as she launched her bid for the deputy leadership. Writing in The Independent, the MP for Tooting refelcted: We shouldn’t have ignored the warning signs in Scotland, and now we’ve paid the price in northern England, across the midlands and in Wales.Shadow women and equalities secretary Dawn Butler was first to announce her bid for the deputy leadership. The Brent Central MP has served in Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s shadow cabinet since 2016Labour\u0027s only MP in Scotland said that the architects of the party\u0027s catastrophic failure in the December election can not be allowed to lead the party forwardShadow foreign minister Mahmood said living in the West Midlands puts him in the ideal place to win back lost voters as he launched his bid for the deputy leadership. I’m not part of the metropolitan elite but in Birmingham, the workshop of Britain. I want to rebuild our country and the Labour Party.Shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon is standing as a continuity candidate, flaunting his loyalty to Jeremy Corbyn and saying it is wrong to blame the current leader for the election defeatHe continued: “We’re a democracy, I’d rather see us as citizens than subjects in the 21st\u0026nbspcentury. Let’s talk about what a modern state looks like and what the role of the royal family would be in that.“I’m in favour of more democracy – let the British public decide what the future of the monarchy is and what shape it should be. I don’t consider myself a subject, I think I’m a citizen of this country and I think the vast majority of people consider themselves citizens.”Phillips, Nandy and Long Bailey pass first Labour leadership hurdleThe suggestion comes after a torrid few weeks for the royal family, during which Prince Andrew was forced to step back from public duties over his relationship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026nbspcaused shock waves by announcing they were abandoning most of their royal duties.Mr Lewis said: “As regards to the royal family,\u0026nbspI completely respect the right of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026nbspto do what they’ve done – it’s a matter for them.“I think it’s extremely unfortunate and a sign of the media we have that they feel they have to do this. If you look at the intrusion on their lives, if you look at the racism that Meghan Markle\u0026nbsphas experienced in the British media then I can understand why given what’s happened.”However, he later clarified his comments about the monarchy, insisting he had not called for the royal family to be abolished.He tweeted: “In response to my comments about the royal family. I didn’t say they should be abolished, I have lots of respect for the hard work they do. I simply think the question about their size and the money they receive should be one for the public. Asking these questions is democratic.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The governmental wing had previously paid for him to have an electric wheelchair, but much of his home remains inaccessible\u0026nbspfor wheelchair users.On the day before Christmas Eve he was asked to sign paperwork for Medicare – the federal health insurance programme for the elderly and people with disabilities – while being told to put forward his own money as a co-payment.Instead, the veteran declined, saying the legs should instead be paid for by the VA’s office in full. In response, a Hanger employee removed his legs.As a veteran with PTSD, cannabis helps me fight for myselfMedicare did not send me to Vietnam, Mr\u0026nbspHolliman told the newspaper. I was sent there by my country ... with the understanding that if something bad happened to me, that it would be covered by the VA.The prosthetics were returned shortly after the veteran spoke to his local newspaper, according to reports, but he has since claimed the company will not make adjustments required so that he can use the legs properly – adding that they are essentially useless to him without modifications.Meghan Williams, a spokeswoman for Hanger, said: “It is our policy, in accordance with regulatory guidelines, to follow up with every patient we see and make necessary device adjustments through delivery and for at least 90 days afterwards.“We are committed to empowering human potential, and want to see our patients regain their mobility and independence.Susan Varcie, a spokeswoman at the VA Medical Center in Jackson, said she could not comment on Mr\u0026nbspHolliman\u0027s case due to privacy laws.Department of Veterans Affairs\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She and the other two main candidates patrolled city streets appealing for support during the day, as supporters gathered on Friday evening for final campaign rallies.In the southern city of Kaohsiung, backers of Ms Tsai’s chief opponent, Han Kuo-yu of the opposition Nationalist Party, waved red and blue Taiwan flags, blew horns and chanted their support. Another candidate, James Soong of the smaller People First Party, also planned a rally.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMs\u0026nbspTsai’s party lost badly in local elections 14 months ago. But she has gotten a boost from hostile words and actions from China and months of anti-government protests in Hong Kong, which she says show Beijing’s “one country, two systems” formula for governing Taiwan is untenable.The island’s high-tech economy has also helped. Stock prices have remained robust and wages risen slightly, partly thanks to Taiwanese exporters relocating from China to cut costs and avoid the bruising effects of the US-China trade war.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Vets and volunteers treat koalas at Kangaroo Island Wildlife Park, southwest of Adelaide, AustraliaDevotees follow the carriage transporting the statue of the Black Nazarene during an annual religious procession in its honour in Manila.

The Nationalists hold 35 seats, with the rest taken by minor parties and independents.Taiwan elections generally revolve around economic, public welfare and social justice issues, China’s threat to annex the island by force always looms large in the background.Even more so this year.China has taken an especially hard-line against Ms Tsai since her 2016 inauguration, infuriated by her refusal to endorse its claim that Taiwan and the mainland belong to a single China.Beijing cut off all formal ties with her government, restricted visits by Chinese tourists, excluded Taiwan’s representatives from international gatherings and peeled away more of the island’s dwindling diplomatic allies, leaving it with just 15.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Chinese state media have been notably silent on the election campaign.Analysts say the low-key approach masks a more subtle campaign to back Mr Han and Nationalist candidates for the legislature through media manipulation and social media campaigns.Seeking to scupper such attempts, the legislature last month passed an anti-infiltration bill laying out fines and prison sentences for those seeking to manipulate Taiwan’s political system on behalf of China or other foreign powers.In comments to the international media on Thursday, Taiwan’s foreign minister Joseph Wu said Ms Tsai’s government doesn’t plan to rock the boat with a formal declaration of independence.“Maintaining the status quo is in the best interest of everyone concerned. We will not provoke any conflict with China, but we are absolutely determined to defend Taiwan’s democracy,” Mr Wu said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Do I feel diminished, I wondered, very briefly Nah, I concluded, sod that. Good shot. And good riddance. I felt no more regret than when I squash a tick from my dog’s back.Soleimani was a vile man. He orchestrated terrorist attacks which caused death, misery and mayhem for millions across the Middle East and beyond.He was in Iraq planning attacks against our own forces as well as American ones. And he was doing so in the service of a country which has a pretty good claim to being the worst in the world — Iran.Hell, even North Korea can’t match Iran for its support of worldwide terrorism and the multiple murders in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Israel and Yemen.Iran is a pariah state, a thoroughly odious religious dictatorship, under which homosexuals are executed, Christians and Jews persecuted.Where there is no freedom of speech, no freedom of conscience, no freedom for women to wear what they want or do what they want.An economically wrecked Stone Age nest of barbarians whose government has spent the past  years waging war against anyone and everyone — but largely, it has to be said, other Muslim nations.Oh, and shoring up its malign influence across the whole of the wretched Middle East. And trying very hard to develop nuclear weapons so it can cause even more devastation — mainly to the area’s only democracy, our ally Israel.No wonder, then, that Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, has a soft spot for Iran. It hates us — and therefore the deluded halfwit is on its side. Asked about the killing of Soleimani, he denounced the USand refused to accept that Soleimani was a terrorist.Meanwhile, so-called “experts” have been suggesting Donald Trump’s missile strike will increase tensions and could even lead to a Third World War.What rubbish. As my dad might have put it, Iran doesn’t have a pot to p**s in.The same experts were saying Iran would wait and carefully consider its options before launching some devastating attack. Wrong, wrong again.It waited about half an hour before lobbing a bunch of crap rockets at US bases, which killed no American soldiers at all, according to reports.I’m not in favour of getting involved in the Middle East’s politics, unless they are targeting our people or our interests.I was against the invasion of Iraq and against the bombing of Libya. Against our involvement in Syria, too.But here was a clear case where an agent from a hugely hostile foreign government was fomenting trouble in a country — Iraq — full of US and British troops.One missile got rid of him. Another might get rid of whoever takes his place. Countries such as Iran need to know that the tide has turned. We won’t put up with their continual sponsorship of terrorism.Especially in the north of the country. This month the TransPennine service is cutting almost HALF of its trains, causing havoc for commuters. It’s offered passengers with a season ticket a three-per-cent rebate. Brilliant.Meanwhile, Northern Trains is about to be stripped of its franchise. About time. The service I use looks like it was dug up from a disused railway line in Czechoslovakia in about . South Western Railway is in trouble, too.Here’s what to do. Take them into public ownership. It’s one of the few Labour policies that the public liked. And it would prove that this is a government which will act even when it’s against the Conservative instinct.And then scrap HS and spend the money on improving the rolling stock and infrastructure between our great northern cities.Sound like a plan, Mr Johnson and Mr Cummings ENJOYING the Labour leadership contest  Never has the party seemed so hilariously irrelevant.One of the frontrunners, Rebecca Long-Baileywas asked what she thought of Jeremy Corbyn’s election campaign. She said she gave it “ten out of ten”. And kept a straight face.The worst performance in  years. Rebecca, love, the people voted in just  Labour MPs. That means they gave Corbyn less than three out of ten for his campaign. Meanwhile, Dr Rosena Allin-Khan is hoping to be deputy leader. Heard of her  Nope, me neither.She has suggested we should have a Ministry of Fabulosity, where “fabulous MPs” think up “fabulous things”. She also suggested that instead of a debate, MPs could have a Strictly-style “dance-off, because we all love a boogie”.Is she six years old  Or just out of her brainbox on horse tranquilisers This is the party, remember, that gave Britain the National Health Service, welfare state and decent education. And its leadership is being contested by people with the combined IQ of a tub of BQ tile grout.Ha.The brilliant Russian comedian Konstantin Kisin has a good answer to that: “If the Russians had been involved in Brexit, it wouldn’t have taken more than three years. It would have been one meeting – we’re out. And we’d have taken a big chunk of France with us.”TERRIBLE news. The left-wing journalist Owen Jones has announced he will be cutting back dramatically on the time he spends talking utter b*****ks on Twitter.What on earth shall we all do  I hope the Government might set up a counselling service for those of us grief-stricken by Owen’s decision.He does have a point, mind. Twitter is a moronic institution. It reflects the views of a tiny proportion of the people and is largely filled with obsessive maniacs shrieking abuse at each other.Twitterstorms, as they call them, matter less than a handful of dust.They are just maniacs, from the left or right, desperate to be outraged.Do yourself an even bigger favour, Owen, and leave Twitter entirely.I CAN’T quite get into Veganuary. I’ve tried – I ate some peas the other night, for example.But I can’t be doing with the ious supplements vegans have to take to stop them dropping dead.Also, vegan sausages taste like the seat lining from a Toyota Corolla.Instead, then, I’ve decided to embrace Januhairy. This is where women stop shaving their front bottoms and end up with vast thickets of undergrowth in which deer and rabbits frolic with gay abandon.Now, I was never in the habit of shaving down near my old fella. Not least in case the razor slipped. But there’s plenty of surplus hair I did keep in check – poking out of my nostrils, hanging down from my ears and sprouting from my eye-brows. I’m going to leave all that alone for a month.Soyou see an overweight northerner coming towards you, who looks like a cross between Hagrid and Denis Healey, you’ll know it’s me.IT’S Bafta time again and of course there’s the usual moaning about a lack of ersity in the nominations. Why no black actors  Why no female directors The answer to these questions might be that on this occasion the judges reckoned the best performances came from actors who happened to be white, and directors who happened to be men.Equality does not mean every single thing in our lives should be made up of an equal proportion of black people, disabled people, gay people, women and so on.Some harridan even had a go at Margot Robbie because she was nominated twice and happens to be white. Get real, you race-obsessed bores.And good luck to the lovely Margot. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Britain will not be bound by Brussels.Yes, goods will flow less freely at our borders.

Without fail, Corbyn takes our enemies’ side.It’s not hard to condemn Soleimani as a terrorist. It’s not “siding with Donald Trump” to do so. But Corbyn can’t.What concerns him is not eliminating the architect of Iran’s slaughter across the Middle East — the monster who killed British and US troops. It’s ­Soleimani’s rights under international law — and Trump’s potential “illegality”.Such are the warped values of the man who could have become our PM. Who took money to broadcast on the state TV channel of a rogue regime that executes gay men.Who is, incredibly, rated “ten out of ten” as leader by wannabe successor Rebecca Long Bailey.Millions deserted Labour because, among many other reasons, they saw that its leaders loathe Britain. The party is finishedthose extremists keep hold of it.SO much for the BBC squealing it is too poor to continue free licences for over-s.It gets £.billion a year from the public, of course. But its commercial ision has topped it up with £million profit, selling nature shows to the US.That alone would cut OAPs’ licences by a third. It wouldn’t be hard to find the rest. And since licence-payers bankrolled these lucrative programmes, why shouldn’t they get the profits back BBC funding, via a compulsory “tax” enforced by courts, is an absurdity in a new era of quality subscription TV.Non-payment must be decriminalised – then the licence scrapped and the Beeb forced to join the st Century.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We will have to prioritise.A Downing Street spokeswoman said: The PM reiterated that we wanted a broad free trade agreement covering goods and services, and co-operation in other areas.The PM was clear that the UK would not extend the Implementation Period beyond  December  and that any future partnership must not involve any kind of alignment or ECJjurisdiction."},{"url":null,"title":"prince harry meghan markle split minister palace","story":"Last night the top Royals shocked the country with their announcement they were stepping back from their Royal duties and would spend more time in North America - as revealed by The Sun  hours earlier.Buckingham Palace issued a statement later saying the discussions with the Duke, , and Duchess, , about splitting themselves off would be complicated.A Palace spokeswoman said talks were “at an early stage”, adding: “We understand their desire to take a dferent approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through.”This morning Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick echoed the Palaces statement, saying there were issues to work through.Mr Jenrick told LBC Radio: These are decisions that they will need to take.Buckingham Palace issued a statement which said, and I think this is right, that clearly the decision of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex raises a range of quite complex questions around their future rule, security, housing and so on.These are issues now Her Majesty, the Queen, the Royal Household, will now need to work through.And he said that the Royals would likely continue to be funded by the taxpayer in future, saying there are long-standing rules and guidelines around the funding of the family.What we know so far: London Mayor Sadiq Khan said this morning he was sad to see the couple step back from some of their work.Im a bit disappointed, he told LBC Radio.Ive seen, since Meghan got engaged with Harry, how people of colour have been really proud of Harry and Meghan.They do brilliant work, like Harry does for the Invictus Games.And he added that it was an operational decision made by the Met police whether they receive less money to protect them.The couple said last night: After many months of reflection and internal discussions, we have chosen to make a transition this year in starting to carve out a progressive new role within this institution.Prince Harry and Meghan could continue to get funded from his father, Prince Charles estate in future.The couple say they will be financially independent as they carve out a progressive new role, but will still support the Queen.It comes after The Sun revealed they were due to discuss plans to move abroad, and Meghan yesterday visited The Nationals Dorfman Theatre in London.The couple had reportedly told close friends they want to spend some of the next two months working out of Canada after a six-week trial holiday over Christmas and New Year was deemed highly successful.Friends of the couple in Canada and the US are supportive of the move, which they say comes after the couple have been sidelined by the monarchy.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At least Greta follows through on what shes saying.So its understandable that most Brits would feel a little confused by the couples actions and lash out against their hypocrisy.But to say this is because Meghan is mixed race is totally ridiculous.In  Meghan was welcomed into the royal family with open arms by the Queen, with royal commentator Duncan Larcombe telling The Sun that Her Majesty made an  “unusual effort” with her grandsons we as she didnt want her to feel alienated.The Queens approval of Meghan and Harrys wedding spoke volumes, signying how the reigning monarch was moving with the times by allowing a orcee to marry into the establishment - something she was unable to do for her own sister, Princess Margaret.Meghans African-American heritage did not factor into the Queens decision to allow them to marry - and nor should it now be considered as a reason behind the Sussexes radical departure.Its estimated that almost  million Brits tuned in to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle say I do - a national gesture that said: We support you.If Meghan and Harry are indeed attempting to flee racism, then North America is hardly the ideal place to go - when Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, was not long ago outed for blacking up, just a day after admitting such behaviour was racist. The hypocrisy is embarrassing.And is the US really any better  President Trump has repeatedly claimed that hes the least racist person that youve ever encountered and yet he thinks it is acceptable to propose a ban on all Muslims entering the US and call Mexican immigrants criminals and rapists...Equally, Hollywood is the home of #metoo and #oscarssowhite - hardly a perfect model of racial justice and equality.But now as a huge eff off to the Queen, Meghan and Harry have formed deeper ides than ever before by choosing to orce from the family that made them the most famous couple in the world.The relentless scrutiny the royals come under is undoubtedly a heavy burden - and its not hard to be sympathetic to the Sussexes plight.However, this doesnt take away from the fact that an evident lack of gratitude has been shown towards the Queen in the past  hours.In going behind Her Majestys back and springing this announcement on her without warning - the Sussexes deserve to be criticised.All members of the royal family have come under fire at some point or other - even six year old Prince George, who was cruelly mocked for taking ballet classes by a US TV host.But it seems thatthe same thing happens to our dear duchess, we must hold our tongues.A persons race doesnt excuse disgraceful behaviour andanyone is going to call the royals up on it, its going to be the public.The currents have turned against Meghan for many reasons, but not because the nation is suddenly racist.The royal couple say they will be financially independent as they carve out a progressive new role.But given that we will more than likely be shelling out millions into the Sussexes relocation to Canada with round-the-clock security teams, a royal entourage and staff members - we should at least be able have the chance to freely voice our critiques without having to worry about being branded racist as a consequence.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The whole world loved him.But over the past two years his relationship with the media has not just turned sour — it has become toxic.I haven’t seen him look really happy for a long time.Often he seems totally miserable.To go from being the most popular member of the Royal Family to where people barely care about you, something has to have gone seriously wrong.Last September I went with him on a visit to Lealands High School in Luton, where the children went crazy for him.As they queued to be hugged by the Prince he had a massive smile. He was almost like the old Harry.And as I walked away from the school I realised the reason he seemed so happy. Meghan wasn’t there.I am sad to say she is the problem.When she arrived on the scene I welcomed Meghan, and the people did too.On walkabouts outside Edinburgh Castle, in Dublin and Cardf, as well as on their first official foreign engagement in Morocco, the crowds loved her.She often kept Harry waiting because she spent so long chatting to well-wishers.Meghan seemed to me to be doing incredibly well and I thought she was going to be a great ambassador for the UK.Now I am not so sure.Where did it all go wrong Their wedding, just  months ago, was spectacular.Thousands of you turned out in Windsor to cheer them in their carriage, millions more bought souvenir copies of The Sun to keep the memory of that fairytale day.On Christmas Day I watched Prince Charles walk to church at Sandringham with his grandson Prince George.I remembered how, just a year earlier, I had photographed William, Kate, Harry and Meghan all smiles.What had happened in just a year to change everything Harry and Meghan are blaming the media and have cancelled the Rota — a system where each newspaper takes a turn in covering royal engagements and shares the pictures with every publication.Now they are going to ban all newspapers except The Daily .But they should beware, theis a serious newspaper — just ask the MPs who fiddled their expenses.Andit finds the Duke and Duchess of Sussex should be held accountable for something, the paper will inevitably do its duty and inform its readers.But it can’t all be blamed on the media.The clues were there even before the couple’s wedding, when Meghan’s stepbrother wrote letters to Harry telling him: “Whatever you do, don’t marry her.”At the time we thought they had an axe to grind. Looking back, maybe they were right.There is usually a reason why someone marries with just one family member in attendance.No one could have had a better welcome into the Royal Family.Who can forget Prince Charles proudly walking Meghan down the aisle on her wedding day, or the pictures of the Queen and Prince Philip beaming at baby Archie.Despite this, the le Meghan had before is the one she would prefer.Harry is besotted with her and will do anything to keep Meghan happy.But the couple do not seem to have properly worked out their plan for the future.You cannot be half in the UK and half in America.I don’t think you can “pop in” for Trooping the Colour but not be there for Remembrance Sunday.You can’t be patrons of charities and not give them a lot of your time, they depend on royal patronage for their funding and their donations.What’s Harry going to do  Appear on TV shows  Cosy chats with Oprah  Speeches to American millionaires I suspect he will hate that.Will the Sussexes lose their titles as HRH, which bring great privilege and kudos I saw it happen to the Duchess of York. Now Fergie is on American TV flogging Weight Watchers programmes and Wedgwood china to make a living.If that’s what the future holds for Meghan and Harry it will be a sad turn of events.So don’t be stupid, Harry. When you finally spoke to the Queen and your father about your decision yesterday, I hope you listened to what they had to say.Charles is a man who, after the death of Diana and his marriage to Camilla, suffered more adverse publicity than any member of the Royal Family in modern times.He didn’t run away. He didn’t hide. He didn’t criticise. He didn’t ban anybody from the Rota.Charles and Camilla faced up to the criticism, got on with it and showed they were two people who want to do their duty for their country.No matter what bad publicity they have had, they have always looked straight down the camera and won over their critics.Harry has always said his role in le was to support his brother, so what has changed Hopefully, Prince Charles will be our king — but the reality is it won’t be a very long reign. After that William will have this almighty responsibility as monarch.I just hope this feud can end and that Harry willas a full-time member of the Royal Family to support his brother. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There’s a huge amount to work through.“For example, their security is determined by the Home Office as it comes from the Met Police budget.It comes after the pair were warned about a slimmed-down monarchy before being driven out of the royal family, journalist pal Tom Bradby claims.The ITV News reporter also claimed the Palace were not blindsided by the couples bombshell announcement they were stepping down as senior royals.Insiders have revealed the Queen, Prince William and Prince Charles only found about their decision minutes before it broke online.Her Majesty was seen looking stony-faced today as she drove her car around her Sandringham estate, in Norfolk - the first time she has been seen since the news broke.What we know so far: Bradby, who fronted last years documentary, Harry and Meghan: An African Journey, told ITV News: Its certainly not true to say the palace were blindsided by this.The couples view was they came back and wanted to talk to the family about their plans.It had been made clear to them in their absence there was going to be a slimmed down monarchy and they werent really a part of it.Bradby also said the decision follows really bad personal splits within the royal family - with the couple feeling like they had been driven out.And he warned it might it looks like it might get worse, not better for the moment unless the family can broker a peace deal.He said: Thereve been a lot of fallouts - a lot of harsh things were said around the time of the wedding.And its gone a bit too far. And certainly the rest of the family find Harry and Meghan very dficult and, from Harry and Meghan’s point of view, they’re just being driven out as they see it. And its sad.It comes after claims Meghan and Harry felt excluded from the recent line of succession photo which saw The Queen beaming alongside her heirs Prince George, Prince William and Prince Charles.And Her Majesty didnt have any photos of the couple or baby Archie on display during her Christmas message.Pals have claimed Harry and Meghan felt unwelcome in the family and were sidelined as the monarchy moved towards a future focused on Prince William and Prince Charles.This is despite the perks the pair have enjoyed since becoming royalty - including a £million wedding at Windsor Castle watched by millions of people across the globe.They had been due to take up residence in a large apartment at Kensington Palace but they instead moved into Frogmore Cottage after it saw a £.million renovation paid for by the taxpayer.Living at the Palace would have meant they were close to the Prince William and Kate Middleton, who had attempted to make Meghan feel welcome by rolling out the red carpet in Christmas .But the Fab Four fell apart at the end of  when Harry and Meghan quit the joint charitable foundation they were all part of amid rumours the two brothers were at war.And they say they will be financially independent in their new lives - but will still be guarded by taxpayer-funded bodyguards.Insiders now say Prince Harry has “completely changed” since meeting Meghan - said to be the driving force behind their choice.No other members of the Royal Family were consulted before the shock statement was issued on Wednesday and the hurt Monarch was taken by surprise.Last night there were also reports that Harry and Meghan had agreed to do a sit-down interview with American TV host Gayle King.Miss King, who is the chief anchor for CBS, was invited to Meghan’s baby shower in New York last February and has become a close pal.First it relies on them still being bankrolled by an increasingly enraged public — as they magnanimously “work to become financially independent” despite already being worth sums most of us cannot imagine.Second, because when they finally deem their wealth vast enough to cut that umbilical cord, their livelihood will still centre around their image as senior royals . . . a role they have quit.The idea of them busily enriching themselves by flogging their part-time royalty to advertisers will disgust taxpayers — both on principle and because this ­entitled pair will never refund a penny back into Treasury coffers.The UK public will justiably demand they be cut off at the ankles, stripped of the titles on which they trade.What then for plain Meghan and Harry Wales, the narcissist formerly known as Prince Who will listen then to their vapid sermons  They might fancy themselves as the new Clintons or Obamas — but they have not earned their  or status.They were born into it, or married into it, but gave it up when it all looked too dull, too hard and not enough fun.Diehard fans will stick by them. They will doubtless make big money. But the firestorm of criticism they have ignited here will become an inferno.It is a disastrous mess and may get worse. The couple’s assumption about the public continuing to fund round-the-clock security in Canada looks ­premature — and must be reviewed.Harry is worth £million, Meghan another £million. How much richer must they be before they pay that bill Meghan has headed back to Canada to rejoin baby Archie but Harry faces an awkward appearance at Buckingham Palace next Thursday where he is due to host the draw for next year’s Rugby League World Cup.His mum was allowed to keep her title as Diana, Princess of Wales after her orce from Charles — but she did lose Her Royal Highness status.Sarah Ferguson is still the Duchess of York despite losing her HRH.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I can’t disclose his name.”Actress Katharine said she did a “couple of shows” with Meghan when they were at school.She added last year: “She was always lovely and always talented.”Locals on the island first spotted Harry and Meghan around December  enjoying hikes and jogs — with the pair even stopping to take a selfie for another couple on New Year’s Day.They missed the traditional royal Christmas with the Queen and family at Sandringham.The estate agent who sold the Canadian mansion said: “It’s a beautul property, it’s one of the nicest ones on the island. It has great privacy. I think the current owner’s done quite a renovation.”But he went on: “I’ve had to sign an NDA on it and I cannot disclose who owns it now.“I would get myself in a lot of troubleI disclosed anything. I don’t think you’ll ever find out. He does live in America.He’s not famous by any stretch. I haven’t had any contact since he purchased.”Harry is expected to fly back to Canada after an event next Thursday — and their long-haul trips are raising fresh concerns about their environmental credentials.When he eventually s to Britain it will be the Sussexes’ fth transatlantic trip in two months.Depending on the flights, they may have cost up to £, and emitted more than  tons of carbon dioxide.Their spokesman refused to saythey chartered a private jet.Each passenger on a commercialflight to Vancouver from London creates an average of . tons of CO.

She wants to be in the limelight, but under her own terms.Now she will get to make her own rules. It’s perfect for her.

She is running a campaign.This is not just an exit. It is a long-game strategy that has been set in motion for some time.It comes days after they announced they are stepping back and plan to become financially independent.They want to split their time between North America and the UK - with their future roles still being hammered out.The former pal added: She was cut off from her usual channels — her Twitter account or Instagram — which meant she couldn’t speak out on causes the way she wanted. In that silence,I’m sure she convinced Harry to pick a “side” . For her it was never about modernising the Royal Family.The former actress gave up her le in Toronto after she got engaged to Prince Harry, where she had a host of A-list pals and enjoyed lavish private members clubs.There she became close to Jessica and Ben Mulroney, who were dubbed the city’s “most polished power couple”, by Toronto Le magazine.And after reportedly leaving behind former friends, she gained other celeb pals in her inner circle - such as tennis legend Serena Williams after meeting her in , and actress Priyanka Chopra, who she bonded with at an ELLE Women in Television dinner.As royals are locked in crisis talks the pair are hopeful workable solutions can be found sooner rather than later, a source has said.They added said: It is in everyones interest for this to be figured out, and figured out quickly, but not at the expense of the outcome.Harry and Meghan will be able to earn money, and speculation is growing about what they will do.Prince Harry reportedly defied instructions from the Queen not to announce their plans, after she requested he hold off until he talked it over with his father.And Prince Charles told his son he needed more time after he was sent a draft proposal about his future role, particularly on the issue of funding.But it was revealed the Queen reportedly learned she had been ignored when the news broke on TV, and Charles and William only got a statement copy ten minutes before it went live.British taxpayers could still front the £, security bill for the family despite their bombshell pledge to be financially independent.They also get about another £million annually from Prince Charles Duchy Of Lancaster estate - which may not continueCharles chooses to cut off his son.The Sussexes also hope to keep their Frogmore Cottage home, which was refurbished last year at a cost of £.million to the taxpayer.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The -page New Decade, New Approach deal was designed to heap pressure on the two parties to finally end the impasse before Monday’s crunch deadline.Last night the PM tweeted: “This is a great step forwards for the people of Northern Ireland and for restoring public confidence in stable devolved Government and delivering much needed reforms to public services.”Fresh elections would have been triggeredthe parties had failed to agree a deal by Monday.Northern Ireland’s peace process dictates that the executive can onlywith the inclusion of the largest unionist party and the largest nationalist party, which is currently the DUP and Sinn Fein.In a dramatic development last night, Sinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald said the deal provided a “basis to restore power-sharing”.She said: “Were up for that.

He wants to show voters that the country has moved on and the Government is once more focusing on the domestic issues voters care about.But however much he tries, it will be hard to make these talks boring. They are important and there is already DRAMA BREWING.Boris saw the new Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Downing Street this week. The pair got on well in their hour-long meeting. They both want these talks to be less acrimonious than the orce negotiations both want a more cordial tone.The pair reminisced about the school they had both attended in Brussels. Unlike Eton, it didn’t have playing fields, and until Johnson arrived the only game in the playground was marbles. He introduced some more rough and tumble.No were pleased that von der Leyen, rather than the more confrontational Michel Barnier, took the lead. As one No source points out, the EU loathed the lack of clarity and authority under Theresa May: She wasn’t clear what she wanted and it wasn’t certain that she could deliver what she wanted.With Boris and his new majority it is very dferent. He was able to point von der Leyen to the Tory manesto’s commitments on the future trade deal and say this was his mandate and that he was determined to deliver it.Yet despite the pair’s attempt to maintain a friendly tone, there are already tensions. Boris is irritated that the EU keeps saying it is nigh-on impossible to negotiate a full trade deal by December , despite having signed up to a political declaration that commits it to trying to do just that.The DANGER is that the EU thinks that under time pressure Boris will bend, that he will either extend the transition period — something he has repeatedly promised not to do — or drop his commitment to breaking away from EU rules and regulations.Boris is determined not to do either of these things. He doesn’t want to extend and believes in the value of the UK having the right to do things dferently.Both sides have frequently misunderstood each other in this process. Both sides must now realise that the other means what it says. Unless they do, there is going to be an almighty bust-up and no trade deal at the end of all this.THERE will be a National Security Council meeting later this month to decide whether or not to allow the Chinese company Huawei to be involved in the construction of the UK’s G network.This is an issue of fierce debate in Whitehall. Under Theresa May, it led to the then Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson’s sacking from government.Hawkish figures inside government fear No is leaning towards allowing Huawei’s involvement. One complains that Downing Street’s timetable for the technology’s roll-out is, “not realistic”, but that this time pressure means it will need Huawei involved. However, I understand that the Americans are pushing very hard for the UK to bar Huawei.One senior US government national security figure has been in London this week to lobby directly on this point.Before he makes a decision on Huawei, Boris Johnson should consider the damage it could do to Britain’s most important security relationship – the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing agreement with Australia, Canada, the US and New Zealand.Eventhe UK thinks it can manage Huawei’s involvement,our allies do not then we shouldn’t proceed. It is simply not worth the risk of undermining such a vital alliance.Don’t expect his approach to change. His holidays will be far more glam than Cameron and May’s were.THE most common reason British governments fail is that the Prime Minister and the Chancellor fall out.If No and the Treasury – the most powerful department in government – aren’t on the same page, nothing gets done.Boris Johnson and Sajid Javid are determined to avoid this fate. In the run-up to the Budget on March , there will be a huge effort to make sure that the Treasury and No work together.One Johnson ally tells me the two men will have a Budget-focused meeting at the start of each week to make sure they are in agreement on the key issues.Then their teams will meet again mid-week to assess progress. Javid, whose job is safe in the coming reshuffle, is determined to show that the Treasury is capable of delivering on Boris Johnson’s agenda of levelling up across the country.Those close to him are confident that they can put meat on the bones of No’s plan.AT Cabinet this week it was impressed on ministers that one of the most important events this year is COP, the climate change conference the UK is hosting in Glasgow in November.The UK Government wants to use the event to show how Britain can lead on clean growth post-Brexit.I understand there will be a steady drum beat of announcements on this front throughout the year: The Tories want to show they are helping create new green-collar jobs.They also hope that by holding the event in Scotland, they can emphasise the benefits of the Union.THE Labour leadership contest has yet to catch fire.The Tories are not particularly concerned about any of the candidates.Though there is some hesitation about how they would handle PMQs with Jess Phillips, who likes to make very personal attacks on Boris Johnson.But the most interesting candidate in the race is Lisa Nandy.She seems to have the clearest understanding of why Labour lost.Her bid is starting to have faint echoes of David Cameron’s successful tilt at the Tory leadership in .GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Making the announcement on Friday night, Sinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald said the challenges of this time are “absolutely immense”, adding: “Are we able for that  Absolutely. Is Sinn Fein up for that  Absolutely. “And I hope that every other political party and political leader similarly is in the space that we are in today.” The Northern Ireland Secretary of State Julian Smith had warned thatthe deal was not accepted, he would call a fresh assembly election. And the government had indicated that a package of funding for the region dependent on getting an agreement.Prime Minister Boris Johnson welcomed the step.He said: “This is a great step forwards for the people of Northern Ireland and for restoring public confidence in stable devolved Government and delivering much needed reforms to public services.”Public services have been suffering because no locally-elected ministers have been in place to take decisions. Many schools have been unable to balance their budgets and thousands of health workers are staging strikes in protest over pay and staffing. Under the terms of the deal, the new executive will also take action to reduce spiralling hospital waiting lists increase the number of police officers on the beat and resolve an industrial dispute involving teachers. The UK government has described funding for the region as a major Treasury-funded financial package to tackle a host of acute problems facing a public sector.  The Sinn Fein president said: “The first action we believe of the incoming executive must be to deliver pay parity to health workers.” The last DUP Sinn Fein-led coalition government collapsed in January  over a row about a botched green energy scheme. That row subsequently widened to take in more traditional wrangles on matters such as the Irish language and the thorny legacy of the Troubles. The wide-ranging deal, which was published by the UK and Irish governments on Thursday night, contains compromise solutions to those vexed disputes.  Ms McDonald welcomed “official legal recognition of the Irish language for the first time” and said she wanted to commend activists who campaigned for it.The Sinn Féin president also welcomed measures to deal with the legacy of the Troubles in Northern Ireland and changes to a controversial Stormont’s veto known as the Petition of Concern.“We now have legislation to deal with legacy cases, which is to be delivered within  days, we have reform of the Petition of Concern to try and end its misuse as a veto by one political party,” she said. But the deal means Sinn Fein must accept aof Arlene Foster as First Minister - despite previously demanding she go over the ‘cash for ash’ scandal.Foster described the proposals as a “fair and balanced deal”.  “I know there will be challenges in the deal, not least we need to make sure we have the finances to be able to deal with all of the issues in Northern Ireland that are present at the moment, particularly in and around the health sector.”  Ms McDonald said her party will continue to work for Irish reunication, adding: “And we want to ensure that the criteria for ensuring the triggering of an Irish unity poll are set out, and that planning for Irish is stepped up, including the convening of a national forum to discuss and plan for the future.”Flanked by party colleagues, she said: “Three years ago, Martin McGuinness set down a challenge to all of us, to get it right and to deliver for all, for every single citizen.“And now we need to go to work.” "},{"url":null,"title":"5 key celebs meghan harry","story":"News key celebs Meghan and Harry will turn to as they carve out le away from royalsThe Duchess of Sussex is known to have missed her group of celebrity friends, which also includes the actress Janina Gavankar, while she was living in the UK as a senior royalShareCommentsByRussell Myers:,  JAN NewsThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex \" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

The mum-of-two went with Lilly back to the store and successfully retrieved the order. I went in with her to challenge the lady and her reply was a rather rude ‘nope she’s underage we don’t serve under  anymore’, said Claire. I explained we had already ordered and paid and she was purely collecting. She reverted to allowing her after I’d challenged their replies. When she shared details of her ordeal online Claire was told that youths causing troubles had led to the ban. We later found out it’s because of other older kids causing so much trouble, she said. It always ruins it for the younger kids.  I’d seen posts about the kids causing trouble, but I had no idea of the refusal of service after certain hours.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailIn the early hours of August , , the Queen sat in her dressing gown at Balmoral Castle beside a sobbing Prince of Wales. They had just been informed, via a call from Paris, that Princess Diana had been killed in a car crash. Despite being numb with shock, the monarch’s first thought was to protect her grandsons William and Harry, whose lives were about to implode. She persuaded Charles to wait until morning before breaking the shattering news and ordered that all radios, TVs and newspapers be removed to shield the young princes. Then, rather thanto London to mourn with her subjects, she stayed closeted in her castle and tried to support “those poor boys”. It was one of the rare occasions when the Queen put family before duty – yet it led to a national outcry and accusations that she was distant, unfeeling. But it also sparked a touching new relationship with Diana’s boys and a special affinity with -year-old Harry, so patently damaged by his mother’s death. “Granny” became the most important female role model in his le until he met his future we Meghan. His nanny Tiggy-Legge Bourke was the cuddly surrogate mum – but the Queen was a counsellor, adviser and inspiration. She shared his love of country pursuits, his passion for the military and his impish sense of humour. Who can forget them both glowing with pride at Harry’s Sandhurst passing- out ceremony in  or the cheeky looks between them in the video he persuaded her to make to promote his Invictus Games in   “I absolutely adore my grandmother,” he said in an interview marking her th birthday, “but I always view her as the Queen – the boss.” When viewing footage of the -year-old Princess Elizabeth pledging her le to the service of the Commonwealth, he declared: “It’s a hugely moving speech.  “It’s incredible to know that someone at that age appreciated and understood exactly what was expected of them. To basically put duty ahead of everything  so early in her le is quite remarkable.” But Harry seemed to have an equally strong sense of duty, serving his country in the Army then forging a role as a Commonwealth Youth Ambassador with his new bride Meghan Markle . Ah yes – Meghan, the “breath of fresh air” we all took to our hearts when we saw how she had captured Harry’s. The orced, mixed-race, US actress and humanitarian who would aid the monarchy’s modernisation and give Harry the family and sense of purpose he craved. No wonder the Queen looked so delighted when the Duke and Duchess introduced her to their baby Archie. Poor lost Harry had found his other half, his happy ever after. So how can it be that, eight months on, he appears to have totally lost the plot  How could he have defied his Granny – his “boss” – with such callous disregard for her feelings, not to mention those of his father and brother  The -year-old Queen is left feeling angry, wounded and betrayed by the Sussexes’ arrogant attempt to create their own brand of royalty.  A move apparently prompted by the pair’s perception that Meghan has been “bullied”, “hounded” and “vilied”. When it looks to be more about her need to own the limelight, rather than take second billing to future Queen Kate and for them both to make a fortune out of Hollywood-style celebrity status while playing at saving the planet. Harry is so besotted with his older, charismatic, psychobabble-spouting we that it seems his personality is subsumed into hers. This fun-loving bloke has become the Prince of Woke and, while Meghan may have opened his eyes to many important issues, you can’t help feeling he has lost his sense of self. A former friend of his told me: “We all know people who’ve met a new partner and begun to distance themselves from old pals and relatives, becoming part of the other’s circle. “But when Meghan got engaged to Harry she cut herself off from family and old mates – and the only friends at their wedding were her A-list celebrity ones. “Now she and Harry are cutting themselves off from his family – yet expect to keep all perks and privileges, because being royal is their big selling point.

Trouble flared between Ian King and Wayne Whatling following an exchange of texts in which the former accused the latter of having an affair with his ex-partner.They arranged to meet in the car park of a football club in Milford Haven, Wales to sort out their dferences, Wales Online reported .King, , drove up to the scene in his VW Golf car where he met Whatling, , who was on foot and brandishing a baseball bat. The pair exchanged words, which prompted Whatling to smash one of the windows of the otheraposs car. King put his foot on the accelerator and drove around Whatling, performing handbrake turns and donuts next to his love rival. The man on foot ran and King followed, pulling out of the car park and speeding down a road. He crashed into Whatlingaposs BMW, pushing it into the car in front. The court heard that such was the force of the crash, firefighters had to attend to separate the mangled cars. All three suffered extensive damage and were written off. The two men then continued raging at one another in the street.  At Swansea Crown Court Dean Pulling, prosecuting, said King was accusing Whatling of having an affair with his ex-partner. King, of Dewsland Street, Milford Haven, had previously pleaded guilty to dangerous driving, and Whatling, of Prescelly Place, Milford Haven, to possession of an offencive weapon and criminal damage when they appeared together in the dock for sentencing. The court heard King has four previous convictions for seven offences, and Whatling has seven convictions for  offences, including one for possession of an offence weapon - namely a piece of wood with nails in it. Ashanti-Jade Walton, mitigating for King, said the incident had all the hallmarks of immaturity, adding that the pair had been acting like children on the day in question.  She said King was ashamed and disgusted that he was back in court after  law-abiding years. Stuart John, for Whatling, said the defendant had found himself in a very emotive situation after being accused of having a relationship with Kingaposs then partner. The advocate said his client accepted he had made the wrong choice in getting involved in the confrontation.  Judge Geraint Walters said it was plain both defendants had anger management issues, and had behaved in an outrageous manner. He said: It is obvious the two of you thought you would sort out your dferences with violence. Your behaviour was completely lawless - it played out as a public spectacle which much have been terrying for anybody who observed it.

There have been claims the couple were worried they would be cut off by brother Prince William when he takes over the Prince of Wales role and the finances of the Duchy of Cornwall, which the Cambridges and Sussexes rely on. ITV Newsapos Tom Bradby, who is close to the couple and travelled to South Africa with them to film their controversial documentary, has said it had been made clear to them that the monarchy would be slimmed down. When the Queen dies Prince Charles becomes King and his vision of a slimmed down monarchy will become a reality. Both Charles and William are in agreement this should happen and have recently stepped up working together on a number of royal issues, including the Prince Andrew scandal and their united voice on climate change. Many believe Harry and Meghan pressed the nuclear button to get ahead of the curve as relations between them and the rest of the family are at rock bottom. Prince William and we Kate - who looked downcast yesterday while out driving on her th birthday - have been told by the Queen they have more responsibility than ever now to ensure the familyaposs future. One close source said Harry made the decision to end his royal career after falling out with William and fearing he would be cut off from the family fundshe did not move. Mr Bradby said: Itaposs certainly not true to say the palace were blindsided by this. The coupleaposs view was they came back and wanted to talk to the family about their plans.  It had been made clear to them in their absence there was going to be a slimmed down monarchy and they werenapost really a part of it.Meghan and Harry were reportedly upset that the Duke was left out of the line of succession photo released by the Queen to mark the start of the New Year.The Monarch released a gorgeous picture of her with her son Prince Charles, grandson Prince William and great grandson Prince George in the Throne Room at Buckingham Palace.According to The Times , the Sussexes were upset that they were not included in the family photo. It reports: The Times understands that the Sussexes were upset at the release of the line of succession photograph and saw it as a signal that they were being excluded from royal le. They will have taken the same message from the fact that there were no images of them among the framed photographs on the Queenaposs desk when she delivered her Christmas Day message. Their decision to step back from royal duties was, in part, triggered by those signals.

He still believes Meghan is the perfect match for Harry and the family – and is determined to bring the couple back in. A senior palace source said: “There’s a genuine fear from Charles that this could be the beginning of the end for Harry and Meghan’s involvement with the family and that, in his words would be ‘an utter tragedy’. “Charles has implored everyone to work together to bring them back into the fold before it is too late, as he realises the benefits they have as a couple and indeed for the popularity of the monarchy across the world. “The message is clear: the stakes are too high to lose the one of the family’s greatest assets.” Charles, , has a clear vision of how he wants a “slimmed-down” monarchy to operate in future, with Harry and Meghan bringing their star quality to major roles. But he was disheartened at the couple’s wish to split from The Firm and pursue the prospect of earning millions without the blessing of the extended family The senior palace source said: “He’s spoken atwith both William and Harry over the last year and outlined his plans, which have all been ratied by the Queen – that William and Kate will be primed and ready to carry on the long-held traditions of the family, while Meghan and Harry will be able to spread their wings and have a far more fluid role. “Both brothers were until recently, it seemed, in complete agreement with the plan and, despite a falling-out over the last year, committed to making it work for all parties. But the urgency with which Harry and Meghan have pursued their intentions to break out on their own even more than had been agreed upon has caused great alarm.” The couple had been warned their plan to break away and split their time between big-money corporations and the Crown would be “wholly unworkable”. Harry is understood to have told Charles the wheels of change moved too slowly in the palace, prompting the Sussexes to release their bombshell departure statement ahead of time this week.  But the Mirror can reveal that after a meeting between the Queen, Charles, the Cambridges and Sussexes on Thursday, Harry and Meghan have been given “a new range of options” for how their new roles could work. Charles has made no secret of his admiration for Meghan and is said to be saddened at the prospect of losing her. Soon after first meeting her, he told confidants he was impressed with her “spirit”.

The source told the Daily : In getting this right, you are not only solving a conundrum for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex but others further down the line of succession for years to come, including Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.” It comes amid claims from William and Harryaposs camp that they were driven out of the UK.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailDressed down in jeans and jumper, clutching her chubby-cheeked son Louis, the Duchess of Cambridge is a picture of relaxed modern motherhood. With the one-year-old in her arms beside husband William – who holds their older children Charlotte, four, and George, six – this is the face of the modern monarchy the Queen and Prince Charles are so keen to build. The family portrait was taken last year and used as the Cambridges’ Christmas card design. But contrast it with the strain and worry written on the Duchess of Cambridge’s face as she drove to Kensington Palace on Thursday amid the Sussex “abdication” maelstrom. Because Kate, the future queen, has clearly realised how the weight of responsibility to save this institution is now firmly on her shoulders. She must be the strength behind the throne of King William V. And she must raise her eldest son to face up to his duty too, while helping her other two children lead as normal lives as possible. It is a balancing act that would be tricky at the best of times, but one that has become even more onerous now. A Palace source said: “There’s a genuine worry over how much this could affect the Cambridges and the strategy that has been carefully crafted for them. “William has been taking on more responsibilities at home and abroad – working in the Middle East is a great example, and also his strides into the climate-change arena. “With Kate, she has arguably had her best year as a royal, looking very comfortable and relaxed in the role, working with major issues that she will carry on doing for years to come. “Harry and Meghan deciding to up sticks and leave without any thought about how it could affect them is pretty selfish. If the Sussexes are only here half the year then it will fall to William and Kate to pick up the slack with more engagements, more pressure, and that has not even been considered.”  But her affection and admiration for the Queen means that Kate will never shirk. She once spoke of how she was “struck by the Queen’s sense of duty and commitment”, and she clearly hopes to follow her lead and help William do his duty. She has come a long way since we were introduced to the “commoner” set to marry the future king. People loved her for the fact she clearly loved William enough to find a way to accept the enormous pressures that came with their relationship. And not just accept them, but to embrace her new role and make it her own. She was not just a pretty woman to hang on the arm of the future monarch but a true partner, an equal who would support and encourage him as monarch. Kate is fully aware of the importance of her role since marrying Prince William in April .  Kate has become a royal patron to  charities that reflect her own interests such as the arts and photography. And she even came up with the idea to put mental health on the map with the Heads Together campaign, which she worked on with William and Prince Harry. These days Kate is also often seen at official events on her own, with a royal source describing her as being “like the finest of wines” as “she has taken years to mature to perfection.” At the opening of children’s hospice The Nook last year, Kate herself acknowledged just how much her work had developed. She said: “At the opening of the Treehouse Hospice many years ago – which I think I will remember for some years to come as it was my first ever speech – I referred to your hospices as being homes.” She added: “Whilst a lot has changed since then, my commitment and my support for this wonderful organisation and the work that you do has not.” Supporting children is an issue close to Kate’s heart.  In October it was announced that she had an exciting “secret” project in the works that will focus on the importance of children’s early years. And despite all her official engagements –  last year – Kate has always practised what she preached. She is a dedicated mother who drops her kids off at school, cooks their food and tucks them up in bed, habits admired by the Queen. A royal source said: “[The Queen] has been extremely impressed by the Duchess of Cambridge’s ability to keep several balls in the air at once. “Never before has a royal of the Duchess’s standing taken such a hands-on role in raising a future king. It has traditionally been left to nannies and governesses.” But as two of Kate’s children are destined not to be heirs to the throne, will the “unflappable” Duchess be affected by Harry and Meghan stepping down as senior royals   Princess Charlotte made history when she became the first royal not to be ruled out by gender, making her fourth in line to the throne. As was the case with Prince Andrew and Princess Anne, it’s less important for Charlotte and Louis to keep a clean slate. And while Harry was pictured dressed as a Nazi in  and even naked at a Las Vegas hotel in , Prince William kept a low profile during his youth. Kate must be hoping all her children follow their father’s example.

Zara Rodriguez said her confidence hit rock bottom after a botched boob job in Turkey which left with zero per cent breast tissue and severe scarring across her chest.The -year-old jetted to Turkey five months ago to plastic surgery clinic Comfort Zone in Istanbul where she booked a tummy tuck and breast implants with an uplt.But after the seven-hour procedure, Zaraaposs implants began to leak and became infected and she was rushed to Bath Hospital to have the implants and breast tissue completely removed. The barber, from Trowbridge, Wilts, said she was initially pleased with the results but went rapidly downhill upon ing to the UK and must now save another £, to have correction surgery. She said: I have been left completely flat chested with zero per cent breast tissue and deep scars that run across my chest. I am  years old and have been left mentally and physically battered. Zara booked her cosmetic surgery at Comfort Zone in Turkey after researching her options and said the Turkish clinic appeared to be the best. But after the op, she discovered she had a blood clot under the skin of her left breast and she was rushed back into surgery.  Zara said: Iaposve always wanted breast implants for most of my le after I developed a hatred for my body. When I first woke up from the original seven hour operation, the nurses tried to get me up and out of bed walking but it took three attempts, each time failing due to feeling lightheaded. When I awoke I found out I had a hematoma - blood clotted underneath the skin - on my left breast and had to get rushed back into surgery to sort the problem. At first I thought nothing of it and just put it down to a big operation. Yet at home, I noticed my incision on my left breast wasnapost healing properly which I found out was because I had developed an infection. After visiting the doctors every few days for check-ups and to have it redressed, it started to get worse and more painful.  Zara claims she informed the Turkish clinic that her right breast was severely dropping below the incision wound and claims she continued to text the company for advice. But she said the clinic advised it was normal and to simply massage them before she claims the pain became worse.Zara said: Eventually I ended up in hospital in Bath where I was told I had to have my breasts removed. I was scared and afraid and so I posted photos on my Instagram to share my situation. But then the owner of the company personally rang me to tell me to fly back and they would fix it for me for free, as long as I deleted the photos because it was bad press for business. I naively agreed and apologised for posting them, arranging to fly back in October. The next morning I went to hospital where I then had my left implant removed and replaced and my right implant lted. I was so happy and excited to finally be able to enjoy my new breasts, but this was short lived once again - when I was home my breast started leaking and I began to panic. That was when I continue to message for advice, and I began to get ignored.

She explained: My wedding day should have been the best day, but people definitely mistreated me at the stores as soon as I walked in.

Twisting your bra in half can cause damage to both the cups and the wires - especially underwire or moulded styles.Michael Thomson, owner of Pour Moi says you should treat your bras as you do you suits, you would never fold or misshape it, and the same level of care should be made.”He advises stuffing the cups with socks or rolled up knickers to keep the shape and encourage firmness - but only whilst theyaposre flat, reports the Sun. But you can get away with folding unpadded or aposcut and sewapos , and even silk or lace ones - but onlyyou fold these inside out, since it protects the material.Katie Thacker from the buying team at Boux Avenue , recommends storing your bras flat rather than folding them in half, but this all depends on how much space you have to spare. So, itaposs time to Marie Kondo your bra collection and throw out any that no longer bring you joy, causes you pain or makes your boobs look a little lop-sided.  That way youaposll have room to carefully lay out each of your bras flat and on top of eachother. But how long is too long to wear the same bra  Agent Provocateur , preaches the three day rule. Wearing your bra for longer than three days in a row can cause it to stretch and lose shape.They said: “When you wash a bra it s the fibres back to the original state so helps to keep it fitting well.”And whilst weaposre on the topic, Persil recommends washing your bras after three to four wears - but this is just a rough guide!"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/KMil_Verdartttt-003.jpg ","title":"art collection inspired by dundee jute industry to go on show at verdant works","story":"A new exhibition that focuses on artwork inspired by the Dundee jute industry will go on display this weekend.The show entitled, Spirit of the Jute Mills, opens at Verdant Works tomorrow and showcases artwork within the museum’s collections inspired by the traditional industry’s relationship with the city.On show will be work from artists including Allan Bevridge, Nicola Wiltshire and from the Society of Scottish Artists. vw, px\"  The exhibition is made up of paintings and sketches, prints, sculpture, mixed media as well as machinery and textile products.Mel Ruth Oakley, curator for Verdant Works said: “We are delighted to be able to bring together and display the artwork from our collection.“This exhibition has allowed us to bring together pieces which really demonstrate the impact of the jute industry on the city and the ways that it has inspired artists.” vw, px\"  The exhibition will run until Sunday April  and will be housed in the Verdant Works’ temporary exhibition gallery.Entry is free.

Some things you might get away with when it’s more open, you don’t.“Inverness were good at it last week. They sit with six players behind the ball and maybe cheat with a couple up the park and counter you well.“We need to find the answers to open teams up.”Dundee’s form going into last weekend’s clash with Caley Thistle was good with two wins and two draws in their previous four.However, consistency has consistently been the downfall for the Dark Blues this season.That four-game spell in December was their best since August and Hemmings knows it’s something the team have to improve on.He added: “We’re tired talking about it, to be honest.“We’ve had moments where we think we’re getting there and we’re away on a good run but have games like Inverness last week.“We can’t just do it for three or four games but we need seven or eight in a row to really assert ourselves.“The performances going back to the second half against Arbroath had been really good.“We’ve been positive in the way we’ve played, some good performances.“Last week was a chance to close the gap on Inverness and go level on points with them. It was disappointing in that regard.“This will be another big game because Ayr are a good team and we need to pick ourselves back up.”Tomorrow’s clash comes after tests against league leaders Dundee United, second-placed Inverness and ahead of a dficult Scottish Cup tie at home to high-flying Premiership side Motherwell.It’s a testing run for the players but Hemmings is relishing the chance to get back out and into a big match.He said: “It is good to have another big game this weekend.“We knew there were three big home games in a row with the Scottish Cup the week after.“That’s what you want – you always want to test yourself as a player.“It’s a good game to jump back into.”The last meeting with Ayr saw Dundee leave Somerset Park with an impressive - victory. That night saw plenty of tackles flying about and Hemmings expects no dferent this time around.“Whatever way they go, it’ll be a dficult game for us, we know that.“It was a tough game down there and a bit tasty as well – I expect the same this weekend.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/12/5df75284787cb1.28242057-e1576496457165-940x564.jpg ","title":"dundee set to close in on pre contract deals","story":"Dundee manager James McPake says there are no signings “imminent” at the club ahead of the weekend’s clash with Ayr United.However, he did admit the club are close to two pre-contract agreements, with one believed to be with Inverness right-back Shaun Rooney.The Dens gaffer said: “I must have had easily over  phone calls over the last week – names from everywhere. But there’s genuinely nothing imminent.”Despite no incomings being imminent, James is keen for fans of the club not to take that for inaction behind the scenes.He added: “We don’t want six or seven signings every window. We need to keep building every window – looking to add and get stronger with every one.“We’re fourth in the league which isn’t great but it’s a process and we need to believe in what we’re trying to do.“I’d be quite happy keeping this squad and adding a couple.“We need to make sure we’re in the play-offs with a chance to get to the Premiership and we’re looking to build a team that can compete there.“We’ll hopefully get a couple of pre-contracts done with a view to next season.”One name that has been linked with a move back to the club this month is former Dee favourite Craig Wighton.“I loved working with Wighty when he was here,” said James.“I know his character and his talent. He’s training with the reserves at Hearts but there’s nothing happening with that. Will it  I’m genuinely not sure.“Wighty got put to us at the start of the season. He’s one we’re aware of and know very well but he’s a Hearts player at the minute.” vw, px\"  Meanwhile, the Dens boss expects to have Graham Dorrans available for Saturday’s match against Ayr after he spoke with MK Dons at the start of the week.Dorrans scored his first, and so far only goal for Dundee in the derby at Tannadice on December  .“He’s trained very well over the last two days,” James added.“If he’s here come the weekend, he’ll be involved. My opinion hasn’t changed – I think he will be. That’s how I’ve felt all along unless something drastically changes.“I hope that’s not my heart ruling my head.“He’s been really professional in the way he’s dealt with it.“He’s an experienced player with good character. He still looks very committed in training.“He’s key to what we’re trying to do but we knew when we signed him that this might happen.“We’re prepared for whatever happens.

I said as much to our players so we are not taking positives from that.“We have been here before and come back from a poor performance before. We need to do it again.“We can’t afford to be so up and down as a team.”The majority of Dundee’s low points this season have come on their own patch.The poor defeat to Inverness added to a list that includes bad days as hosts to Dundee United, Partick, Queen of the South and League Two Elgin City.However, James doesn’t feel there is an issue for players playing at Dens Park.“I was never big on that,” he added. “I didn’t feel that as a player. vw, px\"  “The basic thing that supporters want to see is people going out there and working hard.“For  to  minutes, Inverness were much better than us and, by then, the game was effectively done as far as they were concerned as they had a lead and sat back off the match.“They were right to do that and it happened up there as well. They are really good at it.“You know that teams come here and look to get through the first  minutes or so and look to get the crowd turned against us.“That happens at clubs that have quite a bit of support.“But I genuinely don’t buy into the view that there is this big stigma or a big problem about playing at Dens.“I don’t get it and it should be the opposite because when you get it right and you get the fans right behind you it is a really good place to play.“It flips and becomes a good place to play football.“The atmosphere can be really good but I have said it before and I will say it again – we need to give them something back.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.49490117-240x180.jpg

closed.A building warrant was submitted in September to demolish buildings at the site including the main arena, which has now been approved by the local authority.Aberdeen City Council co-leader Douglas Lumsden said now the building warrant has been granted, the “intention” would be for that work to start “immediately”.He added: “That might include internal works first which people won’t be able to see.”As well as the removal of the old main arena building, the covered walkway that connects to the section of the conference centre next to the Holiday Inn Express will also be removed.It is expected that the value of the work to be undertaken will be around £,.The warrant has an expiry date of January   and all work must be completed by then.It is understood that the remaining conference centre will be retained as well as the nearby park-and-ride facility.Talks regarding the future use of the site are still ongoing.Plans were previously submitted to the local authority by developers Henry Boot in May  for the land, which hoped to create a mixed use development including approximately  residential units, properties for commercial and business use, a recycling centre and park-and-ride facility.The application is still pending and there was a number of documents uploaded on to the site in , along with a letter of objection received last year.It stated: “The site would have been better used as a new north-east HQ and training hub for Police Scotland with Queen Street being disposed of.“There would be ample space to create a specialist training facility, which Police Scotland does not have anywhere north of the central belt.”Discussions have also been under way with the King’s Community Church over the site, with the church keen to move from its base on King Street.The church began in  with a small gathering before it moved to the city centre church in  where it has remained.An Aberdeen City Council spokeswoman said: “A building warrant to demolish the

NowAt the end of November we asked readers for help to unravel the mystery of a yacht log book which was posted to the paper with no clues as to its origin.And, not for the first time, Argyllshire Advertiser readers have come up trumps and we now know a little more about the boat#s owner, named only as RG Mowat in the log book.The  log book gives an account of the voyages of the -foot gaff cutter #Fulmar# and the adventures of her colourful crew. Its dog-eared pages contain neatly-typed records, precise drawings and fascinating photographs.The log#s mystery is deepened by the fact no names are given other than the nicknames #Tanky#, #Bosun#, #Skipper# and #Pilot#. The only crew member named is pet dachshund #Major#.The log does record the Fulmar#s home port was Tighnabruaich and the owner was RG Mowat, but few details on Mr Mowat could be found.Lord Weir of Lochhead, Achahoish, contacted the newspaper to pass on information on Commander Ralph G Mowat.During the Second World War, Commander Mowat was a Royal Navy Captain, latterly in command of a cruiser. At the end of the war, he and his ship entered Copenhagen, where he took the surrender of the German troops.Clive Brown from Ardfern added some post-war detail. He revealed: #Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , was a distinguished member of Clyde Cruising Clubbest known as being, for  years, the honorary editor of the CCC Sailing Directions . These were # and indeed remain # a #must have# for everyone who navigates their way among the many lochs and islands of Scotland#s west coast. They were colloquially known as the #Blue Book# and published at that time as a hardback. He also served as CCC Rear Commodore -.#Mr Brown also provided an extract from the book #Clyde Cruising Club, The First One Hundred Years -# which states Ralph Mowat received an RYA Award for services to yachting in  but refused to accept honorary membership of the club. In recompense, his widow Mary was elected an honorary member in , after his death.Tighnabruaich man Alan Wilson contacted Clyde sailing legend Ian Nicolson, who was fairly sure he recalled racing against the #Fulmar# in the s.Mr Nicolson said:#Old Man Mowat, as I remember him, was a typical ex Royal Navy officer. He treated me as a young upstart, which I was, but we got on well because I wrote a bit for Clyde Cruising Club publications. He lived in Clarkston on the edge of Glasgow.#Clyde Cruising Club itself cannot help with information on the Fulmar. Club secretary Jenner Rollands contacted the Advertiser and confirmed CCC sadly lost all its records when the Carrick, moored on the River Clyde, sank in .

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

It now seems that Dutch taxpayers are subsidising our failing train services. This is on top of the Scottish Government subsidies, which make up about half of its pound billion revenues.We need a viable solution to ScotRailrsquos woes, and terminating franchises early or nationalisation is not the answer. We need better accountability and long-term planning to ensure we see the fortunes of ScotRail turn around.The Borders tourism can offer a more peaceful alternative to bustling CapitalI was not surprised to see that Edinburgh was revealed as having the fourth highest ratio of tourists to locals in the world. This is after Miami, Las Vegas and Dubai, and it sits well above th placed London. Statistics show there are nearly  tourists for every  residents in Edinburgh, and it begs the question, are we really managing the impact of tourism well Annually our Capital city is influxed with tourists for the Hogmanay celebrations and the Fringe. Whilst it great to see tourism booming in Edinburgh, we need to see more affirmative action to encourage tourists to see more of Scotland, including the Borders. We are located only an hour south of Edinburgh, yet we see very little of the footfall.We need to see incentives and drivers for visitors to explore outside of Edinburgh. Encouraging rural tourism is at the top of my list, and I believe the Scottish Government need to make it a priority to ensure that our overcrowded capital does not suffer, when rural areas have a more peaceful and less stressful visitor experience on offer."},{"url":null,"title":"polar-bear-expert-deliver-talk-galashiels","story":"THE Arctic is ground-zero for climate change, and polar bears are on the front line.Yet, therersquos still a whole lot to learn about these magnicent animals.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road.

My we and kids were with me carrying the crisps and goodies when the absence of sound coming from my friendrsquos flat made me suddenly realise Irsquod mucked up.Turning up on a doorstep with drinks and snacks for a party that had already taken place was a potentially awkward moment.ldquoI wondered where you were yesterday, my friend said, ldquoas you were so sure you were all coming.Kate, my we, who normally keeps me organised, looked at me in a way that expressed horried disbelief and lack of surprise at the same time. But what could have been an embarrassing and disappointing evening became a wonderful and quite moving experience.My friend is Jewish. She is not religious but she observes Jewish festivals and traditions as part of her inheritance and identity. And the day we arrived was December , which in  was the first day of Hanukkah, also called the lsquofestival of lightsrsquo. There is not a fixed date for this celebration as the time is based on the cycle of the moon, as many celebrations from other religious traditions are.We were askedwe would like to take part and we were honoured to do so. By tradition, the youngest in the room lights the candle, so my four-year-old son, with help, did so.The evening was full of meaning and unexpected closeness with an old friend. There was a feeling of shared sacredness in the antiquity of the ceremony, and the meaning of the story behind Hanukkah, like many religious stories, can be interpreted in dferent ways by the people who hold that faith.But at its core is the story of the miracle of the lamp that, despite only having oil enough for one night, burned for eight days and eight nights. The lamp was lit as a dedication to a desecrated temple, thereby signalling the restoration of religious freedom, and hence the name festival of lights.As we left our friendrsquos house into a cold and calm night, Kate told me she had forgiven me, as otherwise we would not have had such a meaningful and memorable evening.It happened to be also the Winter Solstice and this is a turning point in the year. Hanukkah isnrsquot specically about seasonal change but the idea of sharing the light in this dark time is a common theme.I imagined our ancestors huddling together in their ancient dwellings during the shortest day, knowing the dark was now at its worst, and soon the light would begin to . Le would come back to the land and the days become longer. But in the meantime, ways were needed to keep the dark at bay.Today we challenge the darkness with decorative seasonal lights. But we also have super-lit shopping centres, bright street lights and, hopefully, warm and lit homes.But in celebrating this time, it seems the seasonal bling of the corporate money-makers is becoming the new ritual. They promote the idea that celebrating together should be bigger and better every year that those who want to feel included need to buy the ticket for the big event.And indeed, much fun can be had at such events. But have we reached a point where traditions have become marketing labels rather than authentic shared experiences  Some people now have to acquire tickets from a company to celebrate in their own street, although thankfully not yet in East Lothian.The idea of being bigger and better means bigger crowds, which means more profit but not necessarily a better experience. Big crowds need to be restricted and controlled, meaning others are excluded. Have we reached the point whereyou donrsquot have a ticket then you canrsquot be part of the tradition We can enjoy big events while still having our own traditions, of course, but my feeling is that the idea of tradition is being hijacked by a commercial juggernaut with little authenticity or meaning other than making money.And so I think the unexpected evening with my friend taught me a lesson I hope I already knew: that the traditions we really value, and the memories we truly treasure, are the simple ones of shared meaningful connection. And perhaps the biggest treasure is sharing with those who would otherwise be excluded.And so wherever you are, whatever you do, I hope you find time to share these moments at this time of seasonal celebration. Whatever your faith or spirituality, whatever your family or cultural traditions, I wish you a Happy New Year and I look forward to theof the sun, and sharing with you new adventures of discovery in our beautul county."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-youngsters-thank-lifeboat-crew-saving-lives","story":"Rachel Pirie and Luke Foster, both , were exploring the townrsquos clfs with Chloe McCaw, , at about noon on November  last year when the incident happened.The rising water levels left the youngsters, who all live in Dunbar and attend Dunbar Grammar School, cut off with no food, no water and one working mobile phone that did not have any credit.Police and Coastguard crews struggled to locate them.Talking about their ordeal, Rachel said: ldquoWe know the area well and the tide was well out so we thought we were safe.

I was alone and deep in thought. I cannot remember now exactly what the issue was, but something had happened that seemed to be unfair, and it had made me angry.It was a windy and cold day. The tide was in and the waves rolling and crashing created a kind of meditative sound. I donrsquot know how long I sat there, as time seemed to dissolve as I listened to the sea, and smelt the salt air.Later I walked by the shore, again alone, and I remember how my mood had changed.My memory of that day fades at this point: I cannot recall what happened as I ed home. But clearly the sea had done its job in calming my emotional state.Memories are not like books on a shelf which we can take out and look at, and then . Our memories are really about emotions rather than happenings. We connect to the emotions first, our brain then does a search for the events associated with the emotion. Songs, smell, sounds and places can trigger emotion which then leads to associations with actual events.So itrsquos the emotion attached to events which will mark it as signicant. Thatrsquos why we remember the unusual moments more than the everyday ones. We remember the events when our emotions were aroused, either positively or negatively.That day I was angry. The sea was pretty much on our doorstep, so it was probably an obvious place to go to be alone, away from my siblings, to rage at the injustice I felt. But it was a good choice, because the sea has a powerful ability to heal.There seems to be a sense by some that the sea is a place to go only when itrsquos sunny and warm. In fact, the gts of the sea are given all year round, and it is winter time, or a time of storm and wind, that the sea becomes a powerful place to find naturersquos healing.How lucky we are to live in a county where we have  miles of coastline, much of it close to communities and accessible. Those with a sense of adventure and physical ability to do so can find parts of the coast to themselves, even in busy times.But as I learnt all those years ago, the sea can speak to us directly. Simply sitting by it, or walking along the shore while sharing our thoughts, can be a powerful form of mental as well as physical healing.Some take this a step further by bathing in the sea on a regular basis ndash yes, even in the winter. There are real benefits to swimming in a cold sea, both in terms of mental and physical health. But I think it helpsothers do it with you, as an encouragement! The Loony Dooks which take place at North Berwick, Dunbar and where around the coast should be a weekly event, not a yearly one!But we donrsquot need to be in the sea to feel its benefits, just by it and connected to it mentally, and yes, spiritually. This is a serious point. We have an epidemic of mental health issues, and while there is no one simple explanation or solution, we need to understand the signicance of our disconnection from nature and its impact on our mental health. Spending time by the sea is a tonic for body and mind.I think we felt this last week when we headed for the rocks at North Berwick on Boxing Day. It was here that Robert Louis Stevenson played as a boy and discovered a small cave in which he imagined tales of pirates and smugglers. The island of Fidra, said to be his inspiration for Treasure Island, can be seen further along the coast.The tide was in, so it wasnrsquot possible to see the cave. But in scrambling over the rocks, discovering other things and sitting by the waves, the sea did its magic for our family and myself. The waves were crashing andyou studied how they hit the rocks you could see how the hand of the sea had carved them in certain ways.We sat and explored there ndash not noticing the nippy wind ndash for a good hour. It was an overcast afternoon and darkness fell soon. But the walk along the beach to the town for a hot chocolate was the final part of the therapy!Our coastline is a gt for us and we need to use it, and respect it, more. The beaches, coves and clfs of our county are a true treasure. Try spending more time with them, listening and experiencing the sea, walking or sitting with it.I promise you, you will feel better, and have a story to tell.Happy New Year."},{"url":null,"title":"new-mcbrave-games-event-held-musselburgh","story":"The action-packed event, called McBrave Games, promises participants a uniquely Scottish experience with events such as tug orsquo war, tossing the caber, putting the shot, the hill race, weechinrsquo the welly and a Highland fling.There will also be a Scottish twist on challenges along the km obstacle course to test participants.The event takes place on Saturday, May , at Newhailes House.Participants can take on the challenge as a solo entrant or enter as a clan of four with colleagues or friends to battle it out to become the laddie or lassie of McBrave Games.Co-founders Jo Dytch and Andrew Hastings are confident the creativity and innovation behind the event will encourage entrants to try something new in .Jo and Andrew bring with them more than  yearsrsquo combined experience in the mass participation space on large-scale events such as Race for Le, Tough Mudder and the -mile Cateran Yomp.Commenting on the inspiration behind the event, Jo said: ldquoScotland is an inspiring and magical place.

Racing Associated Committeit was not down to them.He said: ldquoIt is their [ScottishPower]train set and they will play with it however they want to play with it.The Electric Bridge traditionally opened on race days at Musselburgh Racecourse to help with traffic through the busy town centre.When the power station closed in , the bridge, which spans the River Esk, was closed but an agreement was met with the racecourse, East Lothian Council and ScottishPower to open it for major events.At the MRAC meeting, racecourse general manager Bill Farnsworth said it was used until last year by the Musselburgh Riding of the Marches and was used by the Edinburgh Marathon as well as the racecourse.He described the decision by ScottishPower to close it as ldquodisappointing and said he had been told that ldquoScottishPower do not need it and East Lothian Council do not want it.Mr Farnsworth urged the local authority to try again to take ownership of the bridge, adding: ldquoWe are told the bridge is absolutely sound and in good order. It is a perfectlygood bridge that is being closed and we are urging councillors and the council to try and reach an agreement with ScottishPower.Howeve,r Mr Farnsworth was told that there was no reason why the racecourse itself could not approach ScottishPower to reach a separate agreement regarding opening the bridge in the future."},{"url":null,"title":"groundsman-almost-struck-replacing-divets-midway-race-musselburgh","story":"The lsquonear-missrsquo incident occurredduring the Edinburgh Cup in September when groundstaff had been warned to remember the main race of the day would see the runners go round the course twice over the two-mile event.However, it appeared one of the workers forgot and was still replacing ets on the ground when the horses came round the bend towards him.It was only when he heard jockeys shouting at him to get out of the way that he managed to duck under the barriers to safety.Bill Farnsworth, racecourse general manager, said a stewards inquiry was launched after the incident and the British Horseracing Authority investigated ruling that all protocolhad been followed by the racecourse itself.The incident came to light at a meeting of Musselburgh Racing Associated Committee this week.Mr Farnsworth said: ldquoThe Edinburgh Cup is a two-mile race and our head groundsman warned all the groundstaff to remember they go round twice.ldquoOne of the groundsmen went out and obviously forgot it was a two-mile race.ldquoHe was busy knocking in the ets as horses came around the bend and jockeys had to shout at him.ldquoHe ducked off the track, it was a lsquonear missrsquo.He added that a similar incident at Ascot in November had seen that course fined nearly pound, by the British Horseracing Authority for not following the proper protocol before the race.Mr Farnsworth said: ldquoThe sport needs to decideit is safe for people to get on track during racing, it is weighing up the benefit of repairing the track with the risk.

No big deal, you might think, but in these parts the red squirrel is better protected than the royals at Balmoral. A hit squad was despatched to find and eliminate the intruder, which they did within  hours.The grey squirrel, a th-century import from America, has a terrible reputation, thanks to its impact on its native red cousin. Culling is usually considered the best solution and, for the sake of the red, which is particularly susceptible to disease carried by its relative, I wouldnrsquot argue with that. Less grisly but more final are attempts at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh to alter the DNA of female greys to render them infertile. If that works then theyrsquoll soon disappear forever, hopefully leaving To Let signs encouraging reds to .No such fancul nonsense in the scientic world, of course. An ecologist at Edinburgh Napier University has pointed out the double standards involved in public attitudes. Whereas the grey squirrel has conservationists reaching for guns and traps, another ldquoinvasive alien species ndash the domestic cat ndash is so beloved, there are an estimated  million in the UK.Ecologist Dr Jason Gilchrist, writing on the academic website The Conversation, says: ldquoIt is often argued that killing grey squirrels is justied as they predate bird nests. They do, and so do red squirrels, but there is scant evidence that squirrels have a signicant impact on songbirds. While domestic and feral cats decimate songbird populations, they are unlikely to be targeted for culls any time soon... In terms of the ecological damage they do, the impact of both species is similar: they donrsquot belong here and are having negative effects on wildle.While this doesnrsquot emphasise the potentially irreversible effect of greys on red squirrels, he has a point about predatory cats. They kill about  million wild birds every year. It would be a horrying tallythese were all healthy young things but the RSPB says the majority are either sickly or weak and would soon have expired anyway. Cold comfort for those of us clearing the crime scene where a fat wood pigeon has gasped its last. Nor do I entirely believe it. Watching a black tom motionless as a gatepost beside our chirruping beech hedge, itrsquos easy to see how a healthy robin, fooled into thinking it was a shadow, could be caught unawares.Even the most besotted owners squirm at the trophies dropped at their feet ndash often not entirely dead ndash and while itrsquos good to keep down rodents, disposing of feathered carcasses tucked in your slippers is no fun. I say this as a cat person. So far as Irsquom aware, the only thing my city cat ever caught was a mouse, which I managed to rescue and put back on the street. My cat used to sleep like a Russian fur hat on my pillow, and when she died it was little short of heartbreaking. But now I have a garden, with a hedge that quivers with sparrows and finches, I couldnrsquot possibly replace her. It would be like tossing a live grenade onto the lawn. Itrsquos in catsrsquo nature to kill, and other than keeping them confined indoors, or hanging a bell as loud as Big Ben around their neck, they will inevitably go on carnivorous sprees.Dr Gilchrist is well aware that his comments might outrage the feline-owning community. His aim, he says, is simply ldquoto bring some logic and consistency to the way we treat animals. The problem is, therersquos nothing logical about the love cats inspire.Pointing out the savage heart that beats within every sweetly purring tabby, for instance, makes absolutely no dference to the cooing and clucking around their every move. Ian Fleming knew what he was doing when he placed a cold-eyed white Persian in his villain Blofeldrsquos arms. It was hard to tell which was the more sinister, each, as he implied, being utterly deadly. More recently, the costume designers and make-up artists for the film version of Cats were way off the mark. Turning one of the most alluring and lithe species into a creepy hybrid with long legs, flapping arms and a human body completely misses the essence of the feline kingdom. Whether itrsquos a Siamese or a tortoiseshell, a Bengal or a Manx, elegance is key. Much of the allure lies in their aesthetic appeal and the dignity and hauteur with which they behave. Itrsquos no wonder the Egyptians treated them as Gods. Nor that they were considered an essential accessory for a witchrsquos diabolical work.Whereas squirrels might be impressively athletic and undeniably cute, they cannot compete with the fascination cats hold. This arises in part from their disturbingly dual personality. Unlike dogs ndash what you see is what you get ndash they are mysterious and ungovernable. As they lie on your lap, exquisitely lovely and touchingly affectionate, they make people feel special. Therersquos a sense of pride in being favoured by a sharp-toothed beast with vicious claws that, when it slips out of the window flap at midnight, turns into a merciless killer, and by day treats the garden like ScotRailrsquos buffet trolley.As anyone who dares suggest cats are a nuisance will soon learn, in this country they are all but sacred. When it comes to choosing between the fate of felines or songbirds, itrsquos very simple: two legs good, four legs infinitely better."},{"url":null,"title":"sturgeon-consider-neer-day-trading-ban","story":"As the shop workers union protested outside Holyrood in favour of such a ban, the First Minister said she sympathised and would look at what steps the Government could take.The Christmas Day and New Years Day TradingAct  bans the opening of most large stores - defined as more than  square metres in size - on Christmas Day.It also allows Scottish Ministers to introduce a similar ban for New Yearrsquos Day, but the provision has never been used.:Nicola Sturgeon refutes claims of secret investigation into falling Higher pass rateA recent Usdaw survey of  Scottish retail staff found  per cent thought stores should close on New Yearrsquos Day to give workers more time with friends and family.At First Ministerrsquos Questions, Labour MSP Jackie Baillie raised the Usdaw campaign.She said: ldquoMany retail workers in Scotland had to work on  January instead of spending time with their families.ldquoParliament has already put in place legislation covering Christmas and New Yearrsquos Day trading that would stop large stores from opening, but the New Yearrsquos Day provisions have not been implemented.ldquoWill the First Minister commit to backing Usdawrsquos calls, to consulting on new yearrsquos day trading and to giving shop workers the festive break that they deserve Ms Sturgeon replied: ldquoShop workers deserve a festive break such as the rest of us get the benefit of.

The question about tax residency, for example, will have come upyoursquove been filling in a tax . The issue of paying more taxes has also been raised by the recent National Audit Office report showing that, because of changes introduced by the Scottish Government, Scots paid almost poundm more in income tax in   than the year before.:Scots estimated to have paid poundm more in income tax following SNP tax changesIt would seem, from what Irsquove seen, that voters in the second group who say theyrsquore happy to pay extra tax outnumber those who are unhappy, and this is curious for two reasons. First, it appears to defy one of the basic rules of British politics, but it also obeys another rule of Scottish politics that runs much deeper.The basic rule of British politics says this: do not raise taxes because voters wonrsquot like it. More specically, the rule suggests voters will say they donrsquot mind paying more tax for better services but vote for parties that lower taxes. Itrsquos the dference between the publicity of opinion and the secrecy of the ballot - when things are secret, people can do what they believe, not what they think they should believe.The thing is, though, political rules arenrsquot quite as simple as that. On the face of it, the rule works: Margaret Thatcherrsquos governments, for example, reduced income tax and won three elections, and Tony Blairrsquos governments did pretty much the same: they cut income tax further and kept on winning.However, the details reveal something a bit more subtle. For a start, the Tories arenrsquot as tax-cutting as they say they are ndash the Thatcher governments cut income tax but also dramatically raised VAT. Isolating tax as an issue also fails to understand what truly motivates voters. There will be some who think excessively cutting tax will make public services worse and vote accordingly, but more important is how voters prioritise issues in their heads.It works like this: tax rates, corruption, inefficiency, immorality ndash all of these matter to voters but none of them matter as much as the issue that, deep down, they really care about. It explains why Boris Johnson does well despite all the questions over his record . And it explains why the SNP continue to do well despite all the questions over theirs .What this means in Scotland is the SNP can appear to break the tax rule and still do well because some voters care more about independence than taxes. It also means that the risk of higher costs or economic damage has no effect on some voters ndash witness the reaction of some to the economic risks of independence. They. Donrsquot. Care.The SNPrsquos defence to all of this is that the greater tax burden is ldquoprogressive and raises extra revenue for ldquofirst-class public services but both claims are dodgy. First, Scotlandrsquos public services are not first class, but the extra taxes also cannot be progressive when they apply to people earning pound,. Wouldnrsquot it be more progressive to end benefits that can be claimed by the well-off  And what about council tax ndash was it progressive to freeze it, thereby benefitting affluent households more than poorer ones while also forcing councils to cut services The point is that, even though the Donrsquot-Raise-Tax rule is still relevant, here in Scotland the deeper magic of independence matters more it also means public services can get worse and taxes can get higher and the SNP continues to do well. Maybe the new rule for politicians in Scotland should be: think about independence first. But maybe therersquos another lesson too: often itrsquos the politicians who break the rules that do best in the end."},{"url":null,"title":"truly-radical-royals-harry-meghan-ditch-duke-duchess","story":"Not  hours after Meghan Markle and her husband made the unexpected announcement they are to demote themselves from senior to minor royals - seemingly without running it past the boss of the firm first - Madame Tussauds removed the couples waxworks from its royal family display.If only the real le redundancy process the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have applied for could go so smoothly and easily.Rather - strap in - were in for several months of claim and counter claim, insider sources and speculation about the motives of Harry, formerly known as Prince.Despite the collective clutched pearls, its not as though this latest chapter in the royal soap opera wasnt well foreshadowed.Harry did not marry some pliable ingenue. He married a grown woman, a self-made millionaire who had oodles of le experience, had forged her own successful career, who had very set ideas, interests and moral codes and who clearly saw the instant and vast fame of being part of the British Royal family as a means to promote her philanthropic and charitable ideals.Not everyone sees this as a virtue. Confident, refreshing, ambitious Meghan. Pushy, bossy, bitchy Meghan.From day one she has refused to capitulate to the expected mores of a member of the House of Windsor. From going bare-legged at official events to declining the title of Prince for her son from continuing to behave like a typical young American woman with transatlantic baby showers to insisting on the title of Ms and not Miss for herself.Every perceived dference - some say faux pas, some say reasonable modern behaviour - has been noted, recorded and scrutinised.Harry and Meghan were never going to tow the line.Some would say the foreshadowing began  years ago with the abdication of Edward VIII, whose love affair with an American orceacutee is the reason Harry now finds himself in a predicament with his.Thanks to the chain reaction sparked by Edward and Wallis Simpson, Harry is now wrangling with his position within the royal family and without.This is part of the problem. There has been an utter reluctance to meet Meghan Markle on her own terms.She is either compared to Wallis Simpson and found too similar, or compared to Kate Middleton and found to be too dferent.While the Duchess of Cambridge has made herself blandly likeable and upstanding - an inoffensively perfect consort-in-waiting - Meghan would never have been able to do this.Prince Williams we was plagued for being middle class and having an air hostess for a mother. But she is from a good family, received a good education and has blended in seamlessly to aristocratic le.Meghans perceived flaws are insurmountable. She cannot erase her previous marriage from her record. She cannot stop being American.Instead of praising her moral consistency - such as during the rumours of her asking Prince Harry not to go hunting at Sandringham - she was scorned as a scheming nag trying to turn our Harry against us.Prince Harry, goes the narrative, has been altered against his will by this conniving vixen. Much has been made of a what a rambunctious young fellow the Prince used to be. It really shows how deeply held the disdain for Meghan that we preferred Harry in his Las Vegas, photographer-punching, Nazi costume wearing days.Would Britain really rather its sixth in line to the throne was gadding to parties in an SS unorm than spending some time in Canada over Christmas Most crucially, Ms Markle cannot make herself less black. While Britain balks at the notion it might be a bit racist, lets try and be honest enough to acknowledge the racist undertones to the criticism of Meghan.Prince Harry, too, has been consistent and vocal. He has asked the press nicely to back off and he has threatened the press to back off. The press did not back off and now, he likely feels, theyve got what they deserved.It is highly doubtful this will wash well with the tabloids.The Harry and Meghan romance has shown up the UKs racism, classism and the uniquely dysal relationship it has with the royal family where the country feels it has ownership because we pay for their upkeep.They get fame, fortune and outrageous privilege and we get to feel like were in control. Now the couple has violated the sacred deal.Its very dficult to emphasise with their position. \"Itrsquos not enough just to survive something, right ,\" Meghan said in her Africa interview last year. \"Thatrsquos not the point of le. Yoursquove got to thrive, yoursquove got to feel happy.\"How, it is nigh-on impossible to imagine, can you feel in survival mode with a doting husband, beautul baby, unlimited privilege and absolute luxury.Yet this is how Harrys we feels and their decision to publish on Wednesday evening or be damned speaks to an interesting utter lack of trust in the Palace.They want to earn their own living using their royal brand for commercial gain - freeing Meghan up to play herself in the Crown, perhaps - yet still live in Crown Estate property and take money from the Duchy of Cornwall.Other royal couples before them have given it a try - the Countess of Wessex tried and failed to keep up her PR work with royal duties - so they have a template for what not to do.Having a foot in each camp seems an attempt to have all the upsides and no downs. Perhaps its designed to be a compromise - a compromise between themselves or a compromise between them and us - but its a poor deal.The royal family is rightly paring back to become a more modern institution in a world that does not have automatic deference to its mere existence.After the initial shock of their announcement, there would be more understandingthe Sussexes went it alone. They should drop their titles, cut their royal income and be truly independent.

The proposals also require banks to publish details every six months on the SEARs they offer which should make comparisons easier.The FCA says that the new rules would make it easier for longstanding customers to see whether their existing account gives them a good interest rate because their bank will not have one set interest rate.The rules, which will now go out for consultation, are meant to boost transparency and competition across the easy-access savings market, which has been accused of taking advantage of customers unwillingness to switch.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Financial Conduct Authority video on proposals to help customers get better rates for cash savings\",\"description\": \"Financial Conduct Authority video on proposals to help customers get better rates for cash savings\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media aNQvKtg poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests aNQvKtg.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": The FCA video promoting its intervention.Easy access accounts typically let you pay money in and withdraw it when you want without being penalised.With over , savings accounts available in the UK and around  that are easy access, only a handful offer interest rates that beat the inflation rate which was at .% year-on-year in November.Around  million people hold such accounts in the UK but many longstanding customers receive low rates of interest and therefore miniscule s for their savings.The typical easy access account interest rate has dropped to its lowest point since .

Being a reasonable chiel Irsquod perhaps permit them to hang on to one of the royal residences and convert it into an eventide home for royal codgerdom. Irsquod only stipulate that once a year they agree to a fly-on-the-wall Christmas special for the BBC, presented by Nicholas Witchell whom Prince Charles once described as ldquothat awful man.A quantum of mince has been written about the Duchy of Cornwall, the inherited vehicle by which Prince Charles lsquoearnsrsquo his multi-million-pound income. This huge estate makes the prince the biggest landowner in England and we are asked to believe the lie that it also makes him self-sufficient. As Harry and Meghan obtain the bulk of their income from the duchy then the lie extends to them too.The Duchy of Cornwall was established in  by Edward III as a gt to his son, Edward, Prince of Wales, also known as The Black Prince. The Prince of Wales does not extract his millions from this vast landholding through any merit or talent of his own. He is able to employ squads of professionals to help him and give credence to the subsistence lie.Only the oldest surviving son of the monarch gets to use it as his own personal cash cow. No women can get their mitts on it and no Catholics either. In st century Britain we allow this family of property thieves to prevent Catholics contaminating their bloodline, unless of course they first renounce their faith.Our maintenance of this family in their palaces and their multi-million pound lestyles mocks any pretensions this country has to values of equality, justice and honesty. For how can we proclaim these virtues and propel our young people towards them when we permit medieval feudalism and grievous discrimination to flourish at the heart of British society We always want the next generation to learn from the mistakes of past ones and to become better than us. This, though, becomes a pointless exercise when we seem to celebrate and bow down to the Royal Family and its ancient, unearned privileges. Here, mediocrity is rewarded entitlement is encouraged and true merit is scorned.If Prince Harry and Meghan Markel genuinely want to decouple from this seedy fiefdom then I wish them every success. The nation wonrsquot be convinced, though, until we see a set of accounts that doesnrsquot include income from the civil list or the spoils of th century conquest. And until we lose the rest of them Britain will never be entitled to call itself a modern, civilised country."},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh-collectors-rare-images-david-bowie-marilyn-monroe-go-hammer","story":"Images of Monroe by Lawrence Schiller show the Hollywood icon posing on a couch in a dressing down and are expected to fetch up to pound,.Meanwhile, a John R Rowlands photographic portrait of Bowie captures his Thin White Duke incarnation in  and is valued at pound, to pound,.:Exhibition of rare David Bowie photos to be held in GlasgowOriginally purchased by a private collector for a traditional Amsterdam canal house and then moved to a Georgian flat in Edinburghrsquos west end, the photographs are being auctioned off as the collector moves again.:DNA reveals Marilyn Monroersquos Highland rootsPop art pioneer Roy Lichtensteinrsquos cartoon strip lithographic triptych As I Opened Fire is on sale with an estimated price of pound to pound, while an untitled artwork from the Family Portrait series by Syrian artist Mohannad Orabi could fetch up to pound,.The items will go on sale at Lyon and Turnbull auctioneers in Edinburgh on Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"tom-gordon-scottish-labours-position-worse-thought","story":"A Wisden-like slew of statistics, itrsquos invaluable for shining a light on the overlooked details of the result.The latest contains some fascinating nuggets about the  vote in Scotland, especially about Labourrsquos fortunes.The partyrsquos Scottish executive, which meets in Glasgow today to discuss its response to that thrashing, might want a stf drink before reading it.For Scottish Labourrsquos result is even worse than it looked at first glance.The headlines were the loss of six of seven MPs, saved from a total wipe-out by Ian Murray in Edinburgh South, and its vote share falling from . per cent to .%, putting it third behind the Tories.While Labour only just came third in , it was decisively beaten by the Tories in , the gap between the two widening from . to . per cent.But look deeper and you really see how far the party has sunk.There have been five general elections in Scotland on the same boundaries, so some gruesome trends are discernible.In  and , Labour won  and  of Scotlandrsquos  seats with vote shares of .% and .% respectively.Many of the safest Labour seats in the UK were then in Scotland. The partyrsquos biggest majority in  was , in Coatbridge. Tony Blairrsquos majority in Sedgefield was only the third largest.In every Scottish seat, Labour candidates always polled at least %The SNP tsunami of  obviously changed that, but not just by washing away every Labour MP bar Mr Murray.There was new phenomenon.Labour effectively became electorally irrelevant in several Scottish seats.Candidates started losing deposits for the first time in decades.Labour lost three deposits - after polling less than % - across the entire UK in . All three were in Scotland.Labourrsquos share of the vote also fell below % in a dozen Scottish seats.The picture briefly improved in Mr Corbynrsquos half-decent loss of .There were no lost deposits in the UK, and Labourrsquos vote share was down to single figures in only three Scottish seats.But last month those worrying trends for Labour reasserted themselves.In , Labour won m votes in Scotland. Last month it was half that.The party lost  deposits across the UK. Seven were in Scotland.Its vote fell in all  Scottish seats, and went below % in  - single figure support in a third of the country.The Tories also lost seats and vote share in Scotland. But in only two seats did they drop into single figures, and there were no lost deposits.The SNP, which had an overall vote share of %, only fell below % in a single seat, Mr Murrayrsquos, and even there they managed a respectable .%.Labourrsquos vote was squeezed left, right and centre. It lost deposits in seats won by the SNP, the Tories and LibDems.It previous supporters abandoned it to vote tactically or just plain abandoned it.In Dumfries  Galloway, which it won in  with .% of the vote, Labour was down to a humbling .%.In large parts of Scotland, Labour is disappearing from the electoral map.A fallen giant, its carcass is being systematically stripped clean by other parties scavenging for votes.So what to do  Scottish leader Richard Leonard has announced he is leading a review of the election, with the party told to expect some ldquohard lessons.Herersquos a hard lesson for him. He should step aside from the review because hersquos part of the problem.In two colourless years as leader, he has lost both his MEPs, six of his MPs, andhe carries on as before, a good lot of his MSPs in  as well.He has just not connected with voters.He never tried to step out of Mr Corbynrsquos shadow. Worse, he seems more fired up by Labour party history than your tomorrow.Irsquove yet to hear his big vision for Scotland in the st century. But Irsquove lost count of his reveries about Mary Barbour and the Glasgow rent strikes of  years ago, or eulogies for Keir Hardie and other sepia-tinted ghosts.Itrsquos a comfort blanket. Therersquos not a single vote in any of it. Not one.The review will also cover the partyrsquos ldquoconstitutional offer. This boils down to whether it supports a second referendum on independence.Mr Leonard was initially opposed to Indyref, then caved in to Mr Corbyn and John McDonnell when they said Labour shouldnrsquot stand in the way of it.But now party members may be asked whether to actively embrace Indyref, as the outgoing general secretary of the STUC, Grahame Smith, has advised.There has been some harking back to the s, when Labourrsquos offer was a Scottish Parliament subject to a referendum. Back then the party was behind both the end and the means.However for Scottish Labour to back Indyref, but not back independence, would be a far harder trick to pull off.Hence Mr Leonard floating the idea of a multiple-choice referendum, with independence and devo max or federalism against the status quo.This might seem like a clever fudge.The SNP and Greens would back independence in such a scenario, Labour and the LibDems more devolution, leaving the Tories as the party offering Scotland an empty plate.But would voters really be bowled over by it  Ever greater devolution is already the direction of travel for Holyrood. The public expects it.Presenting it as a great leap forward requiring yet another trip to the polls is unlikely to earn much thanks.The setting up of Holyrood was a huge change. Independence obviously would be. But more powers Federalism would also require parallel devolution in Englandrsquos regions. Scottish Labour canrsquot guarantee that.Kezia Dugdale tried it, touting a ldquonew Act of Union as a federal riposte to independence. It sank without trace.Then there are the mechanics of a three-way vote, and the row over them.A first-past-the-post system could, in theory, deliver independencejust over a third of voters backed it. Under the single transferable vote, it could win out with even fewer first preferences.In the end, the need for a clear and authoritative result would make a re-run of rsquos binary choice between independence or the Union inevitable.Labour members shouldnrsquot be gulled into thinking there is a soft third-way optionIndyref ever comes to pass.Nicola Sturgeon doesnrsquot want Devo Max on the ballot. A decade ago, it might have seemed akin to a win for SNP, but not after Brexit. A Devo Max Scotland would still be outside the EU.In the panicky aftermath of defeat, a new constitutional offer might seem a key step in Scottish Labourrsquos recovery. But its problems are not so easily fixed.Its fall owes more to socio-economic and demographic change eroding its base and a decade of inadequate leadership both sides of the border.Ed Miliband and Jeremy Corbyn couldnrsquot cut it. Iain Gray and Johann Lamont couldnrsquot dent Alex Salmond, and Ms Dugdale and Mr Leonard have been no match for Nicola Sturgeon.Scottish Labourrsquos best hope is an electable UK leader who can earn the party a second look from voters.Adopting a new position on Indyref didnrsquot help Mr Corbyn and it wonrsquot make a winner out of Mr Leonard."},{"url":null,"title":"northern-irish-government-return-three-years-sinn-fein-agree-deal","story":"With the DUP having already signalled its support for a draft deal proposed by the UK and

From a Unionist perspective, that demands goodwill, or it risks the SNPrsquos undoubted electoral mandate hardeninginto one for another referendum.The Chancellorrsquos announcement of his plans for the UK budget, however, suggests that no consideration has been given to the timetabling dficulties created for Scotlandrsquos fiscal planning. This may be an unintentional slight, but it cannot be seen as anything other than a slight.The budget delay caused by the General Election may have been unavoidable, but this foul up should have been prevented. Reassurances of advance information, or claims that Holyrood has time between March  and its deadline at the end of the financial year to enact its own plans, may be technically accurate, but they look like a blithe disregard for Scotland. English departmental spending and forecasts of tax revenues have implications for the block grant, which might need to be examined and resolved in days, rather than the usual weeks or months.Itrsquos reasonable of Finance Secretary Derek Mackay to describe this as ldquodisrespectful evenhe can in theory set a budget before the Chancellorrsquos, he must know it would be foolhardy, and the UK Government ought to have recognised that, too.Evenone were to accept Chancellor Sajid Javidrsquos view that the situation is manageable, Westminsterrsquos apparent failure to have noticed the implications for Scottish council budgets ndash with a legal deadline actually on the day set for the UK budget ndash is inexcusable.

He helps to run the family-owned business with his father, Managing Director George Taylor.The crisps brand and Mackie’s at Taypack as a business were launched in  as the result of a joint-venture between potato farmers the Taylor family and Aberdeenshire’s Mackie’s of Scotland, which is renowned for its ice cream and chocolate.Its thick-cut and gently cooked potato crisps use the best ieties of crisping potatoes, grown on the farm, reflective of its “plough to pack” ethos.Subsequently, Mackie’s Crisps has become famous for its haggis and cracked black pepper iety, as well as launching the world’s first pigs in blankets flavour.Research on its new flavour started in earnest in  during a new product development push, after establishing Burns Night as an opening to deliver a new patriotic flavour combination.Meticulous sampling sessions helped it to master the flavour of haggis, neeps and tatties, building on its popular haggis-based flavours.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Members of Inverurie  District Mens Shed accept the donation from Barratt Homes\"  Funding boost for Inverurie Men’s Shed viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"The Mackie’s Crisps team were further convinced of launching the flavour when a student, Aileen McColm, joined the Perthshire business in  to shadow quality control manager Jamie McKell. She undertook a survey, with  respondents showing the flavour to be the favoured option for the target market. James added: “It’s been many years in the making, so we’ll be keeping in contact with our end customers and trade clients throughout to see what the appetite is like for our new flavour.“Who knows, we may even be able to expand the run to make it a permanent addition to our range. We’d also love to be able to sell bags abroad, helping the wider world to experience the taste of haggis, neeps and tatties.”"},{"url":null,"title":"ssen talk to bright spark pupils","story":"SSEN Transmission staff visited Rothienorman School last month to talk to the children about how energy works and how they can stay road safe during construction.The staff are currently working on the construction of the Rothienorman substation, which forms part of SSEN Transmission’s reinforcement and improvement of the transmission network in the North East and East Coast of Scotland.The school visit marked a busy couple of weeks for the team, following visits to the substation site by members of the local community, Fisherford Community Council and Rothienorman Community Association.During their visit they talked to the pupils about the key role Rothienorman substation will play in facilitating the connection of renewable energy to the National Grid on the North East Coast.They also showed them how the substation will help control the flow of energy across the north east, directing renewable energy generated around Peterhead, and assist with the delivery of energy to where it’s needed, while highlighting the key role SSEN Transmission plays in supporting the transition to Net Zero.Finally they used their visit to talk about staying safe around increased local and construction traffic and gave each pupil a high visibility vest and snap band to wear when travelling to and from school on dark mornings and winter nights, helping the children to “think bright” about road safety and improve their visibility to drivers on the road.Following the visit Gary Donlin, SSEN Transmission’s Community Liaison Manager, commented: “We really enjoyed our visit to Rothienorman School.“It was great to see the children so interested in finding out how energy works and the role SSEN Transmission plays in facilitating renewable generation and the transition to Net Zero.”Mr Donlin added: “We have been working closely with community since the early development of the project and this has continued into construction, it is important to us to ensure we work together to actively mitigate any impacts of the works.“We were pleased we were able to talk about keeping road safe around construction traffic and give the children high-vis to help themselves to be seen by drivers during the dark mornings and nights.”Work on the substation began in April this year and is expected to be completed in summer .data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

People in Orkney will be shocked to hear how often those making emergency calls are being forced to wait due to a lack of land ambulance cover. In many instances, these will be cases where the response time can be critical.“This is absolutely no criticism of Orkney’s ambulance crews, who do outstanding work in operating a service that is clearly over-stretched. Indeed, the admission from the Minister about the scale of the problem shows that local crews are being let down by a lack of resources and support. This can only be making an already dficult job even more challenging.“I am due to meet senior representatives of the Scottish Ambulance Service early next month. I will make clear the need for an urgent review into the resources available locally and calling for additional capacity to meet the needs of the Orkney community. This is the very least that the public and our ambulance staff deserve.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr Han voted in Kaohsiung, the city in southern Taiwan where he is mayor. --Han Kuo-yu, Taiwanrsquos  presidential election candidate of the KMT or Nationalist Party, prepares to cast his votes at a polling station in southern Taiwanrsquos Kaohsiung city--ldquoI hope every citizen can come out and vote, Miss Tsai said after casting her vote in Taipei, the capital. ldquoYou should exercise your rights to make democracy stronger in Taiwan.For many in Taiwan, months of protests in Hong Kong have cast in stark relief the contrast between their democratically governed island and authoritarian, communist-ruled mainland China.Miss Tsai said at a final campaign rally on Friday night that the election was a chance to protect Taiwanrsquos democracy.ldquoLet us tell the world with our own votes that Taiwanese are determined to defend sovereignty, determined to guard democracy and determined to persist in reforms, she said.The Nationalist Partyrsquos Mr Han has said Taiwan should be more open to negotiations with China, in contrast to Miss Tsai, who has dismissed Beijingrsquos overtures. At his last rally, attended by hundreds of thousands of people in the southern port city of Kaohsiung, he focused on practical issues such as improving education and the economy.ldquoI want to attract massive investments. I want products to be exported non-stop, he said.China and Taiwan separated during civil war in , but Beijing still claims sovereignty over the island and occasionally threatens to use force to seize controlnecessary.The Hong Kong protests have undermined Taiwan support for the ldquoone-country, two-systems approach Beijing has championed for governing both that former British colony and Taiwan.Fears of Chinese interference in Taiwanrsquos politics and an uptick in the economy have helped Miss Tsai regain an edge after a dire electoral setback for her Democratic Progressive Party months ago. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Taiwanrsquos  presidential election candidate, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen lines up and talks with people at a polling station in New Taipei City, Taiwan--ldquoThe reason why I vote for her is for upholding the value of Taiwanrsquos freedom and democracy and that should not be affected by the other side of the strait , Lucy Ting, a college student, said at Miss Tsairsquos rally on Friday.The Nationalists have struggled to find candidates who can fire up their pro-China supporters and win over young Taiwanese who increasingly favour the DPP.A win by Miss Tsai is anticipated to draw more diplomatic, economic and military pressure from Beijing on the island, in a continuation of President Xi Jinpingrsquos campaign to compel her administration to endorse its insistence that Taiwan is a part of China.Miss Tsai has refused to do so, maintaining Beijing has no claim over Taiwan, although her government has repeatedly called for the reopening of talks between the sides without preconditions.Since its transition to full democracy beginning in the s, Taiwan has increasingly asserted its independent identity from China even though it is not recognised by the United Nations or any major nation.The island of more than  million people exercises all the roles of a sovereign nation, issuing its own passports, maintaining its own military and legal system and serving as a crucial hub in the global high-tech supply chain.If re-elected, Miss Tsai will face challenges in trying to reform the government and economy and push through unpopular cuts in generous civil service pensions.copy -.

I went to school for  years, straight to university, and from there on to Moray House to teacher train.Things were easier for young teachers thenand I was offered a few jobs. I took one, then another, and so on until I ended up, by a rather convoluted process, as a head teacher. That was my career, and, among many other things, it meant that, man and boy, I always had the whole summer offit meant I spent my whole working le among young people, which I think is good for you, no matter how many people have said ‘You’re a teacher  Oh, I could never do that’ and, most profoundly, it made me assume that, like my colleagues and I, everybody out there thought that education really mattered.I’m sorry, now that we are in this brave new year, to drag this fact screaming out of Scotland’s collective psyche, but we had a general election in December. Now, no matter where you stand on the political spectrum, you have to admit that education did not really figure large in anyone’s election manesto.: Don’t let SNP mislead you about the state of Scottish education – Murdo Fraser: The evidence that shows Scottish education’s critics are playing politics – John SwinneyI’m sure it was hiding in them somewhere but was there really any chat about it going on  In the UK, there were the two recurring themes – “Get Brexit Done” and “You Can’t Sell Our NHS” in Scotland, the demand for a post-Brexit indyref joined the chorus.Whatever the outcomes, I can’t really remember anyone suggesting that we should be talking about schools, with the slightly odd exception of the discussion, in England and Wales, of whether Ofsted should be scrapped. In the past, education was more of an electoral issue – Tony Blair, in , said “Our top priority was, and always will be education, education, education” – whose “top priority” was it this time round HuspitalznskoolsAnd yet for decades, from school debates to the highest reaches of governmentdecent people have talked about the need to spend more money on “hospitals and schools” – it’s a cliché, almost one word as in “we need to pour money into huspitalznskools”. Actually, though, I have started to realise that most people are much more bothered about the NHS and hospitals and health than they are about schools. I’m not sure that should come as too much of a surprise. Children go to schools, and they can’t vote. Adults have been to school, and are not going again. Childless people have no stake, or so it would superficially seem.Really the only group of people actually invested in education at any one time are people with children at school, and by the time your kids are  or so, there isn’t much point in agitating too much, because change takes time, and they’ll be away from the school by the time the revolution has been effected.Whereas, health ! We’re all going to be ill, or in an accident, or have a sick child. It could be in  or it could be tonight.As Philip Larkin said in his great poem, Ambulances, “all streets in time are visited”: one day it’ll be you. So you don’t have to have a very cynical view of human nature to see why people might be a whole lot more worried about health than they are about education. OK, both these issues are devolved to the Scottish government, and this was a Westminster election, but it still makes you think.Ghastly memoryI think in , there needs to begin a whole new review of the education provision in Scotland’s schools, because there’s only a certain time that the highly dedicated professionals teaching and running them can keep paddling in this very deep water, as the tide pushes them back.Another ghastly memory from last year was the publication of the results of the  Pisa survey, which compares education systems. Reading was a bit better – back to the level it was in but the results in maths and science were the worst results that Scotland’s had since we started taking part  years ago. Nearly , Scottish pupils took part in tests sat by , pupils worldwide. Now, I was a teacher of English, so I am always happy to see our young people reading better, but, I have to say it –a nation’s young people are getting worse at their sums and their science, it spells disaster for our economy in the medium term.So, we have to start really thinking about what it is we want to achieve in our schools. I have a hunch that the Scottish Government doesn’t want to rock the educational boat too much as we press forward towards possible independence, but surely all of us – young people, parents, teachers and yes, the grandparents, the childless, people who hated their own schooling, all those who don’t have a stake in today’s schools and don’t really know what’s going on in them – don’t we all need to know that there’s a chance for Scotland to have a great education system again, whether we are independent or not, and don’t we have to start thinking about what that might look like Cameron Wyllie’s blog is www.ahouseinjoppa.wordpress©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh adventurer mollie hughes becomes youngest woman to ski solo to the south pole","story":"Edinburgh adventurer Mollie Hughes has arrived at the South Pole, breaking the record for the youngest woman ever to complete the solo trek there. window.twttr At , Ms Hughes has beaten the current record held by -year-old Vilborg Gissuradottir, from Iceland.She wrote on Twitter at .pm UK time: \"After . days of skiing I am standing at the Geographic South Pole as the youngest woman EVER to ski solo from the coast of Antarctica to the Pole!\"\"Its a surreal feeling,\" she said later in a statement. \"I canrsquot quite believe Irsquove done it.

Her original plan was to reach the geographic South Pole by New Yearrsquos Day, but due to harsh weather conditions she has made slower progress than expected.To maintain energy levels she had to eat around , calories a day - more than twice the average daily amount for a woman. Despite this she lost around kg during the course of the trip. The extendedof her trek meant she needed to receive a food drop during the trip, meaning that her record is now the youngest woman to ski solo to the South Pole, rather than solo and unsupported as initially intended. Ms Hughes has been in training for the trek since this time last year, and is no stranger to dficult conditions as in  she became the youngest person to climb both the north and south sides of Mount Everest.She will now recuperate at a camp at the South Pole before flying to Punta Arenas in Chile. She is due toto Edinburgh on January .

Saturday morning and not letting up until midnight on Monday.Only Sunday will provide any respite from rain and hurricane-force winds, expected to touch mph.The warnings come as last month was confirmed as providing the warmest December temperature ever seen in the UK.The mercury soared to .Cat Achfary in the Highlands on December , smashing the existing record which had stood since .Since the New Year, however, a mph Jetstream has been firing a series of low pressure systems across the Atlantic.The latest arrived on our shores last night, promising a “horrible” day across much of the country for the first day of the weekend.A yellow Met Office ‘be aware’ warning has been issued for a wide area of west central Scotland, an area to the north of Glasgow stretching almost as far as Inverness.The atrocious conditions are expected to last until pm tonight.Rainfall totals of -mmhave been forecast quite widely, with more than mmover high ground in Argyll.According to the Met Office, this could cause “fast-flowing or deep floodwater” in the danger areas, leading to some homes being inundated.Spray and standing water will lead to dficult driving conditions and may cause some roads to be closed.Similar warnings for heavy rain have also been imposed on south west Scotland, Dumfries and Galloway and Lothian and Borders, including the route of the M.On the east coast and overlapping into The Borders, the warning in place is for wind, in almost the exact same area hammered by severe gales on Tuesday, which saw two lorries blown over on the A.Bonnie Diamond of the Met Office said:”We are looking at gusts of up to mph, similar to what this part of the country experienced earlier in the week.“These winds will affect high-sided vehicles and could cause delays on the roads and bridges.“The warning is in place from early Saturday until pm.It will be a horrible day cross Scotland.”Police have not yet said whether the A will be subject to similar restrictions imposed for much of Tuesday, when it was closed to all traffic between Haddington Junction and Thistly Cross.In addition, drivers of high sided vehicles were told to stay off the entire road from Edinburgh to the English border.Sunday will be the best day of the weekend before things deteriorate once more on Monday.Yet another low pressure system crashes into the country, resulting in warnings of gusts of up to mph on the west coast.Ferry services are likely to be decimated, during the warning period which extends from noon until midnight.Ms Diamond of the Met Office added:”I’m afraid it’s a downward

The -year-old contract, which secured the services of Downpatrick footballer Jimmy Connor, is now the oldest artefact in the society’s museum.Signed on July , the document was for a season-long spell from September  of that year until April  in . However, Connor was also part of Belfast Celtic’s first league winning side of the - season.His highly decorated career would see him win virtually every trophy in Irish football, including a further league title with Glentoran and the inaugural Gold Cup in .The Belfast Celtic Society received the artefact from an anonymous donor, who found it in a pub in County Down.Speaking about the find, the society’s Chairman, Pádraig Coyle, said: “It means a huge amount to us.“The donor, when they did a bit of research and saw who this man was, they got in touch with the Society and askedwe would be interested in having them in the museum and of course we were delighted and very pleased that they are there. “It’s just another bit in the jigsaw of the story that is Belfast Celtic.”Signed by Belfast Celtic Secretary Robert Barr, the deal saw Connor receive a £ signing-on fee and  shillings per week. Mr Coyle said the fairly lucrative contract offers an insight into how well the club treated its players.“He was paid a fair wage then, and it’s interesting when you look at the document and see that when they were injured they still got paid provided they showed a doctor’s certicate,” he said,“It’s another reflection of how Belfast Celtic tried to look after its players in those days. Bear in mind that there wasn’t social security back then, there weren’t employers insurance arrangements, so it would’ve meant a lot to the guy thathe was hurt that his employers would look after him. I’m not surethat was common practice, but that’s how he was treated by Belfast Celtic.”Connor was seen as a particularly tough player, who would walk from Downpatrick to Belfast for training sessions, but for all his physical prowess and skill he was, given the time, relatively uneducated and simply signed his contract with an ‘X’.“It’s absolutely no reflection on him that maybe he wasn’t able to read or write, but how many people back then would’ve had access to education in the way that we do so now,” Mr Coyle explained.“What became the  Plus Act, the Education Act, wasn’t introduced until , so for many people having a basic education just wasn’t as easy,you lived in a rural area it was much more dficult.“I hadn’t seen a contract signed with an ‘X’ before I saw his contract. Of course, this was  years ago.”While the contract offers a fascinating insight into Belfast Celtic as a club, Mr Coyle said it contributes to the wider history of the city, particularly around St James’ and the Park Centre site where Celtic Park once sat.“It all helps to tell the story of that part of the city because at the time Jimmy Connor was playing for them they were the star attraction in that part of the area. People’s lives revolved around seeing Belfast Celtic midweek and on a Saturday. “The man who would’ve signed Jimmy Connor, his name is at the top of the contract, Robert Barr – he was a school teacher and he gave that up to become full-time secretary of Belfast Celtic Football Club. He worked for them until his death. There is a story there too. You’ll know St James’ and there’s a roadthat leads to Willowbank’s playing pitch and my surmising of it is that he lived in a house back in the day when there wouldn’t have been that road there, but he lived in a house, from what I’ve been told, that led into the Belfast Celtic ground. The story goes that he went out his back door in the morning, down that back garden and out a gate straight into Celtic Park.He added: “He would’ve been the guy who did all the administration for people like Jimmy Connor, who maybe couldn’t read or write, but he looked after them and made sure they were treated properly.”During his career Jimmy Connor was picked as an Irish international, receiving  caps during a -year spell when he played alongside other stars such as Mickey Hamill and Patrick O’Connell who, during a his managerial career, would save Catalan giants FC Barcelona from certain collapse.Sadly, Jimmy Connor’s le was cut short when he died in the Spanish Flu pandemic of , aged just .It is not knownJimmy Connor is survived by any family members, but Mr Coyle encouraged anyone with any information about him or Belfast Celtic to help keep the history alive by getting in touch.“Those of us associated with the Society are just volunteers who love the story and we’re happy in any way to help promote the story,” he enthused.“If people have anything they want to let us see or talk about then we’re more than willing.Anything at all to keep the story of the incredible football club going.”Jimmy Connor’s contract will go on display at the Belfast Celtic Society museum in the Park Centre."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"orange order says no to new decade new approach deal","story":"ORANGE Order leaders have fired a shot across the DUP bows with a no-holds-barred attack on the #New Decade, New Approach# deal tabled last night by the Irish and British governments.Previously, Order Grand Secretary Mervyn Gibson had warned the DUP that any concession on an Irish Language Act would be fiercely opposed by Orangemen.#In contrast to the detailed list of measures to promote the Irish language, references to Ulster-Scots Ulster-British culture are ambiguous # lacking meaningful detail or delivery mechanisms,# said a statement from the Grand Lodge of Ireland. #Indeed, many of the initiatives are merely reworking of previous undelivered commitments to our community. As British citizens living in the United Kingdom, we have a complex and multi-layered identity which in many areas is wider than simply Ulster-Scots. We remain unconvinced that the cultural traditions and identity of the Orange family will be meaningfully promoted or safeguarded by these proposal.#Earlier Conradh na Gaeilge had branded the proposals an #historic advancement# for the Irish language but ones which fell #far short# of previous government commitments by the Irish and British governments.The deal includes a number of provisions for the language including the appointment of a Irish Language Commissioner.Dr Niall Comer, President of Conradh na Gaeilge, said that deal was #undoubtedly historic#, however, the organisation highlighted the absence of an Irish Language Act as promised in the  St Andrew#s Agreement. #This legislation is undoubtedly an historic advancement for our community, and for those who wish to use the language, by providing historic official status, legal protection and an Irish language Commissioner for the first time in the history of the state,# Dr Comer said.#This has only come about as the result of a tireless, inspirational and bottom up campaign which has transformed how people here now view the language and ultimately how the state will interact with our community and shared language moving forward.#Ciarán Mac Giolla Bhéin of Conradh na Gaeilge added: #This protection comes in the form of an Irish language Bill being pasted into the GFA, independent from the other language legislation, as new, separate parts of that agreement. If passed, we will hold any new power-sharing executive fully to account on the full implementation of these proposals and will tirelessly test and expose the weaknesses and glaring omissions in the coming days, weeks and months. #There are some huge question marks here. These proposals fall far short of the commitments made in the  St Andrew’s Agreement, which promised an Irish language Act based on the Welsh legislation and does not contain provisions that are made for language in Wales or in the south, as was explicitly committed to by both Governments. #The complete omission of visibility and signage is hugely frustrating and will undoubtedly be a source of tension and will expose major fault-lines on contested cases of signage in the coming period. However, the possibility of the delivery of signage through language standards will be rigorously and immediately tested by our community. #The role and remit of the commissioner being left to the sign-off of OFMDFM leaves us at the whim of a veto being used against core components of the legislation and drafting and delivery of services. The use of any veto to limit, obstruct or frustrate delivery of services and rights would undoubtedly erode trust and could be potentially catastrophic for any incoming Executive.#We welcome the adoption of recommendations included in our consultation document for the centuries long overdue repeal of the final remaining  Penal Law, that will now facilitate the use of Irish in Courts the new central translations hub the right to use Irish in the Assembly, where it was previously sneered at and belittled, which includes a provision for simultaneous translation. Finally, the commitment to an Irish language Strategy has the potential to transform our community in the coming years. #We will now work diligently towards testing the glaring gaps in the legislation that prevent us from playing a fair and equal role in our society. Legal advice is being sought on several of the provisions, including the ‘official status’ provision. The devil is not only in the detail of the legislation, but in the implementation of that legislation.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"o theanga leipreachain go dti acht ghaeilge","story":"I , caitheadh amach as mo chéad chruinniú den Chomhairle i mBéal Feirste mé as Gaeilge a labhairt.Nó “teanga leipreacháin” mar bhaist Sammy Wilson uirthi.Mhuscail mé inniu agus Acht Ghaeilge ar an táirseach againn.Moill ró-fhada ach d’éirigh linn mar phobal Gaeilge ó Thuaidh tabhairt ar na húdaráis an tAcht a bhí geallta ó  a ghéillstin.Tá na heilimintí tábhachtacha atá de dhíth in aon Acht ansin:Stádas oigiúil.Coimisinéir Teanga.Caighdeáin seachas scéimeanna.Agus ar ndóighe tá ríméad ar leith orm go bhfuil aistriúchán comhuaineach le bheith curtha ar fáil sa Tionól féin agus comhaltaí ag caint Gaeilge.

Instead, they favour the construction of a tunnel under the Irish Sea. In fact, the plan is for two tunnels - one from England to the Isle of Man, and a second from the Isle of Man to Co Down.They say their proposal would be better than a bridge, as a rail tunnel would not be at the mercy of bad weather, and would avoid the problems in spanning Beaufort Dyke, a deep sea trench in the North Channel containing a million tonnes of dumped wartime munitions.The plan is part of a broader list of tunnel projects put forward by the society. They include a tunnel from Hampshire to the Isle of Wight, another under the Bristol Channel between the West Country and Wales, and a new tunnel under the Thames.Bill Grose, lead author of the ICE report, told the Sunday Times: \"A tunnel starting north of Liverpool that surfaced in the Isle of Man and then went back under to reach Belfast would solve all the problems\" he said.\"Tunnels are less prone to bad weather, and construction is getting faster and cheaper every year.\"The distance from England to the Isle of Man is around  miles, and from the Isle of Man to Northern Ireland is just over  miles.Mr Grose, a former chairman of the British Tunnelling Society, added: \"As prices continue to fall, tunnels will become increasingly attractive as a way of connecting the United Kingdom.\"It cost about £m per kilometre for a twin rail tunnel, but costs are falling. When we reduce them by another %, tunnelling will become popular and very long tunnels become feasible.\"Tunnels and bridges cost much the same - but tunnels are not prone to bad weather.\"The ambitious proposals are surfacing as Prime Minister Boris Johnson is known to be interested in major construction projects to unite the UK in the post-Brexit era.In September last year it was learned that Mr Johnson had asked Government officials for advice on the costs and risks of building a bridge from Scotland to Northern Ireland.Initial estimates put the cost at around £bn.

It does not have the electoral strength to take a ministry by right but may be invited to take up the justice portfolio, which is allocated by a dferent process to other ministries.The Ulster Unionist Party, which is entitled to a seat, has not indicated whether it will enter the executive.The wide-ranging deal, which was published by the governments on Thursday night, contains compromise solutions to the vexed disputes at the heart of the -month powersharing impasse, such as legislative provisions for Irish language speakers. It will also be accompanied by what the UK Government has promised will be a major investment package.“We now have the basis to restore powersharing, and we’re up for that,” said Ms McDonald, making the landmark announcement in Parliament Buildings in Belfast.The move, which came after a day of internal deliberations by the republican party, followed a similar announcement by DUP leader Arlene Foster on Thursday night.The sign-off of both leaders was vital, as peace process structures mean a ministerial executive can onlywith the inclusion of the largest unionist party and largest nationalist party in the region.The Sinn Féin Ard Chomhairle has met today and decided to re-enter the power sharing institutions and nominate ministers to the Executive - @MaryLouMcDonald pic uckmurFeP— Sinn FéinJanuary , Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith, who helped broker the deal alongside Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney, welcomed confirmation that devolution would .He tweeted: “A devolved government can now start delivering the reforms needed in our public services.

It offers an opportunity to restore devolution implemented with goodwill and genuine commitment to power-sharing, can deliver for NI.”Government funding is set to help tackle a host of acute problems facing a public sector that has been floundering amid the governance vacuum.One of the most high-profile of those is an industrial dispute in the health service which on Friday saw nurses again walk out on strike.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Nurses and supporters on the picket line at Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital Under the terms of the deal, the new executive will also take action to reduce spiralling hospital waiting lists extend mitigation payments for benefit claimants hit by welfare reforms increase the number of police officers on the beat and resolve an industrial dispute involving teachers.The last DUP Sinn Fein-led coalition government collapsed in January  over a row about a botched green energy scheme.That row subsequently widened to take in more traditional wrangles on matters such as the Irish language and the thorny legacy of the Troubles.Mr Coveney said history has been made. Speaking to reporters in Dublin after Sinn Fein backed the deal, he said: “History is being made today. We now have confirmation from the two largest parties in Northern Ireland that they both are committed to re-entering an executive and establishing a ing Stormont again.“Of course, that is not the end of the story as we want this to be an all-party executive so I hope that the Alliance Party and SDLP will also be able to join Sinn Fein and the DUP in that new executive.“We hope that it may be possible that executive will be formed tomorrow butnot tomorrow, certainly Monday and to build on the momentum that is being created in the past  hours so that people can see positive political activity, people working together and setting an example and signal of positivity and show that politics in Northern Ireland can be a force for good and brings people together.”"},{"url":null,"title":"sir keir starmer vows to win back labour voters who deserted the party","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

My dog means the world to me and I don’t know what  to do. I’ve no home or money now for him. “Le has taken a really bad turn for me and I couldn’t imagine him being outside with me cold and hungry.

Michelle Southern, the charity’s founder, said: “Rooney’s story has really touched the hearts of the nation, but sadly it’s not uncommon.

Mr Han voted in Kaohsiung, the city in southern Taiwan where he is mayor.“I hope every citizen can come out and vote,” Miss Tsai said after casting her vote in Taipei, the capital. “You should exercise your rights to make democracy stronger in Taiwan.”For many in Taiwan, months of protests in Hong Kong have cast in stark relief the contrast between their democratically governed island and authoritarian, communist-ruled mainland China.Miss Tsai said at a final campaign rally on Friday night that the election was a chance to protect Taiwan’s democracy.“Let us tell the world with our own votes that Taiwanese are determined to defend sovereignty, determined to guard democracy and determined to persist in reforms,” she said.The Nationalist Party’s Mr Han has said Taiwan should be more open to negotiations with China, in contrast to Miss Tsai, who has dismissed Beijing’s overtures.I want to attract massive investments. I want products to be exported non-stopHan Kuo-yuAt his last rally, attended by hundreds of thousands of people in the southern port city of Kaohsiung, he focused on practical issues such as improving education and the economy.“I want to attract massive investments. I want products to be exported non-stop,” he said.China and Taiwan separated during civil war in , but Beijing still claims sovereignty over the island and occasionally threatens to use force to seize controlnecessary.The Hong Kong protests have undermined Taiwan support for the “one-country, two-systems” approach Beijing has championed for governing both that former British colony and Taiwan.Fears of Chinese interference in Taiwan’s politics and an uptick in the economy have helped Miss Tsai regain an edge after a dire electoral setback for her Democratic Progressive Party months ago.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Taiwan’s  presidential election candidate, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen lines up and talks with people at a polling station in New Taipei City, Taiwan “The reason why I vote for her is for upholding the value of Taiwan’s freedom and democracy and that should not be affected by the other side of the strait ,” Lucy Ting, a college student, said at Miss Tsai’s rally on Friday.The Nationalists have struggled to find candidates who can fire up their pro-China supporters and win over young Taiwanese who increasingly favour the DPP.A win by Miss Tsai is anticipated to draw more diplomatic, economic and military pressure from Beijing on the island, in a continuation of President Xi Jinping’s campaign to compel her administration to endorse its insistence that Taiwan is a part of China.Miss Tsai has refused to do so, maintaining Beijing has no claim over Taiwan, although her government has repeatedly called for the reopening of talks between the sides without preconditions.Since its transition to full democracy beginning in the s, Taiwan has increasingly asserted its independent identity from China even though it is not recognised by the United Nations or any major nation.The island of more than  million people exercises all the roles of a sovereign nation, issuing its own passports, maintaining its own military and legal system and serving as a crucial hub in the global high-tech supply chain.If re-elected, Miss Tsai will face challenges in trying to reform the government and economy and push through unpopular cuts in generous civil service pensions."},{"url":null,"title":"507474","story":"Ulster University’s most up-to-date financial strategy and strategic plans make no mention of Derry’s Magee campus. Its strategic plan centres around funding for the Greater Belfast Development with no mention of its Magee or Coleraine campuses which have witnessed student numbers drop signicantly in the past five years. The University’s most recent Financial Statement for  , outlines its long-term financial strategy. UU’s five-year strategic plan ‘Five and Fty’ sets the vision and mission of the University. It states: “As Northern Ireland’s civic university, Ulster University will deliver outstanding research and teaching that encourages the innovation, leadership and vision needed to help our community thrive.” googletag.cmd.push It details ambitions to deliver an “operating surplus” to support a sustainable investment strategy in both the University’s physical resources and information technology facilities. This includes the generation of “sufficient cash reserves” to allow for the allocation of poundm per annum to capital projects of which poundm per annum is towards the Greater Belfast Development and the repayment of loans to fund this project. A spokesperson for the Derry University Group has urged UU to immediately hand over its lands to city-region, saying: UU is demonstrating all the hallmarks of a struggling multi-national business running down a neglected outpost. Ulster needs to hand over the lands and budgets at Magee to the city-region immediately to allow us to develop university provision here autonomously. Ultimately, we can sit and watch UU die slowly in the regions while it moves to Belfast, or we can take proper control of the situation ourselves and start building for the future, with a vengeance. googletag.cmd.push The idea of Council partnering in a multi-million pounds development City Deal with organisation such as UU is frankly ludicrous. Imagine you were about to invest poundm and performed due diligence on your partners and found out they had UUs record. You would leave the table immediately. Council must do likewise. Signicant problems The University’s approved financial strategy aimed to ensure the financial viability of UU. Any borrowings were not to exceed that approved in the Business Plan for the Greater Belfast Development and any other projects that may arise which are confirmed as self-funding. The strategy also aimed to support the development of activities that generate income for growth. However, since the   financial statement was published the Northern Ireland Audit Office released a report showing that the Greater Belfast Development has encountered signicant problems, and delays, meaning it now needs to attract substantial additional external finance to bridge a major funding gap. It is anticipated to run poundm over budget. The business case, approved in March , envisaged that the expanded Belfast Campus would be open to students in September  at a cost of pound million. Funding was to come mainly from the UU’s own reserves and external borrowing, with the Department for the Economycontributing poundm capital grant. UU has earmarked cash reserves of poundm built up since , to support the project and committed a further pound million over the next three years. This is over and above the pound.m spent by UU to date. The total cost of the project is now estimated at pound.m including  per cent VAT which is irrecoverable.

Speaking about the event, Roy said: “The poetry of Seamus Heaney has always captured my attention. Often Heaney manages to say with a touching sensitivity and brilliant eloquence the kinds of things I am also trying to say through my own song writing. His is truly poetry for the soul. To be invited to play at the Heaney HomePlace for this, the third January running is a special honour and a thrill.”During the afternoon gig, which will take place between .pm and .pm, Anne and Roy will feature tracks from their “Songs for the Soul” CD .All tracks were composed by Roy, as well as songs from artists as ious as Judy Collins, Tom Waits and the late and much mourned, Eamon Friel.Anne explained: “Both of us are delighted to be joined by that fabulous musician and arranger, ‘the maestro’ Eddie O Donnell on keys and guitar as well as by my brother, Michael Corey, a mighty singer with a wide repertoire of songs.“Another Moneymore woman, Maura Johnston, whose poems from The Whetsone were launched to great celebration at the Heaney HomePlace during March , will add a special colour and richness to the afternoon.” The final member of this very talented troupe is Buncana-based Tom Byrne, wizard on both accordion or harmonica. He will be making his debut at the Heaney HomePlace.“The six of us are all looking forward to performing together at the Home Place,” said Anne. She added: “We have chosen a set-list which includes both original and traditional songs, songs we hope will touch the hearts of the audience gathered together in Bellaghy just a couple of weeks into the new year, songs with a story to them, songs that explore the pull of ‘home,’ ‘identity’ and ‘place’ and songs with a bit of craic to them.“Though I have lived in Derry city for quite a number of years, for me it is special to be performing in such a magnicent venue so close to my own home town of Moneymore. “And I am thrilled that my brother, Brendan Corey, is making a pilgrimage to the Heaney HomePlace all the way from Long Island, New York.“Brendan has been singing and playing professionally in New York for over  years but has joined us for a few songs over the past three years. “He is truly smitten by the atmosphere and audience reception in the Heaney Home Place.”Anne Tracey, Roy Arbuckle, Eddie ODonnell, Michael Corey, Maura Johnston, Tom Byrne, and Brendan Corey appearing at the Heaney Home Place, Bellaghy, from .pm this Saturday,  January.

This information can now be easily recorded through the elicence website.John McCartney, director of conservation and protection, said: “This is really important information because it enables our scientists to understand how many fish are caught, taken or ed back to the river and how much time anglers put into catching those fish.“ It provides an indication of how well stocks are doing andwe need to take any action should catches take a turn for the worst.”Freshwater fishery biologist, Mark McCauley, said the Loughs Agency used anglers logs s to manage the fisheries of Foyle. He added: “We use the data to screen proposed developments such as roads, hydro, etc that may impact the interests of the fishery.“We can also use the data anglers provide to assess the strength of fish runs in the system this year and also for long term trend monitoring.”Have you purchased a Loughs Agency licence this year  Log in with your angler number at https:elicence.loughs-agency.org and update your angling log for the  season. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show there are  administrative staff based at Coleraine and  at Magee. The latest figures available show , students are based at Magee and , at Coleraine. Money spent on admin staff at Coleraine is pound,, whereas a total of pound,, is spent on salaries at Magee. In addition, Colerainehas  teaching staff, Magee , with pound,, and pound,, spent respectively. Independent Councillor, Gary Donnelly, who supports proposals for an independent north west university described the figures as “appalling” and further evidence that Derry City and Strabane District Council should lay the groundwork for a standalone institution. googletag.cmd.push These figures are appalling - evidence that UU is clearly only interested in Coleraine and Belfast - but they are not shocking, as we have known all about their propensity for discrimination for generations already. “Council is threatening to partner with this organisation and hand them over poundm of capital from the City Deal - money that could go out the back door to Belfast to pay for UUs massive overspend there. This needs to be reconsidered.” He added: The Magee Campus - and its budgets - must come back under local governance. The North West - which we have previously defined as the combined Donegal and Derry Strabane council areas - needs its own independent university to reverse the tide of educational discrimination which has existed here since partition. googletag.cmd.push “It is time Derry City and Strabane District Council began preparing to develop a standalone university here and local elected representatives need to keep this firmly on the agenda. UU’s biggest campus, Jordanstown, which will relocate to Belfast City Centre, has  administrative staff and  people in its teaching staff – costing pound,, and pound,, respectively.  Top earners Spread amongst the figures for each of the institutions are the salaries of all top earners at UU depending upon which campus they are based. Departing Vice-Chancellor, Professor Paddy Nixon, was appointed and took up post of VC and Chief Accounting Officer on  July . According to the universitys latest financial statement for  , the VC earned pound, taking in benefits and employers pension contributions that rises to pound,. There are  other “high paid staff” earning over pound, per annum,  earn between poundk and poundk while the other  earn poundk-poundk. The reports states: Vice–Chancellor leads Ulster University to make a signicant social, economic and cultural contribution, helping our community to thrive and confidently supporting Northern Ireland on the global stage. In an increasingly competitive sector, university leadership reflects the scale, complexity and impact of higher education across research and teaching. The Vice Chancellor’s salary is determined by the University’s committee responsible for remuneration and governance. ‘Business needs’ In response, an Ulster University spokesperson said there are administrative staff based on each campus, with many departmental roles supporting activities across its multi campus University. She added: “As such, the number of administrative staff does not directly correlate to the student numbers on each campus. “All categories of University staff are located and distributed across campuses, depending upon business needs, operational requirements and academic or professional specialisms. “Although they may be attached to one campus for the purposes of staff records, many teaching staff are mobile and work across more than one campus. The ratio of staff to students ies, depending upon the nature of the subjects and course provision.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

McCrudden and McLaughlin are reunited just over a year after the pair succeeded at Institute, where the forward was on  goals midway through the season before joining Derry City. McCruddens time at the Candystripes was blighted by injury, making only  starts and  substitute appearances for the club during his second spell at the club. His decision to join Cltonville is a huge boost for McLaughlin who believes he has added a huge talent to his squad. “At the time Mickey was playing with Stute I thought he was up there with the best strikers in the ision,” he said. He and Joewere sitting on almost  goals each at the turn of January and that was a phenomenal record for anyone playing for Institute. “You couldnt blame him then for going to Derry City, his home town club in a full time environment and he deserved the chance to do that, but when the chance came now to sign for Cltonville it was a no-brainer. Hes as good as anyone in the league and were delighted to get him.”McCrudden was one of Irelands hottest properties during time at Institute and while his time at Derry City did not go as expected, McLaughlin believes that the forward canto his prolic ways once again.“He got injured three or four weeks in and that was the worst possible start and that type of injury takes forever to heal,” McLaughlin said. “It was a nightmare injury so Im sure he was disappointed with that and he probably didnt fulfill his potential at Derry, but thats football.“Sometimes you get lucky breaks, and sometimes you get unlucky breaks and Michael was just unfortunate at Derry. He was then limited in his opportunities because the team was doing so well and hed probably understand that. “He felt that it would be best to start afresh where and were delighted he has come to us. What happened in the past for him stays there. He has got to look forward now with Cltonville andhe can get back to playing the way we know he can play, then we will have one of the best strikers in the ision coming on board.” googletag.cmd.push Good footballing background This is not the first time that McLaughlin has turned to his former club to boost his Cltonville squad, with full back Conor McDermott finding a new lease of le at Solitude. McLaughlin is now hoping that lightning can strike twice with McCrudden finding his previous prolic form to boost his teams own title challenge. “Its a tough competitive league but they are coming from a good footballing background when they leave Derry City,” McLaughlin agreed. “The full time training everyday is brilliant for them. You see Patrick McClean doing really well at Glentoran and theres Josh Daniels at Glenavon. There are good players in the Irish League who have benefitted from their experience at Derry City. “We try and identy a player who can bring something we dont have and we are lucky enough because Conor McDermott has been brilliant for us, with top performances. Were glad now to have Mickey on board and hopefully he will be another fantastic signing for us.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A - draw with Dungannon Swts aside, it has been defeat after defeat for Stute, but more alarming for the manager have been recent displays, with games against Warrenpoint, Carrick and last weeks cup tie increasing Connors frustration.“I had the players in for  minutes after the game,” he said. “I think this group of players think thatyoure not coming in shouting and screaming at half time then youre not scolding. Ive hit them with a few home truths and I didnt have to raise my voice. “I told them exactly what theyve done and where were going. I said that when I first came in here I put in some structure and substance, we were working really, really hard and we were getting good results, but the more those results came in the more the players started to smell themselves and they think they are bigger than what they are and Dungannon was a culmination of four weeks of that.”Stute are in a real battle at the foot of the table, with only goal dference keeping them off bottom spot. That place is currently occupied by Warrenpoint, who have actually won twice as many games as Institute. “The players need to show something,” Connor insisted. “Certain players in this football club need to start delivering becausethey dont, then with whatever resources I have, Ill get players in who can, thats very, very simple.“Staying in the ision is more important than the cup, but I would have liked a nice cup run, Im not going to deny that. Im not going to sit and say that Im happy that we are out of the cup because Im not happy. “Lets face it, were not going to win the league so this club has to aspire to win cup competitions or going as far in cup competitions as we can. “We should have applied ourselves better against Dungannon andwe had done that we wouldnt have found ourselves in the situation we did. googletag.cmd.push ChangesConnor has already added striker Alex Pomeroy to his squad, and he is ready to add even more unless he sees an immediate improvement in others. This weekends trip to Glenavon gives those players a chance to show their manager that they not only belong to the club, but they they want to be at the club.“Our strikers arent taking chances quick enough, theyre not reacting, were not getting enough men in the box,” he explained. “Hes the first of hopefully two or three more to come.“The bright points against Dungannon were that we lted it in the second half but we need to work as hard against the teams around us as we do against the top teams and thats clearly evident to me that were not doing that.

I am guided by the principles of the Good Friday Agreement.Baroness Ritchie also recalled the words of the very early th century Irish political thinker, AE Russell, who said: ldquoThe strength of Irish culture lies, I believe, in plurality rather than unormity.The view that national culture is a guarantor of homogeneous identity is no longer tenable. A living culture follows a multiplicity of voices. Authentic culture is not a matter of ourselves alone. Baroness Ritchie said that running alongside the Good Friday Agreement, Russellrsquos words are the embodiment of her political philosophy mdash partnership, working together, respect for political and ethnic dference and unity in ersity.She then focused on the Queenrsquos speech, issuing a reminder that it dealt with a plethora of issues, with Brexit, the environment, National Health Service, climate change and devolved Institutions chief among them.ldquoOf these, Brexit has been one of the greatest political catalysts in Britain and Ireland, said Baroness Ritchie.ldquoIt has consumed all aspects of our lives in Northern Ireland since the referendum of June  where the people voted to remain in the EU. It has impacted on identity, sovereignty and nationality.ldquoLike the majority in Northern Ireland I want to remain in the EU and realise that due to the Governmentrsquos majority in this parliament we will leave the one institution that has provided so much political, social and economic stability on the island of lreland.Baroness Ritchie argued that EU membership had diluted territorial and mind borders and contributed much to reconciliation and developing the economy and infrastructure, urging the British government to look at how this can be achieved in any new working arrangements.ldquoBrexit has undermined the principles of the Good Friday Agreement in relation to reconciliation and building a shared society, the maiden speech continued.ldquoIt has deepened political isions at a time when our political institutions were collapsed. Being a concept that is essentially about the economy it has become a major constitutional issue in Northern Ireland.ldquoMoreover, the EU Withdrawal Bill, which will give effect to Brexit, will have direct consequences for trade between Britain and Ireland and between Northern Ireland and Britain. It will also reduce parliamentary accountability and lessen protections for workersrsquo rights.Baroness Ritchie said people do not want borders either in Ireland or in the Irish Sea. She insisted they want to build reconciliation, intra community political progress, economic and social regeneration and social justice,the very factors she explained that were enhanced by EU membership and which could be damaged when the UK leaves.She continued: ldquoWe need the closest possible links with the EU. We need favourable trading terms with the EU and as a cautionary warning to the government, there canrsquot be zero trade details with the EU and then do our own thing. Borders and bureaucracy need to be lessened and a comprehensive trade agreement with the EU is required.ldquoThere is a need for access to the biggest market in Britain which takes half of our agricultural food sales from Northern Ireland which is equivalent of pound.bn. Coming from an area where there are two fishing ports, the fishing industry is looking for the current unhindered and unfettered access to itrsquos main market in Britain to continue. I support that concept too.On the wider political issue, Baroness Ritchie said devolved institutions need to be up and running in Northern Ireland, expressing hope that the current Stormont talks process will bear fruit for the local population.ldquoThat is what the population is yearning for and what I hope can be achieved to help achieve a healing process and a period of moderation.Turning to the weeks and months ahead, Baroness Ritchie said she hopes that during her time in the House of Lords mdash along with other Lords and Baronesses mdash she wants to work towards building reconciliation, fairness, equality and a shared society in Northern Ireland, explaining that this requires a plan to ldquoend ision and bring down the physical and mental walls of ision.She declared: ldquoI would hope that we can work across this House to achieve that process of moderation and peaceful politics in Northern Ireland a comprehensive trade deal with the EU to assist our economy and a plan to end austerity and poverty and ensure proper financial mitigations are in place to deal with the punitive rigours of welfare reform.ldquoClimate change needs to be tackled, just look at the floods in Britain and the intensity of the heat in Australia which has resulted in the bush fires, and whilst reference is made to tackling it in the Queenrsquos Speech, this issue needs international efforts. I believe continued membership of the EU is required to address and offset manrsquos inhumanity to our precious planet.Baroness Ritchie concluded her speech by highlighting how much she is looking forward to working with colleagues across the House on a range of policy issues over the coming months and years..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th January 2020 Meeting.jpg","title":"Meeting called to address Saintfield sewage issues  ","story":"THE current ban on new development in Saintfield will be discussed at the end of the month when local politicians meet with senior officials from NI Water.The temporary ban was imposed by the organisation in July  after it confirmed that it was not permitting new connections to the townrsquos sewer system.With Saintfieldrsquos sewage treatment plant approaching the end of its capacity, NI Water is in the process of completing a comprehensive drainage area planning model for the town, with the exercise also focusing on the treatment plant which continues to comply with all stringent environmental discharge standards.The detailed study was ordered in the wake of a number of sewage spills at the Old Grand Jury Road in the town during periods of heavy rain.NI Water engineers have installed special valves along sections of the sewer network at this part of the town in a bid to prevent future spills but have confirmed that no additional work is planned until the drainage area study has been completed. This means that the temporary ban is set to remain in place.At Monday nightrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, politicians discussed the detail of a letter from NI Water which detailed that the organisation has identied a requirement in the region of around pound.bn to maintain safe, clean drinking water and address main issues with sewer networks between  and .The news comes after NI Water revealed recently that during this period, an additional poundm investment will be required across the council area.While politicians are concerned about the poor waste water infrastructure in ious parts of the district, the need for investment in Saintfield is viewed as a key priority by many concerned atthe current moratorium on new-build schemes.The lack of investment in the districtrsquos sewerage infrastructure is being blamed on years of underinvestment in the system and the failure to upgrade networks of pipes installed decades ago which are struggling to cope with demand.Rowallane councillors Terry Andrews and Billy Walker say the situation in Saintfield needs to be addressed as a matter or urgency.Cllr Andrews described the detail of the NI Water letter as ldquoparticularly worrying and said the scale of the investment is unlikely to be made available by the government.ldquoThe current housing ban and the need to upgrade Saintfieldrsquos sewerage network is impacting on a signicant number of people and has ramications for the construction industry and buildersrsquo suppliers, he added.Cllr Walker said there were ldquoserious issues in Saintfield with the moratorium on new-build having an impact. He said the sewerage network needs an upgrade and this must be carried out as soon as possible.ldquoIn the past, raw sewage has been back flowing into peoplersquos toilets and spewing out from underneath manhole covers into gardens. Such a situation is intolerable. The current system cannot cope.Cllr Walker said the problem was not with the townrsquos sewage treatment plant but the pipes which supply it, explaining that suggested level of investment required to tackle the problem is in the region of poundm.He added: ldquoPeoplersquos lives in Saintfield are being made a misery. In the first instance, the poundm needed for the town must be found. If we donrsquot get satisfaction from NI Water at the end of the month and the Assembly is not sitting, we need to go directly to a direct rule minister.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke said NI Water was making it clear that it did not have the budget to carry out the required work and blamed austerity measures on cuts to public services.ldquoI hope the Assembly will be up and running and we have a local minister in place and that there will be the required cash injection. The ban on new development does have an impact, particularly on the construction industry. The reduction on the block grant also isnrsquot helping.Independent councillor Jarlath Tinnelly said no big decisions were ever taken locally, but ldquokicked down the road forever and a day because political parties are afraid to make them.He added: ldquoThere is a day of reckoning coming for all public services and I remember reading years ago that the introduction of water charges would sort out the infrastructure problem.ldquoI am certainly not advocating that course, but the point is that these big decisions are pushed further along for someone  to deal with.

Lidl says it has been looking for an alternative town centre site for over decade without success until the Shanslieve Drive site became available, with the planned mountain rescue team centre providing the volunteers with a permanent base.Lidl said a large number of reports have been submitted with the planning application which confirm that the proposal will have no ldquoadverse effects on the environment or amenity of local residents.In addition, the supermarket giant says its development plan will regenerate a brownfield site with ldquomodern, attractive buildings and has signicant economic benefits.Objectors to the new store proposal claim that there are ldquoserious errors in the transport assessment submitted in conjunction with the application, inaccurate land ownership information, unachievable visibility spays and out-of-season traffic surveys.In addition, it will be argued today that in determining the planning application and making a recommendation to councillors, the local authority has done so without a thorough assessment having been undertaken and without being furnished with all the necessary information required to support a robust decision that the ldquoproposal to build on any particular site is acceptable, in principle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th January 2020 Plea.jpg","title":"Plea for opt in organ donation discussions  ","story":"LOCAL politicians are to examine how they can promote the importance of organ donation.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is working with the South Eastern and Southern health trusts on the issue, with many councillors keen to see plans for an opt out system.This means that people would agree to donate their organs with those who do not wish to do this signing a register. However, this does not currently exist.At Monday nightrsquos monthly meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, a letter from the Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health confirmed that there are no plans in place at present to introduce so-called opt out legislation.However, Mr Richard Pengelly said that work is continuing to achieve higher rates of donation and transplantation to ensure that more people are able to receive the gt of an organ.It is estimated that someone dies every six weeks in Northern Ireland waiting for an organ donation.At Monday nightrsquos council meeting, Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owen said she was not surprised at the content of Mr Pengelleyrsquos letter, explaining that there is not much he can do without the required legislation being in place.ldquoIs there anything we can do at council level  she asked.ldquoA lot of the things we would hear on this issue from people is that it is something they have never really thought about or spoken to their family about.

Is there anything that we can do to educate people and push a bit more on this issue as far as people putting themselves on the donor register  she asked.Cllr Roisin Mulgrew said organ donation was an issue she highlighted during her year as the districtrsquos first citizen, explaining that workshops were held involving a number of young people who spoke with representatives from the ldquoBraveheart organisation.She described the event as ldquohugely successful and suggested the organ donation issue could be one for discussions across the districtrsquos DEAs.Cllr Mulgrew added: ldquoOrgan donation is a conversation families hope that they do not have to have. There is an appetite for information on this issue.Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews also backed the suggestion for the organ donation issue to be discussed at DEA level and said it should also be discussed with the Education Authority and local health trusts.Council director Michael Lipsett confirmed that he will be bringing a report on the organ donation issue to a future meeting of the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee.He said the report will focus on how the council is going to approach the issue and will contain information on its work with the Public Health Authority, local health trusts and Education Authority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th January 2020 PSNI.jpg","title":"PSNI helicopter used in search after attempted burglaries at weekend  ","story":"POLICE have been praised for their swt response to an incident in Killyleagh last Sunday after reports of attempted break-ins at homes in the town.A helicopter was deployed as part of a major operation which subsequently resulted in the arrest of a  year-old man near Killinchy.Connor Martin Haughey, of Forest Street, Belfast, appeared in court in Newtownards yesterday charged with a series of offences including burglary, taking and damaging a vehicle, no insurance and possessing as an article with a blade or point in a public place.The case was adjourned, with Haughey remanded in custody until January  when he is due to appear at Downpatrick Court.The ious charges he faces are in connection with burglaries in the Saintfield and Killinchy areas. It is understood he was arrested after police received a number of reports of suspicious activity in the Ringhaddy area, near Killinchy.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker has praised police for their swt response to the incident and has urged people to review their home security and ensure that their front and rear doors are locked at all times.He said a suspicious car in the Grove and Kerry estates sparked alarm last Sunday with residents calling for the police who responded swtly, deploying a number of officers, including aerial support via the PSNI helicopter.ldquoI would appeal to people to ensure that their doors are locked at all times, said Cllr Walker.ldquoI would also encourage people across the district to check in with their elderly neighbours and remind them to never open their doors to strangers.ldquoPolice were swtly on the scene in Killyleagh last Sunday which was very reassuring for residents who very much appreciated the quick response, he continued.The Rowallane politician also encouraged elderly residents in particular not to open their doors to strangers.He said residents concerned about people calling at their homes should always be asked to show their ID accreditation for the organisation they claim to represent.ldquoVirtually all staff from ious organisations now carry ID cards which feature a photograph of the person carrying it.

Work in the area is expected to take around four weeks to complete.Phoenix says while it understands that its planned programme of work will cause some disruption, it will take all relevant measures to mitigate this. In addition, the company says it is pleased that the interest levels from homeowners in Downpatrick wishing to connect to the gas network have been consistently strong.In a letter to local politicians, Phoenix says that it continues to receive regular queries from householders that donrsquot currently have access to the mains network, encouraging the company to make gas available as quickly as possible.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has asked residents and commuters in the town to remain patient as work on the multi-million pound scheme continues to provide householders and businesses access to a new form of energy.ldquoPhoenix has written to residents who are most likely to be affected by the next phase of pipe-laying to ensure that they are fully aware of what is being proposed, he continued.ldquoThe company recognises that its investment does result in disruption but is quick to resolve issues when they arise. The poundm investment across East Down to deliver natural gas is very signicant.Cllr Curran also praised Phoenix for its engagement with residents and the business community as it rolls out its pipe-laying programme across the county town in particular.The Downpatrick councillor has also confirmed that he plans to contact Phoenix officials to discuss the potential for weekend working as part of the drive to keep disruption to a minimum.Cllr Curran said while the arrival of natural gas has been welcomed in many quarters, Phoenix faces the unenviable task of delivering a y construction scheme while keeping residents and business owners reasonably happy.He added: ldquoThe company has done its very best to date and there is no doubt that delivering the natural gas network is challenging. It is also not without its dficulties at times due to ious factors outside the companyrsquos control.ldquoAs work continues this week and over the months ahead, it is important that people remain patient and understanding as contractors get on with the job of providing consumers with increased choice when it comes to selecting their energy provider..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th January 2020 Twelfth.jpg","title":"Twelfth child for Saintfield couple  ","story":"MEET the Donoghues mdash now officially the largest family in Northern Ireland.The Saintfield family entered the record books when baby daughter Molly mdash their th child mdash arrived on New Yearrsquos Day.Molly, who weighed lb oz, was born at the Ulster Hospital shortly after  noon last Wednesday.Dad Johnand mum Tessa , were thrilled to introduce little Molly to her  siblings ndash six brothers and five sisters mdash who waited excitedly to welcome her home.Saying good night in the Donoghue household sounds more like a classroom roll call.

The sides were still locked after extra-time and at the end of five penalties apiece when James McClean drilled Olympic - ahead.It was then left to Walsh to break the deadlock when he kept out Ruairi Fitzpatrickrsquos well-struck spot kick to seal victory before he was mobbed by his delighted team-mates.Rathfriland certainly looked the part early doors as they sprayed the ball to both flanks where Fitzpatrick and Thomas Lockhart took full advantage.Fitzpatrick, in particular, ran at Dalton Tate at every opportunity, but Rathfriland failed to take advantage of his wing trickery.The first real shot in anger came in the th minute when Olympicrsquos Anton McGrattan tested Parr, but the big custodian saved with ease.Five minutes later at the other end Dalton Tate produced a telling tackle on the edge of the six yard box to deny Fitzpatrick a certain goal.However, from the resulting corner, Stephen Hughes bundled the ball over the line when Lockhartrsquos delivery caused mayhem.Rathfriland continued to play the ball methodically through the middle where Andy Kilmartin and Hughes were dominant and with  minutes gone they teamed up with Fitzpatrick to carve out another opening for Harry Campbell, but he shot straight at Walsh.Ruairi Cunningham then created an opening for Fitzpatrick, but he was way off target as was Lockhart in the th minute. A minute later at the opposite end Jason Noade got on the end of a McGrattan corner, but headed over.It looked asRathfriland were going to take their - lead into the break as the game entered the th minute and good value they were for their lead.However, with  minutes gone Stefan Mason exploded into le. The rangy striker took on two Rathfriland defenders after picking up a long ball out of defence.He headed down the left flank and looked destined for the by-line, but stopped in his tracks, checked back, turned his markers and curled a lsquoworldyrsquo into the top corner of the net, giving Parr no chance.Two minutes later it was - Olympic and again Mason was involved. When his attempted cross was blocked, McGrattan headed the ball into Nathan Jonesrsquo path.Nothing looked on when Jones got the ball centrally, just inside the box, but he managed to get the ball from under his feet and beat Parr all ends up with a stunning finish and turn the game on its head.The second half was every bit as competitive, but Olympic seemed to have the measure of Rathfriland and were playing well within themselves until Peter Telford was given the freedom of the box and allowed to head in a Lockhart free kick to make it - in the rd minute.Jason Noade then headed a Jones free kick at lsquokeeper Parr and with  minutes played the busy McGrattan fired over after a nice build-up.Another searing run and cross from Fitzpatrick begged to be put away, but Rathfriland lacked a fox in the box and the chance was gone.Chances continued to be created at either end and with the respective lsquokeepers earning their corn with brilliant saves.However, the game was in the nd minute when Walsh came to Olympicrsquos rescue when he somehow kept out an effort from Marty Havern when the former Glenavon striker seemed certain to win the game for Rathfriland. Two periods of extra-time came and went before the dreaded penalty shoot-out took centre stage.Jones, Stevie and Jason Noade, McGrattan, Tate and James McClean netted for Olympic with Kilmartin, Johnny Roy, Nigel Prentice, Ruari Cunningham and Daryll Evans replying for Rathfriland before Walsh saved the day when he beat away Fitzpatrickrsquos penalty.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Paul Dickson, Jason Noade, Anton McGrattan, Nathan Jones, Stevie Noade, Chris McNamara, Stefan Mason, Conor Reid, Ryan Molloy.

But they feel very strongly about this issue and are prepared to sacrice a dayrsquos pay to make their point. It is important to remember that the ongoing strike is not just about pay parity, it is also about safe staffing levels.Mr McConnell said NHS workers have watched staff leave ious aspects of the service and not be replaced which has left the provision of health and social services at ldquocrisis point with all services affected.He said staff have tended to keep their heads down to deliver services, explaining that they are now saying ldquoenough is enough.The Unison officials said while their members continue to go the extra mile for patients, this is impacting on their physical, emotional and psychological health.Mrs Ritchie added: ldquoStaff family lives are being affected and they have simply had enough, especially as they are being paid thousands of pounds less a year than their counterparts across the water.Mr McConnell added: ldquoThe bottom line is that the goodwill of staff has come to an end.

minister Simon Coveneyand Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith, outside Stormont Parliament buildings in Belfast, jointly unveil their deal. Photo: Niall Carson PA WireIn an apparent attempt to rush the deal through before the weekend and before it comes under detailed scrutiny, Secretary of State Julian Smith last night moved to try to recall the Assembly today to endorse the deal and restore devolution.Mrs Foster – who in  said “I will never accede to an Irish language act” because to do so would be like feeding a crocodile with concessions – accepted that the agreement represented a compromise..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button She said it was “not a perfect deal and there are elements within it which we recognise are the product of long negotiations and represent compromise outcomes”.The agreement will involve a signicant sht in how Assembly business is conducted, with MLAs able to make their entire speeches in Irish or Ulster-Scots and the provision of immediatetranslation – presumably through headsets, as happens in the EU parliament.The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal would see the repeal of the Administration of JusticeAct – the legislation which bans the use of Irish in court.There will be a commissioner to “recognise, support, protect and enhance the development of the Irish language” and another commissioner to “enhance and develop the language, arts and literature associated with the Ulster-Scots Ulster British tradition and to provide official recognition of the status of the Ulster-Scots language”.There will be the creation of a “central Translation Hub” at Stormont in the finance department. There is no mention of Irish language road signage.The DUP executive is scheduled to meet tonight but it is not clear whether it would be able to reverse the party’s decision to accept the dealthat is ratied at Stormont today.The deal will also see a sudden move to implement the Stormont House Agreement on the legacy of the Troubles – something about which increasing numbers of former security force members have been concerned.And it would see the military covenant extended to Northern Ireland.However, the DUP has failed to secure a commitment that Sinn Fein could never again walk out of Stormont and demand political concessions – something which the party once said was key to resolving the situation.AM closed in Peterborough Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"And the party has also not secured any commitment on abortion, something which some senior figures believed was important.The deal promises lots of government investment, particularly for the health service – but onlythe partiesto Stormont.Standing beside Tanaiste Simon Coveney, Mr Smith said there was a major financial package on offer from the government, which would mean health strike action would not need to go aheadthe parties restored the institutions.Last night Sinn Fein sat on the fence with leader Mary Lou McDonald saying: “We are studying the text ... the Sinn Fein ard chomhairle will meet tomorrow to fully assess it.”UUP leader Steve Aiken said cautiously: “We will consider this complex and far-reaching document carefully and consult widely within our party before making any further comments.”Former DUP spad Tim Cairns said that the deal seemed to be “largely the same as February  [which the DUP rejected] ... not much in ”. But republican commentator Chris Donnelly said he thought it “isn’t a deal that will sit well with Sinn Fein” with the language commissioner “a restricted role”.Buried in the document is also an agreement that “RHI will be closed down”.Given that the scheme has already been shut, that appears to mean that those who accepted Mrs Foster’s cast iron guarantee of -year payments will be thrown out of the scheme. It is not clear how they would be compensated.try catch  TrendingNI snow alert - first snow of  has arrived confirm Met Office - subzero temperatures expected tonightCate Conway shares tearful video of hug Stephen Clements gave her at end of their final radio programme togetherBBC Radio Ulster presenter Stephen Clements has died suddenlyWidespread search for -year-old NI schoolboy ends in tragedy -

But as HELEN MCGURK discovers change is in the air.....Mention the word ‘menopause’ at work and it is likely to elicit stunned silence, a clumsy joke or a hot flush of embarrassment and queasiness among male workers who would rather remain oblivious to ‘women’s problems’.And yet, the menopause is a fact of le for half the population - as natural as periodsand pregnancy.For most women, the menopause will last between one and four years, typically between the ages of  and . It is a normal le event for women, not an illness or a medical condition, but that often means that the symptoms are too often under recognised, trivialised and not taken seriously. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button The menopause is commonly referred to as ‘the change’, a bland word that holds none of the distress and despair of endless hot flushes, depression, mood swings, brain fog and eradication of libido that many women experience. Amanda Sweetlove, , from Belfast, knows only too well, how awful it can be, describing her menopausal symptoms as ‘debilitating, absolutely debilitating.’The mum-of-two became perimenopausalfive years ago and admits dealing with her symptoms and her job as frontline ambulance staff became extremely dficult to cope with. ‘‘What brought it to my attention was the sweats. It wasn’t just at nighttime, it was while I was on duty. I was dripping sweat on top of a patient. There was no controlling it. I could have lain down on the stretcher beside the patient because when you take a flush like that, you become extremely fatigued. You are exhausted all the time.’’So-called ‘brain fog’ was also a major problem for Amanda. ‘‘If I was driving on an emergency call I had to be extra vigilant because my concentration levels just weren’t the same.’’And depression, which many menopausal women report, was a distressing issue for Amanda.‘‘I had low self-esteem, paranoia and lack of confidence. I also became very emotional. I would have found myself crying with patients in situations that wouldn’t have had an impact on me before. In the job that I was doing at the time, it just wasn’t a very practical way to live.’’Amanda says her symptoms were also challenging for her crew mate. \"  \"  Man and woman die from injuries sustained in separate road traffic collisions Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"‘‘In the winter I’d be driving with the window open in my short-sleeve shirt and he’d be siting in his winter clothes, with the heating on and the window up - so he suffered as well.’’Amanda is currently on temporary secondment as a complaints manger and continues to advocate on behalf of women. ‘‘About two and a half years ago in the ambulance service we decided to set up a women’s forum, which I chair. We are actively working on how we can set up a policy within the Northern Ireland Ambulance Serviceto cover menopausal symptoms in women.’’Numerous women have approached Amanda explaining how they struggle at work and feel embarrassed talking to their employer about the menopause. ‘‘Women are frightened to say, but they are starting to become stronger because they know there is a group of women who are rallying and trying to set things up for them. ‘‘On the other hand, I have had a couple of very compassionatemanagers come to me and ask my advice on how to deal with the issue.’’Whilst some organisations are progressive, many, Amanda believes, have a long way to go. ‘‘If the majority of your colleagues are male and they are laughing at you, it is really absolutely awful. The behaviour surrounding it is atrocious, but I think it’s just ignorance because it has been taboo for so long.‘‘Men really haven’t had their eyes opened because their mothers didn’t talk about the menopause and now they are watching their wives and thinking ‘did my mum actually go through all that and keep quiet about it’. ‘‘We need to keep talking about the menopause. Every woman in the world will go through it, whether they suffer through it or whether they have an easy ride.’’Menopause symptoms are protected under employment law through the Equalities Act . It’s an employer’s responsibility to support employees at work. Even for those without menopause policies, existing policies such as sickness or flexible working will cover menopause.However, the most many employers offer to their menopausal women in the workplace are fans – but is this enough In many workplaces the menopause remains a taboo subject, forcing women to suffer in silence through ying degrees of physical, mental or emotional disturbances. However, some have woken up to the need to address this silence in the workplace before it turns into a clamour in the doctor’s surgeryLast October the Police Service of Northern Ireland launched its Menopause Workplace Guide. Currently a third of police officers in Northern are female, and overall women make up  per cent of police staff. Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton said: “I recognise the importance of supporting our officers and staff through the menopause ensuring everyone is treated with dignity and respect which in turn helps to maintain a healthy and engaged police service.”Earlier this week Derry City and Strabane District Council agreed to adopt a new menopause policy for employees.It is understood it is the first council in all of Northern Ireland to adopt this kind of strategy, which aims to outline what menopause is, reduce absenteeism due to menopausal symptoms and provide support to manage symptoms at work. The policy was proposed last year by SDLP councillor Shauna Cusack, who said the move was “a further step to getting women the support and understanding they need in the workplace”.“Let’s hope other employers and councils follow suit. Here’s to breaking the silence,” she added.Alliance councillor Rachael Ferguson, who backed the motion said she hoped menopause policy and guidance will now be ‘‘commonplace across other councils as a positive step forward for women in the workplace.’’Elaine Hutton, a personal trainer, who ran The Menopause Cafe at Bangor’s Aurora Leisure Centre for  months said:‘‘I think employers need to be more aware of it, definitely. “Women are working longer now, we don’t retire at  or  anymore.’’She also suggested employers need to be cognisant of ‘the simple things’.‘‘If you are in an environment where you need to wear a heavy unorm in the winter, some ladies can’t wear that, so employers should make an allowance for this.’’try catch  TrendingNI snow alert -

Those standards would have to be approved by both the DUP and Sinn Fein in any new Executive.A commissioner on the Ulster Scots Ulster British tradition will enhance and develop the language, arts and literature associated with it and provide official recognition for its status.The y impasse on the language issue revolved around whether provisions for the Irish language would be enacted as a stand-alone Act or as part of a broader piece of legislation.The governments have proposed to do it by amending the  Northern Ireland Act with three separate Bills - one specically dedicated to provisions for the Irish language.The petition of concern, introduced following the  peace accord to protect minority rights but later used to block change such as same-sex marriage, will be \"reduced and ed to its intended purpose\".The text said: \"The parties will publicly commit to taking or supporting petitions of concern only in the most exceptional circumstances and as a last resort, having used every other available mechanism.\"The threshold for its triggering will remain at  Assembly members but will need the support of two or more parties.Parties would agree that a three-year absence of devolved government cannot happen again and create a package of measures to deliver more sustainable and resilient institutions during periods of political dficulty.Arlene Foster backs a deal that includes major new Irish language legislation Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"That includes a party leaders forum, a sub-committee of the ministerial Executive on Brexit and measures strengthening the ability of opposition parties to hold ministers to account.If political tensions in future threaten breakdown of the institutions, the agreement provides for a longer -week period before an Assembly election must be called. Ministers will remain in office in a caretaker capacity.The collapse of the Assembly was caused by Sinn Fein concerns over how the DUP operated the botched Renewable Heat Incentive scheme.Under the deal, ministers responsibility for their special advisers would be strengthened, details of their meetings with external organisations would be published as well as information about gts and hospitality enjoyed by special advisers.Requirements for record-keeping and protections for whistleblowers would be strengthened.The accountability of ministers to the Assembly and the need for its scrutiny committees to be provided with information would be made clear.Priorities for new ministers, as widely envisaged, will include immediately settling the nurses pay dispute which has caused strike action and paralysed some services, reconfiguring hospitals, and delivering extra nursing and midwery undergraduate places.It will also address problems such as mental health, alcohol and drugs abuse, and tackle cancer.A stalled plan for graduate entry medical school at Magee College in Londonderry will go ahead.The Executive would also commit to fund three cycles of IVF.The new ministerial Executive is also pledged to address resourcing pressures in schools and resolve the teachers industrial dispute.The deal would see the extension of Stormont-funded mitigation payments for those affected by welfare reforms.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief.

PRESS ASSOCIATION Photo. Picture date: Saturday November , . See PA story IRISH SinnFein. Photo credit should read: Brian Lawless PA WireThe order’s comments came after an interview by Sinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald where she was asked about the matter.“The Orange Institution is not interested in engaging in ‘conversations’ or responding to hypothetical statements which merely assist Sinn Fein and nationalists as they continue to ‘talk up’ the inevitability of a united Ireland,” an Orange spokesman said.“Orangemen in many communities across Ireland have experienced Republicanism’s intolerance and hatred first-hand. Ironically, despite these comments, recent developments in the Republic of Ireland have shown us the reality that Sinn Fein and others are not really interested in equality – or the historical commemoration of anything deemed to be British.”Ms McDonald had told the Irish Independent she was willing to put celebrating the Twelfth of July across the island of Ireland on the table in talks about a future Border poll.She said “everything should be on the table” when asked specically about annual celebration.“I’ll tell you how we do it, we do it by having them [unionists] front and centre in the conversation and asking them, because I would be absolutely astonishedfor people of a unionist persuasion the issue around the Twelfth of July was not raised,” she said.“We, more than any other political party in the Oireachtas, are used to working with, living with, dealing with our unionist neighbours and the Twelfth of July is very widely celebrated.”Ms McDonald’s comments were made before the current controversy over the now-postponed Irish state commemoration of the Royal Irish Constabulary and Dublin politan Police. Sinn Féin led calls for the event to be cancelled altogether amid concerns it amounts to celebrating the Black and Tans.While acknowledging Sinn Féin supporters may not favour marking the Twelfth, Ms McDonald believes people will “surprise themselves” with what they find acceptable in a united Ireland.“Generally speaking, people are decent and reasonable and they want a good le for themselves and for their families and they are happy to accommodate and respect their neighbours so long as that accommodation and respect comes back to them,” she said. “They’re kind of the go-to issues when people talk about Irish unity, and that’s fine. Bring all of that to the table. Let’s talk about it.”While critics claim she is not in control and Sinn Féin is still run out of west Belfast, the paper said, she insisted Gerry Adams “doesn’t pull my strings, nobody’s pulling my strings”.Ms McDonald also declined to express regret for proclaiming “up the rebels” and “tiocfaidh ár lá” when she took over as leader. “No,” she said when asked about using militant Republican language. “Up the rebels.”LBC journalist and NI man Matthew Thompson tweeted: “That’s nice and all. But you’d think allowing unionists one day of the year to celebrate their heritage would be the least they might expect from a united Ireland.”In  former Sinn Fein TD Peadar Toibin said he was not sure the time was right for southern Orangemen to parade in their capital, saying there is “a broken relationship” with the order which needs work to be fixed.TUV Councillor Matthew Armstrong said the Orange community would treat the offer “with the contempt its deserves”.\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"portadown businessman sam hewitt enjoyed colourful life well lived ","story":"Car crashes into NI homeThousands of UK retirees are set to lose £ a week from their state pension - this is who’s affectedNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPortadown businessman Sam Hewitt enjoyed a colourful le well-livedWhen Sam Hewitt ran the Superglaze firm in Bridge Street, Portadown, everyone knew him as ‘Super Sam’.By The NewsroomWednesday, th January , : pmUpdated Wednesday, th January , : pm\"Sam Hewitt as drawn by Billy Austin.And that is how he will be remembered as hundreds of his friends mourn his passing.Sam died in Craigavon Hospital on Sunday afternoon after a brief illness and as family and friends reflect on a colourful le well-lived they will all remember Sam with much affection.Sam was  and he and his we, Margaret, lived at Annahugh House, Kilmore, one of the oldest houses in County Armagh. Sam, the third child of Norman and Jean Hewitt,was raised on a farm at Moneypennys and it was there thathis love for the outdoor le was nurtured. He would often recall his early days there, telling stories of sailing to Portadown along the canal on his canoe and spending hours in the fields observing the wildle along the river banks. It was there too that his spirit of adventure developed which ultimately led to a career in the Royal Air Force and a posting to Germany where he served for three years, developing a love for that country. That career was relived when the family gave him a trip in a Spitfire for his th birthday and Sam was delighted when the trip was featured on Anne Marie McAleese’s Radio Ulster programme Your Place and Mine. Having obtained a pilot’s licence earlier in le he enjoyed lots of flying time from Aldergrove and there were frequent trips to the Isle of Man with his we, Margaret, and daughter Claire.As a child and teenager Sam developed a close relationship with local horse dealers, the Hamill family, and this gave him the opportunity to ride horses, which became a le-long passion, passed on to daughter Claire and grandchildren Olivia and Rocco.Family was the most important aspect of Sam’s le and he and Margaret had three children, Claire, born in , Reuben in i and Samuel in . He was totally devoted to them, opening up opportunities for each ofthem to pursue a range of activities ranging from horse-riding to fishing and motor bikes and all sorts of watersports. And although Samuel was based in England there was nothing he enjoyed more than to arrive at Annahugh House and see his children play with the model trains Sam had so lovingly built.Because of his love for horses Sam was involved in the founding of the Armagh Horse and Pony Club and instigated pony camps for children in the Mourne Mountains. Until recently he wasa constant supporter of grandchildren Robin, Alex and Jude at rugby and cricket. Sam’s career was as colourful as his le. On leaving the Air Force he worked at Quintin Castle in Portaferry as the land steward where he continued his horse riding and began to sail and fish in Strangford Lough. Then he was a car salesman with Allens Automart, where he formed a lasting friendship with the owner, George Allen, and John Ford he dabbled for a while as a carpet salesman with Cyril Lord’s Carpets, then there was a spell as a paint salesman in Bridge Street before he went into business on his own with the Superglaze business in Meadow Lane. And all the while Sam’s infectious enthusiasm for whatever he did warmed him to everyone with whom he came in contact, forming a close relationship with the late Victor Locke who had emigrated to Hong Kong. Debonair Sam was an immaculate dresser and had a wardrobe to fit every occasion, whether it was a wedding, a funeral, a formal invitation or a sporting occasion and he stood out from a crowd with his sleek, silver hair.He was also a car enthusiast, his interest having been fostered at Allen’s Automart and he cut a dash as he enjoyed top-range sports cars over the years. Travel was another of his passions and he had been to Vietnam, Africa, America, where he toured the Grand Canyon, Thailand, Hong Kong andChina  But Sam will be best remembered for his friendship and there have been many tributes to him. He enjoyed his weeklylunch date with a group of friends, a get-together that been going on for some  years and one of that gathering, Ron Mullen, said, “Sam was a one-off. He was a wonderful friend and he always had the ability to brighten any gathering, no matter the circumstances. He will be sadly missed.”Retired school headmaster Jim Smart’s friendship with Sam goes back over  years and Jim said, “Sam was a frequent visitor to our house in Mandeville Street where my father ran a potato business. My mother always had the teapot on and we enjoyed seeing Sam arrive and giving us a bit of the fun that was part of his character.”Sam brought fun no matter where he went but he had his serious side too and his RAF training in discipline and decorum could come into play when the occasion demanded. He was comfortable in any gathering and was equally at home discussing world affairs or more mundane matters at home.People like George Allen, Ralph Loney and Mervyn Gilpin, all known for their Christian views, were among Sam’s best friends, even though he didn’t share all their views, but there was mutual respect on all sides and their friendship grew over the years.“Sam was a deep thinker and liked to argue his case,” said Mervyn. “I don’t think we ever saw eye to eye but we had a friendship that could never be broken and we all held him in the highest regard.” Sam is survived by his we, Margaret, daughter Claire, sons Reuben and Samuel, son-in-law Mark, daughters-in-law Zara and Lucy grandchildren Robin, Olivia, Alex, Rocco, Jude, Charlie and William, sister, Jeanette and brother Trevor.The funeral is to Roselawn Crematorium on Friday at pm and donations in lieu of flowers are to Help the Heroes, c oJoseph Poots funeral directors, , Bridge Street, Portadown. BT RAThe family wishes to place on record their sincere thanks to the doctors and nurses at Craigavon Hospital for all their care and attention to Sam during his short stay there.\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"shops get drop rates pubs see large spike ","story":"Peters ˜purrfect rescue of cat stuck in tree for daysPortadown businessman Sam Hewitt enjoyed a colourful le well-livedNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsShops get drop in rates but pubs see a large spikeSome retailers and banks in Portadown are to benefit from a drop in rates while a number of pubs face a signicant increase in their bills.By The NewsroomFriday, th January , : pm\"Portadown Town Centre.A new business rates valuation has been announced by Land and Property Services this week - the first shake up since .Chamber of Commerce President Adrian Farrell said the reduction in rates for some retailers was ‘a step in the right direction’.However he voiced concerns at the sharp rise in rates for some businesses in the hospitality sector.At least one licenced premises close to the town centre has seen their rateable value shoot up by almost % and will be expected to pay almost £k extra per annum.Another town centre bar will see a leap of % on their rates, and will be expected to pay more than £k extra each year. Even local churches will see a hike in rates with some payments rising by almost %.Meanwhile at least one bank will have their rates reduced by more than % and will pay £k per year less.Many shops in Market Street have had their rates slashed substantially, some by as much as %. A kiosk in High Street Mall will have its annual rates reduced by half.There doesn’t appear to be any change to the rates at the Meadows Shopping Centre while Rushmere Shopping Centre will see a rise of almost %.At least one outlet in Magowan Buildings will have a rates rise of almost % though others will see no change. ASDA will benefit from a drop in rates from £,, to £, - a drop of £k. Tesco Extra in Craigavon will see a % drop in its bill from £,, to £,, - a decrease of £kBucking the trend in the hospitality sector is the Seagoe Hotel which sees no change to its rateable value.The Omniplex Cinema in Craigavon will see the rates rise by almost % from £k to £k.Portadown Fire Station will also see a rates hike of almost % but Cascades Leisure Centre next door, which is due to close, will see a % drop in rates.Portadown Health Centre will see a drop of almost % in rates in April down from £, to £, - a drop of £,.Mr Farrell said: “I think this is a step in the right direction but I have concerns about the rise in rates in the hospitality sector.”He added that there needed to be a ‘radical reform’ of the ‘flawed rates system’ and called for online retailers to contribute to the rates system.In total draft valuations for all , businesses in the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council area have been published online.Known as Reval – this process will result in a new non-domestic Valuation List being used to calculate business rate bills from April . The Department of Finance said: “This process is about restoring fairness in the rating system by redistributing basically the same rating burden using more up-to-date values. A revaluation is not about collecting more money from businesses, but it is about ensuring that everyone pays their fair share.” Business rates are charged on most non-domestic premises including shops, offices, warehouses, factories, hotels and pubs as well as utilities such as gas, water, electricity and wind farms.The results show a modest growth in the total value in the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council area of .% compared to the current Valuation List which is based on  values. Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary at Department of Finance said: “The revaluation means that from April, ratepayers will contribute to the funding of essential public services such as health, education and infrastructure as well as a wide range of council services relative to their  rental value, instead of  values as at present.“The growth in the total value of the Valuation List does not translate into a corresponding overall increase in rate bills. I will be seeking to ensure that the regional business rate poundage that we set is lowered to reflect the overall growth in the Valuation List. I will also be encouraging councils to do the same in respect of district rate poundages reflecting the fact that revaluation is not about raising more revenue overall from rates.”If rate poundages are adjusted downwards by both central government and district councilsthis would mean up to % of business ratepayers would either see a reduction or little or no change in their rate bill.Encouraging business ratepayers to view the draft schedule of values, Sue added: “I’m delighted that for the first time we are making the draft valuation list available on our Spatial NI . This will provide ratepayers with greater detail including a breakdown of how their value has been calculated as well as seeing the same information for similar properties in their local area and indeed for all similar properties across Northern Ireland. This approach makes the rating system much more transparent – which is absolutely the right thing to do.“I would encourage business ratepayers to go online and view the new draft values for their properties ahead of rate bills issuing in April.”Preliminary outcomes of the revaluation include:a modest growth in the total value in Northern Ireland of .% many high street shops and some shopping centres will see a decrease in rateable value, with some as much as %many of the edge of town retail parks will remain constant some of the largest food stores show a decrease in rateable value of between % and %the office sector shows an overall increase in rateable value of % andthe pub trade will see considerable iation in values with notable decreases in some pubs and signicant increases in some pubs in busy urban areas.As well as being able to view their new valuation online at a time that suits them, business owners can come along and talk to the Reval team at events across Northern Ireland to find out more about what their new valuation means for them.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business urging cross party political backing to restore assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community is urging cross-party political backing for a deal which could see the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
