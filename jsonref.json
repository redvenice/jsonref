What that will mean is it could be City v Liverpool on consecutive weekends - first in Premier League on 10 April and then the following weekend.

Photograph: GettyStartling heatwaves at both of Earth’s poles are causing alarm among climate scientists, who have warned the “unprecedented” events could signal faster and abrupt climate breakdown.Temperatures in Antarctica reached record levels at the weekend, an astonishing 40 degrees above normal in places.At the same time, weather stations near the north pole also showed signs of melting, with some temperatures 30 degress above normal, hitting levels normally attained far later in the year.At this time of year, the Antarctic should be rapidly cooling after its summer, and the Arctic only slowly emerging from its winter, as days lengthen. For both poles to show such heating at once is unprecedented.The rapid rise in temperatures at the poles is a warning of disruption in Earth’s climate systems. Last year, in the first chapter of a comprehensive review of climate science, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned of unprecedented warming signals already occurring, resulting in some changes – such as polar melt – that could rapidly become irreversible.The danger is twofold: heatwaves at the poles are a strong signal of the damage humanity is wreaking on the climate and the melting could also trigger further cascading changes that will accelerate climate breakdown.As polar sea ice melts, particularly in the Arctic, it reveals dark sea that absorbs more heat than reflective ice, warming the planet further. Much of the Antarctic ice covers land, and its melting raises sea levels.Scientists warned that the events unfolding were “historic”, “unprecedented” and “dramatic”.Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Centre at Pennsylvania State University, said the extreme weather being recorded was exceeding predictions to a worrying extent.“The warming of the Arctic and Antarctic is cause for concern, and the increase in extreme weather events – of which these are an example – is a cause for concern as well,” he said. “The models have done a good job projecting the overall warming, but we’ve argued that extreme events are exceeding model projections. These events drive home the urgency of action.”The latest unprecedented weather patterns follow a series of alarming heatwaves in 2021, most notably in the US Pacific northwest, where previous records were shattered by several degrees as temperatures climbed close to 50 degrees.Mark Maslin, professor of earth system science at University College London, said: “I and colleagues were shocked by the number and severity of the extreme weather events in 2021 – which were unexpected at a warming of 1.2C. Now we have record temperatures in the Arctic which, for me, show we have entered a new extreme phase of climate change much earlier than we had expected.”All-time record brokenThe Associated Press reported that one weather station in Antarctica beat its all-time record by 15 degrees, while another coastal station used to deep freezes at this time of year was 7 degrees above freezing. In the Arctic, meanwhile, some parts were 50 degrees warmer than average.“I have never seen anything like this in the Antarctic,” the University of Colorado ice scientist Ted Scambos, who returned recently from an expedition to the continent, told the news agency. – "},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"british and irish relationship should be based on equal respect says starmer","story":"Labour leader Keir Starmer speaks to the Labour Party Irish Society Annual St Patrick’s Day reception at the London Irish Centre. Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireBritish Labour party leader Keir Starmer has called for a relationship between Britain and Ireland based on equal respect that acknowledges both governments’ roles as co-guarantors of the Belfast Agreement rather than simply consultees.He said the relationship had been dominated by Brexit in recent years but it had a rich and long history that was bigger than the current dispute over the Northern Ireland protocol.“And I felt they were some of the most uplifting years in my working life because there was so much progress going on, so much change going on. You could feel it, you could see it, you could sense it when you were there. And that has given me a really strong sense of the importance of that partnership.“The relationship requires respect, equal respect and understanding of what it means to be a country and to have that status, that friendship, that relationship and that respect.”Mr Starmer was speaking at the Labour Party Irish Society’s St Patrick’s Day reception at the London Irish Centre in Camden, which is in his constituency of of Holborn and St Pancras. Other speakers included Trade Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Frances O’Grady, Labour MP Conor McGinn, who chairs Westminster All-Party Parliamentary Group on the Irish in Britain and Adrian O’Neill, Ireland’s ambassador to Britain.Mr O’Neill said that this year’s St Patrick’s Day events in London had been conceived as a celebratory return to personal contact after two years of the coronavirus pandemic but they had been overshadowed by the war in Ukraine.“To some extent, we have to kind of dial it down a little bit or at least recognise that while we are enjoying this opportunity to meet in person and celebrate all the things that we really cherish, our democracy, our human rights, our independence, sovereignty, all of those core values that they are absolutely now being trampled on in Ukraine,” he said.“In Ireland, we’re working very, very closely with the UK, with the US with like-minded partners in the Security Council of the UN, within the EU, the Human Rights Council in Geneva, the International Criminal Court, using all the mechanisms at our disposal to isolate and increase pressure on Putin and his regime.”"},{"url":null,"title":"ireland in midst of second omicron wave but no return of restrictions varadkar","story":"Tánaiste said Covid-19  case  numbers were ‘a cause for concern’ but not a  ‘cause for panic’. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Ireland is in the midst of another Covid-19 wave but restrictions will not be reimposed, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has said. The Fine Gael leader also said that an inquiry into the handling of the pandemic could be set up within the next few months and would likely hear from senior figures, such as chief medical officer Tony Holohan. His comments came after Taoiseach Micheál Martin said over the weekend that he didn’t want a situation where senior personnel were looking over their shoulders in future while making key decisions during a crisis. The number of people in hospital with Covid-19 increased by 48 on Sunday, bringing the total number of patients being treated for the virus to 1,175, the highest number of hospitalisations since February of last year.“I think it is another wave,” Mr Varadkar said. “What’s happening across Europe now is a second wave of Omicron if you like.But I don’t think it is going to require the reimposition of restrictions. About half of those in hospital with Covid would be in hospital anyway, it is an incidental finding in their cases. Also because of the vaccines even though case numbers are high, the number of people getting sick, the number of people being hospitalised, requiring ICU treatment, thankfully the number of people dying, is very low. This is another wave but we don’t anticipate it will necessitate the reimposition of restrictions.”Mr Varadkar said while the current case numbers were “a cause for concern” they were “not a cause for panic.” “We are monitoring the situation very tightly.”He said the Government is considering whether a fourth vaccine dose needs to be started for those who are elderly or medically vulnerable. He said the expectation is that a fourth dose would be recommended to commence “around the middle of the year” rather than closer to the end of the year.The Tánaiste also said that discussions have taken place on the planned inquiry into Ireland’s handling of the pandemic, but a decision has not yet been reached on the format. “We haven’t made a decision on the format of the inquiry yet. We do believe it is important that we have an inquiry into how the pandemic was handled in Ireland. “If you look at the numbers, Ireland has one of the lowest excess mortality rates in Europe and indeed the world and that says to us that we as a society did a lot of things right, but we did not do everything right and I think it’s important that we work out and establish what we did right and what we could have done better.” He said while the Government did not want to see senior figures “hauled over the coals”, it was envisaged that people who were involved in the response, including those in Government and in senior positions in the HSE and the Department of Health, would give evidence. Mr Varadkar said the inquiry was not about “getting” people but was to try to to establish which decisions were correct and what could have been done better so we “ could be better prepared for another pandemic if it happens in our lifetime.” “We would certainly envisage having the inquiry up and running this year, if not in the next couple of months. “One thing we do need to bear in mind is that many of the people who would be asking to take part in the inquiry to give evidence are also the people still battling the pandemic. “We don’t want them spending several days a week preparing statements and questions when we need them doing their frontline jobs.” Mr Varadkar was speaking at a national ceremony of remembrance and reflection which took place in Dublin in memory of all those who died during the pandemic. The ceremony, which was held in the Garden of Remembrance in Dublin City Centre, also paid tribute to those involved in safeguarding Ireland from Covid-19. Wreaths were laid by front-line healthcare workers, transport workers, volunteers, public health doctors and contact tracers amongst others.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"maureen dowd while putin shrinks zelenskiy soars","story":" Babushka dolls depicting Russian president Vladimir Putin  on sale in Athens, Greece. Photograph: Orestis PanagiotouEPAMyron Cohen, a garment district silk salesman turned popular comedian in the Ed Sullivan era, loved to tell this chestnut: Picture a skinny little guy, a shrimp, a nothing. He walks into a lumber camp looking for a job. The foreman is sceptical, so the shrimp steps up and fells a towering oak in 90 seconds. “Where’d you learn that?” says the foreman. “In the Sahara Forest,” replies the guy. “You mean the Sahara Desert,” the foreman corrects. “Sure, now,” the guy says. Hubris guided Vladimir Putin’s malevolent and maladroit invasion of Ukraine. As the Associated Press pointed out, US military officials assumed Russia would deploy electronic and cyber warfare to blind and paralyse Ukrainian air defences and communications. But the Russians did not take control of Ukrainian air space when they launched their attack.Putin was cocksure, dismissing Volodymyr Zelenskiy as a shrimp, a nothing. But Zelenskiy has shown the world what true stature is. Putin has always had a Napoleon complex, puffing out his bare chest on horseback fishing shirtless in Siberia winning staged judo and hockey displays. But Zelenskiy understands that stature is not about phoney macho photo shoots. Stature is a physical quality, but, more important, it is a human and moral quality. Keats was barely over 5 feet, but look at his spiritual size. Our military leaders have lately been quoting Napoleon, who said, “The moral is to the physical as three to one.” We have seen this with the Ukrainians, who are not only courageously resisting the Russians but also launching counteroffensives.Parking tanksAs the New York Times reported, the number of Russian casualties has hurt morale our intelligence reports have described Russian soldiers simply parking their tanks and wandering into the woods. Putin doesn’t realise what the world knows: You don’t show your muscularity by razing cities, by bombing a maternity hospital, a boarding school for the visually impaired, a bread line, a community centre and a shelter painted with a message in Russian pleading that children are inside. What kind of monster treats the word “CHILDREN” as an invitation to kill? This just proves that the Russian dictator is, as President Joe Biden and his secretary of state contended, a war criminal.You don’t show your power by starting a war that reveals how weak and mediocre your army is and strengthens European bonds when your goal is to ide and weaken Europe. No matter what happens in Ukraine, Putin will be a loser with no moral stature and Zelenskiy will have towering moral stature.Donald Trump, who called Putin’s barbaric strategy “genius” and “savvy” after spending four years legitimising that malefactor, also comes out a loser. Trump is stuck on the fringe of his party, sharing the wrong side of a moral ide with Tucker Carlson, JD Vance, Madison Cawthorn and Marjorie Taylor Greene. Trump and Putin, what a pair, shrinking in stature in the eyes of the world. Tiny, tiny Trump and cruel fool Putin. The corrupt, paranoid germaphobes love surrounding themselves with sycophants, conjuring delusional worlds and giving unhinged rants.Putin let loose on those who question his misbegotten war: “Any people, and even more so the Russian people, will be able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors and simply spit them out like a midge that accidentally flew into their mouths. Spit out on the pavement.”He even went after his pals, the oligarchs, “who can’t do without foie gras, oysters or the so-called gender freedoms” in Miami or the French Riviera. Sowing seedsTrump and Putin sowed the seeds of their own destruction. They wanted all of the attention and credit. Now they deserve all of the blame. Grandiosity and fantasy worlds will trip up these poisonous authoritarians. Neither man has a democratic bone in his body. And both think they know better than anyone else. “When you have an autocrat who’s been in power for too long, they don’t listen to people anymore, and this war was afflicted by very bad decision making,” Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a historian who teaches at New York University, said on MSNBC. This has left Putin vulnerable and humiliated before Russian elites and the world, she said. But it has also, parlously, left him without an off-ramp “because autocrats don’t negotiate”.Stephen Kotkin, a professor of history and international affairs at Princeton, told the New Yorker’s David Remnick that the Russians have a fractured identity. Culturally and scientifically, they are a world-class power. But economically and politically, they have a hard time matching the West, so “they resort to coercion”.“The worst part of this dynamic in Russian history is the conflation of the Russian state with some personal ruler,” Kotkin said. “Instead of getting the strong state that they want to manage the gulf with the West, they instead get a personalist regime. They get a dictatorship, which usually becomes a despotism.”Zelenskiy spoke to a joint meeting of Congress on Wednesday, comparing the terror in Ukrainian skies to the death hailed down from the skies on Pearl Harbor in 1941 and on New York and Washington on 911. He also showed a devastating video that brought tears to lawmakers’ eyes.Underlining his role as David to Putin’s Goliath, Zelenskiy said, “Strong doesn’t mean big.” Strong means supporting human rights and freedom and demanding the right to die when “your time comes and not when it’s wanted by someone else, by your neighbour”. – This article originally appeared in The New York TimesFull coverage of the Russian invasion of UkraineStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"Phenomenal success of Nigerian artists is bringing both opportunities and criticismAuthors are tackling topics from transgender rights to Islamic extremism, and picking up plenty of awardsTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"russell brand became mad hatter conspiracy theories","story":"The mockney messiah with a man bun has found a new calling. Russell Brand, formerly known for stand-up comedy, hosting reality shows and making incendiary phone calls about granddaughters of Fawlty Towers actors, can now be found posting ‘truth-seeking’ daily videos and weekly podcasts to some 10m people across YouTube and Instagram. Recent episodes include ‘You’ve Been LIED To About Why Ukraine War Began’ ‘Can We REALLY Trust Vaccine Fact-Checkers??!’, and ‘Trump was RIGHT About Clinton \u0026amp Russia Collusion!!’. It’s all a far cry from the man three times named ‘S------ of the Year’ by The Sun.The charismatic Brand, who became ubiquitous in the mid-Noughties, has harnessed his popularity into virtual populism, his ‘anti-partisan’ videos winning millions of fans across both Left and Right. The 15-minute posts usually begin with thanks to “awakened beings” for joining the “journey to truth” he has defended both Putin and Trump, decries billionaires, and wants to root out racism. Brand detests authority – mass media and the Government being the primary evils – and wants revolution. So much so that he wrote a book of that name in 2014 (from the country pile of his then-girlfriend, heiress Jemima Khan).Seemingly modelling himself on Joe Rogan – the controversial US podcasting phenom who followed the stand-up to reality presenter to populist pundit pipeline to become one of the most powerful figures in American media – Brand promises to “say the unsayable”, earning himself a loyal, and large, following. The 46-year-old says he is not there to flout conspiracy theories, but to ask questions and “create new narratives” – a similar defence employed by Rogan, who in January found himself at the centre of a scandal after being accused of peddling Covid mistruths.One episode of the Joe Rogan Experience, which has 11m listeners, resulted in a letter from more than 270 doctors slamming the programme as a “menace to public health”. Neil Young and Joni Mitchell told Spotify, the platform on which his podcast is streamed, that it had to ditch Rogan or their back catalogues Rogan won out. The brouhaha only solidified the status that the podcasting behemoths now wield – which is good news for brand Brand.There are major differences in their approaches, however. While both are martial arts fans keen to host isive figures – Rogan’s include ex-NRA leader and Sandy Hook-denier Alex Jones, academic Jordan Peterson and Gavin McInnes, founder of the far-Right Proud Boys group – the US presenter’s hours-long conversations belie a genuine desire to find what makes his interviewees tick. Brand is a different beast, his videos a stream of verbal ablutions that begin with a plea for viewers to buy tickets to his live tour (his T-shirts bearing anti-Government slogans sell for £25.99). ‘Stay Free’ is splashed across merch from tea towels to phone cases and mugs, the latter of which also features his face. His site promises that “grants using money generated by this endeavour” will be made, though no further details are provided.Brand – an avowed anti-capitalist with a net worth over £10m, according to Spear’s – was criticised for his 2017 book Recovery: Freedom from Our Addictions, which some said was a for-profit version of the 12-step programme used for alcohol and drug addicts (which is available for free). “The point is that you don’t profit from the 12 steps,” says an insider who knew Brand as his star was rising that is “really frowned upon”. But he’s “very funny, he’s very charming,” she admits. “When I was with him, I felt like I was the only person in the world.”It is this “incredible ability to make people feel as though he’s talking just to them” that has supercharged his online success. “This is what it feels like to be part of a conversation,” he tells viewers in a video posted this week: “to be heard, to be seen.”Henry Jeffreys saw that appeal up close in 2007, when working as a publicist for My Booky Wook – Brand’s sex and drink-fuelled memoir. “People loved him,” he recalls of Brand’s effusive chats with old ladies and security guards. Back then, Brand was a household name, thanks to hosting E4’s spin-off show Big Brother’s Big Mouth, appearing in Hollywood films from Forgetting Sarah Marshall to Get Him to the Greek, and tabloid-documented liaisons with Kate Moss, Sadie Frost, Geri Halliwell (and many, many more).By the middle of the last decade, Brand had interviewed Holocaust-denier David Icke on multiple occasions and, in 2015, invited the would-be Labour leader Ed Miliband on his YouTube show, The Trews (a portmanteau of True News), so great was his appeal among young voters deemed to be by politicians. Brand, at the time, was not registered to vote.“There are particular iniduals within the anti-vaccine world who are amenable to pro-Russian propaganda,” according to Imran Ahmed, executive director of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, who notes that there is also crossover among supporters of QAnon (the group who believed Trump was fighting a cabal of Satan-worshipping paedophiles across the government, media and corporate worlds). Rather than these groups fading with Covid, experts warn that the same mindset – dismissing the prevailing logic so as to deny the status quo, no matter the evidence – will merely be transferred to other crises.This has also led to hybrid conspiracies: such as that the US has long had a secret, illegitimate bioweapons lab in Ukraine, which now works with bat-borne coronavirus samples, which Russia is simply attempting to destroy.Brand never clearly nails down his own views, “discussing” conspiracies, so as to skirt accusations of being a conspiracist. He is helped somewhat by those who still associate him with his cheeky Noughties screen persona and former marriage to pop star Katy Perry, as well as his quest for wellness – the subject of another of his YouTube channels – and faithful practise of yoga and veganism, all of which obfuscate possible sightings of tin foil hats.He is currently touring the UK with ‘The 33’, which consists of three segments – his back story, the hypocrisy of the Government during the pandemic, and a meditation with the crowd. An Instagram post from Monday’s show in Sheffield features him clasping the hands of an audience member, as others watch on in wonder at what Brand called “a magical meeting of souls”.Rogan’s brand remains more steak and dumbbells than spinach and savasanas. But the pair share a great deal: both are “funny and fearless”, says listener Jon Miltimore, 42, who appreciates their ability to “talk intelligently about complex ideas and provocative ideas” these are men who aren’t “afraid to poke at those sacred cows, and to question authority”.They share mutual affection, too. “You’ve emerged authentically,” Rogan told his British counterpart during a marathon three-and-a-half-hour episode of his podcast in 2019. “This is who you really are… you found yourself.”Brand – who posted videos of support over Rogan’s Spotify debacle earlier this year – also cited him in his 2019 book, Mentors, in a nod to his “influence and impact.” With a net worth of around £92m, Rogan is still around 10 times bigger than Brand – but with his YouTube subscribers climbing by a million in a month, that gap may yet be closing.My Booky Wook was a bestseller My Conspiracy Wiracy is looking like a dead cert.More from News‘On the right side of history’: China defends its stance on Ukraine warRussia-Ukraine latest news: Russian forces accused of killing 56 elderly people after shelling Luhansk care homeBoyfriend arrested on suspicion of murder after student found deadLatest pictures from Ukraine: Russia may \u0026#39double down\u0026#39 attacks to make headway on invasion Queen to make ‘early and dignified’ attendance at Prince Philip’s memorial serviceCovid Freedom Day?

We have granted 8,600 visas through that scheme so far – each offering an opportunity for security in the UK. And we have made changes to the visa process, so Ukrainians with a valid passport no longer have to attend in-person appointments to submit fingerprints or facial verification before coming to the UK, ensuring people can come here as quickly as possible.We want Ukrainian refugees to thrive here, just like the people we have welcomed from Syria, Hong Kong, and Afghanistan. They will have access to public services, from the NHS and specialist mental health services to education and benefits. This is backed up by extra government funding for local authorities. And despite the misinformation being peddled by some, the Government has not set a cap on the number of Ukrainians who can be helped through our schemes.Our human instinct to provide immediate help for as many people as possible has nonetheless had to be balanced with my main responsibility – the security of our nation. The processes that we have put in place follow the advice of our intelligence and security services. They mean we can help Ukrainians in need, without making our country less safe.We cannot afford to forget that in very recent history agents of the Russian state have sought to commit murder on British soil and that a Russian-sourced chemical weapon deployed in the UK resulted in the death of a British citizen. It would be a dereliction of the Government’s duty if lax controls on those entering the country without documentation were to result in an influx of agents working for the Putin regime.The British public can be reassured that concerns about security will always be in mind while we work to ensure that our operational processes are as agile and flexible as possible for the vulnerable people we are helping.The UK has always been a place of sanctuary which stands for freedom and democracy, and against barbarism and tyranny.More from News‘On the right side of history’: China defends its stance on Ukraine warRussia-Ukraine latest news: Russian forces accused of killing 56 elderly people after shelling Luhansk care homeBoyfriend arrested on suspicion of murder after student found deadLatest pictures from Ukraine: Russia may \u0026#39double down\u0026#39 attacks to make headway on invasion Queen to make ‘early and dignified’ attendance at Prince Philip’s memorial serviceCovid Freedom Day?

Parents and children begged to be killed together. One mother spent her last moments breastfeeding her baby. The child was hurled, still alive, into the mass of corpses, and she leapt after it. They were among the 33,761 civilians murdered that day.I’m sorry: I know that last paragraph wasn’t easy to read. Believe me, it wasn’t much fun to write. But I want to put Ukraine’s present agonies into their full, horrific context. Between 1933 and 1945, Ukraine had the highest mortality rate on Earth. Again and again, its people suffered indiscriminate slaughter at the hands of the authorities: the liquidation of the kulaks, the campaigns against supposed Polish and Ukrainian nationalists, the starvation of Soviet and German POWs, the Einsatzgruppen massacres, the NKVD executions, the reprisal killings.We think of the First and Second World Wars as uniquely destructive but, in the longer view, they were terrifyingly typical. Yes, in terms of absolute numbers killed, the Second World War heads the league. But that is because there were more human beings on the planet than in ancient or mediaeval times. As a proportion of the global population, earlier conflicts, from the Mongol conquests to the Taiping Rebellion were more lethal.His findings are counterintuitive and, in my experience, many people refuse flat-out to believe them. We are attuned to bad news. We are far more aware of the fighting in Ukraine than of the absence of fighting in Vietnam or former Yugoslavia. Yet Pinker’s statistics are unanswerable.What makes the current atrocities stand out is the same thing that makes the Holodomor and the Holocaust stand out, namely their proximity to us in time. We struggle to imagine how Mongol raids must have been experienced by medieval villagers. But when we look at pictures of mid-twentieth century Kyiv, we see people who used telephones, took photographs, drove to work wearing suits. What was true of the victims was also true of the perpetrators.Historically, though, there was nothing unique about those abominations. From the rise of the first city-states in Egypt, Mesopotamia and China, human relations were characterised by conquest and slavery. Despotic emperors would seize territory, slaughter the men and enslave the women and children, muscle-power being, in those days, the most valuable resource. The gulags and the concentration camps were a grisly twentieth century refinement but the principle of working captured populations to death, or of condemning entire groups on grounds of ethnicity, is as old as civilization.Consider, to pluck an example at random, the Biblical Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, after whom the Babi Yar survivor was ultimately named. Her story is told in Genesis 34. She was abducted and raped by Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, who then asked her family for permission to marry her. Jacob agreed on condition that the men of Shechem\u0027s tribe accepted circumcision. The Hivites duly performed the rite. But while they were still “sore” from their circumcision, Jacob’s sons “came upon the city boldly and slew all the males”.The story strikes modern readers as shocking, but it is we who are the exception. For almost all human history, few would have thought Jacob’s behaviour reprehensible. The oldest ethic was “my tribe good, your tribe bad”. Our contemporary objections to the story would have been subordinated to the fiercer imperative of vendetta.Could we be returning to that older ethic? We might dismiss Putin as an outlier. But can we be certain that he is not also an augur? It might seem a trivial thing, but look at how quickly we have extended our quarrel with Putin to all Russians. An orchestra in Montreal cancels a Russian pianist, despite his opposition to the invasion Tchaikovsky is dropped from programmes Russian paintings are removed from exhibitions. My tribe good, your tribe bad.These cancellations are happening in a culture newly primed to categorise and condemn. We damn institutions for some ancient benefaction. We stop publishing authors because of opinions that had nothing to do with their work. We teach identity politics, encouraging people to believe that they have grievances or obligations purely on grounds of their physiognomy.Can we still rely on Pinker’s thesis, derived ultimately from the Australian philosopher Peter Singer, of expanding moral circles? The publication of his book in 2011 was followed by the Syrian war – another enormity in which Putin had a bloody hand – which reversed some of some of the graphs showing declining violence. The second decade of this century saw the global trend towards law-based democracy thrown into reverse. The lockdowns revealed a terrifying appetite for authoritarian rule, even in traditionally liberal societies. Perhaps we have passed the uplands and are back in the shadows.Yet there are signs of hope. Ukraine’s war is, in effect, a struggle for Western values. Ukrainians want their politicians to be servants, not masters. They want free elections, secure property rights and impartial courts. These things are recent constructions but they have plainly not lost their inspirational force, their ability to engender heroism. So far, most Western societies have also rallied to the defence of their values. Putin’s aggression against a country that offered him no threat has jolted even the far-Right Continental parties out of their grotesque admiration for him.Still, are we clear about what it is we are defending? Do we continue to believe that iniduals trump groups and that laws must be general, equal and certain? Or are we sliding into our own version of collectivism, where group rights are what count, where we are treated differently according to our physical characteristics, and where the greatest achievement of the West – the dissemination of science, law, and the Enlightenment – is regarded as contemptible imperialism?There is obviously a difference between identity politics and genocide. But it is, if you think about it, a difference of degree. The surest defence against massacres and collective punishments is to instill the counter-intuitive idea of liberty.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Russian forces accused of killing 56 elderly people after shelling Luhansk care home‘On the right side of history’: China defends its stance on Ukraine warBoyfriend arrested on suspicion of murder after student found deadLatest pictures from Ukraine: Russia may \u0026#39double down\u0026#39 attacks to make headway on invasion Queen to make ‘early and dignified’ attendance at Prince Philip’s memorial serviceCovid Freedom Day?

If we brought these rocks and we split them open and we found a fossil, that would be so exciting. We could definitely have the first discovery of life on Mars happening in the UK.”Nasa’s Perseverance rover has already started drilling rock cores at the site of an ancient lake on Mars, a spot that experts think holds the best chance of finding fossils.The cores will be collected in a few years by the European Space Agency\u0027s Sample Fetch Rover, which is currently in development at Airbus in Stevenage.The samples will be loaded on to a rocket and fired up to orbit, where they will be scooped up by another spacecraft, and eventually set down in the Utah desert in the US in 2031.“This is the first time we are bringing back a piece of a whole other world,” added Dr Irshad.“We know that we’re highly unlikely to find life on the surface, but we’re drilling down to get core samples. Mars lost its atmosphere billions of years ago so any life would have been driven beneath the surface and that’s where we will find evidence of it, if it exists.“Currently there is no facility which can house these samples or carry out the necessary scientific analysis and keep them physically safe.“We won’t be able to just hop back to Mars and replace it if something goes wrong, this is going to be the most valuable material on the planet. Luckily we’ve got some of the best facilities in the world on the doorstep.”The facility is likely to be built at the 700-acre Harwell Science and Innovation Campus in Oxfordshire, home to more than 200 space, energy and quantum groups, including the Diamond Light Source and ISIS Neutron and Muon Source, which can investigate the structure and properties of materials in minute detail.The University of Leicester has already developed a super-secure lab, known as a double-walled isolator, which has two layers of bullet-proof glass, where samples can be entirely manipulated by robotic arms, to avoid contamination by humans.Once the samples have been analysed, the team wants to recreate Martian soil - or regolith - to test whether it is possible to 3D print blocks with which astronauts could build habitats.Dr Emma Johnson, principal project manager at RAL Space, said: “This facility must be fully operational by the time Mars samples are returned to Earth in 2031.“This means we have a window of opportunity to work with the planetary science community to design the best facility for curating and analysing these precious materials. This study enables us to move forward and work towards making this new facility a reality.Justin Byrne, Airbus UK’s head of space science and Earth observation, added: “It would be great to see the UK develop a dedicated research facility for samples from Mars and beyond.“The UK is already a global leader in space robotics and to build on this with a centre for sample analysis is a natural next step.”More from News‘On the right side of history’: China defends its stance on Ukraine warRussia-Ukraine latest news: Russian forces accused of killing 56 elderly people after shelling Luhansk care homeBoyfriend arrested on suspicion of murder after student found deadLatest pictures from Ukraine: Russia may \u0026#39double down\u0026#39 attacks to make headway on invasion Queen to make ‘early and dignified’ attendance at Prince Philip’s memorial serviceCovid Freedom Day?

He has woken us up to what should have been obvious all along: that we still need to exploit our remaining oil and gas reserves – even as we invest in renewables. Suddenly, the Government is talking of issuing new licences for extraction in the North Sea, an industry which, until just a few weeks ago, it was happy to see run down.Hard though it might be to remember now, consumers were already facing whacking increases in their bills even before the invasion of Ukraine, in part because we have allowed the North Sea to go into managed decline. The conceit was that we won’t need oil and gas for much longer as we speed towards a net zero future, so we might as well import what we need for a few years.We can only manage renewables because we have gas power plants we can switch on and turn up to make up for gaps in solar and wind energy. We have some electricity storage, mostly in the form of hydroelectric pumped-storage schemes, but only enough to supply us with power for around 38 minutes. There is a boom in battery storage at the moment, but if we try to rely on that it will make today’s electricity bills look a bargain. Large-scale energy storage in lithium batteries currently costs around £250 per MWh, when you take into account capital and lifetime maintenance costs. That is about five times as much as it costs to generate solar or wind energy in the first place.What this legal commitment does is to invite environmental activists to sue the Government for any policy which might be argued to be inconsistent with the net zero target. And that is exactly what they are doing. The Government has already lost one such action, in 2018 when the Court of Appeal ruled that a third runway would be inconsistent with the Government’s commitments under the Paris Agreement. That was later overturned in the Supreme Court on the grounds that the commitments made in Paris were not legally-binding and at the time the Heathrow decision was made the Climate Change Act had not been amended to demand net zero. But it was only thanks to the owners of Heathrow Airport that the case got as far as the Supreme Court – the Government had already given up.Unsurprisingly, having tasted one victory, activists have come back for more. In January, another group, ClientEarth, filed a lawsuit claiming that the government is not yet doing enough to meet its net zero target. It is not just the Government which is being bombarded with crowd-funded writs. Last week, ClientEarth also sued the directors of Shell, claiming that they are in breach of Company Law for not preparing sufficiently for net zero. It is a copycat action of a successful case in the Dutch courts last year, when Shell was still a partly-Dutch company.How different it all seems now. While Covid has all but dropped out of the news in Britain, China is still stuck in an endless cycle of lockdowns. Last week it was the turn of the 17.5 million strong southern city of Shenzhen, a hugely important player in the country’s electronics industry. This was in response to a nationwide ‘surge’ in cases to 3400.As many of us warned when zero covid was seriously proposed as a policy for Britain, it might seem clever in the short term, but once you have established the principle that no level of covid infection is acceptable, how are you ever going to open up again in a world in which covid has become endemic? It is like trying to eradicate the common cold , a condition which is also caused by endemic coronaviruses, among other viruses.China cannot now escape this madness, for political reasons. For a whole year, it basked in the glory of having appeared to defeat a virus which had brought the West to its knees . Throughout this time, China could boast of being the most influential nation in the world – whose example had encouraged Britain and many others to toy with authoritarian methods of government.More from News‘On the right side of history’: China defends its stance on Ukraine warRussia-Ukraine latest news: Russian forces accused of killing 56 elderly people after shelling Luhansk care homeBoyfriend arrested on suspicion of murder after student found deadLatest pictures from Ukraine: Russia may \u0026#39double down\u0026#39 attacks to make headway on invasion Queen to make ‘early and dignified’ attendance at Prince Philip’s memorial serviceCovid Freedom Day?

In the south-eastern city of Mariupol, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians, mainly civilians, are surrounded and cut off. Shells batter the apartment blocks, food and other essentials are in short supply. Hundreds of people who gathered at a theatre acting as a shelter for children and the elderly were hit earlier this week by a Russian airstrike, trapping many in the rubble. It’s not clear how many were killed or injured.Yet even as this callous carnage continued, there were glimmers of hope.Media reports claimed that peace talks were making progress, that a 15-point plan was being discussed. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky appeared to make a concession, openly acknowledging that Ukraine could not join Nato – one of the key demands of Russia. Sergei Lavrov, the grizzled and wily Russian foreign minister, said a neutral military status for Ukraine was being “seriously discussed” by the two sides and that “there are concrete formulations that in my view are close to being agreed”.At the same time, Zelensky said Russia’s demands for ending the war were becoming “more realistic”. In a phone call on Thursday afternoon with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Putin set out demands that reportedly conceded ground on his original aims of installing a puppet government in Ukraine.Many in Ukraine and the West must hope that a deal can be done – and quickly – if only to stop the killing and devastation. Surely a compromise can be reached?Yet in the fog of war, especially one whose origins are murky and hotly debated, nothing is clear.Can one trust a word Lavrov says? Only 10 days ago, as people were dying in Ukraine, he ludicrously claimed that Russia had not invaded. Is Putin, caught out by the strong Ukrainian resistance, on the back foot and looking for a way out? Or is he just playing for time, looking to regroup and press on? Can Russia survive the economic cost of Western sanctions? Does Putin even care?Western experts, from politicians to academics, take differing views. And such is the wreckage caused by the fighting in Ukraine and the sanctions imposed on Russia that one commentator, Ian Bremmer, founder of the political risk group Eurasia, summed up the sad state of affairs by tweeting: “Putin will lose… tragically, that doesn’t mean Ukrainians will win.”When Putin’s forces infiltrated Crimea in 2014, there was little violence and the local population were largely bemused or even welcoming. Many were pro-Russian. At the same time, pro-Russian rebels in the far east of Ukraine seized control of enclaves around Luhansk and Donetsk which, with Putin’s help, they’ve controlled ever since.Perhaps that gave Putin the idea that he was heading for a similarly easy victory when he invaded on February 24. If so, he was deluded.Over the eight years since the Crimea crisis, Ukraine’s military forces had strengthened, gaining new equipment – some of it state-of-the-art – and valuable experience fighting against rebels in the east. They fought back smart and hard.They’ve downed Russian helicopters, killed generals, destroyed tanks and, by some estimates, inflicted heavy losses on Russian forces – perhaps 7,000 dead. Putin’s soldiers have advanced in the north, south and east – but they are still struggling to capture key cities, including Kyiv, Odesa and Kharkiv. Unable to roll into them as Putin must have hoped, instead his forces have resorted to pummelling them with artillery and rockets. So far, the Ukrainians’ spirit to resist remains unbroken.Such an unexpected turn of events has led some in the West, particularly on social media, to think that Ukraine should keep up the good fight. If its fighters can hold out and even turn the tide, if public opinion in Russia starts to swing, if sanctions quickly cripple the Russian economy, then Putin can be defeated – or so the logic goes.But perhaps this is optimism bias, borne of short attention s. Stephen Kotkin, a professor of history and international affairs at Princeton University with particular expertise in Russia, sounds a note of caution.“Ukraine is winning this war only on Twitter, not on the battlefield,” he said in an interview in a the New Yorker magazine last week. “They’re not winning this war. Russia is advancing very well in the south, which is an extremely valuable place because of the Black Sea littoral and the ports. They are advancing in the east. If the southern and eastern advances meet up, they will encircle and cut off the main forces of the Ukrainian Army. What’s failed so far is the Russian attempt to take Kyiv in a lightning advance. Otherwise, their war is unfolding well. It’s only a couple of weeks in wars last much longer.”Russia’s forces may indeed be overstretched and underpowered, but that doesn’t mean Putin is at a point where he is forced to quit. As Kotkin warns, a brief respite while optimism rises over peace talks could just give him the time to regroup.“After three or four weeks of war, you need a strategic pause,” he said. “You have to refit your armour, resupply your ammo and fuel depots, fix your planes. You have to bring in reserves. There’s always a planned pause after about three to four weeks.”Even if Putin finds he cannot seize control of Kyiv and oust Zelensky, even if in the long run he can only lose thanks to international isolation and Russia’s crippled economy, he can still cause mayhem on a terrible scale, either continuing to fight a war of attrition or wreaking as much destruction as he can before withdrawing.For him, the tragic human toll of war seems to count for nothing. In Syria for seven years, he’s helped Bashar al-Assad wage a war that has killed hundreds of thousands and left places such as Aleppo in utter ruin.It’s also worth remembering a personal incident from Putin’s life in the 1990s. His first wife, Lyudmila, had a bad car crash in 1994, just as Putin was meeting media mogul Ted Turner in St Petersburg about holding a sporting event in the city. Putin, as he recounted in First Person, a book published in 2000 by three journalists who interviewed him at length, went to the hospital and inquired about his wife. The doctors told him she would be fine. “Are you sure?” he asked. They said yes. “So I left,” recalled Putin. He went back to his business meetings without seeing his wife, who had serious injuries to her skull and spine.This is a man not softened by emotion or easily deterred from his objectives. Even if, in Western eyes he loses, Putin may see wrecking Ukraine as a victory of sorts.In an article for Foreign Affairs ahead of the invasion, US academics Liana Fix and Michael Kimmage wrote: “If Russia gains control of Ukraine or manages to destabilise it on a major scale, a new era for the United States and for Europe will begin…“If Russia achieves its political aims in Ukraine by military means, Europe will not be what it was before the war. Not only will US primacy in Europe have been qualified any sense that the European Union or Nato can ensure peace on the continent will be the artefact of a lost age.”Much depends on a key point that is hard, perhaps impossible, to pin down: Putin’s mental state. In recent videos, he’s appeared almost spitting with anger and bile. Others show him holding meetings with generals or politicians at the end of long tables, or alone in front of an array of acolytes. Do they show the power of an autocrat or the isolation of a worried and weakening man?The worrying truth is you can take your pick. Some commentators have noted how Putin, once famed for his bare-chested machismo, now looks puffy and grey. On Friday, he was pictured seemingly limping off a Moscow stage. Is he ill? Has medication damaged his faculties, even made him mad?Amid all the speculation, it’s worth hanging on to the scraps of more solid information. On Thursday, Putin spoke by telephone to Turkey’s President Erdoğan, and shortly afterwards John Simpson of the BBC spoke to Ibrahim Kalin, a close adviser to Erdoğan, who had listened in to the conversation.Simpson asked Kalin whether he noticed anything strange about Putin on the call and reported: “Not at all... Mr Putin had apparently been clear and concise in everything he said.”While we might like to think of Putin as mad, it seems more plausible that he remains coldly calculating. Christopher Bort, who served as National Intelligence Officer for Russia and Eurasia on the US National Intelligence Council from 2017 to 2021, says it’s a mistake to think the Russian leader has lost the plot. Instead, he’s just taking more risks.“The truth is that Putin has gradually evolved into an ever-higher-stakes gambler,” Bort wrote recently in Foreign Affairs. “Although many observers continue to assume that he measures the risks and rewards of particular actions as they do, Putin has grown more and more willing to take risks as he has come to believe that doing so pays off. He has not lost touch with reality or become ‘unhinged,’ as some analysts have suggested. Rather, from his previous foreign interventions – especially in Ukraine and Syria – he has learned that boldness, surprise, and playing on his opponents’ fears of a wider war are the keys to getting what he wants. And that is why it is dangerous to assume that Putin’s future actions will mirror his past ones.”Another danger with gamblers is that the stakes can rise swiftly. While Nato and the West are stronger than Russia militarily and far stronger economically, Putin still retains some leverage because he can play on the fear of escalation to a wider war.Indeed, in some ways the war has already spread faster than most predicted. In December, many in Ukraine still thought Putin would not invade. And if he did strike, few envisaged the grinding destruction now taking place.The worry, according to Chris Chivvis, a former US national intelligence officer for Europe, is that many paths to escalation “eventually lead toward the nuclear threshold”. After Russia’s seizure of Crimea in 2014, says Chivvis, the US and its allies conducted war games that showed Putin “would probably use a nuclear weapon if he concludes that his regime is threatened”.Writing on the website of the Carnegie Endowment for Peace in early March, Chivvis added: “Moving across the nuclear threshold wouldn’t necessarily mean an immediate, full-force nuclear exchange – in other words, global thermonuclear war. But it would be an extremely dangerous, watershed event in world history.“The nuclear option that has been most frequently discussed in the past few days involves Russia using a small nuclear weapon (a ‘non-strategic nuclear weapon’) against a specific military target in Ukraine. Such a strike might have a military purpose, such as destroying an airfield or other military target, but it would mainly be aimed at demonstrating the will to use nuclear weapons, or ‘escalating to de-escalate’, and scaring the West into backing down.”Chivvis points out that Nato’s military experience of the last three decades has not equipped it well for conflict with a nuclear power. “I share the frustration over Putin’s murderous war,” he said last week. “But I fear we have grown accustomed to fighting enemies who had no way to out-escalate us”.Not everyone agrees with such a Manichaean analysis. Might there be a middle way, a path to muddle through to, if not peace and tranquility, a cessation of hostilities? The arch triangulator Tony Blair points out that since US President Joe Biden has ruled out Nato taking direct military action, the fighting – and the dying – will be done by Ukrainians. In Blair’s view, “if the Russian army – for sure underperforming and, as it turns out, badly trained – uses its full military might, it will be tough for Ukraine to prevail in the short term, at least without terrible loss of life. The West therefore needs a two-pronged strategy: ratchet up maximum pressure and, at the same time, push for negotiation.”He favours making it clear that the West is prepared to impose even tougher sanctions that it will hammer Belarus economically if it enters the war to help Russia and that the West keep arming Ukraine, especially with surface-to-air missiles.At the same time, the West should strive for a settlement on the points Putin has repeatedly raised – about Ukraine’s neutrality and the status of Crimea and the enclaves in the east – though Blair admits that the “final decision in any negotiation rests with Ukraine”.For more than a decade before Putin invaded, one US academic was warning that the expansion of Nato and the drift of Ukraine away from Russia towards the embrace of the West was seen as a serious threat by Russia. A lecture given by Professor John Mearsheimer in 2015 on those very themes has now been viewed more than 20m times on YouTube.His argument has been vehemently disputed by some – and there’s no doubt its framing has been contentious. The title of his 2015 lecture was “The causes and consequences of the Ukraine crisis”, but on YouTube it was presented as “Why is Ukraine the West’s fault?”The war is indisputably Putin’s fault: he gave the order to invade. But it increasingly looks that a compromise over Nato may be a step towards a way out of the mess.Both before the invasion and after it, Putin has repeatedly demanded that Ukraine pledges not to join Nato. Ukraine’s President Zelensky now seems to accept that position – it would be, in any case, impossible for Ukraine to join the organisation in its current state. Since Crimea has been de facto Russian since 2014, Ukraine may also be willing to compromise there.There remain, though, significant hurdles to a deal. Will Russia withdraw from all the areas it has invaded? In particular, Putin may be tempted to hold on to territory in the south that links up Crimea with the rebel enclaves of Donetsk, which might be a red line for Ukraine. Who will pay to restore Ukraine to a peaceful, prosperous society? The cost of the damage so far is estimated to be more than $100 billion. What about Ukraine’s relationship with the EU? The invasion has driven many Ukrainians closer to the EU than before – the opposite of what Putin wanted.The big stick of sanctions is also a consideration for President Xi Jinping of China, who entered into a pact of mutual support with Putin some months ago. Since then, he’s seen Russia turned into an international pariah and watched its currency collapse.Xi, who talked to US President Biden on Friday, knows that China’s economy still needs Western markets to thrive. But if there is leverage there it was not evident from China’s readout of Friday’s Xi-Biden call. Xi didn’t volunteer to play a role in ending the war. Instead he used a favorite phrase to cast blame on the west. “Let he who tied the bell on the tiger’s neck take it off,” he said.In the view of Blair and others, there is now a window of about two weeks for Ukraine and Russia to agree a deal. Beyond that, both sides may feel too much has been lost, in terms of lives, property, prestige and much more, for any compromise to be reached.It’s a real risk. In Freedman’s view, we are already “beyond the point where Putin has much ‘face’ to be saved… In launching this disastrous war, he has revealed himself to be not only a vicious bully but also a deluded fool.”Let’s hope it’s not too late and a so-called “offramp” can still be found. If a peace deal is done and can be made to hold, Putin – like Khrushchev before him – may yet be able to retreat from a misjudged confrontation with the west.But while we can hope for the best, we must plan for the worst. Even if a peace deal is agreed it will be fragile. And, as several prominent dissidents believe, it is possible Putin’s imperial ambitions go beyond the borders of Ukraine. More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Russian forces accused of killing 56 elderly people after shelling Luhansk care home‘On the right side of history’: China defends its stance on Ukraine warBoyfriend arrested on suspicion of murder after student found deadLatest pictures from Ukraine: Russia may \u0026#39double down\u0026#39 attacks to make headway on invasion Queen to make ‘early and dignified’ attendance at Prince Philip’s memorial serviceCovid Freedom Day?

It\u0027s bad enough at home!’”Bennett added of recording during the pandemic: “The Archers has such a place in the British psyche, it was sad when we couldn’t work in a studio as usual.“Neither Charles or I are good with computers, but somehow we muddled through and learnt how to record our parts at home.”The Archers actors have previously spoken about how sound effects had to change with lockdown.Tim Stimpson, script writer, said recording sex scenes made the cast laugh.“I’m sure it does, he said. “It’s probably everyone smooching their hands. The innuendo makes us laugh more because we don’t hold back on it.”In 2014, the show’s then-editor Sean O’Connor described the generational ide between intimate scenes.“The more senior actors still kiss on the hand - the ‘radio kiss’,” he said.“But newer and younger actors tend to be more naturalistic about it.“Brian and Jennifer would still kiss on the hand, though I can’t remember the last time they had a kiss.”More from News‘On the right side of history’: China defends its stance on Ukraine warRussia-Ukraine latest news: Russian forces accused of killing 56 elderly people after shelling Luhansk care homeBoyfriend arrested on suspicion of murder after student found deadLatest pictures from Ukraine: Russia may \u0026#39double down\u0026#39 attacks to make headway on invasion Queen to make ‘early and dignified’ attendance at Prince Philip’s memorial serviceCovid Freedom Day?

A memo handed to the Sunday Times explained the action to colleagues. It said: “We understand that PO Ferries have an intention to try and re-employ many staff on new terms and conditions or use agency staff to restart routes”. It added: “Without these decisions an estimated , staff would likely lose their jobs. These changes will align them with other companies in the market who have undertaken a large reduction in staff.”News then broke on Thursday when the staff were abruptly sacked in a video call, without the  or -day notice unions say is required by law.  The Department for Transport today insisted it was simply an “internal government memo” explaining “what officials had been told by PO Ferries”, before ministers had the full facts. But TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “This report shows his government sat on its hands and did nothing while hundreds of jobs and livelihoods were on the line. “There was no attempt to challenge PO on these unconscionable tactics – or even question whether these actions were legal. “Ministers, from the prime minister down, have serious questions to answer. This is a national scandal. It has to be a catalyst for change on workers’ rights.” Shadow Transport Secretary Louise Haigh added: “This bombshell letter proves that the government was not only aware of PO ferries’ scandalous action - but complicit in it.“They knew people’s livelihoods were on the line and they knew PO was attempting to use exploitative fire and rehire practices. But they sat back and did nothing.”Ministers have since voiced outrage, and the government is looking into whether PO Ferries broke the law by failing to consult. Downing Street warned of ramications” which could include stripping the firm of any government contracts or revoking its low-tax freeport privileges.Chancellor Rishi Sunak lashed out at PO’s “appalling” decision - after personally championing Freeports like that on the Thames which is owned by PO’s Dubai owner DP World. He told the BBC : “What we are seeing is appalling, the way they have treated their workers is awful, it’s wrong.“Across government we are examining not just those actions and whether they comply with the regulations as they should have done, but also our own relationship with the company.”Itaposs understood Transport Secretary Grant Shappsapos private office received a copy of the memo on Thursday morning, just before the news became public. But Mr Shapps did not see the memo because he was taking Transport Questions in the House of Commons at the time, sources said.  Earlier No had insisted the news was kept to a tight circle of officials in the Department for Transport due to commercial confidentiality. The PM’s official spokesman said: “I don’t know exactly when the Prime Minister was informed”. A Whitehall source fumed: “Officials appear to have initially bought the PO Ferries line that this was essential to save the company from imminent collapse. “But talk of agency staff and getting operations up and running in just ten days should have set alarm bells ringing that this was no ordinary redundancy announcement with a proper consultation process. “Ministers were incandescent when they were made aware of what was taking place and intervened as quickly as possible.”  A DfT spokesperson said: This was an internal Government memo which, as standard practice, outlined what officials had been told by PO Ferries shortly before their announcement was made. This was sent before Ministers were advised of the full details and as soon as they were informed, they made clear their outrage at the way in which PO staff had been dismissed. “It is clear from the memo that our immediate priority was to work with unions to ensure workers’ rights continue to be protected and the Transport Secretary has urged the company to sit down with workers and reconsider this action.

TV’s Money Saving Expert issued a desperate direct plea to Chancellor Rishi Sunak ahead of Wednesday’s Spring Statement to offer more help to the poorest Brits.Mr Sunak today hinted he could cut fuel duty and did not rule out tweaking income tax or National Insurance thresholds to give people a little more of their money. He revealed he has set up a cost of living unit in the Treasury - amid suggestions he could raise the £ council tax rebate or £ repayable discount off energy bills.  He also claimed he would be lowering taxes by  - after raising the tax burden to its highest in  years. Mr Lewis said the % or £ rise in energy bills on April  will be “catastrophic” and Britain is already more than a quarter of the way through assessing another rise on October .That rise looks set to be “at least another £ a year”, which will add £, to bills across this year in total as million people are in fuel poverty, he told the BBC ’s Sunday Morning.He said: “I’ve been Money Saving Expert since . I’ve been through the financial crash, I’ve been through Covid which was mitigated by some of the measures the Chancellor put in place. “This is the worst - where we are right now, this is the worst.  “When I’m reading messages from people saying money prioritisation used to be ‘do I go to the hairdressers, or do I go to the pub and have a takeaway’. “Now it’s about prioritising ‘feeding my children over feeding myself’. That is simply not tenable in our society and there is absolute panic - and it has not started yet.” In a direct plea to Mr Sunak, he said: “As the Money Saving Expert who’s been known for this - I am virtually out of tools to help people now. “It’s not something money management can fix. “It’s not something for those in the lowest incomes, telling them to cut their bills will work. “We need political intervention.”Rishi Sunak is not expected to announce major changes to his policies in Wednesday’s Spring Statement despite National Insurance rising, tax and student loan thresholds being frozen, and energy bills soaring by £ a year. Moments before Mr Lewis’ intervention, he insisted people should feel confident about the strength of our economy.He told Sky Newsaposs Sophy Ridge On Sunday: The fundamentals of our economy are really good because weaposve recovered well, because of the actions weaposve taken, but look, the outlook is uncertain... because of whataposs happening in Ukraine.Conservative MP Robert Halfon said it was absolutely vital the Government cut fuel duty to ease the cost of living crisis. Asked about action on fuel duty, Mr Sunak said: Obviously I canapost comment on specic things.  “But what I would say, I understand that, I have a rural constituency, people are incredibly reliant on their cars and this is one of the biggest bills that people face, watching it go up, right, weaposre all seeing that, when weaposre filling up our cars. I get that, thataposs why weaposve frozen fuel duty already, I announced that in autumn, itaposs the th consecutive year of fuel duty freezes and that really helps people, I know that. Conservative MP Robert Halfon said it was absolutely vital the Government cut fuel duty to ease the cost of living crisis.On the cost of living, Mr Sunak said where we can make a dferent of course we will, but warned the actions and steps weaposre taking to sanction Russia are not cost-free for us here at home.He told Sky News programme Sophy Ridge On Sunday: I know this is the number one thing that people are concerned about, and people are working hard, theyaposre struggling with the price of things going up, I get that. Iaposm spending all my time focused on that.  I want people to know, and they should be reassured, that I will stand by them in the same way that I have done over the last couple of years to try and make a dference where I can, but as you said the actions and steps weaposre taking to sanction Russia are not cost-free for us here at home. I canapost pretend that itaposs going to easy, that Government can solve every challenge or that I can completely protect people against some of the dficult times ahead, But what I can say is where we can make a dferent of course we will, thataposs what weaposve done over the past two years, and most recently you saw that with our announcement to help people with energy bills - £ billion, £ of support to people, theyaposll get £ of that in April. So look, where we can make a dference of course we will, but I get that this is dficult. Ms Reeves said the rise in energy prices meant Labouraposs windfall tax concept would raise more money than first anticipated, adding: When I first said there should be a windfall tax back in January, we thought it would raise about £. billion but since then oil and gas prices have increased substantially and that surcharge, that windfall tax would now bring in about £. billion. Instead of carrying on down the path this Chancellor is going on, he should look again at Labouraposs proposals for a windfall tax and use that to keep bills low for everybody .

It is also about our weak employment laws that let firms sack at will to hire cheaper staff. If Tory MPs are genuinely appalled by what has happened they will legislate to prevent such outrages being repeated.  Angels of hope Vladimir Putin has visited unimaginable horror on the people of Ukraine. Their bravery and resilience in the face of death and destruction has been humbling. So too has been the compassion they have shown to fellow citizens. Their remarkable spirit is demonstrated by the three women who risked their lives to ferry orphaned children from bombed cities to a sanctuary in the Carpathian Mountains. These angels of hope remind us goodness can flourish even amid the horrors of war. It is also why Putin will never suppress the people of Ukraine.

And she claimed Vladimir Putin could exploit refugee flows to send agents to Britain.In her keynote speech, she said: Iaposve been asked why couldnapost we suspend security checks on people escaping Putinaposs war  Times of conflict, my friends, emphasises our need to remain watchful. I know from the briefings I receive from the intelligence and security services that instability around the world brings with it greater threats.  Only four years ago the Russian military intelligence services used a chemical weapon on British soil. She went on: The truth is that a very small number of people can wreak utter havoc. Russia has a history of covert hostile activity.And Iaposm afraid it is naive and misguided to think that only men can be covert operatives, or that refugee flows could not be subject to some form of exploitation.  Ms Patel went on: There are those who would come to our country, to this country, who mean us harm and who plot to strike at our very way of le. The processes that we have put in place closely follow the advice of our intelligence and security services. They mean we can help Ukrainians in need without making our country less safe. It comes as the Home Office said , visas had been granted under the family scheme for Ukrainians fleeing the war by pm on Friday. Ms Patel added: State threats and terrorism take many forms. They also thrive on indference and appeasement and now we are seeing them bolstered by new types of targeted biological, chemical, cyber warfare, ransomware and online threats. Our duty is to safeguard our countryaposs interests and we will never take our eye off the ball when it comes to the safety and security of our country. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said , places had been created in schools for children fleeing Ukraine and virtual lessons created during the coronavirus pandemic had been translated into Ukrainian. Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove confirmed more than , households had now offered to house Ukrainian refugees, the majority of whom have made their way to Poland. Former prime minister David Cameron announced on Friday he was driving a small lorry to the Polish border with Ukraine with supplies.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON PO FerriesConservative PartyHome OfficeMichael GoveDavid CameronVladimir PutinTerrorismPoliticsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Mr Sunak did not rule out cutting fuel duty or raising the threshold at which people pay National Insurance, sparing some of the poorest workers. He revealed he has set up a cost of living unit in the Treasury - amid suggestions he could raise the £ council tax rebate or £ repayable discount off energy bills. He also claimed he would be lowering taxes by  - after raising the tax burden to its highest in  years.Yet the only policy the Chancellor has actually announced so far is a demand for the NHS to make £.bn of “efficiency” savings to cut “waste” in a move reminiscent of austerity.Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said Labour would not vote against a fuel duty cut - but warned Sky News: “Even a p reduction in fuel duty will only reduce filling up the car with petrol by £.So I donapost think that really rises to the scale of the challenge we face at the moment, which is why we are calling for a windfall tax on the big profits being made by North Sea oil and gas companies right now. Mr Sunak admitted he could not “fully protect” Brits, saying “I can’t pretend it’s going to be easy.”He told the BBC : “The steps we’ve taken to sanction Russia are not cost free for us here at home.“I want to be honest with people that it’s not going to be easy. “I wish government could solve absolutely every problem, that I could fully protect people against all the challenges that lie ahead. I can’t do that.  “What I would say is I will stand by them in the same way I have done over the past couple of years. Where we can make a dference, of course we will.” Askedhe is going to step in during the next months and years of rising energy costs he replied: “Of course I am, and people can judge me by my actions.” He tried to dampen fears the energy bills price cap will rise by another £ in October, saying: “We don’t know [yet] and I don’t want people to be scared.” But he dodged saying whether the number of people in fuel poverty will rise, replying: “I think the things we’re putting in place will make a dference.” Rishi Sunak is not expected to announce major changes to his policies in Wednesday’s Spring Statement despite the crisis.Martin Lewis today declared the cost-of-living surge coming in April is “the worst” crisis Brits have faced in  years including Covid and the financial crash.  TV’s Money Saving Expert issued a desperate direct plea to Chancellor Rishi Sunak ahead of Wednesday’s Spring Statement to offer more help to the poorest Brits. He told BBC Sunday Morning people are “genuinely choosing between whether they starve and whether they freeze” and the Chancellor should “suck in his ideology to fix it”. Conservative MP Robert Halfon said it was absolutely vital the Government cut fuel duty to ease the cost of living crisis. Asked about action on fuel duty, Mr Sunak said: Obviously I canapost comment on specic things. “But what I would say, I understand that, I have a rural constituency, people are incredibly reliant on their cars and this is one of the biggest bills that people face, watching it go up, right, weaposre all seeing that, when weaposre filling up our cars. I get that, thataposs why weaposve frozen fuel duty already, I announced that in autumn, itaposs the th consecutive year of fuel duty freezes and that really helps people, I know that. Ms Reeves said the rise in energy prices meant Labouraposs windfall tax concept would raise more money than first anticipated, adding: When I first said there should be a windfall tax back in January, we thought it would raise about £. billion but since then oil and gas prices have increased substantially and that surcharge, that windfall tax would now bring in about £. billion. Instead of carrying on down the path this Chancellor is going on, he should look again at Labouraposs proposals for a windfall tax and use that to keep bills low for everybody .

Energy bills, National Insurance and inflation are all surging in April, outstripping benefit, pension and wage rises. Meanwhile tax and student loan repayment thresholds are being frozen in a squeeze on the cost of living. The Ukraine-Russia war will make inflation worse in OBR forecasts out on Wednesday - the Mirror understands Whitehall officials are braced for it to go higher than %. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has not ruled out raising the National Insurance payment threshold or cutting fuel duty - but Labour warn this would barely touch the sides. And heaposs understood to be strongly resisting any bigger action like axing the NI hike or raising pensions or benefits beyond .%, as called for by Labour.  A source told the Sun on Sunday: The Spring Statement will be very policy-light. Donapost expect him to pull a rabbit out of a hat. Maybe a few baby bunnies, no more. The SNP called for an emergency package of support while Labour demanded a windfall tax on oil giants. And TVaposs Martin Lewis said: “As the Money Saving Expert who’s been known for this - I am virtually out of tools to help people now. “It’s not something money management can fix. It’s not something for those in the lowest incomes, telling them to cut their bills will work. We need political intervention.” The Tory Chancellor said “where we can make a dference, of course we will” and has set up a cost of living unit in the Treasury - amid suggestions he could raise the £ council tax rebate or £ repayable discount off energy bills.  He also claimed he would be lowering taxes by  - after raising the tax burden to its highest in  years. Yet the only policy he had actually announced by Sunday is a demand for the NHS to make £.bn of “efficiency” savings to cut “waste” in a move reminiscent of austerity. Mr Sunak also warned Brits “it’s not going to be easy”, saying: “I wish government could solve absolutely every problem, that I could fully protect people against all the challenges that lie ahead. I can’t do that. So when and what is the Spring Statement, and what do we know about how it’s shaping up  Here’s what you need to know.When is the Spring Statement  Chancellor Rishi Sunak will deliver the  Spring Statement on Wednesday  March at .pm. He will give a speech in the Commons, followed by documents and forecasts published online. After complaints from the Speaker, less of his statement is expected to be ‘trailed’ in advance. What is the Spring Statement The Spring Statement is a ‘mini-Budget’ by the Chancellor on the situation facing the economy.It is lower-key than a Budget and does not contain the same tax and spending powers.For instance, fuel duty and taxes on cigarettes and alcohol were already set for the year in October’s Budget. So was the minimum wage rise from £. to £. in April - though you can expect Mr Sunak to crow about it anyway.What will Chancellor Rishi Sunak announce during the Spring Statement The Chancellor is expected to lay out the sheer scale of the cost-of-living disaster hitting poor Brits. This will be in the form of Office for Budget Responsibilityforecasts on GDP growth, borrowing, debt and inflation. They will also have the warm-up acts of the Bank of England’s interest rates decision tomorrow, and monthly inflation figures for February - which will be published at am on the day of the Spring Statement. While growth is rising post-Covid, so is inflation - and it is set to be much worse than the last forecast . All this will ramp up pressure to announce extra help for households - but he’s reluctant to do that. He reportedly has £bn more in coffers than hoped as rising prices lead to higher taxes. But soaring inflation looks set to push up his borrowing bill, as debt costs more to pay back. He could recycle already-announced policies or announce vague ‘consultations’ on future ones, but will it be enough  UK inflation could rise over % Shock analysis last week found inflation is set to peak at .% in April after the Ukraine invasion made it even worse.The Mirror understands Whitehall officials believe this figure, calculated by the Resolution Foundation, is broadly accurate. Officials in fact fear it could go even higher, beating the .% rate of  and even hitting %. This will blow October’s forecasts - that inflation would peak at .% this year and could rise to .% - out of the water. It will mean more expensive food and goods in the shops, hitting the poorest families hardest. NHS forced to cut £.bn of aposwasteapos The Chancellor announced a demand for the NHS to make £.bn of “efficiency” savings over three years to cut “waste” in a move reminiscent of austerity. That means DOUBLING the annual NHS efficiency target to .%. The current level of waste across government is simply not acceptable,” Mr Sunak said. But Pat Cullen, General Secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: “Trying to squeeze even more out of the same staff will not work. The existing shortages already mean nursing staff work unpaid overtime to keep the NHS running.” Another £ million is predicted to come from a review of Quangos or armaposs s bodies - publicly funded but not entirely Government-controlled.  Could fuel duty be cut on petrol  Fuel duty was already frozen at October’s Budget for a th year in a row - handing £, to the average car driver since . But Tory MP Robert Halfon said it is vital the Government go further and cut it. Mr Sunak said: Obviously I canapost comment on specic things. But what I would say, I understand that, I have a rural constituency, people are incredibly reliant on their cars and this is one of the biggest bills that people face, watching it go up, right, weaposre all seeing that, when weaposre filling up our cars. I get that. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said Labour would not vote against a fuel duty cut - but warned Sky News: “Even a p reduction in fuel duty will only reduce filling up the car with petrol by £. So I donapost think that really rises to the scale of the challenge. Could Rishi Sunak change energy grant  Previously Rishi Sunak announced a £ council tax discount for Bands A-D next month, and a £ repayable rebate in October. Yet bills are rising by £ a year on April  and will rise again in October - possibly by another £, a year. This is a far bigger hit to the poorest tenth of households who spend around % of their income on energy. The richest spend %. Thereaposs speculation Mr Sunak could increase the £ or £ packages to make them more generous.Treasury officials want to wait until the run-up to the October rise before announcing more help. But a former Treasury minister told the Mirror that approach is “not going to work”, adding: “He’s going to have to do something, it just can’t be the full Covid.” Will there be help for childcare  The Chancellor is considering more help for parents who pay for childcare after Boris Johnson raised the issue in Cabinet, according to the Sunday Times. Ministers are said to be looking at plans to increase the number of children that registered childminders can look after, which now stands at six up to the age of eight. Dad-of-six Jacob Rees-Mogg - who has a nanny - is said to have backed the idea saying: Even I can look after six children at once.Row over energy supply plan and nuclear power Boris Johnson is supposed to set out a delayed, long-term energy supply plan this week - for the UK to wean off Russian oilby the end of the year. This is expected to invest more in renewable power and nuclear power, as well as trying to get more oil from places like Saudi. But Rishi Sunak reportedly insisted it should be delayed to give him more time to assess the costs of nuclear and green power. The PM is privately frustrated with his Chancelloraposs refusal to endorse a massive surge in nuclear power, according to the Sunday . Will National Insurance thresholds change National Insurance will rise from % to .% from April . Tory MPs are still pushing for this to be cancelled as it’s a major tax rise just as a cost-of-living crisis hits. Downing Street insisted the rise is going ahead, despite previous claims Boris Johnson was wobbling. But could it be tweaked instead  Itaposll be paid by anyone earning over £, a year - up from the £, a year now. Thereaposs some speculation the Chancellor could raise this threshold, which is lower than the point at which people pay Income Tax. One Tory told the Mirror: “If itaposs about pride, they can now say that Ukraine is the reason they need to change course.  Will other tax hikes change  The Income Tax personal allowance and p rate threshold will freeze at £, and £,. The IFS think tank warns the threshold freezes will lead to more than £bn in ‘stealth’ taxes as inflation soars - and by , % of GDP will have been added to the UK tax burden. Meanwhile the VAT rate for hospitality firms, currently .% due to Covid, is due toto %. There are spaces here for the Chancellor to act - but it would scupper his claims to be recovering from Covid.Will benefits and pensions rise in April Mr Sunak will raise benefits by just .% - as little as £. a month on Universal Credit and far less than inflation. In October he cut Universal Credit for millions by £ a week. Pensions will also rise by just .% after the triple lock was axed.In a Budget rabbit out of the hat in October, he handed more generous benefits to .million working families by cutting the Universal Credit taper rate from p to p. But this only helps those who work, not the sick or out-of-work.The Resolution Foundation is worried there will be a “rollercoaster” with real benefits down this year and up next year. Tory MP Nigel Mills suggested bringing forward next yearaposs increase in Universal Credit to this autumn to solve the problem. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves called for benefits to rise by the rate of inflation - which is .% now and could rise beyond %. That could be double the .% rise in April, worth just £. a month on the standard allowance of Universal Credit. She told the Observer: “The chancellor should look at how to uprate benefits in a fair way. They are supposed to go up by inflation and they are not at the moment. But Mr Sunak seems unlikely to raise benefits by more than .% because of the multi-billion pound cost - and the need to raise pensions and pay at the same timehe does.  Will defence spending rise  Westminster sources told the Sunday Mirror the Chancellor is planning to raise the £billion MoD budget. One said: “Ministers are no longer talking about defence cuts. They now see the need to beef up our forces to confront Russia.” And that could reverse the planned reduction of , troops to , by . But the Chancellor tried to hose down the reports, saying he has already presided over the biggest rise in defence spending since the Cold War.Will there be a pay rise for nurses, teachers and other public sector workers from April  Inflation means planned rises to public sector wages - due every April - will be wiped out by prices. Rising prices put huge pressure on the Chancellor to give these vital key workers pay rises above % or %, to avoid hitting them with a real-terms cut. But the Treasury is resisting such big cash rises. The government has spelt out plans to raise salaries for experienced teachers by only % in  .Health unions have also blasted plans to offer NHS staff in England a “miserly” % hike.Pressure on the Chancellor to reverse this will be huge but again, it will take a lot for him to budge.  Will alcohol prices rise and when  The cost of beer and sparking wine will fall, but whisky and vodka prices will rise, according to changes already announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak in his October Budget. Currently there is a complicated system of  separate tax bands for booze, across four main areas: beer, cider, spirits and wine. But the chancellor will do away with the old system and bring in a new one from February next year. This means tax cuts on drinks like normal-strength beer, wine, cider and liqueurs, but tax hikes on spirits like whisky. Sparkling wine costs will fall by around p a bottle.A vision beyond Covid and the war The Chancellor will likely try to set out a world beyond Covid but the Ukraine war and soaring inflation will make this dficult. Expect many references to infrastructure and ‘levelling-up’ but be on the lookout for old pots of money being reannounced. One Tory admitted to the Mirror: “The Rachel Reeves line that weaposre a high tax, low growth Government is true at the moment. “We donapost seem to have many pro-growth policies, weaposve pretty much given up on supply-side reforms.

Bare-knuckle boxer Willy, a dad-of-nine, died aged  after collapsing while on holiday with his family in Majorca in July .Now his mourning family have erected what is believed to be Britainaposs biggest headstone at a cemetery in Sheffield, Yorks. The huge memorial is crafted from solid Carrara marble and features two le-sized statues of Big Willyaposs six-foot-two frame.It also includes depictions of Jesus Christ and biblical scenes, plus a solar-powered jukebox playing Big Willyaposs favourite tracks - mourners can also connect to the speaker through Bluetooth to play their own songs. The headstone is lit up in LED lights that change colour and is under -hour CCTV monitoring, which his family can also access on their phones and use to aposspeakapos to him. Willyaposs eldest daughter, Mary Collins, , said the headstone was a send-off to the best father in the world. Itaposs a sad day but itaposs also a way to show the world what he meant to us, said Mary.  Our father was a family man and he means the world to us - he still means the world to us. Weaposve given him everything weaposve got and he deserves it. One of  children, Willy was the patriarch of the Collins family. He apparently doted on his children and grandchildren and had around  nieces and nephews.  After his death, tributes flooded in from across the UK and his home city, where he was known by many as the aposKing of Sheffieldapos. He loved Sheffield, said Mary. He was as much a Sheffield man as he was an Irish man. If you met him once for five minutes you would never forget him.  We now have somewhere where we can meet and talk about him and for others to remember him. He was my best friend. Not a day goes by where we all donapost think of him. Hundreds of mourners lined the streets of Sheffield last August for Big Willyaposs funeral as his body was carried in a gold-plated casket, which was transported by a horse-pulled carriage.

But not in any Sam Smith pubs. Itaposs no secret that mobile phones in particular have had a huge impact in the way we interact with people face to face, and thereaposs arguably nothing more annoying than sitting opposite someone whoaposs more interested than Instagram than holding a conversation.So, back in , pub chain Samuel Smithaposs Brewery, which operates around  pubs in the north of England, announced it would be introducing a series of strict in-house rules, in a bid to boost social conversation person to person.  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. The rules include no phones, no juke boxes and absolutely no laptops. If you have to take a call, you should go outside to answer, just like a smoker would to have a cigarette, according to boss Humphrey Smith. The ban also applies to tablets and iPads, which cannot be used inside or outside. Not only that, pubs owned by the chain are not allowed to play music or televisions, while there is also a zero tolerance on swearing. The policies were introduced in order to ensure the brewery maintained a traditional, uncompromisingly Victorian aesthetic, while maintaining the notion that pubs are for social conversation person to person. In a world where most people see their mobile phone as an extension of their arm itaposs pretty controversial, but thereaposs no getting away from the fact it would boost actual real-le conversations. Itaposs certainly not for everyone, butyou fancy a nostalgic trip down memory line to a simpler pre-technological time, Sam Smith pubs are the place to go.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Image: Liverpool Echo Phoebe BartonByPaige HollandShowbiz Audience WriterPhoebe Barton:,  Mar |commentsGordon Ramsay has been criticised by customers for the steep prices of his food on a number of occasions.If itaposs not his fry up thataposs being called a rip off, itaposs the cost of his steak and chips that is offending customers.So when Gordon Ramsay’s new Bread Street Kitchen  Bar restaurant opened, Liverpool Echo journalist Phoebe Barton was keen to put her tastebuds - and Gordon - to the test.The restaurant, located in Liverpool, offers a large iety of starters, main courses, desserts and drinks, many of which caught Phoebeaposs eye. Despite being tempted by the steak, beef wellington, spinach and ricotta cannelloni and the butter chicken curry, she finally settled on fish and chips. The dish consisted of battered fish, chunky chips, mushy peas, tartare sauce and chip shop curry sauce, and cost £. - which according to Phoebe is pricer than some of the other restaurants in the city. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.There’s no denying Bread Street Kitchen  Bar is a pricier dining venue compared to some other restaurants in the city, she said.Iaposm sometimes wary that you can be paying for the name that’s above the door rather than the quality of the food, but this wasn’t the case at Gordon Ramsay’s restaurant. She continued: When my fish and chips arrived, I was delighted by how delicious the dish looked. The fish was a good size and the golden-brown batter looked perfect. The three little dishes containing the mushy peas, tartare sauce and curry sauce were a feast for the eyes - I couldn’t wait to e in.My kne cracked through the batter revealing the bright white fish, which flaked into chunks as the kne smoothly sliced through it. And it tasted just as good as it looked. The taste was ine and the texture super soft, highlighting how fresh the fish was, she said. The mushy peas were soft but not runny like they sometimes can be, and they seemed to have a slight hint of mint which I thoroughly enjoyed. The condiments also got a thumbs up from Phoebe. The chip shop curry sauce at Bread Street Kitchen  Bar was absolutely delicious. It had a lovely kick but wasn’t too spicy, and the sauce had a creamy texture which coated the chips well. I’d have to say it was the best curry sauce I’ve ever had.The tartare sauce was creamy, smooth, full of flavour and it complimented the fish beautully. Phoebeaposs only criticism of the dish was the colour of the chips. While she admits they were very tasty, she said she usually prefers chunky chips to be a little crispier. I usually wouldn’t pay £. for fish and chips, however, I have to say it was worth every penny. Every component was cooked beautully and full of flavour. Having eaten fish and chips so many times over the years, it’s rare for me to feel like I’m eating the dish for the very first time, but this is how I felt dining on Bread Street Kitchen  Bar’s fish and chips. But the impressiveness didnapost stop there.  Despite being very full, I couldn’t resist looking at the dessert menu, she said, and after a lovely waiter talked her through each item, she finally settled on the Monkey Shoulder Cranachan Cheesecake With Raspberry Sorbetbased on their recommendation. Although she admitted she had no idea what to expect from the pudding, Gordon Ramsay certainly didnapost disappoint. It was super light and fluffy, and the flavour was incredible. The raspberry sorbet was smooth and refreshing, a perfect match to the flavours in the cheesecake. The raspberries were soft and full of flavour, and the crumb and chocolate sauce completed the dish. Overall Phoebe thoroughly enjoyed her meal at the Liverpool Bread Street Kitchen  Bar restaurant, and unlike many of Gordonaposs customers, agreed that his prices were just right due to the delicious food, friendly staff and relaxing atmosphere.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

During their visit, there was a . magnitude earthquake in neighbouring Myanmar - and even though it was a long way from where they were staying, tremors were felt in the park.Royal reporters covering the tour were just checking into their hotel when the earthquake hit. And Katie Nicholl, who was part of the group, previously told Yahooaposs Royal Box: We were checking into our hotel when the ground was literally shaking, trembling.

The chandeliers were shaking, we evacuated the hotel very, very quickly. The Duke and Duchess were out in a field, in a hut on stilts. It was a terrying moment for them. William needed a stf drink after that, as did Kate. A spokesman for the couple confirmed the couple were safe and well shortly afterwards, and the tour continued as planned. Last night, William and Kate were welcomed in Belize on the first day of the tour of the Caribbean.On the week-long trip, they will also visit Jamaica and the Bahamas and hope to meet as many people as possible.Speaking when the tour was announced, a Kensington Palace spokeswoman said: “Their Royal Highnesses are very much looking forward to the visit, which will be their first joint official overseas tour since the onset of Covid- in .” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Kate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgeRoyal FamilyPrince William\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Later this year Scotland Yard will bring Operation Grange - which was launched four years after Maddie went missing - to a close. The decision to do so will raise questions about whether prime suspect Christian Brueckner will be charged with her disappearance.A source the Sun : “There are currently no plans to take the inquiry any further.“The end of the road for Operation Grange is now in sight. The team’s work is expected to be completed by autumn.”  As much as detectives will not continue to actively investigate, the case file could be reopenedthere are any further breakthroughs. Current funding for Operation Grand ends at the end of this month. A request for more money was recently submitted to the Home Office and it would take the operation until the end of September. In total, the cost of the operation will be around £million. Last year now outgoing Met commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said Operation Grange would continue until there was nothing left to probe.  Interest in the case was reignited in  when a German police investigation into Brueckner came to light. The -year-old is behind bars for offences including the  rape of a US widow in Praia da Luz – where Madeleine vanished two years later. German prosecutors said they have “concrete” evidence against him – and he is their only suspect in Madeleine’s case. But they also fear Breuckner has committed at least five other sex crimes, including the rape of an Irish woman, who was attacked in her Portuguese apartment in . Madeleine, three, vanished from an Algarve apartment in  while on holiday with her twin siblings and parents Kate and Gerry, of Rothley, Leics.In , Brueckner shared a string of sick messages with an undertaker, including some about snatching and imprisoning a toddler. The investigation into Brueckner is being led by German and Portuguese authorities, while the Met has been taking a background role. As of last summer German Police were only investigating Brueckner over the case. Last year they named Brueckner as the prime suspect in Madeleineaposs disappearance after phone records placed him in the resort on the night she vanished. The paedophile has accused prosecutors of bringing “shame” to the German legal system by making “scandalous” statements against him. In recent years the Grange team has been whittled down from  officers to just four detectives working under Det Chief Inspector Mark Cranwell. The McCanns are said to be aware that the Metaposs investigation is coming to a close. They have vowed that they will never stop looking for Maddie and may do so with money raised for Madeline’s Fund: Leaving No Stone Unturned. The fund currently has more than £, after liabilities.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Madeleine MccannCressida DickScotland YardHome OfficeCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

They included chef Claudia Lawrence who vanished  years ago this week.But the investigation has been stopped by Wiltshire Police, which has battled a series of budget cuts.The ex-detective superintendent who investigated Halliwell called the move “shocking”. Steve Fulcher said: “Halliwell murdered other people without any shadow of a doubt. “It’s incumbent on a police force to pursue an investigation into a known murderer and serial killer using the material that I gathered back in the day.“That includes  items of ­women’s underwear as part of a trophy collection.” His anger was echoed by missing Claudia’s mum Joan, from Malton, North Yorks. She said: “I’m horried, absolutely devastated. It is well known Halliwell is thought to be connected to so many more cases to close the investigation is appalling.” Halliwell, , is serving le for killing sex worker Becky Godden-Edwards, , and office worker Sian O’Callaghan, , who he abducted in Swindon.In  we revealed the existence of a cold-case review – codenamed Operation Major. But last night the force confirmed: “Wiltshire Police are not currently investigating any offences alleged to have been committed by Halliwell. Operation Major is not a live investigation.”Mr Fulcher – portrayed by Martin Freeman in an ITV drama about the case – fears Halliwell could be one of Britain’s worst serial killers.The cabbie was convicted of Sian’s murder in  and jailed for le. He sexually assaulted, strangled and stabbed her in a forest after she got into his taxi outside a nightclub.  During his arrest, Halliwell also told Mr Fulcher, now , about an earlier killing he had carried out and offered to show him the body. His admission took police to the remains of Becky, who had disappeared from the same town in . The head, hands and feet were never recovered and her mother Karen believes the monster kept them as trophies. Halliwell was sent down for her murder in , when a judge described him as “both calculating and devious”. But, between confession and conviction, Fulcher quit the police after a court ruled his actions during the arrest were wrong. It was decided that the detective had broken rules by failing to caution Halliwell. In  Wiltshire allocated just £, to Operation Major. It was led by Det Supt Jeremy Carter. The force refused to saythey have made any arrests or taken a single statement.

Joanne’s mother, Doreen Soulsby, wrote to Mr Raab and convinced him to use his personal powers to block a parole board decision for the first time. “It’s such a relief. All the effort and campaigning has been really worthwhile in the end, she told Chronicle Live.I donapost think anyone would believe that a killer like Ling would ever be considered to be moved to an open prison. I want him locked up for le. “He was only  when he murdered my daughter. He has had no chance to socialise or have relationships with women. I cannot believe he won’t pose a risk to womenhe went to an open prison. “He will come up before the parole board again, I am sure and I will have to face that when it happens. For the time being, though, I am relieved and delighted. Farm labourer Ling was jailed for le in  and told he would serve at least  years behind bars, after he raped and murdered Ms Tulip, carved crosses and swastikas into her body and set fire to it.He has applied for parole four times since then and during his latest hearing, in February, the board refused his request for release but backed a move to an open prison. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “The Deputy Prime Minister has rejected Steven Ling’s move to open conditions in the interest of public protection.” Mr Raab intervened in the Ling case after deciding that a justice secretary should personally rule on the transfer of high-risk offenders to open prisons rather than leave it to officials. It came after serial sex offender Paul Robson, also jailed for le, absconded from an open prison in Lincolnshire last month, just weeks after being moved from a secure jail.In her letter, Mrs Soulsby warned Mr Raab about the disturbing findings of a forensic scientist in the National Crime Faculty Unit who profiled Ling shortly after the murder. He was found to be a “piquerist” who “has a sexual interest in penetrating the skin with sharp objects”. Mrs Soulsby wrote: “What he did came out of his own head and was he not insane. Lingaposs head was wired in a way that when he came up against Joanneaposs fight against him he sadistically raped and murdered her and did terrible things to her body both before and after death. He is only  years of age now and has missed  years of his young le being in prison. Because of this,he were released even in to open prison, he would target women even on day release, socialise with them, and his sexual appetite having been restrained in prison, would take over his control of the situation and would be a danger to women. You cannot apostestapos a prisoneraposs readiness like Ling in open conditions for any potentialinto the community in future for fear another young woman being attacked and murdered in the same way as my daughter Joanne.

The day after Tanya Simpson took her own le her family were informed that she couldaposve been reunited with her estranged kids. The -year-old, whose body was found on March  at her Northfield, Birmingham home, had left notes for her nine-year-old daughter and son, aged four, her family said, Birmingham Mail reported. One read: “I love you, I cannot cope without you.” The family had been split up after sheaposd gone to school with a shallow scratch on her face. Do you have a story to share  Email webnews@mirror  Police were called and Tanya admitted that she’d accidentally caused the minor injury while cradling the child’s face. Birmingham Childrenaposs Trust decided to take the girl and her brother because of the injury and concerns they had over Tanyaaposs mental health, a document in the familyaposs possession shows. Her daughter was placed with grandparents Ed and Linda, and her son with his father. Tanya had access to them twice a week. Prior to that, there had been no social services involvement over the youngsters’ care, her family insist. Tanyaaposs loved ones want to know why the children were taken away so swtly. Fighting back tears, sister Kimberly said: “I can’t help but hate them. They don’t realise what they’ve done to my family, what they’ve done to the kids. You can see the pain in the little boy’s face. They tore those children apart. How can you split up two kids who have been together for so long  “Mum and dad have lost their baby daughter. To add to their pain, they received a call the day after to be told it had been decided Tanya could have her daughter back.A social worker dealing with the case told my mum a meeting had been set to change the plan so she could move back with her mum. We can’t understand why the children had separate social workers.” She added: “If my sister was not an unemployed single mum,she had the money to pay for a lawyer, this would not have happened. If we’d had the money to pay for a solicitor, this would not have happened. Kimberly claimed her sister told social workers and police, who decided to take no action over the scratch, that she would kill herself.  Paperwork relating to the case shows that Tanya made efforts to get the children back. She underwent hair-strand and other tests to show she was drug and alcohol free, and attended an anger management course. “She was a great mother,” said -year-old Kimberley. “She lived for her kids, she would never hurt her kids. My sister never had a drink problem. She had a problem with emotions and would turn to drink, but that was when she was  and . “And that was the problem. What they added to Tanya’s plan happened when she was a teenager. What happened was an accident. She was getting her daughter ready for school and she was not listening to her mum. Tanya put her hands on her face and accidentally scratched her. She had very long nails. “The police said they may charge her, but dropped the case. We’re angry about the time they took to make that decision. What social workers were saying did not make sense. I can see the heartbreak in my sister’s face. Twice a week she got to see her children at her mother’s home. She couldn’t take the pain. The only time my sister was happy was when she was seeing her kids. Kimberley said she was the last person to speak to her sister. She told me she couldn’t cope without her kids, she recalled. I said, ‘there’s always hope’ and she told me, ‘you don’t understand - I can’t live without my kids’. She couldn’t cope without her kids.” Kimberley believes the case was delayed because it was passed from one social worker to another. An inquest is to take place over the death, but the family have said that Tanya took her own le. Kimberley revealed that her sister rang emergency services and told them what she’d done. An ambulance arrived at pm, but it was some time before police could gain access to the property. Tanya’s father, -year-old Ed, said: “It is asit’s not real. She did speak about it , she tried to do it, but no one would listen. We went to the doctors and it was like talking to a wall. She was a good mother, it was an accident, but it was like talking to a wall. We were pushed from pillar to post. No one we turned to would listen. A spokesman for Birmingham Children’s Trust, responsible for child care in the city, said: “Whilst we cannot comment on inidual cases, we do extend our condolences to the family following this tragic event.” Tanya’s funeral will take place at Lodge Hill Cemetery and Crematorium on March .*The Samaritans are available  you need to talk.

She had started having headaches, fever and stomach pain in September last year, Birmingham Live reports. On her visit to the hospital, doctors found the Newtown, Birmingham girl was in fact suffering from a rare brain condition. Doctors checked her after a two hour wait, but she would die several days later after developing fluid in her brain from acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. An investigation found there were gaps in her care, including a delay in admitting her to the intensive care unit and delays in seizure control.  Paying tribute to his daughter after her inquest, Mohamoud Hussein said: Over the last few months, the passing of Maryama has been extremely painful for us to deal with as a family. Her unexpected death has left a massive hole in our lives. Maryama was only with us for a short time but she made us the happiest people in the world. She was just wonderful and creative and she was beautul inside and outside. She was the sweetest, most caring child you could ever meet. She will forever be missed dearly by everyone that loves her. Maryamaaposs family said they want to ensure mistakes are not repeated with anyone  receiving care at the hospital, and that they want lessons to be learned. He added: We were perplexed, they did admit there were failures but there was no causal link between the mistakes that were made and her passing away. Obviously, it wonapost bring Maryama back, but we understand. We still live in Birmingham and we want the hospital to make sure this doesnapost happen to anyone . The mistakes that were made should be lessons for the hospital and the trust.Maryamaaposs family said she was a happy, fit and sociable girl before she developed apostummy bugapos symptoms, including vomiting and headaches. When they tried to book her a GP appointment on September  they were told she could not be admitted to the surgery because her high temperature might mean she had Covid.Following the appointment Maryama was admitted to the Emergency Department of Birmingham Children’s Hospital. There she displayed the same symptoms as well as bouts of unconsciousness and seizures. In her initial triage, she was aposincorrectlyapos assessed as being well enough to wait, the inquest was told. She was eventually treated for acute disseminated encephalomyelitisand given antibiotics to cover the possibility of bacterial infection of the central nervous system. However, her condition had deteriorated the next day and the young girl started suffering further seizures and bouts of unconsciousness. After the symptoms abated for a short while, they came back on October  and Maryama was transferred to an intensive care unit. Her parents had a meeting with the hospital to discuss their concerns and were told that an internal investigation would be performed because of the delay in admitting Maryama to ICU. Shortly after an unsuccessful attempt to perform a brain stem test, the young girl was pronounced brain dead, and her devastated parents gave their consent for le support to be terminated on October . The internal investigation into Maryama’s treatment highlighted failures in the triage system, the ICU admission system and delays in seizure control. Following the inquest family solicitors Shoosmiths said: “We welcome the above acknowledgement of failings in care but will be closely considering Maryama’s cause of death with our own experts and commissioning an independent report. “We will be continuing with our investigations given the severity of the errors and the changes to practices and procedures that are being considered by the trust at the moment. We hope that these changes will prevent a similar outcome for another family.” Birmingham Childrenaposs Hospital has vowed to act following the gaps in Maryamaaposs care. Dr Fiona Reynolds, the Chief Medical Officer, said: “We would like to share our sincere sympathies with the family at the sad death of Maryama and reassure them that we will act on what they have told us we could have been done dferently in her care.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HospitalsInquestsTributes\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But the Home Secretary is reviewing his immigration status and he has been subject to immigration bail conditions and restricted leave to remain.” The Home Office said: “Safety and security is the first priority and the police, security and intelligence agencies have a range of powers available to manage iniduals.”  Scotland Yard declined to comment.

Professor Roger Kirby, president of the Royal Society of Medicine, has suggested the government may be forced to take some preventative actionthe numbers continue rising. He said that the country was not out of the pandemic yet, and that the government should not risk being complacent.  When it came to the question of a third full lockdown, Professor Kirby believes the population at large would not accept it. Locking down people again, I don’t think people would tolerate it again, he told Mail Online. There would be riots like there were in Belgiumthey tried to do that. In November last year large demonstrations against coronavirus restrictions in Brussels turned violent. Stones were thrown by demonstrators calling for the lting of measures put in place against the Omicron iant, despite Belgium being among the worst hit by coronavirus in Europe.  In the UK anti-lockdown protests never reached such a high octane. The closest things got to bubbling over was in December  when thousands of protesters have marched through London to voice their anger over the then latest Covid restrictions. Crowds assembled in Parliament Square as part of a Freedom Rally against vaccine passports and other virus rules. Demonstrators shouted shame on you as they clashed with police.Some officers suffered minor injuries while escorting a police motorcyclist through the area.As much as the conflict in Ukraine had erted attention away from the pandemic over the past month, the threat of Covid- has not fully passed.Doctors are have warned about a new wave triggered by social mixing and the rise of a more transmissible iant of Omicron called BA.. At the moment case rates among the elderly are at a record high, with one in  people over  in England infected. Although the vaccine has helped to keep the impact of those infections lower than in  and the start of , hospitalisation rates are now rising again. There are currently about , Covid admissions a day across the UK - a % rise on this time a month ago. Last week medical experts warned the pandemic was not over yet on a global scale. World Health Organisation official Margaret Harris told a conference in Geneva on Friday that it was “far from over”, adding: “We are definitely in the middle of the pandemic.”  The current situation is being fuelled by the BA. mutation, which could be of the most infectious diseases the world has ever seen, according to Professor Adrian Esterman. The epidemiologist and biostatistican says the iant is up to six times more transmissible than the original strain of Covid - and we can expect most people to catch it.While it is less deadly, BA. is a mutation of the Omicron iant of coronavirus and now accounts for the majority of new infections in the UK.BA.aposs R number, the rate at which it can spread, is , compared to . for the original virus.

The UK saw the hottest day of the year so far on Saturday, when temperatures peaked at °C in the village of Kinlochewe in northern Scotland.The Met Office said it will be breezier and colder today, with cloudy conditions in parts of the South West, but the mercury levels will begin rising again next week.According to the forecaster, London will see clear skies and top temperatures of around °C on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. BBC forecaster Chris Fawkes said the weather “is going to get a lot, lot warmer” next week. “As the southerly winds continue to push northwards through Tuesday and Wednesday, those temperatures are going to surge signicantly, he said. “Tuesday - a fine day with some sunshine - maybe a few isolated showers developing through the afternoon but most of you will have a dry day though. “Temperatures will reach a high of °C in London, °C in Glasgow and °C in Belfast.  “The fine weather with prolonged spells of Spring sunshine, for many of us will last for much of the weekend, with temperatures on the warm side for the time of year.” Met Office meteorologist Dan Stroud said Sunday will be cooler, with top temperatures of around °C in the south of England. He added: “High pressure continues to dominate into the new working week, with fair amounts of cloud and temperatures increasing during the course of the week.”  It comes after weather forecaster Jim Dale told the Express that next month temperatures are expected to reach °C - the Met Office’s threshold for a heatwave.I wouldn’t be surprised to see °C, °C, °C in the middle of April,” he said. “Longer-term, given what’s happening globally in terms of the temperature profiles in the southern hemisphere and what’s also happening in the United States, I would not be surprisedwe started to see some big highlights - in whichever direction it goes, either cold or hot. Five-day forecastSunday: Most parts dry with good spells of sunshine. Cloudier at times over East Anglia and far southeast England where a little showery rain is possible. Breezy and colder than today. Monday to Wednesday: Chance of a few isolated showers, otherwise widely fine and dry with plenty of sunshine after some early mist and fog. A cold, frosty start on Monday before turning warmer.

The bizarre project, designed to connect his shed to his house, is the brainchild of inventor and YouTuber Colin Furze. He has worked on the remarkable back-breaking project for months removing an astonishing three-and-a-half tonnes of rubble a day. The -year-old, whose digging videos have each attracted more than six million views, has now finally connected the tunnel to his house in Lincolnshire and says it one of the most enjoyable projects he has ever done.He said: “It’s been one of the most talked about projects on my channel. “It’ a very cool project, everyone likes the idea of digging tunnels”, said Colin. “I do the projects that people really want to do but don’t have the time or money to actually make happen..  “I’m very lucky as it’s quicker to open my back door and walk to my shed, but it’s much more fun to use an underground tunnel and it means you don’t get wetit’s raining.” Colin started the tunnel under his shed floor in November  and it took him around a year to dig down to three-and-a-half metres deep, working on it when his neighbours were out so it wasn’t too noisy. He used a shovel and a bucket with a pulley system to hoist the rubble out of the hole as it got deeper.  He re-started the tunnel in March last year, using hydraulics to dig sideways through the earth and rock and aided by his mates Rick Simpson and Tom Lamb. As the tunnel got longer Colin even built a small mine cart and track to help transport the rubble out of the hole. He explained: “We had to dig the whole thing by hand as the tunnel goes underneath the foundations of my shed, garage and house. “It was very hard work but also one of the most enjoyable things I have ever done.  “We wanted to keep the noise down for my neighbours so used a shovel and hydraulics, which were really quiet.” The tunnel, which is . metres wide and two metres high and comes up in a cupboard in Colin’s kitchen, has been reinforced with steel and concrete. Colin, who is renowned for his inventions, including the world’s fastest mobility scooter and a drivable hot tub car, added: “It’s very spacious in the tunnel, everyone who visits wants to try it out.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Gardening\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In the lead up to their wedding and in the early months of their marriage, he stood at her side to guide her through official engagements, charity outings and private meetings with the Queen and the rest of The Firm. But according to body language expert Judi James, a subtle hand gesture from Meghan Markle proved Harryaposs role as guide and protector is now over and the tide has changed in their relationship. In their infamous interview with Oprah Winfrey, the couple sat side by side on garden chairs as they detailed their version of le within the royal family.  Meghan made accusations of racism and said the Duchess of Cambridge made her cry, while Harry said his brother Prince William is trapped and claimed his dad Charles cut him off financially. And Judi told The Mirror that their hand gestures show that while Meghan appeared confident, Harry was not and needed his weaposs support. She explains: I think when Meghan came to the UK, Harry very much saw himself in the role of overly protective husband that knew that all hell was going to break lose in terms of press and public interest, and was desperate to protect her - albeit that she presented herself as a very confident woman. But I think the tide has completely changed looking at the Oprah Winfrey clip. Now she seems to have taken a much more vulnerable Harry back to the US with her and she seems to be more in the role of rescuer and protector with him. This hand gesture that you can see, heaposs got his hand on the chair and sheaposs placed her hand on top.Thataposs almost a maternal looking gesture, itaposs though itaposs being used for reassurance and to let him feed off her confidence. Clearly sheaposs friends with Oprah, sheaposs used to being in front of the cameras sheaposs an actress, but to Harry this is a whole new world that heaposs being judged by and being asked to perform. And it sounds from the clip as though heaposs going to rip his soul out in front of the camera and tell us about everything. According to Judi, Meghan is sitting with a pit-bearing gesture which shows she is confidence. She explains: Meghan is just sitting there looking very demure, very regal I would say, very elegant. Sheaposs got the upturned V gap underneath her armpit which shows a confidence. When we feel like weaposre being bombarded with dficult questions or weaposre not comfortable women in particular tend to self-diminish, we bring out arms in. But with Meghan sheaposs got that super self-controlled, confident image going on here. However Judi believes that Harryaposs body language tells a very dferent story, saying it suggests he needs that support from his we. She said: Harry on the other hand is much less self-assured. He is sat diagonally and he kind of looks a lot more awkward. Highlighting that Harryaposs hand was on his crotch, Judi added: He is doing a male pose, heaposs got his hand between his legs. Itaposs called the fig leave pose, it is a very self-protective gesture. She highlights how dferent his body language is to when he was interviewed by James Corden. Here he looks way more guarded and a lot more uncomfortable and very much in need of that hand clasp that heaposs getting from Meghan.

Not only that, itaposs the largest designated area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in the country, so when many foreign tourists come to the UK, the Cotwolds is high on their bucket list.The majority of tourists flock to the idyllic villages to soak up the quaint charm, stunning sights and everything the area has to offer, but it turns out that some American visitors have been left less than impressed, MyLondon reports.Take for example Linnbada from Nevada, who took one look at Castle Combes - commonly cited as the most beautul place in the Cotswolds - and decided to give it a miss.  We were going to walk the town but after we saw what little it had to offer besides a steep walk down the hill to get there and the , we decided we would pass and wait for the Cotswolds, she said, oblivious to the fact she was already in one of the most famous parts of the Cotswolds. Meanwhile, TripAdvisor user hickss from Texas also got a bit confused, specically with the name Castle Combes. There is NO CASTLE in Castle Comb, they said. No castle but there are remains of a castle, but you wonapost see it. It is overgrown and on private property.

BobKonecny from Alabama wasnapost a fan of how quiet Castle Combe was, writing: After a long walk from the car park up on a hill on a Wednesday afternoon, the village appeared to be closed. The short section of main street that was shown in War Horse is very attractive, but is that all there is  The one pub that was open seemed to have the only townaposs activity. Any rural Brit will tell you that pubs are, in fact, the centre of town activity, and to be honest, what more could you possibly want  One particularly disappointed American couldnapost even imagine why people would go there: The walking tour suggests you aposimagine what it was like  years ago when...apos I guess we didnapost have enough imagination to find Stow worth the time. But they must love the gardens at least, right  The Cotswolds being an area Outstanding Natural Beauty and all... Nope. Alcove from New York was excited to see the landscaped garden of the private residence of Their Royal Highnesses The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall when visiting Highgrove Gardens but was disappointed. Although Prince Charles has  gardeners it appeared ashe needed many more, they mused. Ouch.

The teenaposs account, @isseypovs, is simply made up of accessible apospoints of viewapos which lots of other teenagers find themselves relating to.Speaking exclusively with the Star, Issey spoke about how she managed to gain so many TikTok followers in a short period of time: I knew what was doing well at the time, so kind of followed that. I started a brand new account and began posting POVs, where you make up a story and match it to a song. I also made sure I mixed up my content quite a lot. Describing her content, Issey explained: I post a lot of relatable content that other teens can identy with. Thataposs why most people follow me I think. I share things about mental health, stuff at home, and just talk about stuff a lot of teens go through. With her online fame happening so fast, and at such a young age, the TikToker spoke about how sheaposs coped with her new-found popularity. Because I got a lot of followers in lockdown, I wasnapost really aware of how many people were seeing my videos, she admitted. People didnapost come up and ask for a photo, theyaposd just say hi, like a friend would.The youngster confessed some of her pals have found her new popularity a bit dficult though: Some of my friends were confused about it. I also couldnapost see them as much as I didnapost have as much free time, so that was a big change. Issey says her dad has been great about her social media stardom though, describing him as really supportive. When it comes to her online followers, Issey admits sheaposs had her fair share of hate although she thinks it may be because of her age. I do get quite a lot of hate. But itaposs not because Iaposm actually doing anything wrong. I think itaposs because of my age. People often treat me like theyaposd treat a friend in school, she said. They often think they know more about my le than they do, so they give opinions on my le that Iaposm not necessarily asking for, which can come across a bit aggressive. They forget theyaposre not my friend in real le.She says she never blocks anyone though as she thinks everyone is valid to their own opinions. Issey admits she does have a bad habit of answering back to trolls sometimes though: If they say a video is boring, I just tell them that they donapost have to watch it.When it comes to earnings from her social media accounts, Issey, who also boasts , on Instagram, says she doesnapost actually make any money from her TikTok.I donapost get money for getting a certain number of views or anything. I would feel wrong for it, the teen said. I donapost like getting gts online too as it makes me feel guilty. Issey instead says she gets money from brand deals. However, she says she only works with companies she actually likes or thinks her followers will like. She said: You can definitely make a living wage from it, depending on your lestyle. You can  percent you can live off it. Iaposve already moved out at . With such success, we asked Isseyshe would recommend the social media lestyle to other people her age. She admits she would have probably waited until she was older in hindsight. The star explained: I did start quite early on. If Iaposd have got to choose when I started, I would have started a little bit older. You canapost make mistakes on social media, so you have to mature a lot more than you would at that age. I wouldnapost recommend the lestyle to other people my age, just because of how much it can affect some people mentally. You really need to separate the what people you donapost know say to you from what people who do know you say. Despite social media being Isseyaposs main job right now, sheaposs hoping it can open more doors to other opportunities when it comes to her career down the line. Her dream job would be a runway model, which she has just started looking in to. She added: Iaposve always really wanted to do it since a young age, but I know itaposs quite hard to get into it.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Many do this by flooding their social media pages with glamorous photos and selfies to show their ex what theyaposre missing. But this plan is often scupperedthe ex decides to block or hide their account.After finding herself in this position, social media star Andrea Russett believes she found a way around it - claiming itaposs the ultimate form of revenge.Andrea, who has .m followers on Instagram, splashed out £ promoting photos of herself on the  so her snaps appeared on her exaposs timeline. Sharing her plan on TikTok to the sound of Patsy Clineaposs hit song Crazy, she wrote: The time I paid  [£] to have a selfie of myself promoted on Instagram directly to my exaposs demographic so he had to constantly see my face.Her fans were quick to praise her creative idea in the comment section. One wrote: I wish Iaposd thought of this after my last relationship. Another added I admire you for that moment, always lmao while a third wrote: This is crazy, how do I do it  Others were keen to try her cheeky idea herself, with one commenting: Me struggling to pay last monthaposs rent but still would do this.While Andreaaposs plan may have caused some upset, it probably didnapost do much long term harm - but one woman decided to get her revenge by spilling his work secrets to his boss. While working from home during the pandemic, the man worked out a way to shorten his working day from his paid eight hours into just two by using a database to do the calculations for him rather than working it out himself. This meant all he had to do was edit the workings out together. The man said he shared this info with his girlfriend, who worked at the same company, but then they broke up and she used it against him - sharing his screen with his boss and revealing how much time he spent slacking off.Taking to Reddit, the man said: After some time I broke up with her, we tried our best but I wasnapost feeling it as much as she was and I felt it would be better to end it sooner than later. The breakup seemed somewhat peaceful.Two days later I got called into HR at work for a disciplinary hearing. To my horror, I was presented with screenshots of my activity of the previous days: memes, trading activity, news reading, YouTube and even a tally of how many hours I actually worked vs how much I wasted. Turns out my ex shared my screen via Microsoft Skype when I went on a smoke break, recorded all my actions for the day and then reported me to HR. I shouldaposve actually worked my hours in, I shouldnapost have tried to impress my ex, and I definitely should have noticed my screen was being shared. The man went on to say that he almost lost his job because of the incident, but luckily he just hung onto it.Do you have a story to share  Email yourmirror@trinitymirror.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Relationships\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Frederick Payne went out to eat in Hampshire with a pal who kindly treated him the £ meal, but he was left questioning the kind gesture when it arrived. Sitting on the grey plate next to all the normal fry up items were slices of fruit and some rocket. The melon, pineapple, grapefruit and orange are beautully sliced and arranged in order of side, meanwhile the rocket is mixed with pomegranate. Do you think this is an acceptable breakfast  Have your say in the comment section below. Taking to Twitter to share his outrage, Frederick said: My mate thought that buying me breakfast in this place would be a good idea #traumatised.He later added that was now reevaluating the friendship, saying: £ in Hampshire this was, luckily my now ex-mate paid for it.

But settling the age-old sauce argument, ketchup was the most popular condiment, with  per cent saying this is a key ingredient in a cooked breakfast, compared to just  per cent who go for brown sauce. It also emerged the average Brit tucks into an English breakfast twice a month - and more often at home than in a cafe. Francesca Woodward, spokesman for High Street TVaposs QuadraPan, said: Itaposs great that our results show how much people love tucking into a classic English breakfast. And we were also pleased to see that people prefer to make them at home, rather than heading out to a caf or restaurant. This way, people can be sure of exactly what quality of ingredients and equipment is being used to make breakfast just the way they like it. The Full English is most often enjoyed on the weekend, with two thirds tucking in on a Saturday or Sunday morning - with Tuesday the least popular day. Toast was twice as popular as fried bread as an accompaniment while grilled tomatoes were preferred to fried - although one in four prefer theirs without tomatoes at all. Fried eggs were the most popular choice, with a whopping  per cent of the vote - leaving scrambled behind on only  per cent.

One man did exactly that, by turning to his older sister and asking for help paying for his wedding, which she was happy to oblige. However, the man is now being heavily criticised, after it was revealed he has since uninvited his sister from the celebration altogether - but still expects her to pay, According to their mum, the siblings - -year-old John and Rita, , get on fairly well, but arenapost particularly close, despite the fact Rita has financially taken care of the family for a number of years. Ever since my husband passed away, nearly a decade ago, Rita has stepped up and taken care of all of us financially. Sheaposs funded a huge portion of Johnaposs le and helped him get a job without debt. Sheaposs let me live with her in her house and is very, very soft-spoken and calm, the mum wrote on Redditaposs AITA forum.Her son John recently proposed to his long-term girlfriend Sam, and theyaposve already started making plans for their wedding - making it clear they expect Rita to help them out with it financially, as theyaposre saving up for a house and to later have children. As Sam has a huge family, theyaposve already taken up a big proportion of the guestlist, and John has been forced to reduce the name of guests on his side, which his mum says is no issue for her or Rita. However, her future daughter-in-law recently discovered that one of her long-lost childhood friends would be in town at the time of wedding, so she wanted to invite her. However, with the venue already full to capacity, they had to choose one guest to uninvite from the wedding to make room for her, and the couple recently announced that person would be Rita.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.

Her son and his future we have since been shouting at her, telling her that sheaposs turned Rita into an egotistic loser, despite the fact his sister has already given them an engagement and wedding gt, prompting the mum to tell him sheaposs done her part and that childhood friend could cover the expenses. Since sharing the story online, other Reddit users have been quick to blast John and Sam for being so ungrateful for Ritaaposs efforts. Sam is showing your family how controlling she is. Shame on your son for throwing his very generous sister under the bus, one Reddit user commented. You did right. It’s hard to know when to speak up, but Rita was getting bullied and she, as such a giver, needed your support. Another agreed: Your son is very wrong for how he is doing his sister. It is amazing that she was able to step up and help you both out when she didnapost have to. Itaposs a huge shame that her brother is doing her this way and treating her like this. She shouldnapost have to pay a damn dime towards their wedding, and donapost you dare let her. He and his we are very entitled.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

The couple agreed it was important to them for one parent to stay at home as they both had absent parents due to work and felt neglected in their childhoods, so wanted to ensure it would be dferent for their own kids.We decided Iaposd be the parent to stay home because he has a much higher paid job which is enough to support a family on, which Iaposm alright with it because having a parent at home is something thataposs really important to the both of us, the -year-old woman wrote on Redditaposs AITA forum.However, we made the mistake of not discussing the topic of prenups previously. He assumed because he comes from a rich family and has a highly paid job, Iaposd automatically understand that a prenup was expected. Whereas I didnapost expect anything because I genuinely forgot all about that topic, which was probably ditzy of me. I am just so in love with this guy and want to marry him that I didn’t think anything of the what--we-break-up situation which was naive of me, I know.

I come from a poor background so my parents wouldnapost be able to support me aside from letting me and my kid sleep on their -seater couch, which isnapost a good look for custody agreements, she continued. So I gave him a compromise that Iaposd sign the prenup but I wouldnapost quit my job to be a stay at home mum, but he still insists that I sign the prenup and be a stay at home mum. The woman then turned to Reddit to question whether she was justied in refusing to both sign the prenup and agree to give up her career. So he wants you to give up your financial independence in order to raise a family with him, but also wants to make sure youaposre not legally entitled to any of his wealth should things not work out  Absolutely to NOT sign this, one Reddit user commented. Another added: Be careful. Him wanting to leave you with nothing might be an indication of how heaposll feel about finances while youaposre married. If you’re going to be a stay at home mum, is he going to share finances and give you full control over money that youaposll need for yourself and the kids  Or is he going to act like itaposs all his money and you aren’t doing anything to contribute  Take care of yourself.

The Security Service of Ukrainesaid the troops, also known as Kadyrovites, had ed to Grozny, the capital of Chechnya. The organisation claimed that the soldiers had been pulled out after suffering large numbers of deaths in the first three weeks of the war.Reports of Chechen troops participating in Russiaaposs invasion of Ukraine began in the first days of the Russian invasion on February .On February  a video began circulating of Chechen servicemen hoisting a Russian flag on a military unit building in Gostomel, a village  kilometres northwest of the Ukrainian capital.  The Armed Forces of Ukraine authenticated the video, but denied the claims within it that they had fought off three Ukrainian advances - saying that the area invaded was empty at the time. A day later, three days after the invasion began, commander of the st Motorized Regiment of the Chechen Rosguard, General Magomed Tushayev, died.During efforts to land at Gostomel airport from February  and , several hundred Chechen fighters lost their lives, SBU intelligence officers say. A large column of what appeared to be Kadyrovites fighters and military machines was then filmed in Bucha, north of Kyiv.Subsequent video emerged of airstrikes being launched at it and the wreckage of many of the army vehicles. Ramzan Kadyrov, President of Chechnya, initially denied casualties among his fighters, but on February  he acknowledged the deaths of two Chechen servicemen, while not giving their names. Unfortunately, there are casualties among the natives of the Chechen Republic. Two died and six others were injured, he wrote on Telegram. Claims from both sides regarding lives lost and the current location of troops are dficult to very, given the contested area in which the Chechens were operating. According to SBU counterintelligence, on March , the Kadyrovites were evacuated from the territory of the Kyiv region via Belarus and further by air to Chechnya. At the same time, Kadyrov announced that he was sending a thousand more of his fighters to Ukraine.  Footage that has emerged in the last few days suggests that there are at least some Chechen fighters still involved in the invasion. On Tuesday, Kadyrov announced that his fighters were leading the attack on the city of Mariupol, having entered Ukraine from the east. He published a video which showed a number of soldiers firing at the upper floors of a building that had been hit by an airstrike, before they are seen appearing to help people evacuate.Ukrainian troops have taken to taunting the Chechens, who come from a predominantly Muslim part of Russia.Ukraine’s National Guard posted a video of fighters from the Azov Battalion, some members of which were accused of committing potential war crimes by the United Nations in , greasing bullets in pork fat and warning them to go home.

This is despite dominant British company Reckitt - maker of Durex and other brands - continuing to trade in the country even while slamming the war in Ukraine as “unconscionable”.The country’s largest online retailer Wildberries saw condom sales jump  per cent in the first two weeks of March compared with last year. Major pharmacy chain . reported a  per cent rise in sales. Overall, there has been a  per cent boost in the value of chemist condom purchases compared with a year ago.And supermarkets said their sales were up  per cent, reported RBC. Yesenia Shamonina, co-owner of the Prezervativnaya sex shop, said: “People are buying for the future, despite the fact that we were forced to raise prices.” Costs to the consumer had risen by up to  per cent depending on the brand, she said. Outlets are forced to pass on price increases caused by the sinking value of the Russian rouble against key Western currencies.This was due to collapsing confidence in Vladimir Putinaposs economy after he launched the invasion of Ukraine. An industry source said that while Latex comes from countries which are not applying sanctions, they must buy in Western currencies which are now far more expensive . The rush on condoms was so great that Putin’s Ministry of Industry and Trade was forced to issue a denial that there would be long term problems. “A shortage of this product is not predicted,” insisted officials. “The largest producing countries - Thailand, India, South Korea, and China - have not stopped deliveries of products to the Russian Federation.” Traditionally, Russia imports  million condoms a year, and produces  million.Reckitt employs around , people in Russia and makes in the region of £ million annually in this market. “As the situation continues to evolve, we will continue to take action and respond, always acting with the appropriate duty of care to our employees,” said the company in a statement. Sexologist Yevgeny Kalgavchuk urged Russians to use “good condoms” from “friendly countries” rather than those made in Western markets imposing sanctions. Business expert Pavel Spichakov said that  per cent of the condom market in Russia is owned by foreign companies. “An English company Reckitt, which produces the brands Durex, Contex, Hussar and others, accounts for over  per cent of it,” he said. He did not expect Reckitt to leave despite the walkout of Russia by other Western firms. “There is no hope that the company will voluntarily leave the Russian market,” he said. Butthey were forced out, Russia could boost its own production, he said.

General Sir Mike Jackson said the world was now in “unchartered territory” and that he is increasingly fearful nuclear weapons will be used on people once again. When asked directlyhe feared the Ukrainian conflict would lead to a global war, he said: “I can’t rule it out. I find that very hard to say. The situation is now very delicate in terms of east west and its future. Its uncharted territory. We havenapost, thank God, seen nuclear weapons used since . But I honestly can’t say with confidence we can survive another century without such use.”  Sir Mike went on to urge the Prime Minister to “play the long game” as he continues to try and support Ukraine. He told GB News: “Strategically we have to continue on the road we have now set out to assist Ukraine, short of offering military presence in the air or the ground.I am content with that argument. We have to continue ostracising Vladimir Putin while remembering our dispute isn’t with the Russian people. They, in the long term, are in as much danger from Putin as the rest of the world. We must play it long. Old points of contention in the West, socially, politically, should now be overshadowed by the strategic importance of getting this right.” His comments came on a weekend when the Russian forces appear to have upped the intensity of their attacks on Ukrainian cities.  Earlier today, Mariupolaposs city council reported that an art school in the city, where about  people were sheltering, was attacked. A video has also begun circulating of the Russian military firing what appear to be thermobaric missiles from a launcher. The Russian missiles explode at a much higher temperature than most, and their blasts last longer than conventional weapons. The heat they produce can cause massive damage to internal organs and cause flash burns.It emerged this morning that Russian ships in the Black Sea and Caspian Sea launched cruise missile strikes on Ukraine and fired hypersonic missiles from Crimean airspace today and yesterday. One of the strikes destroyed a large fuel storage facility in the Nikolaev region in southern Ukraine, while another damaged a workshop used to repair damaged armoured vehicles. Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said that hypersonic Kinzhalmissiles were also fired from airspace of Crimea, the peninsula Russia annexed from Ukraine in . Russia also hit a Ukrainian military preparation centre where foreign fighters joining Kyivaposs forces were based. Since the invasion began on February , western countries have been unwilling to send troops into Ukraine for fear of it leading to a larger conflict. Putin has implied that Nato boots on the ground in Nato would lead him to launch a nuclear attack.

The annual event is a project from the United Nations in the hope of finding a happier, more compassionate world in one currently polluted by crisis, fear and hate. The campaign is coordinated by Action For Happiness, a not-for-profit movement that is made up of people from  countries. International Day of Happiness describes the purpose of its mission as boosting wellbeing. “With our world facing unprecedented challenges, wellbeing matters more than ever. “When we choose to take action to help others, they benefit, we benefit and we set an example of kindness that can ripple out into the world too.” The organisation says that the world has moved forward and views have changed - economic growth isnapost the only thing that matters any more. Instead ‘progress’ can now also be measured through increasing human happiness and wellbeing. The history of the International Day of Happiness  In , the UN general assembly made happiness a ‘fundamental human goal’ and adopted it as a formal resolution. It called for “a more inclusive, equitable and balanced approach to economic growth that promotes the happiness and well-being of all peoples”. The following year, in , the inaugural UN Conference on Happiness established a fixed date for the day - it was observed officially for the first time the following year, in . March  has been deemed the official date for the annual event, with all of the  member countries of UN approving the idea and agreeing that more should be done to prioritise happiness. The day centres on a belief that “we are a social species and we thrive when we’re closely connected to others”. Co-founder and Director of Action for Happiness, Dr Mark Williamson, said in : “This International Day of Happiness is more than just a fun celebration, it also reminds us all that the world is a better place when we connect with and care about the people around us.” In the past, events have focused on dferent ways of looking at happiness. In , the campaign focused on reclaiming personal happiness as opposed to the commercial image of happiness we all get blasted with on a daily basis. To do this, the campaign asked people to share their images of what makes them happy - by sharing pictures of peoples’ authentic happiness, it was hoped that people can get closer to it once again. Ways to help with International Day of Happiness The International Day of Happiness’s official page has suggested things people can do to help the cause and, hopefully, spread some happiness. They say you can share positive messages: “Spread ideas that promote peace, kindness and understanding, online and in real le.” Connect with people: “Reach out to people who you know are connected to a crisis and offer your care and support.” Give directly: “Donate to causes working on the front line of a crisis or find a way to help with local efforts.” How are you celebrating International Day of Happiness  Let us know in the comments below Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON United NationsBritish economy\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

From Knapdale, they headed up the west coast, sailing to Lewis and Harris before arriving at their final destination, Iona.Covering almost , miles in the series, they visit places of worship, from pagan stones to an early Christian cave and a contemporary mosque and Sikh temple. The journey tests the pilgrims not just spiritually, but physically too.TV celeb and comedian Scarlett Moffatt, , said: #At school, I spent a lot of time just reading books and on my own and so that’s how I got into faith really. It just felt calming. There’s almost a stigma attached to sort of being religious.#Whenever I would tell my friends, they’d laugh and I’d be like, #why is that funny # I believe in God, there has to be something that started all this.#I would describe myself as Christian, but not a strict Christian. I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#. The -year-old explained: #I think pilgrimage is about clearing out your mental closet by physical exertion and by spiritual conversation with yourself or,you believe it, then conversation with your God.#I know I come across as all sort of flouncy and floppy and rather cavalier, but I am capable of existing in the real world.#However, I don’t think I’ve walked so far not wearing Cuban heels.#Pilgrimage: The Road to the Scottish Isles will be screened on BBC Two and iPlayer in the spring with three one-hour-long episodes, and is a CTVC production."},{"url":null,"title":"shinty round up saturday march 5 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowThe new shinty season got up and running with goals galore across the country on Saturday March .Fort William  Kyles Athletic Kyles Athletic came from two goals down to earn a - draw with Fort William in their pm throw-up at An Aird.Kyles travelled with just  players following Robbie Macleod’s late call-off as former Lochcarron player Liam Arnott made his competitive debut for the Cowal outfit.Both keepers # Paul MacKay for Fort William and Kyles Athletic’s John Whyte # made good saves before the hosts took the lead on the stroke of half-time through Cam Stephen.Victor Smith made it - a couple of minutes after the re-start.Kyles got a goal a couple of minutes later through Arnott, his bouncing shot deceiving Paul MacKay.The goal lted Kyles and Conor Kennedy made it - with  minutes remaining, punishing the Fort defenders for not clearing their lines.Kyles laid siege on the Fort goal as they went all out to get the winning goal but to no avail.The sides were also playing for Drew Ferguson Memorial Trophy, won by Fort William after a penalty shoot-out.Inveraray  Glenurquhart Inveraray, relegated from the Premiership at the end of the  season, drew - with promotion hopefuls Glenurquhart at the Winterton.Both goals came in the first half, with Glenurquhart’s Conor Golabek netting on  minutes and Campbell Watt drawing Inveraray level on  minutes.Col Glen P Bute PThe meeting between Col Glen and Bute was called off on Saturday morning when the pitch at Glendaruel failed an inspection.Kilmory  Inveraray After winning the league in , Kilmory welcomed the Inveraray second team to MacRae Park.Joe Anderson got the Lochgilphead side off to a great start with a goal after  minutes, but Euan McMurdo’s th minute strike saw the score level at the break.Ewan Donnan scored what proved to be the winner on the hour for Inveraray.Strachur-Dunoon P Uddingston PThe match at Strachurmore between Strachur-Dunoon and Uddingston was postponed due to lack of pitch preparation time after recent wet weather."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week march 11 2022","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Who am I  What am I  Where am I  How am I  – questions of identity and some of the questions I was left asking when I left a recent meeting.That meeting was part of a world-wide movement – a movement that calls the peoples of the world to pray.Similar questions of identity were raised when I was asked to write ‘a piece’ for this newspaper.

I’ve looked forward to this date since we entered and it’s what I’ve been working towards. My aim is to defend my gold,possible, but I want to see how well I can do and give him [his dad] a good run for his money.“I’ve made a few changes to my training, my bike and my run style slightly so we’ll see how that all pays off, but I love racing at Oulton Park, it’s a really nice track, a lovely atmosphere, it should be a really good day of racing.”Preparing to defend his M- British title, Leahn added: “This time around it’s at the beginning of the year so it’s going to be interesting, especially as the fields are much deeper this year which is great because that’s what it should be for a British Championships. But I’m going there to try and defend my title, I’ve got a taste for it now after last year and then it’s building up to the Worlds and Europeans later in the year.”Reflecting on the moment they shared on the podium together, Leahn said: “It was such a proud moment to see Dylan on the podium and to be able to share it with him made it even more special.“You are focused on your own race and your own effort, and it can be hard to work out who is in which age group when you’re racing, so until you cross the line you never really know where you’ve placed.“So, to find out I had won and then to see Dylan crossing the line to win his age group was a really nice feeling, especially having seen all the training and hard work he put in last year. It was a nice surprise to be driving home with two gold medals in the car.”.removeLast year’s championships was Dylan’s first standard distance duathlon and his first experience of a British Championships.“I had raced at Oulton Park earlier in the summer, so I knew the track and I really enjoyed racing there,” Dylan said. “I felt a lot more confident in October than at the race in June, but it was a whole new experience for me because it was across a distance I had never raced before.“It was a lot of unknowns, a lot of guess work, but it was an amazing feeling to cross the line and to be told you’re British champion. To be able to stand on the podium with my dad was amazing.”Last year saw Leahn claim world bronze at the World Triathlon Duathlon Championships in Spain. Later this year he will be back in Spain for the European Standard Distance Duathlon Championships in September, when he will be joined on the GB Age-Group Team by Dylan for the first time.“I’ve had the opportunity to travel and compete in dferent places and meet so many dferent people at races who I genuinely call friends, and now seeing the development and progression of Dylan within the sport is fantastic,” Leahn said.“When Dylan was youngerI was doing a long run, he would cycle alongside me and then at the weekend we would both run. Now we’ll do sessions together, we train together after Dylan comes home from school or at the weekend, and we also compete against each other at cross country. I’m so proud of him to see how he’s come from someone who used to follow me around on the bike to now I’m following him, and that’s purely down to his own effort and determination.

Also standing by was the steamer Brora, which was bund for Belfast.The conditions were so bad from the point of view of visibility that the leboat had to receive bearings from the Brora and other ships by means of the Aldis signal lamps while ships’ searchlights assisted them in getting into position. For a time the ships could only see each other on the radar screen.Coxswain Duncan Newlands, who knows this dreaded part of the estuary like the back of his hand, edged his leboat in astern of the coaster and proceeded to begin operations, but at .am came this dramatic message over the leboat’s radio: ‘Arrived alongside casualty at .hours got rope aboard and commenced towing at . hours.‘Rope now parted. Returning alongside St Kentigern for further instructions.’There was a lull in the activities while the leboat resumed its operations. They tried again- without success.Then came the news at . hours – ‘St Kentigern Refloated.’The leboat has succeeded in its third attempt, against odds.The St Kentigern then proceeded to Campbeltown under her own power, while the leboat escorted her, but first it took in tow the coaster’s own leboat, which it had earlier lowered over the port side in case of an emergency.The Ardchattern also accompanied the Saint Kentigern to Campbeltown.Meantime, the two remaining ships, Lairdsdale and Brora, seeing their attendance was no longer required, sent a parting signal of good-luck to the coaster and continued on their respective passages to towards the Irish Coast."},{"url":null,"title":"information is key in kintyre","story":"Campbeltown-based Keeping it local CICis introducing the screens up and down the peninsula, including Tarbert and on the Isle of Gigha.A spokesperson for the community interest company said: #With the support of fantastic businesses all over we are able to provide up-to-date information on events, news, travel and destination areas to visit all around the area at the touch of a button.#The work we do is also supported by advertising on our screens while promoting your own business offerings.#The boards should be up and running by April, all being well.The aim of Keeping it local CIC is to support businesses, trades, services and events by collating information and bringing all that Kintyre has to offer under one roof # a one-stop-shop for the consumer and businesses.The Tarbert information boards are due to be located at One Fyne Deli and at The Gather restaurant."},{"url":null,"title":"island residents and friends have a happy 20th gigha day","story":"Celebrations were in full swing this week as residents on the Isle of Gigha marked  years of community ownership.After extensive community fundraising alongside securing grants and loans from Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the National Lottery, Gigha was purchased by the community for the sum of £m on March  .On this day the island was handed over to the Isle of Gigha Heritage Trusta day that is marked on the island every year as #Gigha Day#.To commemorate this -year milestone all Gigha residents and key island stakeholders were invited to watch Gigha’s eldest female resident Ina McNeill raise the island flag on Tuesday.This was followed by a display from the pupils of Gigha Primary School and a performance by the Kintyre Schools Pipe Band, who made the journey over from Campbeltown to attend.The Isle of Gigha Hotel then welcomed the guests for refreshments and to view a display of island memorabilia and photographs from the past  years.Since the buyout the permanent population of the island has grown from around  up to  residents.This has been achieved through housing renovations and new affordable housing, coupled with increased economic development.Gigha has several businesses which support employment on the island and IGHT now employs  people across its office, maintenance team, Achamore Gardens, new campsite, marketing, and ranger service.This includes two apprentices who are contributing to the restoration of Achamore Gardens.The trust is managed by a board of voluntary directors who are elected by the membership to develop the assets of the island and take forward plans and projects for the community.IGHT  retains ownership of the majority of the built and land assets of the island, worth over £m.Since the buy-out in  IGHT has renovated  houses as part of an ongoing investment programme, sold  plots for private self-build development, developed four wind turbines which help fund development, installed moorings and pontoon facilities, successfully marketed Gigha’s tourism assets as well as working to protect and conserve Gigha’s heritage and environment.One of the trust’s biggest challenges has been managing its financial position.The trust’s debt levels increased to £.m in  after taking out loans to deliver housing renovations.This debt burden is now reduced to £,, which has been achieved through asset sales and income from its renewable and trading companies.The trust has a number of projects underway including a new campsite, km of new and upgraded path networks, on-site and online heritage interpretation, five new housing units, and a -year restoration plan for Achamore Gardens.The trust is actively trying to reduce the island#s carbon footprint through  e-bikes for hire from the activity centre and is also soon to install the island#s first electric vehicle charging point."},{"url":null,"title":"leader march 11 2022 2","story":"So the Scottish Government remains adamant in its decision to ban creelers from the Clyde for the next two months or so.We#re not talking North Sea trawlers here that can go where in the interim.

Its kirkyard gives testimony to the thriving trades that existed here, and the personal struggles and tragedies of families who lived in harsher times.The Witches Stone in Spott I heard once that a minister not so long ago oversaw the recording of the graves, many of which are now worn by the sea winds which sweep over this beautul but exposed place.One gravestone is so worn by the weather a hole has appeared in its centre. I stood by it and hoped that the story it once told had been caught before the words finally vanished.I showed Suu the jougs which hang at the entrance to the kirk: a metal collar attached to the wall by a chain.Here its victims would be chained up, humiliating them and exposing them to the judgement of other members of the community who deemed themselves morally superior, or at least hoped their own transgressions would never be discovered.It was the poor, of course, who were subject to such humiliations, and women in particular, not the rich and powerful men who made the rules they set for others.As we stood by the kirk, I told Suu the well-kent tale of the Rev John Kello, who was minister at Spott after the Reformation.A memorial to the women ly executed as witches Despite his pious pontications and apparent high moral standards, he murdered his poor long-suffering we Margaret because of greed. He then tried to make it look like suicide.The fact he stood in the kirk, giving a sermon on morality, holding the Bible with the same hands which he had used, just an hour before, to strangle his we to death, is breathtaking in its horror and hypocrisy.But actually at the heart of this crime is misogyny, a contempt and hatred of women, which was, and is, far from unusual.Kello was eventually caught out and confessed that is the unusual part of the story, not the murder. Women regularly died at the hands of partners and, despite changes and progress, they still do.The jougs were just part of that system of misogyny, a terror of humiliation that dangled before them as they went to church, a reminder that they had a place set for them by men they best not challenge.I took a photo of the jougs and accidentally caught Suu’s shadow as well.The image seemed symbolic of the many women history has forgotten, or didn’t even notice, who remain unnamed shadows in the events catalogued by self-important men.Further down the road, there is another place which shows the final societal conclusion of this perception of women: the Witches’ Stone.Jougs at Spott Parish Church It stands on a site where, it is said, women were horribly executed for the trumped-up crime of witchcraft as late as .There is no space here to get into the debate about which women actually met their end here, and when, and what the evidence tells us.There are times that historical pedantry is promoted on this issue, usually by men, which ignores the very real horror of these events.Suffice to say, this is a location that bears the memory,not all the names, of many women who were persecuted by a system and ideology which had misogyny at its heart.There are statistics, of course: , accused of witchcraft in Scotland, the vast majority women, with evidence that more than , were actually executed, many in or from East Lothian.The real number will be more, and even then statistics don’t tell even half the story.Many of those accused who managed to avoid being ‘worrit’ at the stake will still have had their lives ruined in so many ways. They will have lived with the vilication and suspicions.None of these women were guilty of being witches who had made a pact with the Devil.That was nonsense.They were mothers, healers, midwives, grandmothers, poor servants, old women, young women, usually poor women many were convicted on evidence we would now recognise as compassion and care for others.They were victims of the misogyny cast in the iron of the jougs. Their real crime was being a woman.That’s why I support the move by the Scottish Government to have a full legal pardon for all those who suffered from the insane brutality of the witch hunts. Men were victims too, but it was overwhelmingly women.It’s not just about historical justice, it’s about recognising that while, thankfully, times have changed a lot, they still haven’t changed enough.Misogyny isn’t historical, it’s very current and very real today, all over the world, as well as on our doorstep.That’s why a national monument would be a good idea too, in addition to recognising the local memorials such as the one at Spott, and in my home town of Prestonpans.They need to be made accessible too, not tucked away on a dangerous corner of a road where there is no safe place to stand and remember.And let’s stop calling the women witches, because they weren’t what they were accused of being.And as we commemorate their persecution, let’s also celebrate their role in society, their bravery, their talents and contributions."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-1997-1972-1922","story":"THE school bell was ringing for the last time for Dunbar Grammar School’s headteacher, reported the East Lothian Courier on March , .Will Collin today walks through the gates of Dunbar Grammar School for the last time as headteacher.After almost  years in the senior post, and five years before that as assistant head, he is taking early retirement at the age of .Explaining his decision, Mr Collin said: “I feel I am ready for retirement and putting my feet up.”Born and raised in Eyemouth, he began teaching maths and physics at the high school there in .Five years later he moved to Arbroath before coming to Dunbar as assistant headteacher in .Following an -month sojourn as the deputy head of Selkirk High School in the early s, he ed to Dunbar in .Looking back over a career spanning three decades at the school, Mr Collin, who lives with his we Val in Rosebery Place, said: “The best part of the job is working with young people.”...and  years agoVandals created ‘a reign of terror’, told the East Lothian Courier on March , .A wave of vandalism in East Lothian recently was likened to a “reign of terror” by a county official this week.He said damage amounting to almost £, had been done to a pavilion in Prestonpans.“We are fighting a losing battle,” said Mr George B.

However, from time to time, for the vast majority of human societies its a sad reality that they would rather not think about, but sometimes tolerate.I do know too, as is abundantly clear in these dficult days that many people do not want to think through the consequences of the carnage of war. That’s a perfectly understandable reaction that I have some sympathy with, but only some.On Thursday evening I saw on TV, in common with millions of others, four or was it five tiny new-born babies. They were gasping, gurgling and thrashing as new-born do, but they were doing it in a basement in a war torn city. Horrying as that was, for me, as an anti-nuclear activist, worse was to come. I watched in horror as Thursday’s QuestionTime audience on BBC full of media-induced guilt and media-induced confusion continued in large numbers to entertain the potentially disastrous option of a no-fly zone over Ukraine.For those who still think my anti nuclear position is merely a subset of an alternative lestyle choice I suggest you consider what other, more establishment voices have to say.The Royal United Services Instituteis as establishment as it gets.On its open source section of its website is an article “A no fly zone would be ineffective, dangerous and a gt to Putin”. I commend to all of you who think that “rolling the iron dice” is a risk worth taking, though bear in mind that this time they are radioactive, with potentially a dferent species ending type of carnage.Bill Ramsay, Glasgow.RUSSIANS NEED TO HEAR THE TRUTHTHE biggest problem about the war in Ukraine is that it could happen again.Vladimir Putin’s ludicrous demand for the demilitarisation of Ukraine reflects a real need: demilitarisation of Russian state media and their straitjacket of lies. Most Russian people believe a fantasy world of Russia confronted by enemies waiting to strike.Russians do not need conquests. They need freedom to hear the truth. They would never elect a criminal like Putin again.The keys to the future are a working democracy and freedom of expression in Russia. Russia would be on its way to integration in Europe, to the immense benefit of Russians. Tim Cox, Bern, Switzerland.OUR SAFETY IS STURGEON’S DAY JOBIF the conflict in Ukraine escalates to nuclear war, then Scotland will be on the front line, yet Bob MacDougallthinks the most important elected politician in Scotland should stay quiet and concentrate on her “day job”. I would have thought the safety of Scots was her day job. Equally quaint is Alexander McKay’s nightmarish ramblingsthat the Scottish Government is “going helter-skelter …to shut down, or shut off all our own … gas and oil”. This will be Scotland’s gas and oil resources whose licensing and extraction is, and has been, entirely controlled from south of the Border for the last  years, but whose le span can now only be measured in a few decades. Scotland is a major exporter of energy in the form of gas, oil, with substantial and expanding amounts of electricity going to the UK and European grid. Scotland has no industrial interest in nuclear power, so it would be more enterprising to develop commercial tidal power, or green hydrogen production, and be cheaperto revive the proposed interconnector between Scotland and Norway, so that the complementary exchange of their vast renewable energy would be of benefit to them both.GR Weir, Ochiltree.NORTH SEA OIL WILL NOT SAVE USYOUR report on the Scottish Greens conference quoted Patrick Harvie as saying “war cannot justy more oil and gas production” . Crude coming out of the ground has not suddenly become more expensive to extract and refine. Demand falls as price rises, so price is reduced to increase demand, as the crude can’t be stored. Very soon the price at the pumps will be back to normal.Malcolm Parkin, Kinross.SAY NO TO ANY SAUDI DEALLAST Sunday Mohammed Bin Salman executed  men, in the largest mass execution in Saudi Arabia’s history. This is a brutal and shocking moment. Boris Johnson visited Saudi Arabia this week to beg for Saudi Arabian oil to replace Russian gas. We cannot show our revulsion for Vladimir Putin’s atrocities by rewarding those of Mohammed Bin Salman. I fear for the lives of every person on death row in Saudi Arabia  especially Abdullah al-Howaiti who was just  when he was arrested and tortured for a crime he couldn’t have committed, and Mohammed al-Faraj. who was arrested and tortured when he was just  for so-called “crimes” including going to his uncle’s funeral.Mr Johnson should refuse to buy oil from Saudi Arabia. We cannot be thinking of striking a new trade deal with a country that has just killed  people and that could murder many more at any point. Mohammed Bin Salman is making a statement. He thinks he can act with impunity. He thinks the world will stand by while he orders the murder of so many men, and publicly announces it. Mr Johnson must not trade oil for blood in our name.B McKenna, Dumbarton.NO INDEPENDENCE WITHIN THE EUTAOISEACH Michael Martin has told the Dublin parliament that the government “cannot” bring down diesel fuel prices, as they would like to do, “because of EU regulations”.This is one of the countries often put forward by the SNP as being “normal” and “independent” and “free”. Am I missing something By the way, I voted Remain in the Brexit referendum and wish the UK had stayed and have no axe to grind.

Although not responsible for the building, Glasgow City Council took the decision to order the evacuation for public safety reasons.  However, work was already due to get under way before then and the structure, which dates back to the s and was once a training centre for Church of Scotland ministers, was already covered in scaffolding to allow for essential work to go ahead after previous reports found stresses with stonework and that full refurbishment was required. Planning permission for refurbishment work was granted in December .And in January  police were called to the tower after crumbling stonework came crashing down on the pavement below.Residents were told they could be out of their homes for two to three months and as it reaches the halfway they are looking for answers.Dr Clayton, of the Park Action Group, said: “We were told movement sensors placed in one of the Towers had been triggered and the Tower was in danger of uncontrolled collapse.“The council says the building still poses a risk to le but will not release any engineering reports or provide any plan of action for its stabilisation or controlled dismantling.”Dr Clayton said residents have found it impossible to get back into their homes to assess any flood damage after the storm weekend.He added: “I need licences and permits for my daily job and others might need access for medicine for their children, but the council has been strong-armed about access. We still don’t have an update on what two to three months means.“We are extremely concerned and are running into insurance issues as our homes have not be occupied for more than  days andthat tower does fall down and we are not insured then who is liable  We have this huge sword of Damocles or Trinity hanging over us.“We want to know what is the plan of work and when will it be deemed safe to get back into our homes.”Read more: Revealed: Glasgow equal pay row strike dates are confirmedFellow resident and music producer Keith McIvor, of Optimo Music, said his livelihood is affected as his studio is in his home.Mr McIvor, who has worked with artists including Franz Ferdinand and the Manic Street Preachers, said: “After two years of not being able to work due to the pandemic, I now face continued uncertainty due to having no access at all to my music collection or studio equipment, both of which are essential for me to be able to work. I need to get my work out as my financial is desperate post pandemic I have a letime collection of records which are my livelihood. If the tower is so dangerous, then take it down.”  A Glasgow City Council spokesman said they had communicated regularly with residents affected by the exclusion zone around this dangerous building, but while the Trinity Tower is considered a dangerous building, as it currently is, the council is required to protect wider public safety by restricting access to the building.The spokesman added: “It should be understood that the timescale of two to three was given by the owners’ contractor once they had confirmed the scale and nature of the works they would have to carry out to make the building safe. We relayed this information to affected residents, and continue to work with the contractors to ensure people canhome as quickly as possible. Residents have absolutely been givenaccess to collect essential items, and again it should be noted that more regular visits are not feasible given the great increase in risk that this would entail.“The condition and maintenance of the Trinity tower is a matter for the owners of that building, and repair work instructed by them was already underway when our Building Standards team was alerted by their contractors, who were concerned about its condition.”A spokeswoman speaking on behalf of the design team, which includes the owners of the tower and their surveyors, told The Herald all media was being handled by the council as they had put a cordon in place.The spokeswoman declined to comment any further on the nature of repairs being carried out and how long this was likely to take."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13591039.jpg?type=article-full","title":"natalie-portmans-angel-city-side-kicks-off-future-football-female","story":"Fans’ nostrils have long been assailed by the stench of institutional corruption , their daily newspapers long filled with stories of compromise, self-interest and ineptitude on the part of governing bodies , their social media feeds choked with content posted by the pampered millionaires who play the Beautul Game. This stuff is decadent, idiotic, sometimes offensive, often emblematic of rank inequalities in society. Here I am, look at me: posing in my Ferrari , modelling a pair of £ headphones, showing the kids how you curl a free kick into the top left-hand corner only I’m using the family cat instead of a ball .And don’t get me started on the club owners, that rogue’s gallery of oligarchs, venture capitalists, consortiums and sovereign wealth funds whose acquisitions and reputations are managed and manipulated by expensive lawyers and PR companies – the sorts of people who don’t put ‘sports-washing a speciality’ on their websites or business cards precisely because that is exactly the service they offer.Sure, when you cast an eye over the Scottishlower leagues there are heartening examples of what are essentially community-run social enterprises, and yes they may be the rule rather than the exception. But the money, the power, the fans and the clout is at the top end, in the top leagues, with the top clubs and the top players.Like I said: football is depressing isn’t it A ray of light in all this is the women’s game. I first tuned in seriously during the  Women’s World Cup, after the national women’s team did what the men have failed to do this century and actually qualied. The Americans won, led by the inspirational Megan Rapinhoe .Since then the women’s game has grown in popularity, helped by increased exposure on television and in the media. Today young girls aspire to bend it like Beattierather than Beckham . When Raith Rovers tried to sign David Goodwillie, convicted of rape by a civil court in , it was the women’s team and the club’s most famous fan, crime writer Val McDermid, who brought attention to it by cutting ties with the club. If football still has a moral compass, it’s in the hands of the distaff side.Across the Pond is Angel City FC, a women’s team based in Los Angeles and set to play its first competitive match this weekend. Its sporting director is former England star Eniola Aluko , sister of ex-Rangers and Aberdeen player Sone Aluko. But it’s the owners which are drawing the headlines ahead of that historic first game. Chief among them is Hollywood star Natalie Portman, but the other co-owners include fellow actress Jessica Chastain and tennis legends Serena Williams and Billie Jean King. The aims, at their simplest, are to empower women, and to redefine how football clubs operate within the context of the communities they serve and the values of inclusion and respect they promote. And that,it works out, is not depressing in the slightest. Maybe theres hope for football after all."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13591558.jpg?type=article-full","title":"15-ways-help-butterflies-bees-garden","story":"The good news is that there’s something we can do to help them.“Gardeners,” Goulson says, “can help by making their garden more insect friendly. Avoid pesticides, grow some pollinator friendly flowers , dig a pond, make a compost heap, mow less and soon your garden will be buzzing with le. If every gardener did this it would make a huge dference for wildle – our cities, towns and villages could soon be teeming with le.”Here are  ways you can do this.Choose blooms that attract pollinatorsThe more iety, the better. Bees and hoverflies love members of the daisy, carrot, rose and mint families. If you’re thinking about sowing plants and herbs for the summer, consider, allium, aquilegia, borage, catmint, columbine, delphinium, foxglove, globe-thistle, lavender, nasturtium, oregano, poppy, snapdragon, sweet pea, thyme, verbena viper’s bugloss. Double flowers can make it dficult for insects to access pollen and nectar – so plant single flowers.Provide a water stationBees get thirsty, so it’s good, particularly during the warm, dry summer months, to provide them with a source of water. Bird baths can work well, allowing bees to balance on the ledge of the rim as they drink. Add pebbles on which the bees can stand. Even a water bowl piled with marbles and pebbles can work.Butterflies don’t need a water bowl as they get what they need from nectar. However, they do need places to “puddle” in what is effectively wet soil, from which they get minerals. To make a puddle take a bowl or pan and scatter a layer of soil. Place rocks or pebbles throughout, for the butterflies to land on, then scatter cut pieces of sponge throughout the soil. These must be kept wet and will release water into the soil.Learn to love your weedsA recent study found that plants that we classy as weeds are actually more popular with pollinators than some of the wildflower mixes that are increasingly popular. Ragwort and two ieties of thistle, species which are officially classed as injurious under the  Weeds Act, are hugely popular with bees and other insects. The study found that the abundance and ersity of pollinators visiting these plants was, on average, double that seen for the wildflowers recommended by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.Comma butterfly on a thistleCreate a mini-meadowResearchers at the University of Sussex, with the help of citizen scientists, have shown that even a space of just four square metres is enough to provide a rich habitat for pollinators and support bioersity. Wildflower mini-meadows were created in gardens and allotments, using commercially available seed-mixes. The team, led by Professor Dave Goulson, found \"in the year following seed-sowing, mini-meadows were supporting on average  percent more bumblebees compared to control plots where no wildflowers had been sown. These resource rich habitats also attracted  percent more solitary bees, and  percent more solitary wasps.\"Give your mower a breakThe pressure may be on for a neat lawn but resist. Long grass gives pollinators shelter and a place to feed. If you can’t bear to let your whole garden grow untamed like this, consider dedicating a strip or patch to long grass and wildflowers. Allow lawn weeds to flower before you remove or cut them. Nature Scot points out, “Weeds have had a bad name. A good example is the much maligned dandelion. If you can avoid cutting your grass until mid-April, after the dandelions have flowered but before they set seed, they will provide an important source of food for all types of pollinators.”Ditch the pesticidesOne of the key things you can do for pollinators is to stop all use of pesticides, which have played a major role in the collapse of insect populations across the world. France banned all use of synthetic pesticides in public spaces in , and garden use from . Many experts, including Dave Goulson, who launched a petition last year, believe the UK should follow. Goulson said, “We don’t need them in our gardens... If we link up private gardens with flower-filled road verges and roundabouts, city parks, cemeteries and so on, that’s potentially a network of insect-friendly habitats. It would be a huge step in the right direction.”Natural alternatives include companion planting, “soft” chemicals like soap and stinging nettles, and inviting pest predators like ladybirds into your garden. One of the problems with buying ready-grown plants is that you can’t be sure what pesticide has been used on them. Grow them from seed in order to keep your garden pesticide free.Make your garden insect-friendly even in winterGrow winter-flowering hardy pollinating plants to give honeybees, which don’t hibernate, something to forage, should their food run out. The blooms will colour-up your garden even in the winter months, while providing food for both honeybees and insects that emerge early from hibernation. Choose shrubs like hellebores, willows, mahonias and winter-flowering clematis. Or try lungwort, the favourite plant of the hairy-footed flower bee, or crocuses, grape hyacinths and snowdrops.\" alt\"HeraldScotland: A crocus with a bumblebee covered in pollen grains \" class\"editor-image\"Connect up a B-LineBugle Scotland is a project to create a map of what are called B-lines, which are corridors and fragments of pollinator-friendly land, with the aim to ultimately join them up and create routes for bees. It may just be that your garden can be part of a B-Line or that you could team up with neighbours to help create one, or seethere are other ways of getting involved in your neighbourhood.Bee-friend your herbsWhether in a window box, container or bed, herbs are not only great for your kitchen, many of them are beloved by bees. Marjoram, thyme, chives, sage and rosemary, are more familiar pollinator-friendly herbs. But, says a Friends of the Earth guide to help bees, you could also strike out and try something more adventurous, “Angelica, with its nectar-rich flowers, will attract plenty of early bees and other pollinators, and unlike many other herbs, can thrive in partial shade. Fennel is rich in nectar and pollen, and will attract a iety of solitary bees.”Snoop on the neighbours’ beesLearn from the bees and butterflies themselves. A tip from Friends of the Earth is, “Peek over the garden fence or at your neighbour’s window boxes to see which plants are doing well, and which ones the bees like to visit.If you like the look of any of them ask your neighbour what they are or take a picture and have a look online.”Let your ivy growIvy is a top pollinator food in autumn. When a lot of other flowers have died off, it’s still going, producing its yellow-green blooms, there for the late-flying butterflies like the red admiral or the comma, by social wasps and by honeybees. Don’t cut it back until after flowering.Red admiral on ivy Choose flowers that butterflies loveMost obvious of these is buddleia, also known as the butterfly bush, but there are many others, including verbena bonariensis, lavender and marjoram. Butterflies like warmth, so choose sunny, sheltered spots for nectar plants.Try to provide flowers right through the butterfly season. Spring flowers are vital for butterflies coming out of hibernation and autumn flowers help butterflies build up their reserves for winter.Painted ladies on buddleia Don’t forget the hoverfliesThe great thing about hoverflies is that the adults are pollinators, but their larvae are predators of aphids and other unwanted garden visitors. It’s like inviting in the pest control.Unlike honeybees and bumblebees which have tongues which allow them to access nectar, most hoverflies have simple mouthparts, which means that the nectar of some flowers, particularly tubular blooms, are inaccessible to them. Choose open flowers like apple blossom, single-flower dahlias, Michaelmas daisies and marsh marigolds, or umbellers, like fennel or wild carrot.Make a bee houseApproximately  species of solitary bees are known in the UK. Some build their nests underground, others do so in naturally occurring cavities, in cracks in stones or holes in wood. It’s the latter that you can invite to come and stay in a bee house. Such constructions are usually boxes, fixed to a fence or wall, more than a metre from the ground, and filled with either wooden blocks or logs with holes drilled into them or bamboo stems. Instructions for how to do this can be found on many wildle websites, including the Woodland Trust and Friends of the Earth. Nature Scot notes, “In Scotland, the red mason beeis the most likely occupier of bee houses.” Remember caterpillars need food too.The following plants are particular good to feed them... blackthorn, buckthorn, holly, oak, broom, garlic mustard, nasturtium, nettle, sorrel, thistles. Butterfly Conservation offers an advice leaflet which suggests, “Grow nasturtiums to lure large and small white caterpillars away from the brassicas” and notes, “stinging nettles are a favourite of the comma and red admiral.”"},{"url":null,"title":"life-bay-tv-show-did-bit-tourism-scotland","story":"Now the Wallace family, owners of Pettycur Bay Holiday Park in Kinghorn, Fe, have revealed the \"fantastic reaction\" the BBC Scotland TV series Le on the Bay commanded.The series, which finished its eight episode run a few weeks ago, covered four decades of insights and stories from those who work, visit, and stay at the park, as well as focusing on the Wallaces themselves, particularly General Manager Steven.Having started as a simple caravan park with  vans in the ’s, the park has become a multi million pound enterprise with a  star hotel at its epicentre.Stories and anecdotes from regular holidaymakers, employees, and the Wallaces themselves, were combined throughout the series with scenes of weddings, entertainment shows, trips to the funfair at Burntisland, and customers taking possession of their holiday homes.The series also  an abundance of stunning aerial shots of the park, together with shots of the beautul beach at Kinghorn, which lies beneath the park - and shots showing the expansive Firth of Forth itself.“We had a fantastic reaction to the series,” said general manager, Steven Wallace. “The many scenic shots in the show certainly do justice to our lovely surroundings.

Orkney Islands Council has announced that it will be installing card payment machines in its car parks, thanks to a boost from the Scottish Government.New ticket machines being installed in the coming weeks will offer contactless and chip and pin card payments.Work to install the machines – which will also accept coins – starts from Monday  March.The new machines are fully funded by the Scottish Government Place Based Investment Programme Capital Fund.All new machines are expected to be in place by the end of March.OIC’s roads support manager, Kenny Roy, said: “The existing machines require more and more maintenance now and are due to be replaced.“The option to pay by card has been a growing request over the past few years from our community and visitors, so we’re pleased to have secured funding from the Scottish Government to help us invest in that option.”Once works start, there will be periods during the installation of new power supplies and of the new machines, when parking in the car parks affected will be free of charge due to temporary unavailability of the machines.All other conditions of the car park order will continue to apply and be enforced, such as maximum stays and parking within marked bays.Drivers are being asked by the council to continue to use the bays in the short stay “pay and display” car parks for a maximum of three hours to ensure a turnover of available spaces. You should always check whether the machine is working and not assume free parking is available.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The day is open to all ages and sexes, so please bring your kids along also.”Previously, Orkney enjoyed success in the North of Scotland Cricket Association.Mr Rae continues: “If we can get back to that level, it’d be a huge bonus. At this stage it’s just baby steps, andthe interest is enough, we’d like to resurrect the indoor winter league, which hasn’t been played since  .“If there is enough interest over in Caithness, we’d like to get the inter-county going too. The tours we used to do in August were also very popular, playing a game at Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire while the royal family was in residence.”Communication through their Facebook page has been encouraging, boosting Mr Rae and others that there is renewed interest in raising the profile of the sport once more.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After Easter — from April  — we will stop recommending that people who don’t have symptoms, should test for COVID.“This change will apply across the population — including in most workplaces and in early years centres, schools, universities and colleges.“Then, at the end of April, routine testing will end — even for people who have symptoms.“At that time, physical test sites will close — although some mobile testing units and capacity will be retained for possible future use. Contact tracing will also end.“Free testing will not generally be available to the wider population. Instead, our advice will be thatyou have symptoms of COVID — or indeed symptoms of the flu, or any other infectious illness — you should stay at home in order to aid your recovery.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We are seeking any business in the community which will be able to operate a drop off and storage facility to make contact with this council via our website and we will pass the details of that on to the organisations.“Given the increased transportation costs of making deliveries to Ukraine Habitat are also asking people who still wish to donate to consider a financial contribution to avoid the current logistical dficulties of transportation.“I know that we have a small Ukrainian population in our borough and further afield who are worried about family and friends and our thoughts and prayers are with them at this time.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1647596939237.jpg--ufu_launch__dig_in__to_food__farm_and_the_environment__schools__competition.jpg?1647596940000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220320newsufu launch dig in to food farm and the environment schools competition","story":"The Ulster Farmers’ Unionin partnership with Bank of Ireland Open Farm Weekendand Asda, are challenging school pupils across Northern Irelandto “Dig in!” to food, farming and the environment, by putting their creative skills to the test. The comments were made as the UFU launched its annual schools’ competition. Open to all playgroups, nursery, primary, and special schools, this year’s theme relates to the UFU’s food and farming education resource “Dig in!”, which encourages pupils to learn more about food, farming, and the countryside. UFU deputy president, David Brown said, “This year’s schools competition theme ‘Dig in! to food, farming and the environment’ provides an opportunity for teachers to start the discussion in the classroom about the importance of food and farming in NI, allowing pupils to learn more about how farmers work hard to produce the delicious, high-quality produce on our tables, and their contribution to shaping our landscape in NI, which everyone enjoys. “Climate change has been the front runner in NI this year and our farmers play an essential role in combating the global issue, as they are a key part of the solution. The schools competition helps pupils to enhance their understanding of how farmers create dferent environments in NI which support our economy, rural communities, tourism and recreation.” Mr Brown says every year the competition judges are impressed by the number, standard and creativity of entries for the schools’ competition. “We would encourage all nursery, playgroups, primary and special schools to participate in what is a very worthwhile competition. It’s a great opportunity to express their creativity while learning about one of the most important sectors in NI as they will discover the importance of local food production,” he said. The UFU is pleased to have competition sponsor Asda on board for another year with a range of prizes available for the lucky winners. Joe McDonald, Asda NI corporate affairs manager said, “Asda is a proud sponsor of the school’s competition. It is great to see competition entries grow year upon year, especially with the introduction of a dferentiating foundation category last year - the standard is superb. It is vital to create an awareness of where our produce comes from, and this competition is a great opportunity to do so - educating children on the ‘farm to fork’ story.” Now in its eleventh year, BOIOFW is the perfect partner for the schools’ competition. As part of the prize, the winner of each category receives free transport for their class to the nearest participating BOIOFW farm, and all competition entries will be on display throughout the weekend. Mr Brown says schools don’t need to be competition winners in order to visit real, working farms. “This free event showcases NI’s world-class ‘farm to fork’ journey and reconnects consumers with our farmers, the primary food producers.The weekend underlines the importance of supporting local producers to benefit the rural community and wider economy in NI. BOIOFW is taking place on Saturday  and Sunday  June, and I would certainly encourage all schools to consider organising a trip to a local participating farm on the schools’ day, Friday  June,” said the UFU deputy president. Entry forms have been sent electronically to all playgroups, nursery, primary and special schools. Schools’ competition templates are available by visitingwww.ufuni.org.The closing date for entries is Friday  April .

Credit: Gareth FullerJohn BreslinMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailFreight operators and passengers were scrambling on Thursday night to switch plans following the sudden mass sacking of  PO Ferries employees, including dozens of skilled crew operating the Larne-Cairnryan route.The company announced the action via a video message, then sent private security staff — some wearing body armour and balaclavas, and carrying stun guns and handcuffs — to remove staff from the European Causeway docked in Larne.Sailings on the route are now suspended for at least five days and possibly a week, prompting concern over a serious disruption to the supply chain.Around  lorries use the route daily, many of them carrying perishable goods on what is the shortest Irish Sea crossing.Captains, engineers, electricians and other skilled deck and engine staff were sacked on Thursday, including around  operating the ferries between Scotland and here.They were immediately replaced by cheaper agency staff, unions said. Other workers, mostly hospitality and already employed through agencies, remained on board.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read MoreThey have treated us all like c**p, says -year PO veteranMargaret Canning:OpinionPO Ferries: Operator of busy link with Scotland recorded £.m profit in , but other factors at play hereWhile PO was silent on Thursday night on why the services are suspended, it is believed the new crew needs to be trained up and may require the green light from maritime regulators to sail.Fears were growing among the approximately  to  Port of Larne ground staff employed directly by PO.East Antrim MLA John Stewart said they had heard nothing from the company as events unfolded quickly on Thursday, adding that the crew members were “treated despicably”.PO, owned by Dubai-headquartered conglomerate DP World since , said it had to take the action because the company was not “viable” after posting losses of £m in the last financial year.The sackings came two years after , staff were made redundant at the same time investors were paid a £m idend, which the company said it was legally obliged to disburse.“Our survival is dependent on making swt and signicant changes now. Without these changes there is no future for PO Ferries,” the company said.“These circumstances have resulted in a very dficult but necessary decision, which was only taken after seriously considering all the available options.”Unions representing the seafarers told members to stay on board, but those stepping off the ship said they had little choice but to leave after being confronted by the security staff and warned they were trespassing, and that the redundancy package would be withdrawnthey did not do so.Local politicians reacted with shock at the developments. It also caught industry insiders completely by surprise.East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson, who spoke with chief executive Peter Hebblethwaite, said he was assured the jobs of ground staff at Larne were secure, but added he was “appalled” at the treatment of the seafarers.“The way in which staff were removed from the ships is totally unacceptable and is not how any employer should treat their employees,” Mr Wilson said.“Despite operating purely between UK ports, PO will now be paying Third World wages to their crew.“This raises serious concerns about the company’s morality.”Immediate clarication is needed over the future of Larne Harbour, East Antrim Alliance MLA Stewart Dickson said.“Given PO owns Larne Harbour, urgent questions now need asked as to the potentially vast impact locally,” Mr Dickson said.Passengers, hauliers and cargo are being redirected to Stena Line ferries, with the company saying it is trying to accommodate but is extremely busy. It confirmed it was trying to accommodate those booked on the PO ferries between Scotland and Northern Ireland.“Most freight companies have accounts with all ferry operators and they are doing what they normally do during periods of disruptions and move via alternative routes operators where space is available,” Stena Line said.Logistics UK, the trade body for freight transport, warned there will be disruption but that those in the business of moving goods were flexible and used to quickly switching methods, either using other ferries or,needs be, air transport.But Seamus Leheny of the organisation said: “This has just come out of the blue... really shocked the industry.”Rail, Maritime and Transportunion general secretary Mick Lynch said: “We are seeking urgent legal action and are again calling for the Government to take action to stop what is fast turning into one of the most shameful acts in the history of British industrial relations.”Tom Long of law firm Shakespeare Martineau said: “PO’s decision to fire  staff with immediate effect appears to contravene the requirements needed for a normal mass redundancy.”Related topicsJohn StewartAlliance PartyStewart DicksonMore On John StewartJohn Traynor, Ballycastle man who died in Carrickfergus work accident, ‘a very, very popular inidual’Birth Mothers, which represents mother and baby homes victims, urges Stormont to act on ’s recommendations PremiumSuzanne BreenOpinionProtocol meeting: Stormont ide is clear in discussions with EC vice presidentDoug Beattie includes Mike Nesbitt and John Stewart in UUP spokespeople changesDoug Beattie includes Robbie Butler and Andy Allen in UUP leadership team Most ReadPaul McKenna: Grieving widow tells of her last moments with DJ husbandBeautully finished Malone semi-detached is spacious and perfect for a modern familyTributes to Enniskillen man who died suddenlyAbuse victim died of Covid- before Belfast paedophile faced justiceSam McBrideOpinionMystery about quiet hardening of the Irish Sea border – and who ordered itTop VideosPlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from Frozen wearing flight suits in yellow and blue colours that match the Ukrainian flag \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news bfb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cedcb-ddcd-fd-ade-bafdbf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news bfb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cedcb-ddcd-fd-ade-bafdbf_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   wearing flight suits in yellow and blue colours that match the Ukrainian flag \"PlayRussian cosmonauts wear Ukraine colours to International Space StationPlayPO Ferries sparks fury after sacking  workersLatest Northern IrelandUnion representatives set to brief Stormont on legal plans against POPolice search for man ‘in navy dressing gown’ after stabbing in south BelfastDUP veteran who quit after ousting of Arlene Foster ‘delighted’ to run for party in Assembly electionStaff replacing sacked PO Ferries workers face ‘poverty pay’, union claimsAnimal cruelty cop John Fleming was in line for promotionLatestWilfred Ndidi injury news takes shine off Leicester’s winMan City and Liverpool on course for FA Cup semi-final clash at WembleyEngland declare  runs ahead of West Indies as they eye unlikely victory pushTanaiste rules out bringing back Covid restrictionsPhil Foden stunner ends Southampton’s dream as Man City reach FA Cup semi-finals,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

And it ended with my appearance in a Hollywood movie starring Johnny Depp. In the intervening  years, the intriguing story of the IRA’s Marita Ann gunrunning ship took me to Boston on the trail of American mobster and Provo supporter Whitey Bulger, where I met the FBI and the family of one of Bulger’s murder victims as well as undercover cops and lawyers. I also ended up face to face with the IRA leader who led the Irish side of the gunrunning operation and the former Provisional who tipped off the authorities about the Marita Ann.It was on my birthday in September  that I flew from Belfast to London to work for a couple of days with ITN. But no sooner was I in the door than I was out again, flying back to Ireland with an ITN crew, this time on a private jet that was waiting at Heathrow. The brief was to get pictures of a fishing boat called the Marita Ann that had been captured by the Irish navy, who had fired tracer bullets before boarding the ship  miles off the Kerry coast. We duly spotted the Marita Ann at sea, and award-winning cameraman Sebastian Rich filmed it from the air before we headed off to Cork to edit a report for ITN .Later that evening we were at Cobh harbour to record the IRA gunrunners — including well-known Kerry republican Martin Ferris — being frogmarched in handcuffs off the ship. The others who were held were Irishmen Michael Browne, Gavin Mortimer and John McCarthy, and John Crawley, a US citizen and former US marine. The next morning we were given access to the terrying armoury of weaponry being unloaded from the Marita Ann. It included  guns, dozens of rockets and grenades and over seventy thousand bullets — total value: m.Next stop was Dublin for the appearance at the Special Criminal Court of the men who had been arrested. I’d been due back in Belfast the following morning for my day job with UTV but ITN asked me to go with their crew to shoot footage of the arms haul being driven to Garda headquarters from Co Cork. On our way south we saw a convoy of security forces lorries heading north on the opposite side of a dual carriageway but by the time we were able to turn around we couldn’t see any sign of it. We later discovered that, in an only-in-Ireland moment, the drivers had stopped off for a cup of tea at the Irish Army’s Curragh base — which explained why we’d lost them. When the lorries finally arrived at the Garda Síochána’s headquarters at Phoenix Park in Dublin, we were waiting to film what I imagined was the final part of the Marita Ann jigsaw for me.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseArms recovered from gun-running ship the Marita Ann FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueArms recovered from gun-running ship the Marita AnnDaily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up But how wrong I was. Sixteen years later, in , UTV sent me to Boston to make a documentary about the discovery in a shallow grave of the body of murdered Irish-American John McIntyre, who had skippered the Valhalla, the trawler that had taken the arms from Massachusetts and rendezvoused with the Marita Ann for a handover in the Atlantic. It transpired that Whitey Bulger, an infamously fanatical and vicious gangster who sang Irish rebel songs in the IRA bars of Boston, had financed the shipment and, like the Provos in Ireland, was furious when the Marita Ann was intercepted. He wanted to unmask the tout. Bulger, the ruthless leader of Boston’s Winter Hill Gang, quickly convinced himself that McIntyre was the informer, and his suspicions were reinforced after the British and Irish authorities ly briefed journalists in Ireland that the information had come from America. The fake steer was to protect the real source of the tip-off — IRA leader and British intelligence agent Sean O’Callaghan. McIntyre paid with his le, with Bulger — who had ordered his murder — helping his men to do his vile dirty work after their victim had been lured to a house in Boston. Bulger and his henchmen at first tried to strangle McIntyre with rope but they couldn’t finish him off and he begged for a bullet in the head. McIntyre was then shot and Bulger’s gang pulled out his teeth in a bid to make any positive identication of his body almost impossible. But it was established he was indeed John McIntyre.In , in a neat house in Quincy, just outside Boston, I met McIntyre’s mother Emily and brother Chris. Over tea and fruitcake they cursed Bulger, who had been on the run for years with his partner Catherine Greig. At another meeting during the same trip, the director of the FBI in Boston, Barry Mawn, told me he had no doubt about the mobster’s involvement in the McIntyre slaying. He showed me an FBI chart on the wall that revealed Bulger was second only to Osama Bin Laden on their “most wanted” list.The next part of my Marita Ann voyage took me to England to interview double agent Sean O’Callaghan for my documentary. In a swish hotel in London, O’Callaghan readily admitted that he gave his handlers in British intelligence chapter and verse about the Marita Ann, which had been due to bring its deadly cargo into Co Kerry, where IRA men were waiting in cars to transport the guns to arms dumps. The British told the Irish authorities and the operation to seize it swung into gear. O’Callaghan said he had been with Martin Ferris right up until the moment he boarded the trawler in Fenit, Co Kerry. He added that McIntyre had nothing to do with the leaking of the information. Over dinner, I told O’Callaghan that McIntyre’s family despised the source of the Marita Ann tip-off just as much as they hated Bulger. He wasn’t surprised, and he wasn’t particularly remorseful.\"data-srcset\"https:www.independent.ie irish-news crime ae .ece AUTOCROP w SN%DEPP%AS%WHITEY%BULGER w,https:www.independent.ie irish-news crime ae .ece AUTOCROP w SN%DEPP%AS%WHITEY%BULGER w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.independent.ie irish-news crime ae .ece AUTOCROP w SN%DEPP%AS%WHITEY%BULGER w,https:www.independent.ie irish-news crime ae .ece AUTOCROP w SN%DEPP%AS%WHITEY%BULGER w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Johnny Depp as gangster Whitey Bulger in the movie Black Mass  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueJohnny Depp as gangster Whitey Bulger in the movie Black Mass A few years later, a bizarre twist of fate found me talking about O’Callaghan with Martin Ferris. Wearing my other hat as an actor, I’d been touring Ireland with a Martin Lynch play, The History of the Troubles , which was a black comedy about the impact of the Troubles on one man, played by me, and supported by a series of characters created by Conor Grimes and Alan McKee, who were also involved in the writing of the piece.We were staging the play in Tralee’s Siamsa Tíre theatre for nearly a week, and one night after the show an Australian lady called Máire and her friends joined us in the bar to discuss the production. Máire invited us to come for drinks after the play the next night at the bar outside Tralee that she ran with her husband, Martin. We never turned our backs on a party and, within minutes of receiving a warm welcome from the locals in the pub, I found myself sitting next to Máire’s husband and instantly recognised him as Martin Ferris, who by that stage had become a Sinn Féin deputy in the Dáil.I told him I had “met” him once before and went on to explain that in the other half of my double-le I was a journalist who had reported on his “departure” from the Marita Ann  years earlier. We talked atabout everything under the political sun butI was expecting an inside track on the Marita Ann or O’Callaghan I was sorely disappointed. In , Whitey Bulger and Catherine Greig were arrested in Santa Monica, and Bulger was later given a series of le sentences for  murders, including the McIntyre killing.But a dferent type of sentence was waiting for Bulger. In , the -year-old Mob boss was found dead in his cell in a West Virginia jail after some of his many enemies finally caught up with him and beat him to a pulp. In a gruesome echo of the McIntyre murder, Bulger was left unrecognisable by his assailants.Three years earlier, a Hollywood film about Bulger called Black Mass had been released. The monster was superbly played by Johnny Depp, who managed to portray his evil savagery with ease. In one scene, in which the practicalities of the gunrunning plot were discussed, Bulger is seen meeting Belfast IRA leader Joe Cahill in a private room in a Boston bar called Triple O’s. The two conspirators break off their negotiations to watch a news report on the television about violent clashes between the security forces and republicans in Derry after an IRA funeral.By a bizarre coincidence, the reporter’s voice they hear in the ITN report is mine. ‘Reporting the Troubles ’, compiled by Deric Henderson and Ivan Little, is published by Blackstaff Press  Most ReadPaul McKenna: Grieving widow tells of her last moments with DJ husbandBeautully finished Malone semi-detached is spacious and perfect for a modern familyTributes to Enniskillen man who died suddenlyAbuse victim died of Covid- before Belfast paedophile faced justiceSam McBrideOpinionMystery about quiet hardening of the Irish Sea border – and who ordered itTop VideosPlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from Frozen wearing flight suits in yellow and blue colours that match the Ukrainian flag \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news bfb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cedcb-ddcd-fd-ade-bafdbf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news bfb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cedcb-ddcd-fd-ade-bafdbf_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   wearing flight suits in yellow and blue colours that match the Ukrainian flag \"PlayRussian cosmonauts wear Ukraine colours to International Space StationPlayPO Ferries sparks fury after sacking  workersLatest Northern IrelandUnion representatives set to brief Stormont on legal plans against POPolice search for man ‘in navy dressing gown’ after stabbing in south BelfastDUP veteran who quit after ousting of Arlene Foster ‘delighted’ to run for party in Assembly electionStaff replacing sacked PO Ferries workers face ‘poverty pay’, union claimsAnimal cruelty cop John Fleming was in line for promotionLatestChocolate farm visit is the golden ticket for William and KateWilfred Ndidi injury news takes shine off Leicester’s winMan City and Liverpool on course for FA Cup semi-final clash at WembleyEngland declare  runs ahead of West Indies as they eye unlikely victory pushTanaiste rules out bringing back Covid restrictions,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Soviet flags were taken down on December , . Below, the aftermath of Russian airstrikes in Kyiv. Credit: Alain-Pierre Hovasse Getty ImagesMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailYekaterinburg is miles away from everywhere. Boris Yeltsin’s hometown and the site of the executions of the Tsar Nikolai II and his family by the Bolsheviks in , it has hosted some key moments in Russian and Soviet history.I spent a couple of days there during the  World Cup, and ahead of the Peru France game, I spoke to Tanya from Sevastopol, who was working as a volunteer. Sevastopol is on the Crimean Peninsula, about ,km from Yekaterinburg which is located where Europe meets Asia.During our brief conversation, she declared that Crimea was most certainly not Ukraine, in case there was any doubt. I hadn’t asked, and anyway I’d heard it all before.Over  years ago, when I started studying Russian in Trinity College, one of my teachers ruefully recounted the story of how former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev had given Ukraine the present of ‘Crimea’, which sits in Ukrainian territory on the Black Sea.Sure, what’s a peninsula with access to the Black Sea between friends when we’re all part of the Soviet Union Quite a lot when that Union breaks up.For those wonderingthe pronunciation and spelling of Kyiv are new inventions, that same teacher, whose lack of English gave our beginners’ Russian a run for its money, always referred to the city as ‘Keev’ and never pronounced it ‘Kee-yev’ as it was spelt in Russian. Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up It’s not the only linguistic curiosity when it comes to Ukraine —you were ‘in Ukraine’ the phrase we were taught was ‘na Ukrainye’, which literally translates as ‘on Ukraine’. The word ‘na’ is normally applied to general areas, for instance ‘the west’, ‘the north’ — and was never used for any other Soviet republic. The issue moved the newly-formed country to appeal to Russia in  to abandon this practice and only use the more logical “v Ukraine”. It didn’t work. Of course, in English, ‘The Ukraine’ was almost universal and, given how loaded ‘the north’ is when applied to Northern Ireland, it should not be a surprise that many English-speaking Ukrainians objected. It’s taken over  years of independence and a terrying war to finally get the penny — and the definite article — to drop in this part of the world.It was a dizzying era in eastern Europe — we took our Christmas holidays in December  as students of the USSR. When we ed the USSR no longer existed. The end of the Cold War opened up all kinds of possibilities, especially as we were required to spend months in Russia as part of our degree course.By the time I travelled over in , the loopholes which allowed previous foreign students to live comfortably had been locked shut and instead new rules were made that introduced higher prices for foreigners, regardless of income. Instead of living like Tsars, we had to work for a living.I hilariously found myself managing a western-owned Moscow courier company for a couple of months. The salary was basic, which matched my basic ability to manage my ‘team’ of couriers. The staff lived by the old Soviet mantra that they’d pretend to workwe pretended to pay them.In my defence, it’s not easy trying to manage any kind of delivery service in a strange metropolis where many street names had been changed from their communist-era titles.I was only ever stopped and asked for my papers once. ‘Dokumenty!’ hissed a poorly-dressed, obviously bored, conscript. A poorly-dressed student myself, his face dropped as he saw me lt the European passport out of my pocket. “I’m so, so sorry,” he said. “I thought you looked Ukrainian.”I never thought it betrayed any deep, underlying suspicion of the emerging state but was more likely just one desperate kid spotting a chance to get a few smokes off a scared foreigner. In a phonetic quirk, speaking Russian with an Irish accent was more likely to see you mistaken for a native of one of the Baltic republics.Ukrainian independence happened almost by accident and was only ever begrudgingly accepted in Moscow which always viewed it as within Russia’s ‘sphere of influence’. Even the Americans tended to agree.Russia without Ukraine was a very dferent country. After all, Khrushchev and his successor Leonid Brezhnev were Ukrainian, as were many of the USSR’s apparatchiki-in-chief. Catching out Ukrainians was not high on the priority list for law enforcement agencies of mid-s Moscow. Instead, you were more likely to see traders from the Caucasus, or what had been Soviet Central Asia stopped by police. Despite their Soviet passports, these ‘foreigners’ looked dferent and became easy targets — and not just for the police.Ukrainians don’t look dferent and, as you can hear from their president’s speeches, they don’t sound particularly dferent either.Russian troops will be coming up against people who in their minds look just like them, have very similar day-to-day lives and speak their language.Soldiers from Soviet Central Asia were used in sizable numbers when the Afghanistan invasion — or as Moscow called it, the ‘intervention’ — began in , but that policy changed swtly, in part due to fears the soldiers were fraternising with and getting too close to the enemy.For all the control Vladimir Putin has, the people speak openly, whether you’re a foreigner or not. You only have to open the door of a taxi and the driver will tell you everything that’s wrong with the world, especially Russia. I’d barely taken my seat on the way to Yekaterinburg airport when the Ford Fiesta driver launched into a tirade about how crazy it was that his city had managed to get to host games.He reeled off a whole host of reasons from the unpredictable weather, to the smog, the dirt and dozens of dferent sources of pollution in the area which made it about as unhealthy a place to stay, let alone play football.Not every city has a street called ‘Asbestos Lane’.While clearing out some old college junk recently, I came across a slip of paper with the name and address of a Russian who I shared accommodation with in Moscow in the late s.He swore rather than spoke Russian and had a Cockney accent after a stint in London with an Irish landlady.I’d forgotten his surname, so was delighted that I could make out his -year-old scrawl. I looked him up and got quite the shock to see him pictured on manoeuvres around Moscow as a high-ranking government official. I put off trying to track him down. Let’s face it, a western journalist contacting a Russian government official should probably go through certain channels, but I was still sure it could be done, some time.It looks like I’ll have to wait.Eoin Brannigan is editor-in-chief of Belfastand Sunday LeRelated topicsUkraineMost ReadPaul McKenna: Grieving widow tells of her last moments with DJ husbandBeautully finished Malone semi-detached is spacious and perfect for a modern familyTributes to Enniskillen man who died suddenlyAbuse victim died of Covid- before Belfast paedophile faced justiceSam McBrideOpinionMystery about quiet hardening of the Irish Sea border – and who ordered itTop VideosPlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from Frozen wearing flight suits in yellow and blue colours that match the Ukrainian flag \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news bfb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cedcb-ddcd-fd-ade-bafdbf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news bfb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cedcb-ddcd-fd-ade-bafdbf_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   wearing flight suits in yellow and blue colours that match the Ukrainian flag \"PlayRussian cosmonauts wear Ukraine colours to International Space StationPlayPO Ferries sparks fury after sacking  workersLatest WorldPatriotic messages in tattoos and on billboards become popular in UkraineSix people die as ferry sinks near Bangladesh’s capitalHundreds of thousands of mourners attend mass funeral of leading rabbiPope condemns ‘repugnant and cruel’ war in UkraineUK dual national Morad Tahbaz ed to prison in Iran, says lawyerLatestChocolate farm visit is the golden ticket for William and KateWilfred Ndidi injury news takes shine off Leicester’s winMan City and Liverpool on course for FA Cup semi-final clash at WembleyEngland declare  runs ahead of West Indies as they eye unlikely victory pushTanaiste rules out bringing back Covid restrictions,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

plans for a major walking trail which passes through Down District have received a pound, boost.A key component of the planned Columban Way is to develop ldquopilgrimage walking such as that found at Spainrsquos Camino de Santiago and at many other trails across Europe, with the trail highlighting Northern Irelandrsquos ancient heritage, including major Neolithic and early Christian sites along the way.It has been confirmed that a pound, grant has made available by the David Cross Foundation to produce a business case with costings to identy and develop the Columban Way from Dundrum to the Saint Patrickrsquos Centre in Downpatrick and from there to Comber by repurposing and upgrading sections of the former Ulster Way which was abandoned in the s.St Columbanus was one of the best-known of hundreds of Irish monks following in the footsteps of Saint Patrick in bringing Christianity, literacy and learning to Central and Northern Europe in the sixth century.Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright mdash who is an enthusiastic supporter of the new trail mdash said ii took St Columbanus  years to complete the journey from Bangor to Bobbio in Italy and he travelled more than , miles, mostly on foot.He is leading the local aspect of the project alongside Charlie Reid from Bangor, with both writing extensively on walks around Ireland and are committee members of Friends of Columbanus. They are supported by Duane Fitzsimons, from Ardglass, who is a walking trails expert.ldquoThe Columban Way forms part of the wider European lsquoVia Columbanirsquo heritage trail supported and promoted by the Council of Europe. It traces the route from Mount Leinster to Bangor through eight European countries to Bobbio in Italy, explained Cllr Enright.ldquoIt is instructive to see how rapidly other countries have rolled out sections of the trail since  and the th anniversary of Columbanus. Switzerland, Italy, France, Germany and the Low Countries have demonstrated the ability to deliver that we can learn from locally.Cllr Enright praised the support of Ards and North Down Council which has already delivered  miles of walk as far south as Comber.ldquoThis -mile section of trail is designed to encourage more people to learn about the history of North Down and Ards, including the impact the area had in a European context through the links with Columbanus, he explained.ldquoOur big challenge will be to engage with Newry Mourne and Down Council to deal with their huge gaps in the Saint Patrickrsquos and Ulster Ways. These should link Downpatrick to Dundrum and Killyleagh, but still have not yet done so..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch Women win yet again  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH continue their pursuit of a domestic double when they travel to Armagh on Saturday in the quarter-finals of the Senior Cup.Ballynahinch Women followed up their win over leaders Carrickfergus with a hard fought - victory over derby rivals Lisburn.The teams shared six tries with a lone Jane Patton conversion proving the dference between the sides on a dficult surface.Veteran centre Rachel Morton weighed in with two tries and Avril Sherlock was the other try scorer.Coach Sara Simms and her team will be pleased with the rate of improvement shown and will hope to keep pushing up the table during the final part of the season.The seconds continue to blood young players during their Second XV League campaign and had another emphatic home win on Saturday.Armagh were on the end of a five tries to one defeat and coach Davy Harris will have been pleased with the response his team have shown since their Townsrsquo Cup defeat at the end of February.James Martin, Matthew Cooper, Ben McMullan, Cameron McGaughey and Harry McCormick were the try scorers.Injuries and call-ups to the first XV squad have had an impact and there will be opportunities for young players to stake a claim for a place in the senior squad next season over the next few weeks.Marty OrsquoNeillrsquos fourth XV continued their red-hot  form with an excellent - victory over Harlequins thirds.They have a % record in their league section and face a crucial three-week period with home and away fixtures against nearest rivals Academy either side of a Forster Plate semi-final against Donegal Town.A fth XV squad with an average age of  travelled to Banbridge on Friday night and came home with a superb - victory.Tiernan Keating, Conor Spence and Sam Forbes made their senior debuts and  players had appeared at some stage this season for the club Academy side.They have three consecutive home games coming up, including a home semi-final in the McCambley Cup against Ballymena fourths.Youth training continues at pm on Monday nights.

But that could be about to change.Last year, the estimated repair bill for the clock, whose interior mechanism was removed over three decades ago and placed in storage, was in the region of pound,.Many are concerned to see the historic landmark falling into continued disrepair, but hopeful that it can be restored to be enjoyed for generations to come, reinforcing its connection with the villagersquos industrial past.Shrigley was founded by the Martin family, who came from Pott Shrigley in Cheshire in  and who owned the spinning factory in the village.The factory was powered by water supplied from the nearby Clea Lough and while the mill mdash which is reported to have employed  people at one time mdash has long gone, the clock tower erected by the people of Shrigley in  in honour of the Martin family remains.Now there is fresh hope that it can be restored to its former glory.Strangford MLAs Michelle McIlveen and Harry Harvey, who have been campaigning for the clockrsquos restoration, are also hopeful that progress can be made.Welcoming the recent developments, they hope plans to acquire the clock and restore it to its former glory will prove successful.The MLAs said Housing Executive chief executive Grainia Long made it clear last year that the huge cost of repairing the historic clock was something the organisation was not willing to meet at the time.The housing chief said at a time when it was experiencing a signicant funding shortfall for investment in tenantsrsquo homes, it was not be appropriate to use income derived from rents to fund the considerable costs that would be required to undertake a full restoration of the Shrigley clock.Ms McIlveen and Mr Harvey then raised the issue with Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey, who has overall responsibility for the Historical Environment Division.They detailed the clockrsquos history and its local signicance, explaining that it is one of the last remaining pieces of Victorian architecture in Shrigley.The MLAs said it was ldquounacceptable that an old clock of such important signicance and splendour should be allowed to fall into such a sad state of disrepair.ldquoWe urged the communities minister to take the necessary steps to prevent this important listed monument from further deterioration and urged her to consider a partnership approach with ious interested bodies, explained Ms McIlveen.ldquoI am pleased that the Housing Executive is now in discussions with an interested local party regarding a proposed feasibility study to consider options and prepare design concepts for the area that would involve the acquisition and restoration of the historic monument.Ms McIlveen said discussions are ongoing and that she and Mr Harvey have made clear to the government department and Housing Executive their desire that these discussions should be centred on the interests of the Shirley community, with the outcome safeguarding the future of the cherished monument..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Council set to review museum joint curator restructure role  ","story":"THE controversial decision to restructure the districtrsquos museum services is to be reviewed.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos decision to appoint a joint curator to oversee museum services in Downpatrick and Newry mdash which was taken without consulting local councillors mdash is to be reviewed by the local authorityrsquos Audit Committee.The newly appointed curator will be based in Newry, a move which has angered a number of councillors and highly respected organisations, including the Friends of the Down County Museum.Council officials have been accused of downgrading the status of the Downpatrick museum with stinging criticism continuing of the decision to have one curator in charge of the local authorityrsquos two museums.Council officials insist they are ldquofully committed to the continuous improvement and development of both museums and that updated staffing structures for both ldquoprovides an unparalleled opportunity to build in this work.The restructuring process has been referred to the Audit Committee by Downpatrick councillor Gareth Sharvin, who is disappointed that despite signicant opposition to the move, the new joint curator is already in post.He wants the process which led to the councilrsquos decision to be reviewed, with the referral coming on the back of an update on the new staffing structure recently provided in secret to members of the local authorityrsquos Strategy, Policy and Resources Committee.Cllr Sharvin said while the press and public were prevented from hearing the update, he understands that the new curator will be based in Newry and shared across both museum sites.He continued: ldquoThe new staff structure is seen as an activity under the so-called scheme of delegation that enables the councilrsquos senior management team to conduct the change without the need to consult or inform any stakeholders in the process.ldquoThe new staff structure is currently being implemented and cannot be subject to change, as the roles have been offered out. We are told this is an operational matter that councillors are not involved in.Cllr Sharvin says he is disappointed to have to confirm that the new staff structure will be implemented at Down County Museum, which means it will have no permanent curator in the building.ldquoGiven the lack of information around the new roles and how the existing complement of skills are being integrated into the new museum structure, it can only raise concern as no one outside the senior management team have the information and understanding of how the fantastic services provided in Downpatrick will continue to be offered and delivered, he continued.ldquoThe campaign by the Friends of the Museum and the many groups associated with the Down County Museum was very much focused on the skills needed to run the museum and offer the excellent experience many hundreds of thousands of people have enjoyed over the years.Cllr Sharvin insists that a strategic review should have been undertaken first to understand the vision for the museum services in the district, design a plan around that vision and identy the staffing structure needed to support it.ldquoWhat has happened in this case, is that the staff structure is being implemented and a strategic review being held afterwards. The strategic review could easily identy that a dferent staffing structure is needed as opposed to the one being implemented now, he continued.ldquoI want to see the Down County Museum grow in size, reputation and service offerings. When you research the top  museums in Northern Ireland on Which Museum, the Downpatrick museum is placed th compared to Newry which is st.ldquoSimilarly on TripAdvisor, the Downpatrick museum is listed th, with Newry in th place. This shows a clear dference in status for each museum and where the councilrsquos main museum asset is.Councillor Sharvin explained he has referred the museum process and procedure to the councilrsquos Audit Committee for a number of reasons, even though he accepts the review will have no signicance in relation to the staffing structure as that will continue.However, he said the move will ensure that ldquolessons are learnt for any future changes and the Downpatrick museum is protected and respected.Cllr Sharvin explained the role of the audit committee is to review internal procedures and that is what he has asked to be examined.ldquoThere is no clear one approach when it comes to restructuring in council and the review of the procedures undertaken in this case will help the organisation identy were gaps are, what risks have been identied and the improvements that need to be implemented, he said.Cllr Sharvin said he has asked for a timeline of the start and completion of the strategic review being implemented and how key stakeholders such as the Friends of the Museum will be consulted as part of the process.He added: ldquoThe strategic review is now the focus of the campaign to ensure that the Down County Museum is not downgraded in any way. I will be approaching the strategic review with the sense of growth in visitor numbers, educational outreach, advertising campaigns, collection and exhibition offerings and the wider service offerings..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dawn launches debut novel  ","story":"THE debut novel by a local childrenrsquos writer is already one of the top selling books in its age category on Amazon.Felicity Flipflops is the work of Dawn Gelston, a teacher living in Dubai but who has strong links with Drumaness and Teconnaught.She is the daughter of Paul and Maura Gelston and sister to Shona, Aisling, Janine and Paul.Aimed at children aged  to  years old, the book tells the story of mental well-being, adventure, and friendship by a young girl named Felicity.Dawn explained: ldquoAs teachers, we encourage children to believe in themselves and to work hard and dream big.

","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has been urged to do all it can to quickly deliver Newcastlersquos new multi-million pound leisure complex.The appeal was issued by the local authorityrsquos chairwoman, Cathy Mason, following a recent meeting she had with senior council directors who provided her with a progress report.A detailed report on building the eagerly-awaited pound leisure centre is expected to be completed shortly, with senior council officials working with consultants to develop an outline business case which is designed to pave the way for construction work to start.The rear of the existing Newcastle Centre and the outdoor Tropicana swimming pool are to be bulldozed to make way for the new town centre leisure complex which will feature an indoor leisure pool which includes three  metre swimming lanes and a dedicated heated play pool for children.The new leisure facility will also feature an ultra-modern gymnasium and once demolition work has been completed, the new complex will be bolted on to the side of the existing centre.Redeveloping the existing Newcastle Centre has been ruled out due to the scale of the costs involved and itrsquos understood that the planned new-build will be larger than the current centre which is a listed building, posing major problems for the council in transforming it into an energy efficient facility which meets current building regulations and standards.Cllr Mason described confirmation of plans for new leisure facilities in Newcastle as ldquowelcome news and is delighted that the development plans are in the final stages of development.ldquoThese new local amenities will be of great benefit to local residents, their families and tourists alike, she said, confirming that the proposes new complex will feature a new leisure pool and state of the art gym facilities.ldquoFor too long, people of Newcastle have had to put up with these substandard facilities, the chairwoman continued. ldquoThe plans highlighted safety concerns with the old part of the building which is to be demolished as it simply isnrsquot fit for purpose.Cllr Mason said she hopes to see the finalised plans and formal site approval in the coming months so that contractors can start working on the project as soon as possible.ldquoIt is essential that the council moves in a timely manner to ensure this project comes to fruition so that Newcastle residents can access these new facilities as soon as possible, said the chairwoman.ldquoSinn Feacutein will continue to do all it can to ensure these much-needed leisure facilities are delivered and I will continue to stand up for rural families across South Down to deliver these essential services right in the heart of communities.Last week, formal planning approval to bulldoze the rear extension of the existing Newcastle Centre and the adjoining Tropicana swimming pool was agreed by the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee.Detailed work has already been carried out at the town centre site, including geotechnical surveys which examined ground conditions to provide architects and designers with key information ahead of construction work getting underway.While no detailed timescales are in place, politicians hope that major progress to deliver the project can now be made, with planning permission and all other associated approvals secured in a timely

club has been formed in Downpatrick.Known as Quoile Angling Club, the organisation is holding its inaugural meeting this Friday night at Murphyrsquos Bar in the town at pm, with an open invitation extended to anyone who would like to attend.The club was formed in response to the growing interest in course angling at the river and with coronavirus restrictions largely gone, anglers have joined forces to form the new club and aim to encourage greater involvement in angling, particularly for coarse fish in the lower reaches of the River Quoile.The picturesque river is home to rudd, roach, hybrids, bream, pike, and eels.The new club is hoping to run a few competitions and, in the future, provide coaching courses for young anglers.A key concern for the new club is addressing the current state of the fishery which runs from the below the Belfast Road bridge to the Steamboat quay.The aim is to engage with a raft of statutory agencies to raise the profile of the river and its angling potential, alongside improved access for anglers and visitors.While there has been signicant investment over recent years and additional upgrades in the pipeline, the anglers will hope this paves the way for greater emphasis on the Quoile area as a recreational and tourism asset.Anglers say the Quoile basin is a designated nature reserve and, as such, there are ious regulations which govern its usage, with those who fish along its banks keen to maintain the waterwayrsquos biological ersity and general appearance, ensuring it is an asset everyone can enjoy.At the clubrsquos inaugural meeting

He was inch-perfect through the morningrsquos slippery conditions, quickly building up a sizeable advantage and catching his rivals on the hop.This continued his fine form after the local driver also won the opening stages.In the space of two stages, he had amassed a lead of more than  seconds ndash a huge margin on the single venue event.From there, he managed his lead and with the sun shining, Greer powered home in his Citroen C to eventually win by . seconds and claim another maximum points haul in his bid for this yearrsquos championship spoils.ldquoIt was a brilliant day, said Greer.ldquoThe car was faultless and was really well suited to the event. We kept it clean and everything went to plan.In the battle for second overall, Derek McGarrity and Graham Henderson held an early second in their Skoda until a stage two overshoot cost them around ten seconds.Aaron McLaughlin and Darren Curran also hit trouble with a puncture and a broken rim, while Darren Gass and Sam Hutchinson were already out of contention after they spun and stalled on stage one.That left McGarrity and McLaughlin battling for the runner-up spot. McLaughlin quickly recovered from his puncture and moved into second after stage three. McGarrity tried hard to fight back but in the drying conditions, McLaughlin had the edge in his Fiesta WRC.He was really enjoying himself and an attempt to secure the fastest time on the final stage saw him come to within one-tenth of a second of rally winner Greer.ldquoHersquos a machine, said McLaughlin.ldquoI was really hoping for a fastest stage time. I just wish we had started the day as good as we finished it.Derek McGarrity and Graham Henderson had to be content with third overall in their Skoda. Their stage two overshoot potentially cost them a position but they still secured an armful of points for their McGrady Insurance NI Championship campaign.ldquoIt was a silly mistake on the second stage, said McGarrity.ldquoThen we had a small misfire on the last stage but it is what it is.Joe McGonigle and Ciaran Geaney clipped a bale and damaged the front wing of their Fiesta on stage two but they survived to tell the tale.Seventh after the test, they climbed back up the order to secure fourth overall ahead of Joe and Ashleen Hegarty, who were lucky to escape a high-speed spin on stage four.ldquoWe were using new tyres and the car broke away from me at high speed, explained Hegarty.ldquoWe went over a few trackside tyres and ended up on the grass.Darren Gass and Sam Hutchinson would have been in the mix too but they took a wrong route on stage five and were handed a stage maximum. Instead, Michael McGarrity and Damien Garvey were overjoyed to claim sixth overall in their Fiesta.They lost time when a boost pipe came adrt and also struggled with some brakingissues during the closing miles but were full of smiles at the finish.Also in a Fiesta, David Kelly and Dean OrsquoSullivan finished seventh ahead of Mark Massey and Alistair Wyllie.Massey was lucky to escape with some superficial bodywork damage after a stage five altercation with some trackside stage furniture so a top eight finish was a good result for the crew.Emma McKinstry and Kenny Hull lost time with some intercom issues but finished ninth while Robert Erwin and Andrew Wilson completed the top ten and secured the two-wheel-drive honours in the process.In the two-wheel-drive category, a titanic battle developed between a number of crews. James and Heather Kennedy were quickest out of the blocks, closely followed by Andrew White and Paul Hughes.Then White lost ground with an overshoot, leaving Kennedy to fend off a challenge from Robert Erwin and Andrew Wilson.As the track conditions improved, Erwin started to pile the pressure on the Kennedys who were suffering with a down-on-power engine.The chasing Toyota MR crew moved in front after the fth test and another strong run over the final stage sealed the category win as well as tenth overall.James and Heather Kennedy had to settle for second on this occasion as well as th overall, with Matthew McGaffin and Ryan Lowry coming home third in class.The McGrady Insurance NI Rally Championship now has a two-month break before the Maiden City Stages on May .In the interim period, a rally social night is being held at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel on Friday, March .

In  it was decided to move both date and venue to have the best chance of fitting in with Covid- restrictions.While the event at Bishopscourt Racing Circuit last June was well received, many were glad to see the race brought back to its origins as a road race taking in the iconic sites of East Downrsquos home town.Months of planning go into a race and this year was no exception. The EDAC race committee had an A and B routes on file in case of flooding on the Quoile towpath.They had worked with and through Covid- restrictions, secured road licences and Athletics NI permits, and employed professionals for timing, first aid and traffic management among others.The club rallied members and friends of the club to marshal the roads, man the water station and prepare the post race food tables.The race committee were out at am on Sunday to finalise the cones and signage when news broke that a fallen tree had brought down a power line directly impacting the planned route.East Down AC volunteers were straight into action. They were at the scene in minutes and had even a tree surgeon on speed dial, but they could not gain access.They were determined not to cancel and set about re-routing the race. This is not as simple as it may seem. With a traffic management plan to take into account and new sections to measure as well as the clock ticking, there was a lot of pressure.The wind and rain didnrsquot help and mindful of the wellbeing of runners, a delayed start was not even considered.With some sharp thinking and speedy manoeuvres a new route was hurriedly drawn up.Having advised the athletes that it was no longer a measured K, the start team herded them on to the start line in Ballydugan Estate and the hooter went only a minute or two behind schedule.With a huge sigh of relief Mags Mathieson, the official starter, waved the  strong crowd on their way. Thankfully everything  went to plan and post race comments have been nothing but positive from those who took part.There was high praise for the volunteers along the route, who cheered, clapped and gave out water. It was not the race that East Down AC had planned but with  fresh in our memories, most were simply glad that they got the chance to run.With all that had gone on pre-race there was barely time to consider who the winner might be, but there was a wave of excitement when Neil McCartan of East Down appeared in the home straight and crossed the line  seconds ahead of Owen Carleton of Annadale Striders.This was a bucket list moment for Neil as he is a longtime club member and he ran well to achieve it.It tops off a great season so far and leaves him primed for the track season which is his first love. When Aaron McGrady, also EDAC, was third, the stress of the morning was washed away in the joy of having two members on the podium.Mal McGrady of M.B. McGrady and Co Chartered Accountants presented Neil with the Jimmy Murray Memorial Shield at the finish line and the top three received cash prizes.The ladiesrsquo race was almost pre-determined when Emma Mitchell ndash the current , metre track championndash decided to throw her hat in the ring.However, given that she has been targeting half marathon timesand that the pandemic has played havoc with both racing and training, it is hard to gauge where iniduals are form wise.In the end she had a clear win finishing in . with Sinead Murtagh of Newcastle and District AC taking second place in ..Eimear McCracken of City of Lisburn came third in . to complete the podium.Emma was presented with the Joe Quinn Perpetual Trophy for first female and she took the time to say that she was delighted to support the magnicent Jimmyrsquos Ten and that the hospitality from the host club was first class.From an athlete who has raced at top level all over the world, it was praise indeed.Two shields are presented for club teams in the K and this year Newcastle and District took the honours in the menrsquos race and East Down AC retained the ladiesrsquo title.It is based on the top four men and the top three women home. There is also a relay event where two people split the K with one runner starting on the line and then passing over a wristband at the changeover point.Their team-mate then heads home to record a joint time. Ollie Robinson and Jacob Crawfordwere the quickest all male team.Holly Scott and Willow Farrington of Scrabo took the all female prize and the mixed title went to mother and son duo Maureen Kelly and James Wright .With the podiums decided the spectators turned their attention to looking for friends and family.The race is a highlight for local runners, many of whom do not belong to a club. This does not mean that they are not well able and plenty of fast times were recorded as the runners flooded in.Some were running to test their pace, some to seethey could run the distance with no speed in mind, others were raising funds or dedicating their run to causes.In short, there were all sorts of reasons and all sorts of runners but they were united in their efforts and the thrill of crossing a line to cheers.The fact that they were then brought to tables laden with food was a big surprise as for so long hospitality has been withdrawn, but with restrictions eased and a bit of careful planning the hosts were able to entertain their guests outside.Even the weather played ball by that stage as the rain had stopped and there were shreds of sunlight to lt the atmosphere.Jimmyrsquos Ten is always a memorable event but the  event will definitely be lodged in peoplersquos minds as the race that went ahead against all odds.EDAC would like to pay tribute to their full list of sponsors McMahon People Solutions, PCG Fitness, MC Dental Laboratories, Duffyrsquos Killough, JS Flooring, Murdock Brothers , P. Gardiner Carpets, Bells Supervalu Crossgar, McDonalds Downpatrick, Gordons Chemists, Plusprint, Wrap and Roll, McVeigh Traffic Management, Soaring Productions and main sponsor M.B. McGrady and Co Chartered Accountants. The financial backing is what makes this race an event.Thanks are also due to the members and even more so to those who are simply friends of the club, who give up their time to make the race happen. The hard graft that they put in cannot be underestimated.Finally, last but not least, there is heartfelt gratitude towards every single runner who signed up.Without runners there is no race. The smiles of the finishers and the kind words of support post race make all the hard work worthwhile. Well done and see you all next year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Kilmore overrun Grove in league  ","story":"KILMORE Rec kept their promotion hopes on track with an impressive one-sided victory over a physical Grove United outfit at Robert Adams Park on Saturday.An early penalty kick converted by Anton McGrattan and two further second half goals from Eoin McGrattan and Joe McKinney was enough to see The Blues home and dry in bitterly cold yet sunny conditions.The Blues came firing out of the traps from the first whistle with Kilmore striker Joe McKinney the first to try his luck within the opening minutes, although his effort trickled harmlessly into the gloves of Grove number one Michael Davidson.However, it wouldnrsquot be long until the home side opened their account and after six minutes they were awarded the opportunity to do just that.Following a long ball over the top, Kilmore midfielder Eoin McGrattan spun his marker before he was clumsily clattered from behind inside the danger area.The referee had no hesitation in awarding the penalty kick, which Anton McGrattan dispatched confidently by drilling his effort low and hard to the bottom left corner beyond the reach of Davidson.The Bluesrsquo good start continued as they relentlessly pressed the opposition and didnrsquot allow Grove out of their own half.McKinney danced his way past three opposing defenders before his opportunity at goal was thwarted by a wonderfully timed last ditch tackle from Grove defender David McCallen.This wouldnrsquot deter the ever-dangerous Kilmore marksman, who continued to be a thorn in the side of his United counterparts when he battled to win back the ball before laying off team-mate Patrick Grant for a shot at goal.Grantrsquos effort did swing wide of the post but it was an encouraging sign for the Kilmore team, who clearly had their tails up.Man of the match, Barry Walsh, was enjoying the freedom of the middle of the park, as the Kilmore newcomer flung himself into every tackle necessary in order to gain possession for The Blues.Grove were very much stuck in first gear and were being overran in essentially every area of the park. Kilmore were dealt a blow when Grant came off second best in a crunching tackle with Grove defender Adam McKnight, leading to The Bluesrsquo defender to be substituted on  minutes.However, the silver lining for the hosts came in the form of substitute Joshua Smyth, who made an immediate impact when he entered the fray.Smyth quickly gained possession and whipped in a fast-paced cross to the head of incoming team-mate John McCarthy, whose effort was stunningly saved from point blank range by the reaction of Davidson in the Grove goals.This garnered applause from the sizeable home crowd, who had turned out to support their local side.With half an hour played, Kilmore looked to inflict further damage and almost did so following an eye-catching move which was unfortunate not to double the deficit.Smyth was yet again involved as he played a delicate one-two with the back heel of McKinney before his pass inside to the chest of Eoin McGrattan allowed the midfielder to find team-mate Michael Carvill unmarked at the edge of the box.Carvill unleashed an effort towards goal but it was smartly stopped yet again by Grove custodian Davidson, who was quickly becoming his sidersquos top performer.Any hint of a counterattack from the visitors was quickly dealt with by the confident backline of Christopher Magee, Gary Kennedy and captain Jack Larkin, with Magee in particular winning his inidual battle with Grove striker Jake Long time after time.With less than ten minutes to the interval, Carvill played a short free-kick to McCarthy, who swtly passed to Kennedy  yards from goal.After examining his options, the Kilmore defender decided to take a touch forward before firing a long ranged effort with conviction which ultimately crashed onto the post before falling to the feet of skipper Larkin.The Kilmore captain turned his rebound over the bar although his blushes were saved by the offside flag.Despite Grove proving they were a physically strong side ndash as they never shied away from a tackle ndash they failed to garner any substantial chance throughout the opening  minutes.The half ended with Grove midfielder David Johnston picking up a yellow card for a late challenge on Anton McGrattan.The first real opportunity of the second half fell to Kilmorersquos Walsh, who after a pinball of passes, saw his effort from the edge of the box saved.However, just two minutes later and The Blues would double their scoring tally after marksman McKinney latched on to a long ball before squaring his pass to team-mate Eoin McGrattan for an easy tap in.To their credit, Grove were certainly showing more of a presence in the opposing final third, although they were lacking the end product required to trouble the hosts.Kilmore continued to cause problems and goal-scorer Eoin McGrattan almost added another when he once again showed his marker a clean pair of heels and barrelled down on goal.This time his effort struck the side netting as Grove momentarily escaped conceding a third.The home side refused to settle for just two goals and were almost granted a third when McKinneyrsquos whizzing pass across the box marginally escaped the boot of the onrushing McCarthy.Grove managed to manufacture a seldom chance when captain Michael McNerlin struck a first time volley from  yards which required Kilmore lsquokeeper Christopher Turley to spring into action and tip the ball over the crossbar.However, this seemed to ignite the Kilmore flame further and with  minutes to go they registered their third, courtesy of a surging Walsh run which ended in a pass to McKinney inside the box.The Kilmore striker kept his cool and confidently placed his right footed effort into the net to drown out any chance of a dramatic comeback.Eoin McGrattan made way for substitute John Patterson, who almost added to the scoreline when once again McKinney was allowed to play a pass across goal.However, the substitute fluffed his lines and sent his effort over the bar in what was an escape for the now weathered looking Grove outfit.The visitors were gted a consolation goal in the th minute, after substitute David Long was adjudged to be fouled in the area by Kilmore captain Larkin.Grove midfielder Johnston confidently tucked his effort into the top right corner but seconds later the final whistle sounded.Following the match Kilmore goal-scorer, Anton McGrattan, gave his thoughts on his sidersquos performance.ldquoI thought we controlled the game, he said.ldquoWe could have gotten two or three goals before half-time but we didnrsquot panic.ldquoWe will just take it one game at a time now, we had a setback against Dromara Village a couple of weeks ago but we have now won two on the bounce.He added: ldquoThere is a massive week ahead, we travel

Rio De Janeiro, Love Island star Matthew MacNabb has tangoed his way into the semi-final of RTEacutersquos Dancing With The Stars.The  year-old will be flying the flag for Downpatrick and Northern Ireland on Sunday when he vies to get through to the final.It was a busy night for Matthew and his dance partner Laura Nolan, with two dances each to complete before the dance-off at the end of the show.They danced a sultry tango to Rio by Duran Duran with judge Arthur Gourounlian commenting after: ldquoMatthew, you brought the passion of Rio to the dance floor tonight.Fellow judge Brian Redmond said: ldquoYou started with intensity, commitment to the movement... its just the face thats missing at this stage, your body brought us on the journey.Loraine Barry, another judge, said: ldquoI like this Matthew, I felt you got yourself in the correct tango position.They scored  from the judges but they picked up extra points in the team dance for their group,Turkish Delights, were victorious.These points, combined with the public, kept Matthew safe from the dance-off.Nicolas Roche became the latest celebrity to exit as he and dance partner Karen Byrne lost out in this weeks dance-off against Ellen Keane and Ervinas Merfeldas.Matthew remained coy over rumours of romance between him and his pro-dance partner Laura, ldquoI havent got a clue about what everyone is on about.However, everyone -mdash including the DWTS judges mdash have noticed a certain spark between him and Laura.ldquoWersquove really grown close, admitted Matthew. ldquoI think with dancing, when yoursquore in this process, itrsquos so intense and yoursquore in each otherrsquos pockets for seven days a week and you become emotionally reliant on the person and vice versa.ldquoIt really is so intense and there is a lot of pressure because yoursquove got the whole nation watching you and yoursquove got the producers and your fellow contestants watching and you donrsquot want to let the down, you donrsquot want to let your family down.He added: ldquoEspecially you donrsquot want to let yourself and your partner down because yoursquove put in all the work, we put in ridiculous work every day. I havenrsquot taken a day off in ten weeks.Matthew revealed he has met Laurarsquos parents and that he was planning what he called ldquoa two-person trip once the show comes to an end.When askedhe ever expected to get to the quarter-final of the show, he said, \"Itrsquos amazing to get this far. I had no expectation coming into it.\"I was never a performer, never danced in my le so it was a whole new world. Going into the show Irsquom rsquo \" so I never expected myself to be a good dancer, Irsquom not saying Irsquom a good dancer now but Irsquove definitely improved leaps and bounds since I started.ldquoIrsquom really buzzing at how far Irsquove progressed and hopefully Irsquoll keep that going and improve further from here.He said that he has found the physical demands of dance quite challenging and that his body is breaking down now.ldquoItrsquos constant because yoursquore twisting your body in new ways. Irsquove definitely got an emotional connection and itrsquos something Irsquoll keep up after the show is over, added Matthew.Check out Matthewrsquos progress on Dancing with the Stars this Sunday at .pm on RTEacute One..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Much respected  GP set to retire  ","story":"AFTER almost  years in practice, Dr Alison Smith is retiring next week as a GP in Dundrum and Clough.Health Minister Robin Swann paid a tribute to Dr Smith on a visit last week to the busy Clough surgery of the Dundrum and Clough Family Practice.Mr Swann met Dr Smith and her colleagues, who serve more than , patients in the South Down area.Dr Smith, who lives with her husband Tim in Newcastle, has specialist interests in womenrsquos health, diabetes, learning disability and care for the elderly.Mr Swann said: ldquoDr Smith and her colleagues have been at the forefront of innovations, in particular the implementation of the Multi-Disciplinary Teammodel in the Down Federation.ldquoThe recent extension to the premises here at Clough has been part of the roll-out of that initiative. The practice has recognised both the need for change, and the opportunity that new ways of working provides to improve the quality of care which it can offer to its patients.ldquoShe is an outstanding example of the dedication and professionalism of our GP services.The minister also thanked all of the practice staff or their ldquotireless and ongoing treatment, care and support that they provide to patients, particularly over the past two years.He added: ldquoI know it has not been easy. This has been an incredibly stressful and anxious time for so many of our population and no less so for our GP workforce and their teams who have been in the vanguard of our response to Covid.South Down UUP councillors Jill Macauley and Alan Lewis also paid tribute to Dr Smith.ldquoAlison has served the community of Clough and Dundrum with such attention and dedication over the years, and we have no doubt that her presence will be missed in the local surgeries, their statement said.ldquoWe thank our party colleague and Health Minister Robin Swann MLA for taking the time to call with Alison and all the staff at Clough Health Centre to acknowledge her retirement, as well as seeing around their impressive state of the art facilities.Dr Smith and her husband moved to the Newcastle area in  when he got a job at the YMCA.Originally from Edinburgh and having qualied at Edinburgh University, Dr Smith spent a short time working on the surgical ward of Downe Hospital with Mr Crawford Bell, consultant surgeon.She then worked part-time with Dr Edith Cunningham in Killyleagh and Dr John Kyle in Newcastle before joining the Dundrum and Clough Family Practice as a partner with Dr Kieran Walshe and Dr Alex Greer in .

This is history that we have actually been living and working through which has been good to have been part of that. But I definitely feel ready to move on and itrsquos time for new doctors to be in the practice.She said it was the speed of change that the practice had to contend with at the beginning of the lockdown that proved challenging.ldquoThere is always change in general practice and some of it is not easy but having to work safely through the pandemic while providing a service to our patients was challenging but I think we managed to do that.Dr Smith, who has three adult children mdash Alistair, Sandy and Corinne mdash added that it has been quite emotional for her saying goodbye to her patients over the last few weeks.ldquoThey are like old friends and it was good to be part of their lives. Itrsquos a privilege to be helping people at some of their worst times of their lives.She and her husband are looking forward in several weeks time to welcoming Corinne home from the US for the first since the pandemic.Dr Smith intends to continue to remain on the board of two local charities, MyMy in Newcastle and RIOT in Dundrum..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Patrick Kielty’s love for Northern Ireland  ","story":"PATRICK Kielty has talked about his le, his loves, his passion for Northern Ireland and growing up in Dundrum.Patrick was interviewed by Gerry Kelly last Wednesday night as part of the lsquoIn Conversationrsquo series at the Saint Patrick Centre.He also revealed his thoughts on fatherhood, Brexit and the peace process.Reflecting on his childhood, Patrick recalled the terrible news of the murder of his father, Jack, and how looking back it seemed odd that there wasone bus for one community to go to school and another for the other.ldquoBrexit really was a wake-up call for me, he said and outlined his determination to find common ground. ldquoWeird and wonderful things happen when you decide to share.Patrick also described how he had jumped on a plane after a late night telephone call to his now-we Cat Deely and surprised her the next day in Los Angeles for her birthday lunch.ldquoThe taxi driver from the airport turned to me and said lsquoDo you want me to wait for you rsquo.Even after almost ten years of marriage he said he couldnt believe his luck and joked that being on the red carpet with his we, who is so successful in America, sometimes made people think ldquohes someone sponsored by a charity tagging along.The St Patrickrsquos Choral Society, who are celebrating their th anniversary this year, sang at the sold-out event mdash their first public engagement in over two years.St Patrickrsquos Grammar School student Eva Rowan, who hasjust won the BBC School Young Soloist of the Year competition, performed as part of the evening.The next in the series of events is a conversation on April  with Richard Moore, who was blinded by a rubber bullet in Derry in .Having forgiven and befriended Charles, the soldier who shot him, he has been celebrated world wide as a peace maker by the like of the Dalai Lama and is often described as the lsquoDerry Lamarsquo.Charles will also be part of the conversation by videolink.

The NI Protocol has done just that and allowed the EU and its local poodle, the Irish Republic, to make laws over our heads.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe independent report, published by campaign group Keep Wales Tidy, is described as the first report of its kind since the start of the COVID- pandemic.  It recorded , littered face masks during the period and it said PPE litter, which was included in street cleanliness surveys for the first time, was present in eight per cent of streets. The ‘How Clean Are Our Streets’ report brings together results from thousands of street cleanliness surveys and is intended to give a ‘snapshot’ of litter and other environmental quality issues.  It only covers streets and doesn’t include parks and green spaces. The report found litter related to smoking is the most common type, found on . per cent of streets. While the report outlines the continued challenge of litter, and its prevalence across the nation, it also reported that recorded dog fouling is at its lowest level since street cleanliness surveys began in - and was present on just eight per cent of streets. Litter from confectionery, including sweet wrappers and crisp packets, was found on nearly half of streets and drinks litter remained at pre-pandemic levels and was found on  per cent of streets. Keep Wales Tidy has highlighted the results as supporting its calls for the implementation of Extended Producer Responsibilityin the UK which would place new duties on packaging producers to pay for the treatment or disposal of their goods. The charity, and other environmental groups, believe that would encourage producers to reduce waste and promote more sustainable product design as, it says, is in the case in many European countries. Keep Wales Tidy chief executive Lesley Jones said a public consultation has demonstrated support for such a scheme:  “The prevalence of littered packaging across Wales further strengthens the case for EPR. The responsibility for tackling litter does not rest solely with local authorities and the financial burden on the public purse must be reduced.” .removeWelsh Government deputy climate change minister Lee Water said it agrees with the principles of extended producer responsibility and will make an announcement in “due course”. The street surveys cover a six per cent sample of streets, selected at random, from full lists of adopted highways provided by each local authority.This article originally appeared on our sister site The National. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I thought in spells we played some great football.“I demand more from us in the second half in terms of the care with the ball.

Exhibitors will include Flood Marine, McAlinden Boats, Swim Ireland, Royal Yacht Association to name but a few, and it will be packed full of activities from fun and interactive workshops, to on the water demonstrations and experiences.“We’ve hosted successful events for over  years now, including the Ireland Angling Show in Dublin, so we honestly believe that the increasing passion and interest in marine leisure over recent years calls for a bigger and better show.“For those interested in perfecting their techniques or learning about new products, the show will feature talks from a range of experts in all areas of the marine leisure sector, while also giving guests the opportunity to chat to professionals and visit our exhibitor stands.“We are also delighted to have the support of Lisburn Castlereagh City Council who recognise the enormous potential of Northern Ireland in providing these kinds of homegrown holiday activities.“This is a very lucrative market for everyone in the wider tourism industry and from this exhibition alone we estimate that around £, will go into the local economy. Northern Ireland has so much to offer with quality accommodation and catering, superb activity facilities and of course unparalleled access to water be it lakes, rivers or coast, said Hugh.”Officiating at the event launch and welcoming it to the city, Alderman Amanda Grehan, Chair of Lisburn  Castlereagh City Council’s Development Committee, said that this is exactly the kind of event to show off the versatility of their tourism offering.“Eikon Exhibition Centre which is conveniently located beside the main arterial routes to Belfast and Dublin is now a signicant centre for International events being held in Ireland and the United Kingdom. It will draw in thousands of visitors and millions of pounds in consumer spend and sectoral investment.“Supporting events like this is a core part of our economic strategy for the council area demonstrating that we are also a critical economic generator benefiting the whole of Northern Ireland.“The countdown has now started, and I look forward to visiting Ireland on the Water Expo next year. It will be a true partnership across the marine, tourism, accommodation and hospitality sectors,” said Alderman Grehan.Details on further activities will be announced over the coming months and you can check out our website www.irelandonthewaterexpo.ie or follow us on social media @IrelandonthewaterexpoIf you would like to know more about the Expo please contact us here, email [email#protected] or telephone Grace Mc Dermot, Mara Media Sales Manager, on +  .Northern Ireland  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularSuspected petrol bomb attack at County Tyrone house...NewsNI strike: school buses, bin services, leisure centres and o...NewsEmergency services tasked after swimmer rescued from Lough N...NewsAppeal: Dungannon teenager missing since Tuesday...NewsSeven people injured following three-vehicle crash near Magh...NewsMost Popular                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Jesus said: “...you do good to those who are good to you what credit is that” – St. Luke :. Surely Jesus wants us to do good to those who can pay us back. In his Epistle letter James : St. James says: “... be doers of the word and not merely hearers.” So, whether we pay for someone’s few items in the supermarket or a cup of coffee for a homeless person or volunteer at a charity shop or any one of a number of good deeds, our motivation should be, we are doing it for the Lord Jesus. It doesn’t matterwe are thanked or not, but it does matter that we show Him to the world. The best sermon anyone can preach is the le you live. St. Francis of old said: “Preach the Gospel,necessary use words.” May we seize every opportunity to care for and do something for people so that they may see Jesus in all we can do. We do good not to get ourselves noticed, but to put the spotlight on Jesus. In this season of Lent instead of “giving something up”, do something good to help others.As St. Paul, one of God’s greatest servants said in  Corinthians : “...God loves a cheerful giver”! May you and I give cheerfully of our time, love, support or whatever we can give to help one another on the journey of le.God go with you and may you go with God.Read More Read MoreExtra Covid- booster for over s and those at high riskJesus  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularSuspected petrol bomb attack at County Tyrone house...NewsNI strike: school buses, bin services, leisure centres and o...NewsEmergency services tasked after swimmer rescued from Lough N...NewsAppeal: Dungannon teenager missing since Tuesday...NewsSeven people injured following three-vehicle crash near Magh...NewsMost Popular                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The pay offer would mean another real terms pay cut and comes after eleven years of pay freezes.”However Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Council and the Education Authority said annual pay increases are negotiated nationally and not at local level.Unite says: “The union is seeking localised settlements to deliver improved pay despite the other two signatory unions in the bargaining processes of the ‘Green Book’ NJC having agreed the .% pay offer. Unite is seeking locally-agreed improvements through raising pay grades, reduced working hours, more paid holidays and other benefits.“Council workers, Education workers and Housing Executive workers in Northern Ireland have watched their pay stagnate over the last decade meaning real terms falls in their standards of living of  percent over the period and this is set to get worse. The NJC pay offer of a bare . percent increase is actually a real terms pay cut of more than seven percent set against a . percent hike in national insurance and surging inflation .Unite General Secretary Sharon Graham commended her members in local authorities in Northern Ireland on their determination to win a cost of living pay increase, saying:“I want to congratulate my members working in local authorities in Northern Ireland for the strength of their ballot for strike action they have the full backing of my union in their strike action.“The employers must now respond by tabling a pay deal in line with our members’ expectations and to meet punishing living costs. Unite is determined to see real improvements won by local authority workers in Northern Ireland.”Lead Regional Officer for local authorities, Gareth Scott, called on management to negotiate and highlighted the strength of feeling among his members. “These ballots confirm the determination of Unite members in local authorities to secure a decent cost of living increase. The majorities in favour of strike action in councils, the education authority and the housing executive were exceptional our members are calling time on real terms pay cuts.“Management must now engage with us to identy how they can address our members’ pay expectations within the NJC framework so as to avoid what is likely to be a disruptive dispute affecting council services, school transport and housing executive maintenance.”The picket lines will be going up on Monday morning for the first week of strike action by Unite members.A Housing Executive spokesperson said “Unite the Union have informed us of industrial action planned for next week. We will be taking steps to minimise any potential disruption to our tenants.”A spokesperson for Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council said “Annual pay increases are negotiated nationally on behalf of Councils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Pay is not agreed at a local level and as such, Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council cannot enter into separate local negotiations on pay with Unite.“The National Joint Council has informed all Councils that the - negotiations are complete and the pay award has been agreed.“Nonetheless Council have now received formal notication from Unite regarding their Industrial Action and are currently assessing the situation and the potential impact on services”.A spokesperson for EA said: “As a result of a -day strike by Unite the Union next weekimpacting a wider range of local Government services in Northern Ireland, as well as in England and Wales, the Education Authorityhas warned of disruption to some education and youth services.“The EA is working hard with schools, youth services and our partners to minimise the impact on children and young people as a result of the industrial action.“However, whilst the majority of schools, youth and other EA services are expected to operate as normal or with minimal disruption, it is likely that the strike action will have an impact on some transport, school meals and cleaning services. It is also anticipated that there could be disruption to a number of Special Schools, particularly in the Greater Belfast area, as regular transport for children may not be available, and there may also be a number of Classroom Assistants taking part in Unite’s Industrial action.“The EA will endeavour to keep parents, children and young people informed on the latest updates via our website www.eani.org.uk industrialactionupdates and our social media channels. Schools will also do their best as far as possible to communicate out any key information through their own channels.“However, we know that in some cases, particularly at the start of the week, services may be disrupted at such short notice that advance notication will not be possible, so we would encourage parents to plan ahead and have alternative arrangements in place, particularly in relation to transport and school meals.”“The strike action, which is taking place across a number of public sector bodies is in relation to NJC pay which is negotiated nationally for England, Wales and Northern Ireland by the National Employers for Local Government Services. The EA then implements the outcome of these negotiations.“Whilst we respect the right of those taking part in the strike to raise their concerns, we are disappointed at the decision to take this action in relation to a pay award that has been agreed and settled at a national level with Trade Unions in line with established collective bargaining arrangements."},{"url":null,"title":"spring carnival parade in londonderry for st patricks day ","story":"Antrim and Newtownabbey Council names leisure centres likely to be hit by strike   Emergency services tasked after swimmer rescued from Lough Neagh by person on jet-skiNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My Businesscanonical_urlCANONICAL_URLhostnameCANONICAL_HOSTNAMElocationCANONICAL_URLreferrerEXTERNAL_REFERRERpage_view_id_PAGE_VIEW_ID_scroll_SCROLL_HEIGHTgeo__INJECT_GEO__cid_ga:CLIENT_ID,comScore:CLIENT_ID,compass_uid:CLIENT_IDversionsha-wJFtySqNnAxBmRbBZGkmXyZeJTYkxlpMdJsFNIrrGVlru-DcIEIZ\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-container\" i-amphtml-layout\"container\"Loading...NewsPeopleSpring Carnival Parade in Londonderry for St Patricks DayMayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke, is looking forward to the prospect of leading the citys Spring Carnival Parade with St Patrick this Thursday March th.By Peter HutcheonThursday, th March , : amUpdated Thursday, th March , : am  \"       \"  Mayor of Derry CIty and Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke, launching Thursdays Spring Carnival Parade with Jim Collins from NWCI.The appropriately themed Rebirth and Renewal event is making a welcometo the city centre following a three year Covid enforced hiatus.The St Patrick’s Spring Carnival is organised by Derry City and Strabane District Council with support from North West Carnival Initiative, Tourism Northern Ireland and Good Relations funding.       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The comments were made as the UFU launched its annual schools’ competition. Open to all playgroups, nursery, primary, and special schools, this year’s theme relates to the UFU’s food and farming education resource “Dig in!”, which encourages pupils to learn more about food, farming, and the countryside. UFU deputy president, David Brown said, “This year’s schools competition theme ‘Dig in! to food, farming and the environment’ provides an opportunity for teachers to start the discussion in the classroom about the importance of food and farming in NI, allowing pupils to learn more about how farmers work hard to produce the delicious, high-quality produce on our tables, and their contribution to shaping our landscape in NI, which everyone enjoys. “Climate change has been the front runner in NI this year and our farmers play an essential role in combating the global issue, as they are a key part of the solution. The schools competition helps pupils to enhance their understanding of how farmers create dferent environments in NI which support our economy, rural communities, tourism and recreation.” Mr Brown says every year the competition judges are impressed by the number, standard and creativity of entries for the schools’ competition. “We would encourage all nursery, playgroups, primary and special schools to participate in what is a very worthwhile competition. It’s a great opportunity to express their creativity while learning about one of the most important sectors in NI as they will discover the importance of local food production,” he said. The UFU is pleased to have competition sponsor Asda on board for another year with a range of prizes available for the lucky winners. Joe McDonald, Asda NI corporate affairs manager said, “Asda is a proud sponsor of the school’s competition. It is great to see competition entries grow year upon year, especially with the introduction of a dferentiating foundation category last year - the standard is superb. It is vital to create an awareness of where our produce comes from, and this competition is a great opportunity to do so - educating children on the ‘farm to fork’ story.” Now in its eleventh year, BOIOFW is the perfect partner for the schools’ competition. As part of the prize, the winner of each category receives free transport for their class to the nearest participating BOIOFW farm, and all competition entries will be on display throughout the weekend. Mr Brown says schools don’t need to be competition winners in order to visit real, working farms. “This free event showcases NI’s world-class ‘farm to fork’ journey and reconnects consumers with our farmers, the primary food producers.The weekend underlines the importance of supporting local producers to benefit the rural community and wider economy in NI. BOIOFW is taking place on Saturday  and Sunday  June, and I would certainly encourage all schools to consider organising a trip to a local participating farm on the schools’ day, Friday  June,” said the UFU deputy president. Entry forms have been sent electronically to all playgroups, nursery, primary and special schools. Schools’ competition templates are available by visitingwww.ufuni.org.The closing date for entries is Friday  April .
