(“I just lolled in One Day!” he texted. Then he was gripped.) Do you have any recommendations to keep young adults like him reading?Sally Lewis, 55, piano, teacher, CambridgeA: Stephanie Merritt, an author, journalist and critic, writes:Your nephew is at the perfect age to rediscover a love of books, because he’s finally free of any associations of reading with homework, and also of the unfortunate notion, promoted by exam syllabuses, that certain books have greater value than others and must therefore be slogged through, regardless of whether or not you’re enjoying them.If your nephew was drawn to One Day because it made him laugh, he should definitely try David Nicholls’s most recent novel, Sweet Sorrow, a bittersweet comedy about 17-year-old Charlie’s doomed love affair during a school production of Romeo and Juliet. Sally Rooney’s Normal People is another scalpel-sharp dissection of young love that fully deserves all its accolades, while Joe Dunthorne’s Submarine is a pitch-perfect distillation of male teenage angst, but gloriously funny (think Holden Caulfield meets Adrian Mole). So many coming-of-age stories are written at a distance of decades, but Dunthorne wrote this at only 26, and there’s a freshness to the voice that stands out. And if your nephew enjoys Submarine, he might want to try the ur-novel of teenage angst that inspired it, JD Salinger’s The Catcher in the Rye. I had wondered if this might feel a little dated to contemporary readers, but my 18-year-old son tore through it in a couple of days, so it clearly still resonates.Other comic coming-of-age classics include Jonathan Coe’s The Rotters’ Club, one of my personal favourites, set in 1970s Birmingham against a backdrop of punk and protest, and Roddy Doyle’s The Commitments, about a group of friends trying to get a soul band together in 80s Dublin. Historical contexts may change, but the frustrations and joys of love, sex, music and friendship in young adulthood remain evergreen in both books.Finally, Naomi Alderman’s award-winning The Power was a hit with my son last year. Set in a world where young women have the power to inflict physical pain on men, it’s a pacy thriller that also raises big questions about who gets to hold power and how we use it.Submit your question for bookclinic below or email bookclinic@observer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/988ea83b1c511a8f336fb1c520eccfb2152a3319/0_64_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ebad215c22f4bbd468c0e508c036d42","title":"cho nam joo kim jiyoung born 1982 interview","story":"Cho Nam-joo, 41, is a former television scriptwriter whose novel Kim Jiyoung, Born 1982 became a hotly debated bestseller in South Korea when it was published in 2016, coinciding with the country’s #MeToo movement. Now published in English, Cho’s book uses the story of one woman to reveal gender inequality in all parts of South Korean society, from the privileging of male children to workplace discrimination and harassment. (Despite having the world’s 12th largest economy, a recent gender gap report ranks South Korea 108 out of 153.) Cho lives with her family in Seoul.Do you see things changing – or do young women face the same problems today?There is still sexual abuse and discrimination. Recently in the news, there was an applicant who couldn’t get a job because the public officials gave her a lower score just because she was female. But there has been some change. Women have been protesting and petitioning they have begun to gather in solidarity. Recently, it was ruled that abortion being a crime was unconstitutional. Although change is slow, I believe that we will not go backwards.You’ve said that your father and uncle struck a deal before you were born: had you been a boy, your uncle — who already had five daughters – would have taken you as his own. How does it feel to know you might have been raised in a different family?Actually, that didn’t matter to me. As long as I was a woman, it didn’t matter whether I was living with my uncle or my dad. But if I were born as a son, I think I wouldn’t have been able to understand this life, the world that I live in, in the same way – living as a person on the weaker side, we see the world a lot more broadly.Was it a common practice that a daughter and a son might be swapped?It was more common in my mum’s generation. Hearing about that pact between my uncle and my dad, I was really surprised. But as I say in the book, there was this trend where women would get an abortion if they were pregnant with a girl – which peaked during the 1980s and early 90s.Several K-pop stars, such as Soo-young of Girls’ Generation and RM of BTS, have praised the book. What was the effect – and are you a K-pop fan?We have a newly coined word in Korea: “idol-seller”. Like a bestseller, but we say K-pop stars are idols. The celebrity endorsement has a lot of impact. I have long been a K-pop fan: I’m a fan of the group Mamamoo, and the singer Taeyang.The novel includes a scene where women are secretly filmed in the bathroom at work. How widespread is this in Korea ?There used to be a big website where members shared illegal recordings, but it was closed down in 2016. But even today, there is constant news about people caught making illegal recordings.Parasite director Bong Joon-ho recently said: “Korea, on the surface, seems like a very rich and glamorous country... but the relative wealth between rich and poor is widening. The younger generation, in particular, feels a lot of despair.” Do you agree?Yes, I think that the younger male generation have a certain sense of loss because they think they don’t have as much power, capital or opportunity compared to earlier generations. But I believe that these men should not belittle women, who have even less opportunity.Why are birth rates very low in South Korea?The price of real estate is really high, and we don’t have a lot of job security. Young people find it quite a burden just to live by themselves. Also, our systems for company benefits like maternity leave aren’t very good, so it is hard for both men and women to juggle work and domestic chores. You talk about the challenges of parenting – how do you find being a mother?Usually in Korean society, people do not view women who raise children very favourably. In my case, after I had a career break, I really didn’t have any hope that I could go back to the working me. I had a hard time. But if our social structure changes, so that we all place more value on raising children, I think we can enjoy having children more.• Kim Jiyoung, Born 1982 by Cho Nam-joo, translated by Jamie Chang, is published by Scribner (£12.99).

His first novel, My Cat Yugoslavia, won the prestigious Helsingin Sanomat literature prize for the best Finnish debut. In 2016 he won the Toisinkoinen literature prize, awarded for second novels, with Crossing, the story of two teenage boys trying to leave post-communist Albania. In a review in the New Yorker, Garth Greenwell compared its main character, a pathological liar who exploits assumptions about victimhood, to “another queer criminal, Patricia Highsmith’s Tom Ripley”. In 2018 Statovci won the Helsinki writer of the year award. Crossing is out in paperback next month.Your first novel, My Cat Yugoslavia, featured a racist, homophobic talking cat. Why did you turn away from magic realism in Crossing?There’s something very liberating about magic realism. It doesn’t care about rules. But operating inside the universe of a magic realist novel can be hard for both writer and reader: it’s so easy to get lost in the pool of metaphors. In Crossing I wanted to tell a more rational story. In this book there’s a fair amount of fear, violence, desperation and unfulfilment, which stems from a sense of not belonging, and shame.We can’t pin him down. He’s a victim but also an aggressor…One of the biggest challenges in creating this shape-shifting, trickster-like character was: how much can the reader digest? It’s sad that it’s rather common for victims of oppression to adapt to it. It takes so much more strength to fight for what is right, and many people don’t have the fortitude for it. Violence follows violence. People who are victims of violence sometimes become guilty of violent acts.Does writing about migration bring any particular responsibility?The two protagonists of Crossing believe life in a western country is better than their life outside it. I wanted to show the brutality of being forced to start over in a new place, having to battle against prejudice. I’ve been asked countless times about the gratitude I feel towards Finland for giving me and my family shelter. I’m grateful, of course. But demanding gratitude is hurtful because it ignores the traumas of one’s personal life. The requirement of gratitude many migrants face feels so dismissive, unfair and disrespecting.I don’t tell a story to preach. But you can’t control how readers read: when I published my first book in Finland, there were pieces about me and my work saying things like “to a migrant Finland is cold and racist”.At one point in the novel Bujar enters a reality show talent contest…Being on television used to be an achievement the cameras weren’t filming just anyone. Then the people behind the camera started shooting ordinary people and presenting them in more and more alarming ways. There’s one show where a group of couples travel to a remote island where they are tested on whether they cheat on their loved ones… I don’t know what’s more worrying: that people are treated like this, that people want to take part, or that viewers keep consuming these stories. I wanted to e into this world with a character who is aware of the mechanics by which producers carefully select a point of view. Bujar makes up a backstory he thinks they want, and participates in the competition as someone else after they reject him when he auditions as himself.Crossing’s original Finnish title translates as Heart of Tirana…That wasn’t ambiguous enough in English. When my US editor called to tell me he had Crossing in mind, I immediately said yes – this word in all its meanings truly captures the essence of a book about shifting borders, fluid identities, about the complexity of gender, sexuality and nationality, and the right to self-definition.What are you reading at the moment?I just finished Sally Rooney’s Conversations With Friends – I know, I’m late to the party – and I absolutely loved it. Frances, Bobbi, Melissa and Nick felt like my best friends. The ending was just perfect. I can’t wait to get my hands on Normal People. On my nightstand there’s The Gospel of Eels by Patrik Svensson, just translated to Finnish from Swedish it’s published in English soon. I recently read Elizabeth Strout’s My Name Is Lucy Barton. So alluring and heartbreaking I’m going to read all her books.Which books inspired you to write?Harry Potter and Robinson Crusoe were my favourites as a child. I’ve been inspired by so many writers: Kafka, Kertész, Toni Morrison, Hanya Yanagihara… I hope I’m never in this situation, but if I had to choose one book to read for the rest of my life, it would probably be Bulgakov’s The Master and Margarita. Obvious, perhaps, but it’s so rich, and every time I’ve read it – which is many – I’ve found new layers.• Crossing by Pajtim Statovci is published by Pushkin Press (£14.99).

It is now expected to be run as a business, said Richard Thomas, of Christie \u0026amp Co. “The owner had hoped it could become a single dwelling again, but the new buyer, a high net-worth inidual, has plans to run it as a business: either a hotel or as separate lodges.”The house was sold at auction in 2017 and was put up for sale again in November 2018 with a guide price of £2m.Wordsworth was based in Alfoxton in the village of Holford, near Bridgwater, Somerset, for 12 months from 1797, along with his sister, Dorothy, the diarist.There, with his admiring friend Coleridge a constant visitor, they spent one of the most productive periods in poetic history.Among the greatest works to have sprung from their days watching the seasons pass by on the slopes of the Quantock Hills are Coleridge’s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Kubla Khan, while Wordsworth’s equally famous poem, Lines Composed a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey, inspired by his walk in the neighbouring Wye Valley, was added to the first edition of their Lyrical Ballads in 1798 at the last minute.Dorothy began her journal here in January 1798, and continued it when the siblings moved back to their native Lake District later that year.Champions of Alfoxton include Liz Fuller of the campaign group Save, who has welcomed the “great news” about the property.“This is a remarkable house with a rich history and clearly needs urgent help to prevent it from standing empty any longer,” she said. “It has been on the market for a while now, so this new development is encouraging.”The house stands in 50 acres of land and looks out across the Bristol Channel to Wales. Much of it dates from 1710, when it was rebuilt after a fire. During the second world war it became home to evacuated pupils of a preparatory school in Kent and then began a new existence as a hotel in the 1960s. The dormitories of the school, and later the rooms of the hotel, were each named after poems.For the writer Adam Nicolson, author of The Making of Poetry: Coleridge, the Wordsworths and their Year of Marvels, the decline of Alfoxton has been a cause of sadness.“Somerset is the cradle of romantic poetry, but it is not mentioned as much as the Lake District. There was no other year in which so much great poetry was written, so why did this happen there and then?” Nicolson said when his book came out.“Alfoxton Park is rotting away, and I don’t know why someone doesn’t fix it up. Wordsworth’s house is one of the greatest places of the world and it is neglected – it is as important as the house Shakespeare was born in.”The academic Jonathan Bate, presenter of a radio series about Wordsworth, has also lamented Alfoxton’s fate.“The local council have helped smooth the path to a sale, which had a lot of legal conditions, because they are aware how much the house means to the community,” said Thomas.Fuller said that the house was added to Save’s buildings at risk register in 2016 after the organisation received a nomination from a member of the public with a personal connection. “His school was evacuated to the house during the war and this is how he could tell us that the rooms were named after poems – he remembers the Ancient Mariner being one.”Fuller believe the house has “deteriorated quite a lot and is in quite a poor condition”. “We very much hope that the prospective purchasers will bring the house back to its former beauty and find a viable use for it whether as a hotel or otherwise,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/604bf020c9b4957bc7cefff3431554b129237980/0_250_3814_2288/master/3814.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0124d6a37ed4c66f4328d20813473c3","title":"rishi sunak must stretch the rules to splash cash in the regions","story":"The weak economic data expected this week will leave No 11 worried about revenueTreasury officials, already shell-shocked from a change of management, are expected to come under further pressure this week from figures showing wages growth slowing, retail sales flagging and inflation rising.Ahead of a budget that is still scheduled for 11 March, economists at the finance ministry will want to assess the impact this will have on the public finances. The verdict is unlikely to be music to the ears of Rishi Sunak, now in place as chancellor after Sajid Javid, who balked at Boris Johnson’s insistence he prefer No 10’s advisers to his own, resigned.Sunak, a Yorkshire MP, is a keen supporter of “levelling up” the regions and needs to direct as much spare funds to the north and west as he can to boost growth.The fall in wages and rise in inflation will put an unwelcome squeeze on real wages and consumer spending. The Treasury is only too well aware that consumer spending has propped up the economy for the last three years while business investment, hit badly by Brexit uncertainty, has all but evaporated.But a slip in wages and an increase in inflation could hit VAT receipts, leaving the chancellor short of the firepower he wants to begin levelling up the regions. He needs extra cash for this project and a lacklustre economy might not provide it.Ruth Gregory, UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, says the need to increase spending, and faltering revenues, mean Sunak is expected to announce less restrictive borrowing rules “and that government policy boosts the economy by more over the next few years than we had previously thought”.She says the rule that forces the chancellor to balance day-to-day spending over a three-year cycle could be extended to five years. “He would have more leeway to splash the cash in the next few years and put off any fiscal tightening until after the next election in 2024,” she says.A more radical option would be to drop the balanced-budget objective altogether and replace it with a rule that puts a cap on total public sector net borrowing, including investment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6260be75ec317dfdb3845279553e6fa910c86e5f/0_147_3779_2268/master/3779.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16480d854321dd4326a83a0f305b9352","title":"germany is weakened by doubt just as europe looks to it for a strong lead","story":"A crisis at the top of Germany’s ruling conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), which triggered last week’s downfall of Angela Merkel’s choice of successor as chancellor, has put new life into an old conundrum: what does Germany want?This was the question pondered by Benjamin Disraeli as he contemplated the rise of Bismarck’s Second Reich. It exercised Neville Chamberlain and Lord Halifax in the 1930s. Now it’s being asked again, this time by the German people themselves.The reasons for this re-evaluation are many: a “golden decade” of economic growth may be ending. The EU and the eurozone, hugely beneficial constructs for Berlin, lack vision and confidence. US-Europe strategic ties are fraying. Merkel’s reassuring presence will soon be lost.Germany, regarded since reunification in 1990 as a steadying influence at the heart of Europe, is entering a new epoch of uncertainty just as pressure grows for it to show a lead. Post-war shibboleths are crumbling. And the banished ghosts of the far-right are re-emerging from dark and dusty attics.The rapid rise of the nationalist-populist, anti-immigrant, Islamophobic Alternative for Germany (AfD) reflects this plunge into unaccustomed unpredictability. Founded in 2013, by 2017 it had become the main opposition party in the Bundestag. It holds seats in all 16 state parliaments.Merkel’s CDU and its coalition partner, the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) have, until now, mostly observed an unwritten rule: no cooperation with the AfD. Such ostracism is rooted in memories of how Hitler’s Nazis rose to power.That’s changing. Last week’s crisis arose after CDU leaders in Thuringia broke the taboo, joining with the AfD to pick the state’s governor. In doing so, they defied the party’s national leader and Merkel protege, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer.Merkel condemned the manoeuvre as “unforgivable”, and the deal quickly unravelled. But the damage was done. The AfD and its unsavoury local leader, Björn Höcke, were jubilant. Mocked and mortified, Kramp-Karrenbauer quit.In fact, despite the Thuringia furore, recent research suggests CDU-AfD collaboration is already happening in 18 municipalities. This is recognition of a grim political reality: if the CDU is to remain relevant, it may have to abandon Merkel’s moderate conservatism and shift right, or risk being outflanked.Talk about the end of parliamentary democracy and a return to the Weimar era is exaggerated. It’s obvious a political realignment is overdue. Divided German voters are fed up with politics-as-usual and want something different. But what?It’s only fair at this point to turn the question around and ask: what does Europe and the world want from Germany? In a week that marked the 75th anniversary of the Dresden atrocity, this is a fraught subject. It could prove a classic case of be careful what you wish for.French president Emmanuel Macron wants German backing for his ambitious plans for a more integrated, more strategic, more militarily formidable Europe that can hold its own with the big beasts, meaning China, the US and Russia.Merkel has reacted cautiously. But there have been tentative steps in Macron’s direction. Last week, the Bundestag voted to fund a fighter jet project jointly with France. There is renewed talk of a European army, drawing on the existing Franco-German brigade. Kramp-Karrenbauer, who remains defence minister, favours a raised military profile and higher defence spending. “The need for Germany to become more involved out of its own interests, to develop the will and ability to make a greater contribution, has become even more pressing,” she said last week, talking about Brexit’s impact.How the rest of Europe would react, in practice, to a major expansion in German military capabilities and leadership is a moot point. Poland, for one, might have serious reservations. So, too, ironically, might the French. The US would certainly not welcome it, if the focus was on building European rather than Nato capacity.What the US wants from Germany presents another conundrum. Donald Trump has demanded Merkel cancel the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project with Russia and renege on the Iran nuclear deal. He seems to personally resent Germany’s manufacturing prowess and dismisses climate concerns.Yet appeasing Trump would put Germany at odds with Vladimir Putin just as pressure grows to repair Europe’s relations with Moscow, not least because of rising transatlantic tensions. It would also undermine efforts to strengthen an EU foreign policy.Authoritarian China, an ever more important trade partner which the EU nevertheless terms a “systemic rival”, poses a quandary too. Whether Germany should take the lead in a new Europe-China strategic relationship to offset US protectionism and isolationism is another question Merkel has left hanging.Germany will assume the EU council’s presidency in July, meaning it may have a bigger say than usual on all these issues, including a post-Brexit trade deal. Yet the timing could not be worse.At a time when many in Europe want its most powerful, wealthiest country to abandon its post-war policy of cautious reticence and give a forceful lead, Germany is looking inwards, struggling once again to decide what it wants, and how to avoid the mistakes of the past."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26f81c64841309c1cfe7207c157e0068c174bcf8/72_0_3855_2313/master/3855.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b26b8165b1b5326114de83caaac93f4","title":"reports of social media influence on voters are greatly exaggerated","story":"You know the joke: one dark night, a policeman comes on a drunk rootling around under a street lamp. When asked what he’s doing, the guy says that he’s looking for his car keys. “Is this where you dropped them?” asks the cop. “No,” comes the reply. “Well, then why look for them here?” “Because at least here I can see what I’m doing.”This joke has often come to mind since 2016 when reading explanations – especially media explanations – of the Brexit vote and Trump’s election. The general tenor is that it was all down to social media, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in particular.This has always seemed implausible to me. While it would obviously be ridiculous to deny that social media played some role in these political upheavals, it would be foolish to assign it the critical role. Apart from anything else, putting social media centre stage ignores what had been happening to democratic electorates during decades of globalisation, neoliberal economic policy, rising inequality and austerity. But because the rise of Facebook et al was one of the biggest changes over the last two decades, the temptation to see them as the place to look for explanations seems to have been well-nigh irresistible.Fortunately, it was resisted by researchers at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism in Oxford when they set out to understand where UK voters got their news during the 2019 general election. They tracked the online news consumption of 1,711 people aged 18-65 across mobile and desktop devices throughout the campaign and also surveyed a subset of 752 panellists before and after the vote. What the researchers were seeking to understand was the relative importance for voters of offline and online news and their attitudes to the media and politics more widely.And, as a nice kicker, the Oxford researchers found that “the majority of those who expressed a view felt the BBC had done a good job. BBC stories were widely viewed and read equally by Conservative and Labour voters.” That should make some of those Beeb-hating Tory MPs choke on their muesli.Classic Dom“Inside the mind of Dominic Cummings” is a terrific analysis by Stefan Collini in the  of the thinking of the UK’s new project manager in chief.Privacy on paradeIf you thought we’ve scraped the bottom of the privacy barrel, think again, is the verdict of A World Without Privacy Will Revive the Masquerade, a very thoughtful essay in the Atlantic by Jonathan Zittrain.Computer literate?Douglas Engelbart’s 1962 paper Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework is a seminal treatise on what computers should be for."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c5ad224ca054ce2ae45ec7fa24beb9ce7ceaaa7/18_21_4872_3100/master/4872.jpg?width=940\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=600282c7a12184178c14220bcef9e9c6 940w","title":"richard more shropshire outcast who sailed to riches mayflower","story":"He was only six when he was disowned by his wealthy father, torn from his adulterous mother and shipped to America with the pilgrims on the Mayflower to begin a new life as a servant.For centuries, the extraordinary tale of the Shropshire childhood of Richard More – a celebrated New England sea captain and one of the “first comers” to America – was lost in the mists of time. Now a group of local historians hopes to reignite interest in More and his three young siblings, who died shortly after leaving for the new world on board America’s most famous boat.To celebrate the 400th anniversary of the crossing of the Mayflower this year, the group is putting on events in Shropshire throughout the summer to commemorate the four children and reassert their place in history.“For years, historians thought these More children were waifs and strays plucked from the streets of London to be used as servants in America,” says Mike Brogden, spokesman for the group. The truth was finally discovered in 1959. Court documents tucked away in a descendant’s attic revealed that Richard’s 23-year-old father, Samuel More, the owner of two large estates in Shropshire, had accused his 31-year-old wife Katharine of adultery with a local yeoman farmer.Samuel and Katharine were second cousins, and Brogden thinks they are likely to have had an arranged, or even a forced, marriage in 1610, in order to keep Katharine’s estate within the family. Their long court battle details how Samuel first denied Katharine’s children were his, then banished all four to America, assigning them as servants to passengers on the Mayflower.Court records show Katharine was not told what her husband, a Puritan, had done with the children until three of them had died from the arduous, disease-ridden Atlantic crossing. The eldest, Ellen, was eight the youngest, Mary, only four. “It is so sad. I can’t imagine what was going through the minds of these poor children, or their mother, when they were taken away from her and sent on the Mayflower,” says Brogden. There is a view, he adds, that Samuel was being kind – because of the censure heaped on illegitimate children at the time. “But I can’t think of a more cruel thing to do.”Richard More, sole survivor of the siblings, went on to become a successful merchant and landowner, winning battles at sea and captaining ships that supplied the colonies. He is also thought to have been a bigamist, with wives and children in both England and America – and, at 74, he was excommunicated from a church in Salem for “gross unchastity with another man’s wife”. Brogden says: “One of the accusations, which I think is more than a little silly, is that he ‘inherited’ a quality of adultery.”Brogden first became fascinated by the Mores after hearing another local historian speak about the tragedy more than 20 years ago. “Here in deepest landlocked Shropshire, it’s a bit surprising that we’d have a connection with the Mayflower.” Even now, he says, it’s not common knowledge that the Mores came from Shropshire, and the group’s application to join in this year’s official Mayflower 400 celebrations was rejected. “The Mayflower 400 organisation has produced a map of places in England linked to the Mayflower, and we’re not on it.”He wants the story of the More children to be better known. “Also, we do need to correct the history myth that this ship was full of ‘decent Puritan people’ who had suffered religious persecution and wanted to make a new life. They represented less than half the passenger list. The other half were traders and merchantmen – people hoping to make a fortune.” The Mores were the only children on board without their parents, and the only passengers from Shropshire.Events planned in July and September to celebrate the Shropshire Mayflower children include talks, a play, an evening of 17th-century choral music and a guided walk from the village where Katharine’s lover lived towards the More ancestral home.There will be a display of documents, pictures and objects relating to the children in a museum in Much Wenlock, and Brogden is raising funds via a Justgiving page to erect a brass plaque dedicated to the children."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3766b9d303332d4a77d09b7fa3a29e5104d41c4/0_328_4920_2952/master/4920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be002d6c4ea516b9932f2cf840f3c61e","title":"students in top universities told no room for you in lectures","story":"Students at prestigious universities have been turned away from overcrowded lectures and told to watch classes online or in overflow rooms.The Observer found that students paying £9,250 or more in Manchester, Nottingham and Lancaster, had struggled to get a seat in lectures.

In November, psychology students at the University of Lancaster were sent to overflow rooms and given the option to watch lessons on their laptops because lecture theatres were full..Overflow rooms typically accommodate large audiences when well-known figures give public lectures. All the named universities said that overflow classes were a short-term arrangement to cover busy periods at the beginning of the academic year.Sofija (who declined to give her surname), a student at the University of Manchester who attended the maths lecture, told the Observer that she saw people being turned away. The economics undergraduate decided to stop going to the class because it was so difficult to concentrate.The National Union of Students, which represents higher education students, said that packed lectures were a result of “desperate” universities being forced to bring in as much tuition-fee income as possible.In a separate example of overcrowding, a physics lecture at King’s College London, one of 24 universities in the elite Russell Group, was reportedly so busy that students were told to “cram” in, with some standing at the back.Julio Figueroa, an international student from Mexico who pays more than £25,000 a year to study at King’s College London, said that he had to take his own chair into a physics lecture on at least two occasions. “We are in a Russell Group university, I feel like this shouldn’t happen,” he said.There is no evidence of the university running overflow lectures, and it said it had no knowledge of students taking their own chairs into lectures.Universities UK, which represents higher education providers, said it was important that all students could access lectures. “Universities will be mindful to ensure this does not compromise the quality of teaching or disadvantage students not attending in person. There is no indication of common or continuing issues with students being asked to join overflow or online lectures against their wishes,” a spokesperson said.The University of Manchester said that the maths overflow was temporary. “When overcrowding does occur, we work with schools to resolve it as quickly as possible and use various solutions, including moving the lecture to a larger location or splitting the cohort into smaller groups.”Nottingham said its overflow lecture was the result of a timetabling problem that affected a small number of students. “For a two-week period last September, a particular set of law lectures proved more popular than anticipated for the allocated theatre capacity,” it said. “Rather than disappoint students, we arranged a live stream of the lecture for some 20 students in the adjoining theatre, with full technical support and additional tutorials to ensure they could explore the lecture topic in person with tutors.”Lancaster said it had run overflow lectures owing to the popularity of its course. “There is always a staff member present in the streamed venue and there are mechanisms in place so students can ask questions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0035a7ede875897e9423f6a40a2ac7417a646de/0_80_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e7a9cd7f22de49cb1cff8343e42795c","title":"christian lacroix fashion collaboration","story":"The “Lacroix look” – theatrical frills, bejewelled jackets and flamboyant pouf skirts – defined luxury dressing in the late 1980s and early 1990s. And this weekend, with London fashion week in full swing, it seems it is well and truly back.Most notably, it has been revived by London-based, vintage-inspired brand Rixo, which has garnered a cult Instagram following since its launch in 2015. Its capsule collection created in collaboration with the House of Christian Lacroix (THCL) was unveiled on Saturday and featured the kind of polka-dot prints and power suits that were synonymous with the label during its haute couture heyday.Rixo’s reputation as an “It Brit” brand will no doubt introduce the look to a young, social media-savvy generation, and is likely to cement its resurgence over the coming season.This follows a high-profile outing for a creation from the house’s original designer, Monsieur Lacroix. Earlier this month, actress Florence Pugh, nominated in the best supporting actress category for her role in Little Women, attended the Bafta awards ceremony wearing a hot pink ruffled gown from the Dries Van Noten x Christian Lacroix collection, which launched last September.In 1987, the New York Times’ fashion critic Bernadine Morris described the Lacroix aesthetic as akin to “a costume party where everyone has a good time”. His “more is more” style was summed up by his recurring role in Absolutely Fabulous, where Edina “Eddy” Monsoon (Jennifer Saunders) would intone “Lacroix, sweetie!” as one of her tone-deaf catchphrases.The capsule collection was shown alongside five Lacroix haute couture archive pieces, including a strapless tartan dress from 1992 and an asymmetrical black-and-white polka-dot “bubble” dress from 1991, in a London presentation overseen by the V\u0026ampA curator Stephanie Wood.Lacroix himself was absent. He lost the rights to his name when he sold his fashion house to LVMH in 1987, which then sold it to its current owners, the Falic family, in 2005. Lacroix left the company in 2009 and THCL is now headed by creative director Sacha Walckhoff. Lacroix has spent the intervening years curating museum exhibitions and designing stage costumes, as well as furniture.Topiol also confirmed that THCL was gearing up to make an independent return to womenswear – further evidence that the Lacroix look is here to stay. “I like the idea of initially doing these collaborations, working with younger up-and-coming brands,” he says. “We are definitely looking forward to having our own, standalone line in women’s fashion, but we are not in a rush.”London fashion week is not the first time the Lacroix look has been back in the limelight. In January, THCL collaborated with sustainable denim brand Blanche for a capsule collection that merged “the clean lines and functionality of Scandinavian minimalism, with the grandeur and glamour of French maximalism” and was shown during Copenhagen fashion week.The fashion historian Tony Glenville can see why the Lacroix look is back: “He is a superb colourist and, as we’ve seen from New York fashion week, colour is what is driving a lot of newness, rather than the clothes themselves. His clothes and accessories look ‘right’ in 2020, which they didn’t when he left fashion.“Then it’s the optimism of Lacroix, an injection of energy, wit and drama into fashion. It’s a step beyond anything current in terms of flamboyance and statement dressing. Elements of his influence have been popping up all over.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cea6d012422bd0fe5c1c80c20d6aa5f676a8b4cf/0_1674_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d081e7d0f344d75297f915d8f207fc3","title":"spring clean the key looks from the new collections in pictures","story":"Power shoulders, pastels, frills and black tie dressing, we take some of the trends from the SS20 season for a spin• Read more from the springsummer 2020 edition of The Fashion, our biannual style supplement"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e85e47d84c794910eef8ab9baab72b0de56f9225/0_114_2300_1381/master/2300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02f8daba2dafc76fb607cb122295aa9b","title":"we love fashion fixes for london fashion week in pictures","story":"Vintage Lacroix couture reimagined by Rixo DIY jewellery at Wolf \u0026amp Badger and updated utility basics from Preen Line"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3666a28a838e1ed509b73c147a93fe213be47ff5/0_990_3443_2065/master/3443.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=178f6651cac386592457c19851a8bcfe","title":"yotam ottolenghi recipes for one zaatar salmon ginger fried rice sweet potato feta","story":"Three ideas for solo meals: za’atar salmon baked in tahini, fried rice spiked with slow-cooked ginger and garlic, and roast sweet potato and feta in a piquant tomato sauceThe narrative around recipes is usually about bounty. Family, friends, flatmates: it’s all too frequently assumed that a group of people is gathered around the table, but that is often simply not the case.Whatever the reason for eating on your own – you live alone, the kids are in bed, your partner is away, it’s Monday night and all you want is to eat, happily, alone – it’s not always one that’s properly catered for.Cooking and eating for one should be a lovely thing. It’s calming, peaceful and – selfishly, delightfully – you get to eat the entire contents of the pan (and straight from the pan, too, should you so wish: no one’s looking), all by yourself.Sweet potato cooks quickly, so it’s ideal for a speedy supper for one. Feel free, however, to swap it for another vegetable, such as aubergine or courgette. This serves one, but the sauce can be easily scaled up if you’re cooking for more, or batch cooking. Serve with rice, couscous or a bowl of greens.1 large sweet potato (250g), cut into 2½cm-thick rounds3 tbsp olive oilSalt and black pepper4 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced200g tomato passata½ tsp caster sugar100g datterini tomatoes (or regular cherry tomatoes)1½ tbsp roughly chopped coriander leaves, plus 1 tbsp extra to serve75g Greek feta, roughly crumbled into large chunksHeat the oven to its highest setting. Put the sweet potato, a tablespoon of oil, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper on a medium-sized oven tray lined with baking paper and toss to coat. Roast for 20 minutes, turning the contents of the tray once halfway, or until softened and lightly coloured. Remove and turn the oven to a high grill setting.Meanwhile, make the sauce. Heat the remaining two tablespoons of oil in a medium-sized, ovenproof frying pan on a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, for about two minutes, until lightly golden. Turn down the heat to medium, then add the passata, sugar, whole tomatoes, 150ml water, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and good grind of pepper. Cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened slightly and the tomatoes have softened.Stir through the coriander, then remove the pan from the heat and add the sweet potato rounds. Top with the feta and grill for 10 minutes, or until the feta has taken on some colour. Top with the extra coriander and serve.Many moons ago, my colleague Noor Murad worked at Spice Market in New York, which has since sadly closed its doors. This rice dish, conceived by its genius chef, Jean-Georges Vongerichten, is as simple as it is delicious, so we’ve left it more or less alone. It’s a good idea to make more of the fried ginger and garlic than you need here, because it’s lovely sprinkled over salads, rice dishes and grilled meat. The excess will keep for up to two weeks in an airtight container at room temperature (ie, not the fridge).2 tbsp olive oil25g piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed⅛ tsp aleppo chilli30g unsalted butter1 large leek (or 2 smaller ones), trimmed, cut in half lengthways and then into 2cm-thick half-moons (250g net weight)Salt250g packet pre-cooked jasmine rice (or leftover cooked rice)1 spring onion, trimmed and finely sliced 2 tsp soy sauce1 tsp toasted sesame oil1 large eggPut a tablespoon of oil, the ginger and garlic in a small, nonstick frying pan on a medium-low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 15-18 minutes, until the mixture is crisp and golden. Stir in the chilli, then transfer the mixture to a plate, spacing it out so it can crisp further.Meanwhile, put the butter and a teaspoon and half of the oil in a large frying pan on a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the leek and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes, until soft and lightly coloured. Turn the heat to high and add the rice, stirring to break it up and spread it out over the whole cooking surface. Leave to brown in places, stir again, and repeat for four to five minutes, until the rice is heated through and well browned. Stir in the spring onion, soy and sesame oil, and turn off the heat.Put the remaining teaspoon and the remaining olive oil in a small, nonstick frying pan on a medium-high heat. Once hot, crack in the egg and sprinkle lightly with salt. Top the white of the egg with the ginger mix, sprinkling it evenly all around, and cook for about three minutes, until the white is set and the yolk runny. Transfer the rice to a bowl, top with the egg and serve warm.The combination of tahini and fish will be a treat to those who haven’t tried it before. I like creamy, runny, nutty tahini, which in the UK is usually imported from Lebanon, Palestine or Israel, so try to seek it out. Eat this just as it is or with some bread to mop things up.1 salmon fillet (about 150g), skin-on and pin-bonedSalt and black pepper1¼ tsp za’atar½ tsp sumac2 tbsp olive oil100g baby spinach40g tahini1½ tbsp lemon juice1 garlic clove, peeled and crushedHeat the oven to 240C (220C fan)465Fgas 9. Pat dry the fish and sprinkle with salt and pepper. In a small bowl, combine the za’atar and sumac, then sprinkle all over the top of the salmon to create a crust. Put a medium-sized, ovenproof frying pan (about 18cm in diameter) on a medium-high heat and add a tablespoon of oil. Once hot, add the spinach and a small pinch each of salt and pepper, and cook until just wilted – about 90 seconds to two minutes. Lay the salmon skin side down on top of the spinach, drizzle the remaining tablespoon of oil over the flesh side and transfer the pan to the oven for five minutes.While the fish is cooking, whisk the tahini with a tablespoon of lemon juice, the garlic, a good pinch of salt and 45ml of water in a small bowl, until smooth and quite runny.When the fish’s time is up, remove it from the oven, pour the tahini mixture all around (but not over) the salmon, and return the pan to the oven for another five minutes, or until the fish is cooked through and the tahini is bubbling. Spoon over the remaining half-tablespoon of lemon juice and serve straight from the pan. aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish.

The Reds manager was speaking from a place of comfort after his side pulled 25 points clear at the top of the Premier League thanks to a 1-0 victory at Norwich thanks to a goal from substitute Sadio Mané.Uefa’s decision to ban City from European competition for contravening financial fair play and misleading European football’s governing body sent shockwaves across football on Friday. But while Klopp insisted he was not across the details of events off the field he showed solidarity with his fierce competitor on it.“To be honest I feel for Pep and the players. Wow. They did, for sure, nothing wrong. They just played football and sensational football. Wherever Pep was he has helped each league to improve. But then in the end we all have to respect some rules and I have no idea if they did or not.”Klopp revealed that Mané had been fit to start against Norwich after returning from a hamstring injury but he had chosen to keep the Senegalese forward on the bench with Wednesday’s Champions League fixture against Atlético Madrid in mind.“Sadio could have started today, of course, but I wanted to have a free decision for Tuesday. I don’t think too often about these things but we had two players – Fabinho and Mané – coming back from injury and they should not play two games in a week, and the quality of the other boys is enough that you don’t have to push somebody through.“It was perfect for Sadio to get a few minutes today, but it looked like he was ready.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd7038844f801f1f63612b66ed2175ef25fe38a4/0_9_3398_2040/master/3398.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74937b5f24718b7bc010069d8a321b0f","title":"manchester city premier league sanctions ffp breaches","story":"Manchester City could face sanctions in the Premier League, potentially being docked points, for the same alleged financial fair play breaches that resulted in Uefa imposing a two-year ban from the Champions League and €30m fine.The Premier League has been progressing with its own investigation into the club’s alleged falsification of its sponsorship revenues. That is understood to have involved some hearings at which City have been represented by lawyers. Neither the league nor the club has been prepared to comment on the investigation, but the new Premier League chief executive, Richard Masters, confirmed recently that it is continuing.As City have been handed a severe punishment by Uefa’s club financial control body (CFCB), against which the club is appealing to the court of arbitration for sport, the Premier League could impose heavy sanctions if it too finds the serious allegation proven that City breached their trust. The Premier League has its own FFP-style regulations, introduced two years after Uefa’s, when its 20 clubs immediately transformed a previous overall loss of £219m into a £198m profitThe Premier League announced last March that it had begun an investigation into City’s affairs, releasing a statement which appeared to cover all the areas in which the defending champions had been accused of wrongdoing by the German magazine Der Spiegel, based on “leaks” of internal emails which City said had been hacked.The first, which led to Uefa’s guilty finding, was that City had overstated their sponsorship revenues to Uefa and in their own accounts between 2012 and 2016, because the club’s owner, Sheikh Mansour of Abu Dhabi, was largely funding the stated £67.5m sponsorship by the country’s airline, Etihad. That was a breach of trust under Uefa’s FFP rules, which limit how much an owner can put into a club to bankroll losses.Der Spiegel and other publications with access to the same emails also accused City of making an irregular payment to the agent of Jadon Sancho when he was a 14-year-old player in the club’s youth system, and of being involved in a “third-party ownership” player investment fund. City have denied any wrongdoing. The Premier League came under pressure, reportedly from other major clubs, to mount its own investigation after the CFCB announced last March that it was investigating the FFP allegations.

He knew from the moment he took the perfect touch on his chest and certainly from when he made the sweetest of volleyed connections. But, really, Bergwijn knew before the game. He knew because of a promise he had made.To understand Bergwijn is to understand his friendship with Appie Nouri, the Ajax playmaker who had the world at his feet until the day in July 2017 when everything was ripped away. Bergwijn remembers how he had played in a pre-season friendly for PSV against RKC Waalwijk, scoring twice and feeling good. Then came the news from Ajax’s game with Werder Bremen. “My world collapsed,” Bergwijn says.Nouri had felt unwell and he almost placed himself on the ground, with the back of his head on the turf. He lost consciousness, suffered a cardiac arrest and, all of a sudden, this seemingly fit and healthy footballer was fighting for his life. Although he survived, he suffered catastrophic and permanent brain damage.Bergwijn met Nouri in the Ajax youth system when they were seven and they quickly became inseparable. “Since then we are best friends, brothers,” Bergwijn says. They shared the same field for six years until Bergwijn’s departure for PSV and they would continue to play together thereafter for the Dutch junior teams.There is no update on Nouri’s condition. The situation is impossibly sensitive and his family are keen to guard their privacy and that of their son. Suffice to say it is grave and Bergwijn’s voice crackles with emotion as he discusses it.“When I heard Appie had brain damage, I just can’t describe my feelings,” Bergwijn says. “At that time I didn’t sleep so much. In the first weeks I was scared to play, scared to go on the pitch because Appie was a young boy and out of nowhere … It was difficult. It’s still difficult. I speak to his brother every day but it’s still difficult.”Bergwijn speaks to Mohammed Nouri, Appie’s youngest brother, and their conversation before the City game was particularly poignant. Bergwijn has previously said that everything he does, he does for Appie. “I spoke with his brother and he told me: ‘You’re going to score for Appie,’” Bergwijn says. “And I said: ‘OK, watch me, I’m going to score.’ I did it.”When the goal went in, Martin Tyler provoked no little mirth when he roared in commentary: “Stevie Wonder!” but the nickname seems to have stuck. “Ah, Stevie Wonder,” says Seb on the training ground reception as he welcomes in journalists for this interview. The affection is plain. The club ambassador Ledley King is knocking around and he simply describes Bergwijn as a “lovely person”.With all the tattoos, the muscular frame and the pedigree as a PSV winger, there have been the inevitable comparisons to Memphis Depay, who is now at Lyon. Yet they are different characters. Whereas Depay is extravagant, Bergwijn is quiet, softly spoken. He is a devout Christian and one of his tattoos contains the opening line of Psalm 23 – The Lord is My Shepherd. But it is another two, emblazoned across his knuckles, that offer insight into his single-mindedness. “FEAR NONE,” they say.Bergwijn fell out of love with Ajax and, if the club’s youth management at the time – headed up by Jan Olde Riekerink – could do it all again, they would surely make different choices. When Ajax tried and failed to re-sign Bergwijn from PSV last summer, it felt like an admission that he had been one who got away.Ridiculously the seeds of the parting were sown over a dispute about a pair of regulation black-and-white Adidas boots. Bergwijn’s were worn out and so he asked the kit man for new ones, only to be told to forget it. Ajax would decide when it was time for a new pair. They were in charge. Bergwijn asked his father, also called Steven, and, seeing that his son needed them, he bought him a pair. When Bergwijn turned up in them the next day, the hierarchy were angry.All very bizarre but things snowballed and would reach the point of no return at a tournament towards the end of the 2010-11 season. Incensed at why his son was not playing, Steven Sr staged a one-man protest, waving a white handkerchief at the coach, Orlando Trustfull. What made the scene even more comical was that Trustfull was on the opposite touchline to him and might not have noticed. It is believed that the assistant referee on Steven Sr’s side – who was provided by Ajax – told Trustfull.“I didn’t have the feeling at Ajax any more and, if that’s gone, you have to leave,” Bergwijn says. “If I have no feeling, when my heart isn’t there, it’s over.”Aged 13, Bergwijn did not want to move from Almere, his hometown, which is half an hour outside Amsterdam, to Eindhoven, where he had been offered digs by a local family. And so his father would drive him there and back for training each day – a round-trip of at least three hours. Steven Sr was not a professional footballer but Bergwijn says his uncles were, with one of them having been on the books of Roda JC.“The alarm went off at 5.30 every morning,” Bergwijn says. “My dad drove me to Eindhoven for training at 9am, he slept in the car, it finished at 11am, then we went back and I’d be in school in Almere until 4pm. We did that for four or five years. After that I started living in Eindhoven.”The sacrifices have come to feel worthwhile, particularly after the dream move to Spurs, which did come with controversial trimmings. Bergwijn had phoned the PSV interim manager, Ernest Faber, on the morning of the club’s game against Twente on 26 January to tell him he wanted the transfer and to seek his blessing for a trip to London to tie things up, which he got. PSV, though, forbade him from travelling as they did not have an agreement with Spurs. Bergwijn travelled regardless.Cue a period of drama and haggling, during which Bergwijn took the unusual step of releasing a video in which he insisted he had not refused to play against Twente. In the end everything was resolved and Spurs had a player their scout Brian Carey had watched extensively for two years. Other clubs had wanted him at various times, including Internazionale, Sevilla and Leicester. To Spurs it felt like a coup.“My father called me and said: ‘Pack your stuff, you’re going to London,’” Bergwijn says. “It was fast. I didn’t expect to make the transfer in January. I thought in the summer. But if Tottenham wants you, you can’t say no.”Bergwijn has played only one Premier League game but what struck him against City was the intensity and physicality, which he also noticed in PSV’s Champions League game against Spurs at Wembley last season. One thing is clear – he has the physique to cope.Bergwijn was relatively slight when he joined PSV and it meant he had to concentrate on his game intelligence and technique. But he slowly filled out, to the point where he acquired what the Dutch like to call the frame of a “wardrobe”. “It’s genetic. I’m not so much in the gym. I don’t push weights. It’s natural, core.”At PSV Bergwijn learned from a few old masters on the coaching staff, namely Ruud van Nistelrooy, Luc Nilis and Boudewijn Zenden. He can now feel the surge of expectation levels but, asked whether he could achieve the same status in England as Van Nistelrooy, he does not seek to dampen them. “That’s why I’m here,” Bergwijn says. “You want to be the biggest, the greatest. I hope I can be that big in England.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18eaba0635a9794cd24817e5b540f9f6a8199daa/1064_0_3970_2382/master/3970.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f49f2024d8f2c23242ed3a8ccafd1f4b","title":"this much i know vincent kompany manchester city anderlecht","story":"The footballer, 33, on tackling racism, studying for an MBA, and why populism is a dangerous gameThe first thing I can remember is riding my tricycle around the balcony of our very small apartment in Brussels. Looking back, it seems so dangerous.My mother grew up in rural Belgium and one day she brought home my father – the kid from Africa. That was a big contrast for a local family then. But it shows we can all progress and keep progressing.As the child of a migrant, you quickly learn about inequality. My parents told me: “You will have to work twice as hard as kids from other backgrounds.” I thought: “OK, if I work twice as hard, I will be twice as good.”My neighbourhood had a lot of gangs, but I would remind kids in the same situation that the world is a lot bigger than the place you know and want to dominate, and it is full of opportunities. You just need a goal. Mine was football. It’s easy to take the wrong path, but what happens on the next street corner could define the rest of your life.Celebrating a goal in front of thousands of fans is a weird experience. Before I hit my long-range goal for Manchester City against Leicester in May, which helped us to win the Premier League title, a teammate shouted: “Don’t shoot!” And I thought: “Why not? Let me do what I want!” My happiness was a mix of rage and adrenaline exploding together.Suffering racist abuse inspires the same feelings in me as any other injustice: anger and revolt. I used to respond, but now I look at the bigger picture: where can I voice my opinion and complain? And what is the ersity of that governing body? Populism upsets me. It’s a dangerous game played by people who understand the implications of what they do, but are just too driven to win. We need serious debate. Everything is too ideological.Studying for my MBA made me feel vulnerable – in a good way. I was way out of my comfort zone. I wasn’t awesome, but I worked myself up to a good level. Learning how to build a bigger vision prepared me well for my new management role at Anderlecht.There is no harder job than being a parent.

The presenter was found dead on Saturday.In the now-deleted story, the Sun highlighted the card mocking the alleged assault of her boyfriend Lewis Burton in December.The “exclusive” story about the card quoted the card illustrator, Samuel Hague, who said his latest creation has been left “blank inside for your personal message” and comes with a “good quality red envelope”.When asked about the card, he said: “There’s nothing I wish to add. I’m surprised that’s the card you choose to write about. I’ve joked about far worse.”Love Island has attracted substantial press coverage for the aftercare support given to it contestants, after two people who had previously taken part in the hit ITV2 show killed themselves. The channel has insisted that these deaths happened long after the iniduals were on the show.Love Island has proved to be a financial cash cow for the broadcaster which last summer made clear it would provide substantial aftercare support to those who take part in the programme.Flack was due to host Love Island’s first winter edition, which is currently being broadcast from Cape Town in South Africa, but was replaced at the last minute by Laura Whitmore.After being charged with assault, Flack was forced to stay away from her boyfriend and had severely limited her social media output.On Saturday afternoon the Sun’s executive editor, Dan Wootton, paid tribute to Flack: “Caroline was hung out to dry by ITV. She was distraught they didn’t stand by her. And distraught about the lack of support she was given. Caroline and I were devastated to attend the funeral of our friend Mike Thalassitis last year. I cannot believe we are here again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82ffe756ff31fa2da948dffcfab27b4bd7056f7b/0_3_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ce3e077c9e192520dbdcb58f9423f0c","title":"whose job is it to stop the livestreaming of mass","story":"There are calls for change after Facebook twice hosted livestreams of deadly attacks, but eradicating undesirable online content can be fraughtWhen a soldier in Thailand killed 29 people and injured more than 50 others last weekend, his bloody rampage was reportedly broadcast live to Facebook for almost five hours before it was taken down.The attack happened almost a year after the Christchurch shooter livestreamed 72 minutes of his attack on two mosques that left 51 people dead and 50 injured.The latest incident has revived questions about who should be responsible for removing harmful content from the internet: the networks that host the content, the companies that protect those networks, or governments of the countries where the content is viewed.Australia’s communications minister, Paul Fletcher, wrote in an opinion piece this week that it was “frankly pretty surprising that a government needs to request that measures be in place to protect against the livestreaming of murder”.Australia is preparing to introduce an online safety act, which will create rules around terrorist-related material, as well as cyber-abuse, image-based abuse and other kinds of harmful content.But while the question of whether to take down a livestream of murder is an obvious one, decisions about other kinds of take-down requests can be fraught.“Some of those requests are kind of scary,” says John Graham-Cumming, the chief technology officer of US web security company Cloudflare. “In Spain you have Catalonia trying to be independent, and the Spanish government saying ‘that is sedition, can you remove it?’”Cloudflare doesn’t host content itself, rather it protect sites that do from distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that could take them offline. Yet, Cloudflare has found itself at the centre of debates around what sort of content is acceptable online, and whether tech companies should be making those decisions.After American woman Heather Heyer was killed in 2017 while counter-protesting a Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Cloudflare came under pressure to stop providing protection for the neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer.Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince ultimately pulled protection for the website, but not without reflecting on the implications of his decision.Let me be clear: this was an arbitrary decision. It was different than what I’d talked talked with our senior team about yesterday. I woke up this morning in a bad mood and decided to kick them off the Internet … It was a decision I could make because I’m the CEO of a major Internet infrastructure company.Having made that decision, we now need to talk about why it is so dangerous. I’ll be posting something on our blog later today. Literally, I woke up in a bad mood and decided someone shouldn’t be allowed on the Internet. No one should have that power.After the Christchurch shooting, Cloudflare again debated whether to stop providing services to 8chan, the forum where the perpetrators in the El Paso and Christchurch shootings had posted about their plans. Again the company decided to accede to demands it cut ties, and 8chan was taken offline.Six months on, Cloudflare’s chief technology officer, John Graham-Cumming, tells  Australia the company would like to see a legal framework in each jurisdiction that sets out what a company’s obligations are – particularly for companies that don’t host the content themselves.In the UK, the government will appoint Ofcom to issue fines to social media companies that fail to remove harmful content.The online safety act the Australian government is consulting on will give the e-safety commissioner the power to:It will also allow the minister to set via legislative instrument a set of online safety expectations social media companies will need to comply with.While this will makes things clearer for tech companies, it doesn’t spell the end of their headaches.As Graham-Cumming points out, when one government has a law in place, then other governments can make similar demands.“There is this tension between this sense of global internet, and then local policing.”Graham-Cumming says the world is still getting to grips what role tech companies should play in determining what should be allowed online.“I think what has happened is some quarter of the public is saying to technology companies: ‘you decide for me’. And that’s an unusual situation where private companies are being asked to make public policy like that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95969ba0c659daed958030cd9abaf31cab44332a/785_731_5070_3042/master/5070.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39e5addfdb5f10807fd5b03fba2c451c","title":"the former addicts saving lives with naloxone podcast","story":"Anti-overdose drug naloxone has been in clinical use since the 1970s but not always where it’s needed most. ’s Jamie Grierson visited Redcar in North Yorkshire where a group of former drug users provide at-risk people with kits that could save their lives.

It uses tax havens, and critics say its executive salaries are too high and its accounts are opaque.In 2011, the then secretary of state for international development, Andrew Mitchell, set out a new vision for CDC, pledging to make it more “socially and environmentally responsible”, with fewer investments in “harmful tax regimes” and greater transparency. He was concerned that too much money was going to private equity intermediaries, with the result that not enough was going to development projects.But in 2019, the Independent Commission for Aid Impact gave the CDC an “amberred” rating, finding that it had produced an “unsatisfactory achievement in most areas”.And, according to Doing More Harm Than Good – a new report from Global Justice Now, a social justice organisation – CDC, which in 2016 saw its potential investment budget increase from £1.5bn to £6bn, remains a cause for concern.The report says that, despite Mitchell’s reforms, which were designed to reduce the amount of money being siphoned off by intermediaries, CDC today invests an annual £2bn via private equity funds compared with £1.9bn in 2011.“CDC has demonstrated a near-total resistance to reform by continuing to make more profit than it should and by channelling its investments through tax havens,” said Daniel Willis, an aid and climate campaigner at Global Justice Now and co-author of the report. “This ‘market knows best’ approach to development uses aid money to facilitate the extraction of wealth from the global south to the global north – the exact opposite to what any institution with a development mandate should be doing.”Global Justice Now highlighted several CDC investments which it said were a concern. These include the Abraaj Growth Markets Health Fund, which invests in private healthcare institutions around the world, and Bridge International Academies, a low-cost private school chain with significant operations in Kenya, Nigeria and Uganda.The report states: “Our research has found numerous issues with Bridge schools, including exclusion of poor and disadvantaged children violation of health and safety and labour conditions and a severe lack of transparency and accountability. The situation became so serious that authorities in Kenya and Uganda actually tried to stop the schools operating.”A spokesperson for Bridge said the research referred to in the report dated from 2016 and claimed that it had refuted the allegations, adding: “We have educated a million children living in extreme poverty consistently outperform national averages in government exams and have been independently shown to deliver equity of learning.” CDC has also invested in a company which operates coal-burning cement factories in east Africa, one that owns a petroleum pipeline in Cameroon, and another that owns an oil-burning power plant in Benin.The report states: “The evidence presented here undermines the claims made by government ministers … that CDC is ensuring that its investments will ‘soon in real terms’ be compliant with the Paris agreement on climate change.”Willis said: “This is not development as we know it. CDC has continually failed to show how its investments are genuinely tackling poverty around the world. What’s more, the aid money being channelled through CDC is actually exacerbating inequalities, damaging the environment and undermining human rights.”A spokeswoman for CDC said: “The report contains numerous factual errors. It also demonstrates a broad philosophical opposition to the involvement of the private sector in fighting climate change and alleviating poverty. We disagree with that view. No country has escaped poverty without a strong private sector creating jobs, providing services and generating much-needed tax receipts. All 193 member states of the United Nations, including all 54 African countries, endorse this approach, Global Justice Now does not.”A DfID spokesperson said: “No country can defeat poverty without economic growth. UK aid helps lift millions of people out of poverty by creating jobs.“We continue to work closely with CDC to ensure it delivers investments, which benefit the world’s poorest countries.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14168f2ca9775bf317697c0aed96d0937ad3c4b8/0_175_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed5d3851a0d3ce7a7d008442b19bc984","title":"keir starmer refuses to promise jobs to labour leadership rivals","story":"Frontrunner for top post won’t commit to shadow cabinet posts for Nandy or Long-BaileyKeir Starmer on Saturday refused to guarantee his two remaining rivals for the Labour leadership places in his shadow cabinet if he succeeds Jeremy Corbyn. Meanwhile, anxiety grew among MPs from different wings of the party over its future direction.At a leadership hustings in Glasgow, held the day after shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry was eliminated from the contest, Starmer said he “saluted” Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy.But the bookies’ clear favourite declined to invite either of them into his top team. “I don’t think any of us are going to get into jostling for positions on this,” Starmer said.In response, Long-Bailey said: “I feel a bit sad that Keir doesn’t want us in his shadow cabinet. I know we don’t agree all the time, and our visions are probably very different, but we meet on areas of common ground, and that’s what would make us a strong shadow cabinet and I would have Keir and Lisa in my shadow cabinet.”Nandy indicated that she would also welcome both rivals to serve under her, saying she would be “proud to serve alongside these two”.Thornberry was knocked out of the contest after failing to reach the necessary threshold of support from local parties or Labour affiliates.At a deadline of midnight on Friday, she had 31 nominations from local constituency parties, two short of the 33 needed, and had failed to receive any nominations from affiliates. Starmer, Long-Bailey and Nandy had already met the requirement to get on to the ballot papers, which will go out to party members in the next few days.Starmer’s remarks came, as behind the scenes, MPs from the right and left of the party advanced their own demands for a new shadow cabinet.Critics of the Corbyn project said that if the next leader did not signal a clear departure from the recent past by placing figures such as Yvette Cooper, Hilary Benn and Rachel Reeves in key posts, then Labour would have “learnt nothing” from its disastrous election defeat in December.This wing would like to see Cooper as shadow home secretary, Reeves as shadow chancellor, and Benn as shadow foreign secretary. “If we do not make these kinds of appointments under Starmer or whoever it is, then we are saying we do not want to win elections, full stop,” said one former minister.But leftwing MPs sympathetic to Corbyn were also flexing their muscles, saying that if Corbynites like Long-Bailey are excluded members will rise up in protest. “They will not put up with a move back to New Labour and centrism,” said one MP. “We will have a party that is completely ided again between the majority of the parliamentary party and the majority of the membership.”Throughout the contest, Starmer has pitched his campaign to the left in order not to alienate members, who have the final say. But another MP said: “The question is, if Starmer wins, what will he do then? Who he appoints to the shadow cabinet will be the first big signal.”At yesterday’s hustings, Long-Bailey was the only remaining candidate who would grant the Scottish parliament legal powers to hold a second independence referendum, saying that to refuse this “would drive more of our voters into the arms of the Scottish National party”.Starmer did not rule out the possibility, saying: “It is an interesting question, but we shouldn’t get sucked into that. The SNP are constantly using the constitutional issue to mask other issues.”But Nandy reinforced her opposition to another independence referendum saying: “We have to stand up for Scotland remaining in the UK, and for solidarity across the nations and regions of the UK.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7a9ded08a315ff1578551cf2ef0e048b7c4658a/453_19_3047_1829/master/3047.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e1b10da4b03cc73dd0e408da7520447","title":"mary lou mcdonald violent dissident republicans should disband","story":"Violent dissident republicans should disband, the leader of Sinn Féin has said. Anti-peace process renegades threatened the party’s vice-president, Michelle O’Neill, and veteran policing spokesman Gerry Kelly after they supported a recent recruitment campaign for new Catholic officers.The party’s president, Mary-Lou McDonald, said they would not be deterred or intimidated by the gunmen. She added: “These people have no politics, no strategy and nothing to offer. They are at war with their community and are now threatening political representatives who serve the people.”The event was intended to encourage more Catholics to join the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). Senior commanders have become concerned about a slide in the proportion of Catholic officers amid the threat posed by dissident republicans who try to kill members of the security forces.The Sinn Féin president said: “Sinn Féin will not be deterred or intimidated. These groups have nothing to offer. It’s time they packed up and disbanded.”O’Neill and Kelly’s attendance at a PSNI recruitment event was hailed by the chief constable, Simon Byrne, as “seismic and historic”. It was the first time such a senior Sinn Féin figure had attended such a meeting, although the party has expressed support for police in Northern Ireland on many occasions in the past.Last year there were attempted bomb attacks by dissident republicans targeting police in Belfast, Craigavon in Co Armagh and near the Irish border in Fermanagh. The New IRA and Continuity IRA are involved.Police have described as “cruel and disgusting” anti-PSNI recruitment posters depicting an officer who was severely injured in a bomb attack. The posters used a picture of Peadar Heffron along with a warning that anyone thinking of joining the police could suffer similar injuries. Heffron lost a leg when a dissident bomb detonated under his car near Randalstown in 2010 as he travelled to work. He now uses a wheelchair.Meanwhile, McDonald commended her negotiating, Executive and Assembly teams – led by O’Neill – for “working hard for citizens”. She listed recent successes following the restoration of devolved political powersharing at Stormont.She said: “Already in the executive we have seen measures taken to tackle poverty, including moving quickly to end the nurses’ dispute of equal pay extending welfare mitigations and a new housebuilding programme has been announced. Additional funding has been made available for education, and the victims and survivors of the contaminated blood scandal in the north will receive compensation payments.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/884fea00ddf1e7ed6b7390f16fef87ee2d124dc3/0_21_2758_1654/master/2758.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a57607f5816b34eb99d8c564411ee223","title":"prime minister chancellor history of rivalry between 10 and 11 downing street","story":"A history of the rivalry between 10 and 11 Downing StreetHarold Macmillan and John Selwyn LloydIf ever there was an example of the ongoing feud between the households at 10 and 11 Downing Street it was under the Conservative prime minister Harold Macmillan (1957-63). As with the dispute between the Treasury and Boris JohnsonDominic Cummings, the prime minister’s desire for higher public spending and faster growth was the root cause. Two of Macmillan’s chancellors, Peter Thorneycroft and Derick Heathcoat-Amory, resigned. Their successor, John Selwyn Lloyd, lasted longer – nearly two years – before being fired. Indeed Macmillan was at odds with No 11 most of the time, preferring the advice of the Oxford economist Roy Harrod, in effect his unofficial adviser.Edward Heath and Anthony BarberA prime minister’s desire to dominate his chancellor was achieved most fully in practice in Heath’s government. His first chancellor, Iain Macleod, died within a month and his successor Barber (1970-74), whose main interest was tax reform, found himself dominated by Heath when it came to macroeconomic policy. Heath’s decision to speed up the pace of public spending and “go for growth” in reaction to what was then considered the high level of unemployment marked the first appearance of the phrase U-turn. The Tory manifesto of 1970 had said public expenditure needed cutting back. Heath became his own chancellor, with unhappy results .Harold Wilson and James CallaghanDissatisfaction with the Treasury was rife in the first Wilson government of 1964-70 - so much so that the Department of Economic Affairs was set up under Wilson’s deputy George Brown as a rival to Jim Callaghan’s Treasury. The thinking was that the Treasury was too cautious and a restraint on economic growth. It was the decade of two National Plans, aimed at faster growth. However, Callaghan’s 1964-67 chancellorship was chronically impeded by Wilson’s decision in 1964 not to devalue the pound until the event was forced on him by the markets in 1967. This crucial prime ministerial decision also foiled the work of the Department of Economic Affairs. It was wound up.Margaret Thatcher and Nigel LawsonThe most memorable clash between prime minister and chancellor over special advisers was between Margaret Thatcher and Nigel Lawson in October 1989. Lawson, who was struggling to persuade the prime minister to agree to the pound’s entry into the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM), was frustrated by what he regarded as the influence of Thatcher’s economic adviser Alan Walters, who reinforced her doubts. Lawson resigned in a huff. Ironically, Walters also resigned and a year later the new chancellor, John Major, persuaded Thatcher to relent. The UK entered the ERM in October 1990 and crashed out spectacularly two years later.Tony Blair and Gordon BrownThe relationship between John Major, as prime minister, and Ken Clarke, as chancellor (1993-97), was relatively peaceful. But that between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown was notoriously stormy. Blair granted Brown an unusual extension of Treasury powers over domestic policy, but what soured relations was Brown’s persistent battle to become PM. Among many odd episodes, Blair’s economic adviser, Derek Scott, was excluded from many Treasury meetings, despite agreeing with Brown that the UK should not join the eurozone. After Brown finally took over in 2007 he himself often clashed with chancellor Alistair Darling.David Cameron and George OsborneDavid Cameron and George Osborne were good friends and keen to avoid a Blair-Brown-style conflict. They were conscious of Nigel Lawson’s dictum that the relationship between prime minister and chancellor was the most important in government. But historians may say the nation suffered from too close a friendship. Osborne has said he was against Cameron’s decision to hold a referendum on membership of the EU. If he had fought harder, threatening to resign, history might have turned out differently.

He controlled every aspect of my life, including the finances. He set up a joint account, but the Jobseeker’s Allowance came in his name and only he accessed that account. I would have to ask him for money, even for basic essentials.After many years I eventually found a way to leave him. I was supported by Birmingham and Solihull Women’s Aid, who found me emergency temporary accommodation in a refuge.One bank saw me three times and gave me false hope, each time saying that they would accept. Then in the final appointment they said the manager had now refused because I didn’t have an address. I was so upset and frustrated. It was like I didn’t matter, nobody cared. It was humiliating and again I had no control. I was worried how I would manage without the universal credit money. I had to feed my children. We had been surviving with support from my family and donations.Staff at the refuge then told me that HSBC UK had started a new way to open an account for women in refuges, a way in which we did not have to give the refuge address.

Yet something about putting pen to paper, and the sense of control it gave him, began to turn that pain into pleasure. “Hoff has transitioned to the next adventure,” he starts his obituary. “After many years of ‘end-of-life’ preparation, Hoff is now exploring the best ways to continue his energy and spirit in a new realm.”Now on a roll, Hoffman leaves well-wishers a list of places to visit his ashes – Washington DC, New York and Vermont are among the more scenic options on a list of 13 possible day trips. But he reminds them: “Whenever you desire, simply think of him – because he will still be with you.”Back in the land of the living, 74-year-old Hoffman says he relished the idea of defining his own legacy before someone else beat him to it. It also helped him get over his dread of the unknown. “I thought of death as an empty hole of black nothingness – it put me into a very negative mind-set,” he says.Choosing what he wants to be remembered for, and attending death cafes – where likeminded customers chat about mortality over coffee and cake – have forced him to think about dying in a more positive way, he says. “It’s giving me a lot of late-life pleasure,” he says.Thinking about your death can really help you get clear about your life, agrees Farr, a trained death doula.“It’s a hard thing to do but the idea is to see where your pen and paper take you, and run with it,” she says.Farr sets the group another exercise: to write what she calls a “fantasy obit” – the death notice they would like to see written about themselves if they live a full life, imagining all the things they are yet to achieve.“What it comes down to is that society will be better if we have frank, open conversations around death,” says Caitlin Doughty, the founder of the death positivity movement, in a phone call from her Los Angeles funeral home. “Everybody’s thinking about death all the time – it’s the preoccupation of universal human experience”, she says. “The goal isn’t about not being scared of it – the goal is to grow awareness through education.”Those sentiments resonate with retired hospice nurse Barbara Wagner, one of those at the Washington workshop. “It’s helped me find a way to look at my bumpy life in a humorous way,” she says. “It feels freeing and cathartic and just joyful.”Wagner describes in her obituary how she married high school sweetheart Buzz and had two children by the age of 21. “When Buzz got a motorcycle and rode off with the Hells Angels at the age of 22, Barbara was called to re-consider her life – an act she did regularly from then until her death last week at age 100.”“There’s not much fantasy in there, it’s mostly true,” she says.The workshops are not just attracting older people. In fact, Farr says, people in their 20s and 30s are the fastest growing group.One of them, Rachel Wynn, a social media entrepreneur, believes that younger people are more open than their parents’ generation to talking about death.In part, she thinks, this is because there’s so much exposure to death on social media she remembers, for example, the shared online grief with friends when actor Heath Ledger died in 2008.Writing her own obituary has been an epiphany, she believes, because, despite being only 30, it made her feel that she hadn’t achieved enough in her life. “It was like, wow, I really need to get my shit together,” she says.Wynn has even gone to the next extreme and attended a workshop where she “went to her own funeral”. She recalls having to lie down on a blanket cut into the shape of a coffin, while a shroud was placed over her body and a beanbag over her eyes.“That was intense,” she says. “It was like we really had died and were being buried.”“It’s like a harsh wake-up call. Are you living the life you’re happy with?” she says. “Because you could die any minute.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adf32147a614d2cd086e24bc1c4b62cdb3cf7119/151_124_3779_2268/master/3779.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bdfc55e8a61cb1a8d68cfb46ae5f23fa","title":"elliot daly saracens championship england six nations","story":"• ‘I’ve got no regrets about joining,’ says wing of move from Wasps• England full-back George Furbank relishing Twickenham debutElliot Daly has become the second England player to pledge his future to Saracens, vowing to stick by the disgraced club in the Championship next season. Daly only arrived at Allianz Park in November following his World Cup exploits with England, joining a club in turmoil after their initial 35-point deduction and £5.36m fine. It was Daly’s arrival into an already star-studded squad that raised further suspicions over whether Saracens had breached the salary cap. A refusal to open their books mid-season brought about an additional 70-point penalty and condemned them to relegation.Jamie George was the first England international to commit his future to Saracens, while Maro Itoje and Mako Vunipola have revealed they are in negotiations with the club. “My plan is probably pretty similar to Jamie,” said Daly. “I am still in contract. At the moment I am not thinking about that. It is coming but we have the rest of the season to sort it out. At the moment, I am just thinking about the next couple of games with England and then when I get back to Sarries then start talking about next year.“My first day at the club wasn’t the best, not the best day you could ask for. It’s a big thing and it’s not to be taken lightly but the way that they dealt with it I thought was really good with the players.Daly has started both England’s Six Nations matches so far this season back on the wing, having spent 18 months at full-back. His move has allowed George Furbank to slot into the No 15 jersey, making a difficult debut against France before tasting victory for the first time against Scotland. If he keeps his place against Ireland next Sunday he will make his first appearance at Twickenham, continuing a rapid rise for the 23‑year-old, who not so long ago was playing for Cambridge in England’s fourth tier.“I’ve still only played 30 games for Northampton,” said Furbank. “So even though things had been going reasonably well in the Premiership I wasn’t really expecting a call-up. To get it was slightly surreal in itself. Wasn’t really expecting to be involved in the first game at all.”Furbank was a keen cricketer in his youth and attended Bedford school, which lists the former England captain Alastair Cook among its former pupils. It was there that he found himself a member of a Take That tribute band – though his England initiation song was Don McLean’s American Pie – while his studies are continuing with a six-year degree from the Open University in environmental science.“It’s been tough the last few weeks,” he added. “I’ve not got much done but I sat in front of the laptop on our two days off. Smashed out a couple of assignments. We’ve got tutors we can liaise with. There were three questions: one about properties of soil, one about rivers.”Furbank lists Saracens’ Alex Goode – who has consistently failed to convince Eddie Jones of his talents – among the full-backs he admires most and having had little opportunity to show his attacking ability in his first two caps, is hoping to do so against Ireland. He is also aware of the aerial threat posed by Andy Farrell’s side, with Johnny Sexton and Conor Murray pulling the strings.“They’re two world-class operators, especially when it comes to the kicking game,” said Furbank. “It poses a big challenge for us. If we get that aerial battle right then it gives us a big chance to get into the game and put on to them what we want.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7acddf608fcf1c2ae6c95c0d91407b3103c5afe3/0_125_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ccadbff4377a8290bc8429342adcd7d","title":"laura muir athletics jemma reekie","story":"Laura Muir has been the undisputed queen of British middle distance for years. But after falling short in a world record attempt over 1,000m at the Emirates Arena in Glasgow she admitted a cold, hard truth: she now shares her throne with her young training partner Jemma Reekie.On a day when Mondo Duplantis broke the world pole vault record for the second time in a week, the 21-year-old Reekie again showed off her devastating kick, emerging from the pack to zoom past the former world indoor silver medalist Dawit Seyaum in the final 20 metres to win the 1500m.And Muir, 26, was clearly impressed. “I think we are very close to being on par,” she said. “Certainly Jemma has got the speed and I have got the endurance. I would probably give her the 800m and me the 3,000m and 5,000m. But at the 1500m we are very, very close. It’s really exciting at training. We’re pushing each other.”Muir had been hoping to break Maria Mutola’s 1,000m world record of 2:30.94 but she was always off the pace needed and finished in 2:33.47 – a time that still admittedly beat Adelle Tracey by more than four seconds.Meanwhile, Reekie’s victory in the 1500m early on in the day capped a remarkable fortnight in which she has shot from relative obscurity to Olympic contender.Two weeks ago at this Arena, Reekie smashed the British indoor 800m record in 1min 57.91sec – shattering her personal best by nearly four seconds and setting the fastest time indoors by a woman since 2006. Last week, for good measure, she also broke the British indoor 1500m and mile record in a race in New York.She had been hoping to break the 1500m again but in a more tactical race she showed another side to her talents by sprinting to win in 4:04:07. “There were a few points I had to get my elbows out,” admitted Reekie. “But that’s middle-distance running. I’m still learning but I’ve got a lot more to give. I was hoping I was going to beat my own British record,” she added. “But that’s OK. I’ll take the win.”But Reekie also found herself having to defend her startling improvement and responded to questions for the first time about her controversial Nike spikes. “It doesn’t happen overnight and there’s a lot of hard work,” she told the BBC. “I am 21-years-old and I am a developing athlete and I am pushing myself to the absolute limits and I will just let my legs do the talking.”Meanwhile the most surprising performance of the day was from full-time primary school teacher Jessie Knight, who set a stadium record with victory in the women’s 400m. The 25-year-old from Epsom combines a full-time job with training six days a week but showed plenty of strength to win in 51.57s – the third fastest time of the year so far.“I got a stadium record and being on that start list, on paper I should have been last,” a bemused Knight said afterwards."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/496c46324932963d4f9c2317fc5811a17cb04a02/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c2ce553c8f06dce882dacc4ace4eed6","title":"tiktok bosses tell social media own time","story":"They are some of the most popular videos on the shortform video-sharing app TikTok – clips of uniformed employees, from builders to nurses to supermarket staff, dancing and goofing around in their workplaces.But police forces and other employers are dissuading staff from posting videos, warning that they risk appearing unprofessional and urging them to not let social media “get in the way of doing their jobs”.TikTok, the Chinese-owned app that was downloaded more than two million times a day worldwide last year by users mostly aged between 16 and 34, has already propelled homegrown stars such as 15-year-old Charli D’Amelio to household name status as a result of its viral videos. Now a subsection of the app is proving particularly popular among viewers: people dancing on building sites, in shops, or near police stations or hospitals – and it is those workers who are becoming minor TikTok celebrities.Danny Harris, 35, who works on a building site in central London, first realised he had become famous when he was recognised by staff at a local bakery as being a member of SparksandTarts, a TikTok profile with 34,700 followers.SparksandTarts’ first video, of five labourers performing a roughly choreographed dance on a city-centre rooftop to a song from the musical Pitch Perfect, has been seen a million times since it was posted a month ago. They’ve now posted 10 videos.“It has definitely evolved into its own entity,” said Harris. “We’re having TikTok meetings in our breaks to plan what videos we’re going to try to get out there. It’s becoming more of a part-time job. People are messaging each other at the weekend saying: ‘We should try this video next.’”The idea that the employees may be discovered skiving off work also attracts audiences, Gahan added. “Generally, the more a piece of content can spark that emotional response, the more it’s shared and sparks a response.”Harris and his workmates asked for their London building site not to be identified. “We do this in our breaktimes and after tea, and it’s one of these things where all my bosses are happy with it, but, for the sake of the clients funding this build, it’s probably best we’re not advertising exactly where we are,” he said.That is the fundamental issue many uniformed TikTokers face: while their antics show a different, often more welcoming side to their industry or companies, they run the risk of appearing less than professional.One Tesco employee, Tyler Beattie, earned 65,000 fans for posting videos of himself dancing in his uniform. In a video posted a few weeks ago, Beattie explained he had been banned from uploading any more videos in uniform. (And he did not respond to many requests for comment.)A Tesco spokesperson said: “Social media is a fun way to communicate and share information with others. As representatives of Tesco, we ask all our colleagues to use their judgment, respect and common sense online, and make sure that it doesn’t get in the way of doing their jobs.”However, other Tesco employees continue to post videos from stores in uniform, participating in “challenges” – often carefully choreographed dances to popular songs – that go viral. Nor is it limited to Tesco: videos tagged with the names of the UK’s big four supermarkets have been seen 99 million times on TikTok.Police officers and paramedics are also going viral on the app. One Cheshire police officer recently passed 10,000 TikTok followers for her insights into how the force operates. Clips of her and colleagues driving the streets to Ridin’ by Chamillionaire, and Sound of da Police by KRS-One have been viewed more than 700,000 times.The comments to both videos are ided between those who enjoy the lighthearted look into a police officer’s life, and others who think it a distraction from a very serious job.Peter Caldwell, Cheshire Constabulary’s digital media manager, said: “Social media is one of many channels we use to communicate with the public.” He added that his force has social media guidance it expects staff to follow while at work. “We currently use Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Instagram to promote the work of the force – however, with the world of digital media constantly evolving, the guidance also applies to new and emerging social media channels.”For Harris, the popularity of SparksandTarts has come as a surprise. But there is one sure-fire sign they have made the big time on TikTok: a protective and high-vis clothing company has been in touch, asking to send them products they could wear in their videos.So-called “brand deals” are the holy grail for influencers – and it seems they can even be brokered on building sites."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e559eeff274b8646167fe3c295ce7585233a9edd/122_182_5747_3448/master/5747.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=656d23381aa9c9523b057c94a8a470c4","title":"the masked singer final rita ora","story":"Rita Ora plays the emperor in the feral singing show. Who will she give the thumbs down to in tonight’s final?Feels gladiatorial, doesn’t it – a baying and screaming crowd, chanting in violent unison, demanding Denise van Outen rip her own head off. Perhaps this is the deep truth at the heart of The Masked Singer (Saturday, 7pm, ITV): that it unmasks not its weak singers buried deep within the costume of a monster, but the crowd themselves, the raw and feral omniperson we become when we’re in them. The same crowds that called for Roman slaves to murder each other are present, here, in a pre-record studio somewhere in Hertfordshire. Rita Ora is the emperor, her thumb wavering in the air for a moment, and lo, she does point it down, and what is almost certainly Jason Manford in a hedgehog costume has to pull his own guts out with a sword, for God and for glory.If you have not yet seen ITV’s Saturday night not-quite crown jewel, you have managed to miss absolutely nothing at all, or perhaps everything. The format is something that plunges you into a fever dream: huge unblinking creatures – a monster, a yellow bath duck, a wizened old tree – waddle on to the stage, and perform a song, and we are told a celebrity is inside there, somewhere. A panel of judges – Davina McCall, Jonathan Ross, former Community star Ken Jeong when he can be bothered, and Rita Ora – review the song and make frantic, incorrect guesses about who the celebrity inside the beast could be.This is where the show takes on a particular mum-got-too-pissed-at-a-dinner-party air. Rita Ora only knows the names of six celebrities, all of whom you assume she met at London fashion week parties Jeong’s British celeb knowledge is obviously zero, so he has to fake an “of COURSE!” face of realisation when someone like Patsy Palmer is unveiled McCall is oddly anonymous for someone who normally dominates centre stage Ross flaps his hands, wears loud jackets, stabs in the dark. There is no points system for a correct guess they are just guessing for, I don’t know. Fun? I don’t know. The whole thing is a parlour game with a budget of millions and absolutely zero jeopardy. Joel Dommett hosts.If you want to get into it, The Masked Singer UK was ruined irreparably in week two, when former MP Alan Johnson – a man who struggles to get recognised in his own house, by his own family – tore his pharaoh’s head off and revealed yes, it was me all along: Alan Johnson. That was the exact moment every possible bit of glamour that could have been attached to the show withered away. You hope that there is someone A-list inside the duck, someone magnificent: a Cara Delevingne, a George Clooney? And then Justin from the Darkness shakes his hair out of the costume with a face that says: “That tax bill was a touch larger than I was expecting.”Is this our Saturday night? Is this what we deserve to consume alongside our Tesco takeaway for two? Crucially, why are literally none of the performances any good? These questions and more can be answered, I suppose, in tonight’s final, when “Queen Bee” takes her own head off, and Jonathan Ross pulls his hair back from his face in shock, and a second series gets commissioned as surely as the Earth goes around the sun."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d74f77278be3948c65b4945d552d17eca4875258/193_242_3379_2445/master/3379.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=250cd860b6112b35d2c66b1b3c011f1e 1400w","title":"emmanuel macron sets out 10 year vision for eu with call for more integration","story":"French president says EU must have effective defence policy, larger budget and integrated capital marketsEurope’s middle classes will only remain reconciled to the European Union if it becomes more integrated, with an effective defence policy, a larger budget and integrated capital markets, and is shorn of vetoes that slow decision-making, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, has said.Setting out his 10-year vision for Europe on Saturday, Macron said he still wanted to see the UK involved in defence, but urged European countries to recognise that in terms of social welfare, Europe had a different values to the US.The continent, he said, was reaching the hour of truth, the moment when it must decide about greater integration and commonality. He warned: “If the Franco-German tandem do not come up with a perspective for the middle classes, that will be a historic failure.”Referring to the weakness of the west, Macron admitted he was impatient, if not frustrated, to hear a German response to his call for a strategic dialogue on a more integrated Europe. Asking for a clear answer, he said the countries “have a history of waiting for answers” from each other.“What’s key in the coming years is to move much faster on issues of sovereignty on the European level,” he said.He expanded on his controversial call for Europe to open a strategic dialogue with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, saying the only way to end frozen conflicts, including the one in Ukraine, was for Europe to work with Russia. He insisted: “My position is not pro-Russian or anti-Russian, it is pro-European.”In a reference to the US and the UK, he said: “I hear the defiance of all our partners I’m not mad, but I know that being defiant and weak … is not a policy, it’s a completely inefficient system.“There is a second choice, which is to be demanding and restart a strategic dialogue, because today we talk less and less, conflicts multiply and we aren’t able to resolve them.”Macron said that although the current policy of sanctions and counter-sanctions was not working, he did not advocate they be lifted in the context of Ukraine.He also said he doubted Russia had ended its direct and indirect interference in democratic elections, saying the best response was to defend Europe’s networks and adding: “I do not believe in miracles, but in policies.”Macron confirmed he was willing to lift French objections – he denied it was a veto – to opening EU membership talks with North Macedonia, so long as the EU agreed to the accession process becoming less theological, long-winded and bureaucratic. The bloc’s current review of its accession procedures should do away with the idea that progress to accession was not reversible, he said.Macron was speaking after two leading German politicians affirmed Germany needed to do more to respond to Macron’s offer of dialogue.The German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said: “Germany is ready to get more involved, including militarily.” He called for the “construction of a European security and defence union as a strong, European pillar of Nato”.Europe needed to respond, he said, due to the sudden emergence of a geo-strategic gap to which the continent had closed it eyes.He explained: “The real gamechanger is that the era of omnipresent American global policemen is over. Everyone can see that. It is not due to US lack of military power, but to the commitment of those responsible in the White House.”Decisions on the Middle East were being taken by countries that did not share European values, he said. In Iraq, Libya, Ukraine and the Sahel, Europe “should not cede these crises to those who bring weapons and mercenaries, not peace”, he added.The German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, on Friday warned that Donald Trump’s “America First” strategy had shaken up the international order and fuelled insecurity in an unstable world.“We are witnessing today an increasingly destructive momentum in global politics,” Steinmeier said, adding: “Every year we are getting further and further away from our goal of creating a more peaceful world through international cooperation.“Under its current administration, the USA rejects the very concept of an international community. Every country, it believes, should look after itself and put its own interests before all others.”Steinmeier, whose role is largely ceremonial but serves as a moral compass for Germany, said Europe needed to take more control of its own security, including through higher military spending.“Only a Europe that is able and willing to credibly protect itself, will keep the US in Nato,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ab4e51b1ac6a21b7ef2111b1c50ebb97b6f94b0/0_1225_2762_1657/master/2762.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4350d2245fd2cd652560b8c49dcd64e","title":"iraq explosions rockets strike near us embassy in baghdad","story":"Multiple blasts and circling aircraft heard near enclave where US mission is locatedMultiple rockets hit near the US embassy in Iraq’s capital early on Sunday, an American military source said, the latest in a flurry of attacks against US assets in the country.The assault sent warning sirens blaring across the diplomatic compound but it was unclear exactly what was hit and how many rockets made impact, the US source and a western diplomat based nearby said. There were no immediate reports of casualties.Agence France-Presse’s correspondents heard multiple strong explosions followed by aircraft circling near the green zone, the high-security enclave where the US mission is located.It was the 19th attack since October to target either the embassy or the roughly 5,200 US troops stationed alongside local forces across Iraq. The attacks are never claimed but the US has pointed the finger at Iran-backed groups within the Hashed al-Shaabi, a military network officially incorporated into Iraq’s state security forces.In late December, a rocket attack on the northern Iraqi base of K1 left one US contractor dead and unleashed a dramatic series of events. Washington responded with retaliatory strikes against a hardline Hashed faction in western Iraq, and days later an American drone strike in Baghdad killed the top Iranian general Qassem Suleimani and his right-hand man, Hashed, deputy chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis.Hashed factions have vowed revenge for the pair’s death, insisting US troops should immediately leave Iraq.Sunday’s attack came just hours after one of the Hashed’s Iran-backed factions, Harakat al-Nujaba, announced a “countdown” to ousting American forces from the country.

He served as minister for agriculture, food and forestry in the 1994-1997 rainbow coalition led by John Bruton. After leaving politics, Yates went into business, saw that business collapse and, after going through bankruptcy in Wales, developed a new career in broadcasting.His wife, Deirdre, is finishing her career as a primary school teacher in July, and now that the couple have settled a massive High Court dispute over their home in Blackstoops, Enniscorthy, Yates is in a position to wind down his broadcasting career.He presents Newstalk’s drivetime programme, The Hard Shoulder, and presents with Matt Cooper The Tonight Show on Virgin Media One. Yates lives in Dublin during the week because of his broadcasting commitments.“There is no way that if Deirdre lives in Enniscorthy that I’d be living in Dublin, so this is a real moment, one of the happiest things that has happened in my life.”Yates left politics in 2001 and became involved in the rapid expansion of Celtic Bookmakers, a chain of betting shops. However, the business went into receivership in 2011, and AIB pursued him for debts of €3.6 million.He went to live in Wales and availed of the bankruptcy laws there, which were much less harsh than the regime that existed in Ireland at the time. He described the trauma of seeing his world collapse around him in his autobiography, Full On (2014).“When I went to Wales in 2012, it was a 12-year life sentence to go bankrupt in Ireland under its draconian, Victorian laws.“And when I came back in 2013, I wasted no opportunity to excoriate governments, politicians and the system to adopt the UK Insolvency Act 1986 that gave people a fresh start, allowed everyone to get on with the rest of their lives, and allowed closure for the financial institutions.”However, he is pleased the law here has been changed so it now reflects the UK regime, something that has “completely transformed” the situation of tens of thousands of people, he says.At the time of his move to Wales, it was not clear whether it would lead to the loss of the Blackstoops property, and even now he cannot say definitively whether, with hindsight, the move was a good one. “That’s a complex question.”Yates and his wife had signed personal guarantees for Celtic Bookmakers’ borrowings. In 2016 the bank was awarded a €1.6 million judgment order against Deirdre.The bankruptcy trustees appointed by the Welsh courts got possession over the Yates family home and 150-acre farm in Blackstoops, but could not evict Yates because his mother, who is now 88, had the right to continue living on the property.“I mean we were literally homeless, in that we didn’t own our own home,” Yates says. “Because of my mother’s life interest, we have always remained there, and it has been our family home, but the situation was that my bankruptcy did imperil the home.”In 2017 Ivan and Deirdre took a complex High Court action against AIB and the bankruptcy trustees, challenging their taking possession of the Enniscorthy property on a number of grounds.The case was to go ahead on February 4th, and was expected to last two weeks. But court records show it was settled on January 31st. Yates says he cannot discuss the settlement.“There is a confidentiality clause. There will be no further litigation. The matter has been resolved,” is all he will say when questioned on the detail. But the key point for him is that he will continue to live at Blackstoops.Ivan and Deirdre have four children, aged 25-31, and a grandchild who lives in Co Wexford.Massive reliefSettling the case “is a massive relief to my mother, my extended family and my own four children.

But he does not regret his approach.“I honestly believe that the 1977 general election promises caused a decade of recession, and the 2007 election directly contributed to the crash.”He dislikes what he describes as the “Dutch auction” aspect of the election campaign just finished, and feels the media did not properly hold the parties to account over the promises they were making. “And the public lapped up the promises. They always do.”“I have been involved in 14 general elections, and my big fear was history repeating itself. I actually don’t mind a few brickbats and I don’t mind social media flak, that never bothers me.”The politicians “were putting their own popularity and short-term party interests above the national interest, and I sort of knew that the Department of Finance were absolutely doing their nut about this, and couldn’t say anything.”His plan for retirement is to “take life a bit easier”.

File photograph: Dara Mac DónaillFormer taoiseach Bertie Ahern has said there is a “possibility” of a united Ireland by the end of the decade. Mr Ahern was speaking on LBC radio station on Saturday morning, when he was asked whether the unification of Ireland would happen in his lifetime. “If the work is done, if the preparatory work is done, if we can hold out the hand of friendship to unionists and loyalists . . . I think somewhere in this decade, I think more towards the end of the decade, I think it’s a possibility,” the former Dublin Central TD said. Mr Ahern said the issue of a Border poll is “growing all the time” and that it has been brought “centre stage” since the Brexit referendum in 2016. “It is now fairly well 50:50 in Northern Ireland in terms of people that want to see unification,” he said. Mr Ahern said two things would have to happen before any Border poll on Irish unity – preparatory work on how a united Ireland would function in terms of policing and criminal justice systems and also allowing the newly formed Northern Irish Executive run for a number of years. “The institutions in Northern Ireland, which have just recently been reset up, have to run for a sustainable period to show that they can work together across parties and across various religious ides and that they can operate together.”Financial issuesThe former taoiseach said that while a Border poll is inevitable, the outcome of that vote would be based on “the case that’s made” following qualitative and analytic work. He said if a poll was taken today it would not pass due to financial issues and also because “people are not prepared anymore to see coercion of unionists or loyalists into a united Ireland until there’s a comfort zone established where people see that everyone could work together”. Separately, Mr Ahern said if Sinn Féin had run more candidates in the latest general election, they “probably would have got 11 seats more”. He said at the moment it looks like attempts will be made for Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party to form a coalition. “My own view, I think they would be far wiser to broaden that and bring in some of the smaller parties, the Social Democrats and maybe some of the rural Independents,” he said. “I think if they keep it just to the three parties, they might be making a problem for themselves in the future.” An index of selected articles available exclusively to our readers with an  digital subscription  Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe third of Ireland’s post-crash elections threw up the third shock result last weekend, demonstrating that unpredictability and volatility are the new normal in Irish politics. Flustered and flummoxed by the results, politicians – winners and losers – scrambled all week to absorb and adjust to the new reality. So did everyone else.It wasn’t just the hardened politicians in the old firm parties of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael that were struggling to come to terms with the results. Many Sinn Féin TDs, gathering in their droves at Leinster House on Thursday, had the honesty to look a bit shell-shocked by the whole thing.But it is Sinn Féin that made the big headlines and represents the big change in this election. The party’s post-ceasefire growth – boosted by the financial crash – in polls and in seats had abated in recent years. Indeed, last year’s elections suggested that the party hadn’t just plateaued so much as gone into sharp decline.This wasn’t a construction – as some party boosters have it now – of a hostile, pro-establishment media. It was feared and believed by Sinn Féin itself, as demonstrated by the fact it was still trimming its election tickets only days before the election was called. The surge the party now delights in was every bit as much a surprise to the party as it was to anyone else.This week Mary Lou McDonald skilfully sought to capitalise on her success, embarking on a series of hastily arranged meetings with the other parties, designed as much to place Sinn Féin at the centre of the government formation narrative as anything else. Everyone knows the serious talking hasn’t started yet, and won’t for some time. But Sinn Féin was front and centre there was no denying that.The stated position of McDonald and her party was to put together a coalition of the left, led by Sinn Féin, and excluding both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. But despite the allure of that prospect for many, it was always a long shot maybe an impossible one. The numbers dictated that.The difficulties in this process were illustrated when the Green Party’s meeting with the People Before Profit-Solidarity group turned out to be a meeting only with the three TDs in the People Before Profit element of the alliance. Solidarity, with its one TD, Mick Barry, would hold a separate meeting with Rise (also one TD, Paul Murphy).Scattered IndependentsAnd that was before you got to the Independents, 14 of whom would be needed to constitute the bare minimum required to elect a taoiseach and form a government.Good luck with forging a consensus in a group that included rural Independents such as Noel Grealish and Denis Naughten TDs such as the former Labour deputy Michael McNamara singular figures such as Michael Lowry and Verona Murphy and very left-leaning TDs such as Thomas Pringle and Joan Collins – and all points in between.On the rightleft spectrum of Irish politics – not always the best description, admittedly – the group of Independents contains people at either end.They would also all have their own local demands that is a fact of politics. Cork South-West Independent Michael Collins gave an indication of the sort of bargaining that would be required. He was willing – more than willing – to talk to anyone about government.He would require (a) a ministry of fisheries, (b) a rural resettlement programme and (c) no downgrading of Bantry hospital.Diversity is no doubt a wonderful thing. But it doesn’t make putting a government together any easier.But the numbers were the real problem they just weren’t there for Sinn Féin. Any hopes that an unlikely coalition could be scaffolded together began to evaporate when the outgoing Labour Party leader Brendan Howlin made clear on Wednesday that the new parliamentary party had agreed, on his recommendation, that they would not be prepared to serve in a new government.This aspect of the announcement was overshadowed by Howlin’s resignation after a difficult four years as leader of the party, a job he took only after being more or less press-ganged into the role by his colleagues in 2016.Howlin was probably one of the best ministers in the 2011-2016 government, but his party continues to pay a heavy price for its role in that turbulent administration. In 2020 terms that price was: only six TDs, and no part in government. Labour struggles on.But if lots of people missed the significance of Labour crushing the hopes of a left-led government, the people who were counting heads did not.The old firmOn Friday morning Sinn Féin’s housing spokesman, Eoin Ó Broin, acknowledged what anyone who could count had known for some time: the involvement of Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael would be needed to form a government. Needless to say, he was excoriated by Richard Boyd Barrett of People Before Profit for “throwing in the towel”. Boyd Barrett will never throw in the towel on the revolution.Once the results of the election were settled and finalised – if not quite digested or understood – there were two significant developments this week that have had an impact on the possibility of forming a government.The first was the realisation that the left-led government wouldn’t have the numbers. The second was Fianna Fáil’s decision to stick with Micheál Martin’s refusal to engage with Sinn Féin. There was a fair bit of grumbling about Martin among his TDs and the wider organisation in the aftermath of the result everyone expected to do better, and many hoped the party would do a lot better. But there are no widespread objections to his stance on Sinn Féin.That doesn’t mean that the party will rush headlong into the embrace of Fine Gael but it does mean Martin is on secure ground when he rules out being Sinn Féin’s partners in government.Sinn Féin realised immediately that Martin’s stance meant the party’s most realistic route to government was closed off quickly McDonald accused the “old boys’ club” of a “sense of entitlement”.Perhaps that is true if so, she saw no irony in seeking to join it in government. But no matter. A new narrative was set: Sinn Féin was being excluded by the establishment, its mandate ignored, its voters disrespected. It is not an unfamiliar narrative to the party, nor one that has proved unprofitable for it.Second electionAlready the drum beats for another election began. “If we have to fight another election, okay, let’s have the election,” McDonald said. If there’s one thing that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are likely to agree on, it is that they should avoid that eventuality.The settling of the dust also makes clear that the Green Party and the Social Democrats are in powerful, perhaps pivotal, positions, whether they realise it or not. Even if Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael cross the Rubicon to govern together, the numbers dictate that they will need additional votes in the Dáil to make a government possible.One of the two (the Greens or Soc Dems) would be necessary two preferable. Both made it clear this week that they would not be cheap dates. Once the talks are under way in a substantial way, that will become clearer – and uncomfortable for the old firm parties. Everyone focuses on Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael but they will need others, too. It makes their job of agreeing and selling a new programme for government fiendishly difficult, and likely to take a long time. But if Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil want to be in government, and avoid an election, that is what the numbers require.Sooner or later, everyone has to play the numbers game.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe .Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has accused Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin of “arrogance” after he again ruled out entering a coalition government with her party. In her first speech in Northern Ireland since last weekend’s general election, Ms McDonald told Sinn Féin’s Six County AGM that “the people voted for change”.The election saw Sinn Féin win the largest share of the vote (24.5 per cent) and its candidates secured 37 Dáil seats, one fewer than Fianna Fáil’s total. “Sinn Féin won the election,” Ms McDonald told supporters on Saturday at the Balmoral Hotel in Belfast. Ahead of the speech it was made clear by Sinn Féin’s press department there would be no opportunity for the media to ask questions at the event. Mr Martin and Ms McDonald spoke by telephone on Friday, and he congratulated the Sinn Féin leader on her electoral success before outlining the reasons why his party will not go into coalition with her party.He said Fianna Fáil had a mandate and it was its prerogative and duty to try to form a government. He argued no grouping in the Dáil could force another grouping to form a government when there were such incompatible views on economic policy and other issues.In her speech on Saturday, Ms McDonald said Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael were “determined to keep us out of government” and that Mr Martin planned to “deny the people what they voted for”.“That is an arrogant and untenable position, given the strength of Sinn Féin’s mandate,” she said. Matt Carthy, the former MEP who topped the poll in Cavan-Monaghan in last week’s election, opened proceedings by attributing the party’s recent success to Ms McDonald.He said Sinn Féin “is in government in the North” and is ready to do likewise in the State. Standing in front of a banner stating ‘Time for Unity’, Ms McDonald said: “Never again will a general election be pitched as a simple choice between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.“Just as the unionist majority here in the North has gone, the two-party system has been consigned to history”.All-Ireland partyMs McDonald said her candidates had been elected in record numbers on a “people’s manifesto” and noted all 32 counties on the island of Ireland now had a Sinn Féin representative. She claimed Sinn Féin is “the only all-Ireland party resolutely committed to Irish unity”.She attacked the republican credentials of Fianna Fáil, which does not stand for election in Northern Ireland but does have a loose relationship with the SDLP, which only stands for election in the North. “Fine Gael postures as the ‘United Ireland party’ but has no strategy, no programme and no real desire to bring unity about,” she said. “And as for Fianna Fáil, the so-called republican party, Irish unity doesn’t rate a mention in its manifesto’s five core aims.”She accused both of having “no plan, just waffle”.“They cannot block the growing demand around unity,” she added. Ms McDonald also criticised “so-called dissidents” for making threats against Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and Sinn Féin’s policing spokesman, Gerry Kelly MLA , for attending a PSNI recruitment event in Belfast. She said those engaged in such threats had “no politics, no strategy and nothing to offer”.“They are at war with their community and are now threatening political representatives who serve the people,” she said.StormontThe section of the speech on the restoration of Stormont gained applause from the audience.Ms McDonald highlighted the need for action on matters in Northern Ireland such as poverty, health, housing and victims’ issues, and stressed “unionists have nothing to fear from Irish unity”.“Of course many of them may see that differently,” she added. “But the answer to that is to talk.”Ms McDonald urged Sinn Féin activists to “keep your shoulder to the wheel” and serve local communities. She ended the speech by saying: “Onwards. Upwards. We can do this. We will do this. We are almost there. And now we will leave and work hard in our communities as proud republicans, as unapologetic united Irelanders.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

As a UK government, we will not be having a border down the Irish Sea.”Mr Lewis was appointed secretary of state on Thursday after the previous incumbent, Julian Smith, was sacked by the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson.He told reporters he was “very fortunate to be coming in as secretary of state off the back of somebody who did a great job and actually delivered, as I say, that agreement”.Mr Smith, he said, had been “a superb secretary of state. I’ve got tough boots to fill and the exciting job of delivering on that agreement.”Mr Lewis visited Queen’s University’s Centre for Security Information Technologies (CSIT) in the Northern Ireland Science Park in Belfast on Friday afternoon, in what was his first trip to the North in his new role.During his first day in office he also spoke by telephone to Tánaiste Simon Coveney, as well as the North’s first and deputy first ministers, DUP leader Arlene Foster and Sinn Féin’s Northern leader Michelle O’Neill, as well as to the Chief Constable Simon Byrne.‘Vexatious prosecutions’Mr Coveney said on social media he and Mr Lewis had had “a very positive first call” and he was “looking forward” to working with him “for as long I hold my role in government”.Ms O’Neill said following her conversation with Mr Lewis they agreed to meet “as a matter of urgency” to discuss “important matters including his government’s approach to the legacy of the conflict, particularly in relation to the bad faith shown over the issue of pensions for those injured as a result of the conflict”.Mr Johnson has pledged to end what he describes as “vexatious prosecutions” against former servicemen.Ms O’Neill also said she intended to challenge Mr Lewis on the financial commitments made by the British government in the New Decade, New Approach deal and on Brexit.Meanwhile, Ms Foster told the BBC that Mr Lewis “has to be an advocate for the union and I very much hope that he is”.Regulatory checksMr Lewis is a former chairman of the Conservative Party and has been MP for Great Yarmouth since 2010.Both he and Mr Johnson have previously said there will be no customs or regulatory checks on the Irish Sea as a result of Brexit.The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said during a recent speech in Belfast that there would be regulatory checks at Northern Ireland’s ports and airports for goods arriving from Great Britain.Asked to clarify this, Mr Lewis replied: “We’ve always said the United Kingdom, Great Britain and Northern Ireland is going to be one area and all will be able to benefit from our future global trade deals.“I appreciate what Michel Barnier says, he’s a very good man trying to do a good job for the EU, but this is also the man who said we couldn’t open the withdrawal agreement. And our prime minister got that agreement opened, got a new agreement, got it through parliament and we’ve left the European Union and we’re going to build a future beneficial economy for the whole of the United Kingdom as one,” he said.

It may make us cold, distant and emotionally stunted, but it turns out that, when apocalypse looms, it may help us survive.That, anyway, is the advice of one of our leading virologists, who says our lack of touchy-feeliness will make it easier for us to cut out the hugs, kisses and handshakes that can spread coronavirus.Or, as Prof John Oxford of Queen Mary University of London told the BBC last week: “The coronavirus rather hates it in England compared to China because we are so stand-offish.”Yet is he right to be so confident? I wouldn’t dispute Prof Oxford on the science, but I wonder if he inhabits the same London as I do, where in recent years Continental-style social kissing has spread through the population like... well, like a virus. And unlike corona, there is a glaring absence of official guidance on how to deal with it.Take the French-style double kiss, for example, once confined safely to the boulevards of Paris, but now practised by growing numbers of Londoners. It may make you look sophisticated and, for those who wish it, convey a certain Remainer chic. But for middle-aged provincial types like me – to whom a double kiss is better known as a snooker term – it’s a social minefield.After all, how am I supposed to know whether the woman I’m greeting is a “doubler” or an old-school singles type? Time and again, I’ve opted for the double kiss, only for the recipient to turn their cheek away, leaving me lunging unsuccessfully like some sex-pest uncle. Alternatively, when I’ve played it safe by opting for the single kiss, I’ve offended some doubler the other way round.True, there’s the odd north London luvvie who seems to instinctively know the form. For me, though, it’s a recipe for embarrassment and, occasionally, headbutts. It’s what the French presumably invented the phrase “faux pas” for. And in the MeToo world, where physical contact is already a rather fraught issue, faux pas are something I can do without.With other blokes, a straightforward, manly handshake used to suffice. Not any more, thanks to the introduction of the “manhug”. Now, old acquaintances insist on embracing like they’re Tony Soprano greeting an associate who’s just done 20 years in the slammer. And I mess it up by just sticking my hand out, like some emotional retard who isn’t that pleased to see them. Sorry, guys, I’m not trying to offend. I just didn’t know the rules.So, personally, I’ll welcome any coronavirus-imposed “no contact” rule. Trust me, it won’t be the end of the world. I covered the Ebola outbreak in west Africa in 2014, where this was strictly observed, and folks seemed no less friendly for it. Come to think of it, I probably came across as far less socially inept than I do in an average weekend socialising in London.Indeed, when I heard Prof Oxford last week urging people to avoid unnecessary physical contact, well, I could have hugged him. But he wouldn’t like that. And nor, frankly, would I.Coronavirus latest news: New cases fall for third day in rowCoronavirus: First European death as Chinese tourist dies in FranceBBC will be forced to scrap licence fee and downsize, say Boris Johnson\u0026#39s aidesSecret of what makes us appear 36 years youngerStorm Dennis: Second body pulled from the sea near Kent as bad weather set to continue on SundayLove Island presenter Caroline Flack took her life three weeks before assault trialCharles Darwin asked for price of Origin of Species to be slashed after receiving letters from working-class who could not afford bookBoris Johnson to refuse to abide by EU rules on tax and workers\u0026#39 rightsExclusive: Millions to be told \u0026#39stay at home\u0026#39 if coronavirus continues to spreadComment: Coronavirus: We must stop it turning into a global pandemicDowning Street talks to developers about moving House of Lords to YorkHS2 \u0026#39backtracks\u0026#39 on pledges to protect environmentBread, pasta and rice sales increase for first time in three years Dr Crippen murder was solved by a woman, new research revealsEating disorder patients should be given home visits, say grieving parentsComment: Why I almost resigned from the Tories over HS2Furious British passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise urge UK government to evacuate themWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"secret makes us appear 36 years younger","story":"Some older people are ageing so badly that their body is 48 years older than their actual age, scientists have found.In contrast, other so-called ‘super-agers’ are growing old surprisingly slowly, and may be biologically still in their 20s.Researchers at the University of Southern California looked at the rate of change occurring to the DNA of more than 4,000 over-57s and found striking differences between biological age and chronological age.At the far end of the scale one 66-year-old was found to have a biological age of 114, while another 59-year-old was physically just 23.The team looked at epigenetic changes, which are modifications to DNA that turn genes ‘on’ or ‘off.’With epigenetic changes, the underlying DNA sequence remains unchanged, but cells start to ‘read’ genes differently, almost like switching programmes on washing machine, or dimming a light. The changes alter how the body functions and can trigger disease.Damaging environmental factors such as smoking, stress, pollution or obesity cause the alterations, and the culmination of epigenetic changes can be used like a clock to determine how fast a person is ageing.Dr Eileen Crimmins, Professor of Gerontology, at the University of Southern California, said: “Some people who are 57 or older look like they’re in their twenties, while some people look like they’re over 100, and there’s a big range in between.“We think that adverse social experiences can change your epigenetic profile in ways that may subsequently influence your health adversely.“There were people who looked 36 years younger, while some look 48 years older.“We’re trying to understand ageing health changes and the biological pathways so that we can better understand what we’re really interested in, which is social differentials and ageing.“People believe that the underlying process of ageing is one that underlies all the different health outcomes link to age, such as cognitive decline, disease, disability, frailty and mortality.”Researchers took blood samples from participants and tested them against three ‘epigenetic clocks’ which have been devised by scientists in recent years, to measure DNA changes at different points of the genetic code.Their goal was to find out which social factors were speeding up or slowing the ageing process and so they compared the clock results to participants’ education, life traumas, mental health, race and sex to see if they could tease out which events were contributing to ageing.“We have lots of evidence that these social factors are linked across the board to the major health outcomes associated with age, and we’re attempting to try to understand the biology of how social factors affect ageing outcomes,” added Prof Crimmins.They found that being female slowed down the ageing clock by up to two years, while obesity speeded it up by up to 18 months. Suffering psychological distress also increased biological age by around four months, and poor childhood health was also found to accelerate ageing.However the results threw up some unexplainable findings. The clocks appeared to show that low socioeconomic status in childhood and having a drinking problem delayed ageing.“Across the board the clocks related being female to decelerated ageing which makes sense, given what we know about mortality,” added Prof Crimmins.“Childhood health problems and negative psychological problems both make you look epigenetically somewhat older.“Drinking problems are actually in the wrong direction but we find that obesity increases epigenetic age by about one and a half years. So some of it makes sense, and some of it sort of doesn’t.”The research was presented at the AAAS meeting in Seattle and full findings are due to be published in March.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/02/14/12/BP-oil-rig.jpg","title":"climate change greenwashing bp net zero 2050 advertising","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.BP’s aim of achieving net zero emissions has rightly been criticised for lacking substance, but its commitment to stop misleading adverts about its impact on the climate is a welcome start – it must be held to account on this, writes Ben ChapmanBuried a couple of thousand words beneath BP’s eye-catching announcement that it aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 was an important promise that garnered much less attention.The oil company said it would stop funding “corporate reputation advertising” which, in the context of the oil and gas industry, is more commonly known as greenwash.This means BP will end its multimillion-pound “Possibilities Everywhere” campaign, which touted the company’s questionable green credentials. That’s a fairly rapid u-turn, given that the global campaign was only launched last year.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesPerhaps BP has realised the futility of spending large sums highlighting the tiny part of its business that generates renewable energy when the company remains synonymous with fossil fuels.\u0026nbspAdverts on billboards, newspapers and television in the UK, US and Europe as well as on social media and online\u0026nbsppictured\u0026nbspgreen fields and windmills alongside phrases like, “working to make energy cleaner”.

I will be closely watching BP’s public statements on climate change this year, as well as its advertising and involvement with groups like the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, to check that they measure up.We can all play a part in this too. Earlier this month Ryanair was banned from claiming that it was Europe’s “lowest CO2 emissions airline”. The Advertising Standards Authority ruled that the statement couldn’t be backed up.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

BP sets target to achieve net zero by 2050 to tackle climate emergencyThe climate crisis is real, but Boris Johnson still ‘doesn’t get it’Boris Johnson forces out UK president of climate change summitAnyone can make a complaint to the ASA about an issue like an misleading environmental claim, it just requires filling out a few boxes on an online form.If this action does not stop airlines and oil companies producing dodgy ads on climate change, sterner laws must be enforced. ClientEarth’s suggestion that fossil fuel adverts should be banned unless they have a tobacco-style health warning need to be\u0026nbspconsidered.A fossil fuel company portraying itself as good for the climate is no less ridiculous, or dangerous, than the tobacco companies that in the 1950s pushed cigarettes with recommendations from friendly-looking doctors.Companies that create misleading adverts about climate change need to face the prospect of fines, not just damage to their\u0026nbspreputation. Currently the ASA, is self-funded by advertisers themselves and can only ban particular promotions, often months after they’ve\u0026nbspgone out.While advertising is an important way that large greenhouse gas emitters can use their financial clout to shift the debate in their favour, a more significant front on the climate change\u0026nbspinformation war\u0026nbspis political lobbying.Here too, BP has laid down a marker by which it can be judged not in 10 years or 20 years, but almost immediately.\u0026nbspThe company laid out a less aggressive approach to lobbying, stating that it would “set new expectations” for its relationships with oil industry trade associations. Where those influential groups are pushing for policies that don’t align with BP’s new approach, it will leave.Created with Sketch.Youth Strike for Climate: London protest in photos Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Basically, this is an admission that BP’s net-zero ambition simply has no credibility if the company remains a member of powerful lobby groups like the American Petroleum Institute which has for decades funded climate change denial in a successful effort to cast doubt on the scientific consensus. BP either has to fundamentally change the API or leave it.The impact of a big oil industry player changing tack could be considerable but action needs to follow words. I’ll also be scrutinising other large oil industry firms about whether they will follow BP in “advocating for policies that support net zero, including carbon pricing”.Fossil fuel lobbyists have vast budgets that allow\u0026nbspthem\u0026nbspto shift public policy and discussion significantly towards the industry’s own interests over and above those of everyone else.In any case, oil companies\u0026nbsplike formerly state-owned BP have frequently been pushing on open doors in the corridors of power. Seen by\u0026nbsppoliticians\u0026nbspto be of strategic national importance, oil majors have provided\u0026nbspthe vital commodity that fuels economic growth and\u0026nbspdelivers votes.It’s fair to say the oil majors have frequently enjoyed a cosy relationship with governments sympathetic to their aims.\u0026nbspVast budgets to fund misinformation and dodgy science have been key to prolonging the life of fossil fuel industry decades after oil companies knew climate change was dangerous and man-made.\u0026nbspClimate campaigners, who have enjoyed less privileged access to political decision-makers, have therefore been fighting a hugely asymmetric battle but one which they may now finally be starting to win.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There’s no one way through it. But it is a way you can achieve positive changeInvesting in trackers means you have to take the rough with the smooth, hitching your wagon to oil companies and natural resource outfits if they\u0027re in the index you\u0027re tracking. The\u0026nbspFTSE\u0026nbsp100 has a lot of those\u0026nbspInvestment funds that aim to follow or “track” the performance of a designated stock market index, as opposed to trying to beat it, are inexpensive, easy to understand and hugely popular, especially amongst novice investors.\u0026nbspWith good reason. Most of the time they outperform so called actively managed funds run by stock pickers which too rarely beat the markets they\u0027re benchmarked against after their higher costs are factored in.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut trackers pose a problem for people who are concerned enough about the climate crisis to want to green up their investments.\u0026nbspA tracker investor\u0026nbspis inevitably exposed to most, or all, of the constituents of the index their chosen fund tracks. So they have to take the rough with the smooth. Sometimes the rough is very rough indeed from the perspective of planet earth.Britain’s premier stock market index is, for example, chock full of natural resource companies. They are some of FTSE 100\u0027s biggest and most important constituents.\u0026nbspEthical investment isn’t always ethical – here’s what to considerCan cutting investment force firms to go green?World’s largest fund manager to sell coal investments You have oil giants (BP, Shell), you have mining companies (Anglo American, BHP Group, Rio Tinto).\u0026nbspA person who saves via a FTSE 100 or FTSE All Share tracker is hitching their wagon to the performance of all of these companies. So if, say, BP does well, they do well.\u0026nbspTalk about carrying the mark of Cain.\u0026nbspDoes this mean their only option is to scour the ranks of actively managed funds with ESG (environmental, social and governance) screening? Do they have to leave the cheapest, and best, route into the market for most novice and smaller investors on the shelf?\u0026nbspOne way of solving this apparent dilemma is through choosing a tracker manager prepared to vote in favour of things like climate resolutions when they’re put forward.\u0026nbspRegular readers of this column will recall that I looked at the voting behaviour of big asset managers in the last edition. I highlighted two separate studies that found European money managers do a lot better than their US peers when it comes to voting in favour of progressive resolutions.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This challenge is already testing my limits but I have also found myself on an educational path.Six weeks in,\u0026nbspI have to admit that I do not have a clean shopping slate. I bought socks and thermals — but in my defence, the former were for my husband and the latter for my sister. I am not sure if they were trolling me but both (not being a party to my pledge) in particular asked me to buy these items for them.Okay, I also bought myself a vintage shirt, non-plastic food covers to replace cling film with and cotton face pads to cleanse the face without the need for additional products.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhy I’m changing my spending habits to help save the planetApart from the vintage shirt these latter purchases are also part of my new outlook on the things I consume: considering materials used in production the use they have and what happens once they become waste.From trying my best to avoid buying lunch wrapped in plastic to opting for plastic free cosmetics, I am trying to progressively reduce my waste.My phone is 20 months old and previously that would mean I would be ready to buy the new shiny phone with the improved camera. Instead I opted to renew my sim-only contract and stick with the handset I have as it’s functioning perfectly well.\u0026nbspAt the weekend I chose to replace the broken pipe for my 12-year-old vacuum cleaner rather than buy a whole new machine. I never knew that Dyson sells parts for even their older models, which came in very handy.Overall, I am changing my approach to things I own and may or may not need to buy, which is reducing my eco anxiety and saving me money.Created with Sketch.Plastic waste across the world: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A father and son on a makeshift boat made from styrofoam paddle through a garbage filled river as they collect plastic bottles that they can sell in junkshops in Manila.

Scientists hope that citizen scientists will be able to find interesting things in the data – whether that is unknown natural phenomena, or something even more unexpected, such as alien life.“Since Breakthrough Listen’s initial data release last year, we have doubled what is available to the public,” said Breakthrough Listen’s lead system administrator, Matt Lebofsky. “It is our hope that these data sets will reveal something new and interesting, be it other intelligent life in the universe or an as-yet-undiscovered natural astronomical phenomenon.”Yuri Milner, an entrepreneur and founder of the Breakthrough initiative, said: For the whole of human history, we had a limited amount of data to search for life beyond Earth.So, all we could do was speculate.Now, as we are getting a lot of data, we can do real science and, with making this data available to general public, so can anyone who wants to know the answer to this deep question.The initiatives and strategies in expanding the search for extraterrestrial life were presented at the the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Seattle.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The UK’s largest energy supplier lost 286,000 of customer accounts last year, which is half the rate of 2018 and a quarter of the rate in 2017.British Gas has lost millions of customers to smaller suppliers and cut thousands of jobs during Mr Conn\u0027s tenure.The company also incurred hefty one-off costs in 2019, including a £476m write-down of its exploration and production business thanks to fluctuating fossil fuel prices.The energy price cap came into force at the start of last year, aiming to\u0026nbspcut outgoings for millions of households.But British Gas has been fiercely critical of how it has been implemented, winning a high court fight in November after arguing that the energy watchdog\u0027s changes to the cap\u0027s methodology were unfair.David Barclay, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said: “Today’s results cap an undoubtedly difficult year for Centrica with drops across the board and an increase in debt.The good news, however, is that management has identified that drastic action is required and is duly taking it to make Centrica a smaller, simpler, and more competitive business. Nevertheless, there is still plenty of work to do and investors will have a keen eye on future updates.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The UK’s largest energy supplier lost 286,000 of customer accounts last year, which is half the rate of 2018 and a quarter of the rate in 2017.British Gas has lost millions of customers to smaller suppliers and cut thousands of jobs during Mr Conn\u0027s tenure.The company also incurred hefty one-off costs in 2019, including a £476m write-down of its exploration and production business thanks to fluctuating fossil fuel prices.The energy price cap came into force at the start of last year, aiming to\u0026nbspcut outgoings for millions of households.But British Gas has been fiercely critical of how it has been implemented, winning a high court fight in November after arguing that the energy watchdog\u0027s changes to the cap\u0027s methodology were unfair.David Barclay, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said: “Today’s results cap an undoubtedly difficult year for Centrica with drops across the board and an increase in debt.The good news, however, is that management has identified that drastic action is required and is duly taking it to make Centrica a smaller, simpler, and more competitive business. Nevertheless, there is still plenty of work to do and investors will have a keen eye on future updates.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But, at this point in time, contributors are optimistic regarding the outlook for activity over the next 12 months.”Looking ahead, respondents to the survey expect this refreshed optimism to continue with sales anticipated to rise across all UK regions, both in the near term and for the year to come. \u0026nbspGraeme Lusk, of surveyors Walker Fraser Steele in Glasgow, said it was a good time to put a property on the market. “There is still an under supply of quality properties on the market and buyers waiting,” he said.\u0026nbspObservers fear that a long-term lack of supply combined with strong buyer interest and historically low borrowing costs will drive up the prices of homes even further out of the reach of first-time buyers.However official figures on Wednesday showed that the number of homes being both started and completed across the UK rose to their highest levels for 11 years in the 12 months to April last year. However, the 165,730 homes completed and the 202,260 started were well below the government’s target of 300,000 a year.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

RBS\u0026nbspwas found to have mis-sold complex financial products to small-business customers in a bid to boost its own bottom line, while its infamous Global Restructuring\u0026nbspGroup destroyed firms to sell off their assets for a profit.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Davies\u0026nbspsaid: “The essential reason for this is, as the bank has evolved from the financial crisis and the bailout, we have focused on the NatWest brand.“We have exited a lot of the international businesses which were not profitable. That was branded RBS and that’s gone.“It really makes no sense for us to continue to be called\u0026nbspRBS. It was designed for a global group of brands, which we no longer are.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Resigned as Chancellor of the Exchequer.

But, at this point in time, contributors are optimistic regarding the outlook for activity over the next 12 months.”Looking ahead, respondents to the survey expect this refreshed optimism to continue with sales anticipated to rise across all UK regions, both in the near term and for the year to come. \u0026nbspGraeme Lusk, of surveyors Walker Fraser Steele in Glasgow, said it was a good time to put a property on the market. “There is still an under supply of quality properties on the market and buyers waiting,” he said.\u0026nbspObservers fear that a long-term lack of supply combined with strong buyer interest and historically low borrowing costs will drive up the prices of homes even further out of the reach of first-time buyers.However official figures on Wednesday showed that the number of homes being both started and completed across the UK rose to their highest levels for 11 years in the 12 months to April last year. However, the 165,730 homes completed and the 202,260 started were well below the government’s target of 300,000 a year.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They will be given the option of looking at their normal feed or clicking through to the latest posts, which will show in chronological order.Instagram changed the order of the feed in early 2016, almost exactly four years ago, but many of the app\u0027s users still regularly ask for it to come back.Instagram update tells users who they don’t likeIn the time since, the company has had to fight against claims that it leads to almost all posts being missed, and has made some concessions to users by changing the way the algorithm chooses which posts are chosen to be shown.Despite all of that, the company has repeatedly insisted that the chronological feed will not be returning. The new update appears to be some concession for the demands for posts to appear in time order, without entirely reversing the switch to using an algorithm.Instagram did not immediately respond to a request for comment and further information on the potential feature.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s also entirely ultrared, or highly reflective, which is commonplace in the faraway Twilight Zone of our solar system known as the the Kuiper Belt.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

The reddish color is indicative of organic molecules.While frozen methane is present, no water has yet been found on the body, which is an estimated 22 miles (36 kilometers) long tip to tip. At a news conference Thursday in Seattle, New Horizons\u0027 chief scientist Alan Stern of Southwest Research Institute said its size was roughly that of the city.As for the snowman shape, it\u0027s not nearly as flat on the backside as previously thought. Neither the small nor big sphere is fully round, but far from the flatter pancake shape scientists reported a year ago. The research team likened the somewhat flattened spherical forms to the shape of M\u0026ampMs.No rings or satellites have been found. The light cratering suggests Arrokoth dates back to the formation of the solar system 4.5 billion years ago. It likely was created by a slow, gentle merger between two separate objects that possibly were an orbiting pair. The resulting fused body is considered a contact binary.This kind of slow-motion hookup likely arose from collapsing clouds in the solar nebula, as opposed to intense collisions theorized to form these planetesimals, or little orbiting bodies.New Horizons flew past Arrokoth on Jan. 1, 2019, more than three years after the spacecraft visited Pluto. Originally nicknamed Ultima Thule, the object received its official name in November Arrokoth means sky in the language of the Native American Powhatan people.Launched in 2006, the spacecraft is now 316 million miles (509 million kilometers) beyond Arrokoth. The research team is looking for other potential targets to investigate. Powerful ground telescopes still under construction will help survey this part of the sky.Emerging technology will enable scientists to develop a mission that could put a spacecraft in orbit around Pluto, 3 billion miles (5 billion kilometers) away, according to Stern. After a few years, that same spacecraft could be sent even deeper into the Kuiper Belt to check out other dwarf planets and objects, he said.The New Horizons scientists reported their latest findings at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, as well as in three separate papers in the journal Science.David Jewitt of the University of California, Los Angeles, who was not involved in the studies, said a flyby mission like New Horizons, where encounters last just a few days, is hardly ideal.For future missions, we need to be able to send spacecraft to the Kuiper Belt and keep them there in orbit around objects, Jewitt wrote in a companion piece in Science. That would allow these intriguing bodies to be studied in stunning geological and geophysical detail, he noted.Additional reporting by ReutersBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

RBS\u0026nbspwas found to have mis-sold complex financial products to small-business customers in a bid to boost its own bottom line, while its infamous Global Restructuring\u0026nbspGroup destroyed firms to sell off their assets for a profit.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Davies\u0026nbspsaid: “The essential reason for this is, as the bank has evolved from the financial crisis and the bailout, we have focused on the NatWest brand.“We have exited a lot of the international businesses which were not profitable. That was branded RBS and that’s gone.“It really makes no sense for us to continue to be called\u0026nbspRBS. It was designed for a global group of brands, which we no longer are.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Resigned as Chancellor of the Exchequer.

Free health care? A jobs guarantee? Isn’t that socialism?Cardi B and Mark Ruffalo among celebrities backing Bernie SandersWhy the rise of Bernie Sanders is making some Democrats nervousWill bitter moderates vote for Bernie Sanders?But while policies such as free universal healthcare are seen as extreme in the US they are perfectly ordinary in Europe.The higher tax and spending proposed by Sanders would also not be out of place on the other side of the Atlantic.The economist Paul Krugman says Sanders is better described as a European-style social democrat rather than a socialist, not least because Sanders isn’t proposing to nationalise private industries.OK, but would this ruin the American economy?The French economist Thomas Piketty even argues Sanders’\u0026nbsppolicies could be beneficial to the US economy\u0026nbspby raising the country’s growth rate, and says that his wealth distribution policies tap into an older tradition of American policymaking.“Remember that the US is actually the country that invented progressive taxation of income and wealth in the 20th century,” Piketty points out.Others have described Sanders as a “New Dealer”, referring to the progressive economic policies put in place by former\u0026nbspDemocratic President Franklin Roosevelt in the wake of the Great Depression of the 1930s.So why are people describing Sanders as dangerous?But it may also be that the genuinely fear Sanders’ policies, even if they are in the mainstream of the European tradition, will do damage in the US context.Or they may be assuming that Sanders, if he won power, would pursue policies that go much further than those he has proposed, with the 78-year-old proving more radical in office, perhaps like Hugo Chavez in Venezuela.Against this, though, is the institutional fact that US presidents are constrained by Congress in what policies they can enact. Sanders might be in favour of relatively radical redistribution, but that’s not true of the wider Democratic party.Even some of Sanders’ rivals for the Democratic nomination, such as Pete Buttigieg, are critical of his policies such as the $15 federal minimum wage.That’s why many analysts – even those who support the principle of “medicare-for-all” – think there is little chance he could actually deliver it, even if he won power.And while some financiers are sounding the alarm, others are more sanguine.Another Wall Street Bank, JPMorgan, recently told its clients that, even if Sanders were elected, “we put the probability of major changes like medicare-for-all or a wealth tax at less than 5 percent.”All of which raises a question: is the risk less that Sanders ruins the US economy than that he disappoints his supporters?Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They employ more people than large companies and are responsible for  per cent of recent job creation.”The eldest of three children, Sunak studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford.He went on to work at investment bank Goldman Sachs before setting up hedge fund Theleme Partners  years ago.In  he stood for election in Richmond, North Yorks, after the constituency’s previous MP, former Tory leader William Hague, retired.It was the safest Conservative seat in the country and his victory was assured.Former Brexit minister David Jones MP told The Sun: “He is very bright. There was no doubt from the start that he was destined for high office.”After being elected, Sunak moved to a -acre property with its own lake and boathouse in an idyllic small village near Northallerton.It was there he has held lavish summer parties, with champagne and canapes served by unormed staff.Though he earned several million from his investment fund, much of his huge wealth comes through we Akshata’s family.She is the daughter of self-made Indian tech billionaire N.R. Narayana Murthy, co-founder of firm Infosys.Akshata, whose shares in the company are worth around £million, also runs a fashion label.The couple married in  and have two daughters, Krishna and Anoushka.Former PM Theresa May made Sunak a housing under-secretary in January .Her successor Boris promoted him to Chief Secretary to the Treasury last July.William Hague described Sunak as “exceptional”, and ex-Chancellor Sajid Javid once tweeted: “The force is strong with young Sunak.”Now Sunak has taken Javid’s job, which is good news for Brexit-supporting Tories, because while Javid backed Remain during the referendum, Sunak was always a Leaver.Clwyd West MP David Jones, who was on the advisory board of pressure group Leave Means Leave, said: “Boris recognises that there is going to be tough negotiation with the EU.“He realises he’s going to need the Treasury behind him in that.“The Prime Minister now has a strong ally in the Treasury.”Sunak backed Brexit as he felt excessive EU regulations were shackling the nation’s small businesses.He said: “EU red tape is holding them back.“From working in my mum’s tiny chemist shop to my experience building large businesses, I have seen how we should support free enterprise and innovation to ensure Britain has a stronger future.”Sunak, whose grandparents were born in India and emigrated to Britain in the s, also felt it was wrong to give EU citizens easy access to the UK when it was often denied to nationalities outside of the Brussels bloc.Describing himself as a British Indian whose hobbies include “keeping fit, cricket, football and movies”, he said: “I come from a family of immigrants. I am grateful to Britain for giving my family the opportunity to settle here and forge a better le.“I am proud of our country’s generous approach to welcoming hardworking and ambitious immigrants and believe it is in our interests to continue doing so.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But why The war between Blair and Brown blighted Labour’s years in office and held back progress.Even Theresa May’s dismal tenure was worsened by Philip Hammond’s soul-sapping negativity.The friendship of David Cameron and George Osborne, by contrast, succeeded in restoring sanity to our finances.So Boris Johnson knows he must have the Treasury fully onside.He and chief adviser Dominic Cummings need it to enact their ideas, not resist or dilute them.It is clear Sajid Javid’s advisers were considered just such an obstacle.The Sun has a lot of time for The Saj, a decent bloke who commendably stood by his staff.His is a sad departure.He might have proved a fine Chancellor.But Rishi Sunak should too.He is very bright, imaginative and enthused by our post-Brexit prospects.We wish him luck, with a historic Budget next month.Most of the reshuffle was welcome — three appointments in particular.New Attorney General Suella Braverman has an appetite to stop leftie campaigners getting like-minded judges to impose via their courts a political agenda rejected at the ballot box.Anne-Marie Trevelyan looks like the no-nonsense type to rein in the scandalous £.billion foreign aid budget.And Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden will, we hope, ensure non-payment of the BBC licence is decriminalised before ushering in a subscription model.We do have one bit of advice for Boris as he prepares to deliver Brexit in full and spend billions, though: It is fine to bring the Treasury in line. But do not lose sight of the balance sheet.Gordon Brown did — and Britain is still counting the cost.ELLIE Gould fought back hard against her ex-boyfriend’s frenzied kne attack.It wasn’t enough. But it might have been, had she known how to defend herself.So The Sun today backs her friends’ petition for compulsory self­-defence classes in school PE lessons.What a dference they could make to kids’ safety and self-confidence.As Ellie’s mum Carole says: “We teach our children to swim because it’s a le skill. Why not self-defence ”You can sign the petition here.ROSES are gone, violets are too.They still have some daffs.Let’s pray that will do.Happy Valentine’s Day!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I don’t believe any self-respecting minister would accept such conditions. Therefore I felt the best thing to do was to go.”In his resignation letter, Mr Javid appeared to take a shot at the PM by accusing him of undermining the Treasurys credibility by surrounding himself with Yes men advisors.He said: It is crucial for the effectiveness of government that you have people around you who can give you clear and candid advice.Mr Javid also wrote: I would urge you to ensure the Treasury as an institution retains as much credibility as possible.The bombshell decision to resign comes amid an ongoing feud with the PMs chief adviser Dominic Cummings.It culminated in the mandarin launching a surprise power-grab for the Treasury leaving the Chancellors tenure in tatters.Their fallout was sparked when the spin chief unceremoniously sacked a member of Javids senior staff over an explosive leaking row last summer.This morning Mr Cummings refused to answer questions about the spat."},{"url":null,"title":"lets give the spanish a jolly rogering and nick all that sunken treasure","story":"This all sounds very noble until you hear that, actually, what they’re doing is looking for a ship that sank in .Called the Nuestra Senora del Juncal, it was loaded with spices, cocoa, leather and . . .  tons of gold, silver and precious stones.The most recent Spanish treasure galleon to be located, in , was carrying just  tons.And that haul was valued at £million.So God alone knows what  tons would fetch. Billions, for sure.What’s interesting is that the ship did not go down with all hands lost.There were  survivors — and they were able to tell rescuers where the Nuestra Senora had sunk. That information has not been lost.So why are we just sitting back letting Spain and Mexico get on with it Britain needs money for its exciting new railway line and all the hospitals Boris Johnson has promised.Andthere’s a small mountain of it sitting at the bottom of the sea off Mexico’s east coast, why don’t we just sneak over there and help ourselves Certainly, our new six-year-old Chancellor should be considering this . . .  once he’s finished his morning bowl of Frosties and tidied his room.Think about it. We have naval ships in the region waging a hopeless war against South American drug cartels. So why not simply ask them to drive around with their sonar on I feel sure thatthis equipment can find a near-silent Russian submarine gently humming its way through the depths, it would have no trouble at all spotting  tons of gold and silver.Or we could draft in RRS Boaty McBoatface . That’s designed to map the seabed and would be a very useful tool.Frankly, having it in the Caribbean looking for treasure is a much better use of it than having it wandering around Antarctica studying penguins and looking for more dreary evidence of climate change. We know already.I bet the crew would be happier too.Of course, when we do find the loot, Spain will claim it’s theirs, in the same way they say they own Gibraltar.No worries. We’ll just behave like we do when the Greeks say they want the Elgin Marbles back.And Mexico  It’s true the jewels and the gold were sourced from their neck of the woods.But as every schoolboy knows, it’s “finders, keepers”.Britain has a reputation for fair play and decency, but in a cut-and-thrust world we need to be a bit more devious.Maybe then we could find the loot and tell the world we hadn’t. “Nope. Nothing there. Sorry.”IF I were to list all the Bond music in order of greatness – and being a man, EVERYTHING has to be listed like this – Octopussy’s All Time High by Rita Coolidge would be the all-time high.I love Rita Coolidge. She sounds like she’s singing while sitting down.At No, from On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, I’d have We Have All The Time In The World, by Louis ­Armstrong, who sounds like he’s lying down in the bath. And at No it’d be the ­incidental music used during the ski chase in the same movie.I’d have to go a long way down the list – past Mr Kiss Kiss Bang Bang from ­Thunderball, past the music used in the cinema adverts before the film started, and down past the Muzak playing when I took my seat – before I got to the dreary song chosen for the ­latest  outing.Performed by Billie Eilish, it is about as memorable as the middle of a Tuesday night.LIKE lots of box-set enthusiasts, I was captivated by Netflix’s drama The Stranger.“Let’s do one more”, I’d say every night. “Come on. It’s only am.”Set in northern England and starring Richard Armitage, the plot twisted and turned, building to the point that in the final episode I started to wonder how all the endless storylines could all be brought together and tied off.I was intrigued. Fascinated. On the edge of my seat.And then – with a load of stuff still up in the air – it just ended.What I had sat through, then, was a beautully told eight-hour joke. With no punchline.THE BBC has signed up Greta Thunberg to present a new series about monster truck racing in Texas.Only kidding. She’s been signed to present a show on – you’ll never guess – climate change.“I can’t wait. It’ll be so exciting,” said no one.I’VE always said hybrid cars are too heavy, thanks to the fact they have two engines.And now this ­photo of a Toyota Prius proves it.NORMALLY, I’m in full agreement with The Sun’s television critic, Ally Ross.But his review of ­Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop Lab show on Netflix was wide of the mark.He described it as “dumb and dangerous”.Wrong, mate. It was way worse than that.At one point, they had two women playing with a vibrator the size of a JCB.And somehow they managed to make the scene even more boring than The One Show.WHENEVER somebody builds a really good bridge, I’ll travel miles out of my way to go and look at it. I realise this is a bit tragic.My favourite bridge in the whole wide world spans the Humber.It’s so graceful and delicate – and when I stand at one end and watch it disappear into the mist on a summer’s morning, I often suffer from a small but embarrassing trouser moment.The only annoying thing about the Humber Bridge is that they went to all the trouble and expense of building it simply to connect the small village of Hessle to the even smaller village of Barton. Two places no one has ever heard of.The fabulous Oresund Bridge was needed because it links Sweden and Denmark.It’s the same story in San Francisco, which has many great bridges that connect the city to the rest of Calornia.That’s the point of a bridge. It links two places that need to be linked.Which brings me on to Boris Johnson’s plan to build a -mile bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland.Hmmm. I’m aware the Chinese have built a sea bridge this long, but this is a nation that built a whole new coronavirus hospital in SIX DAYS.We are just not that fast. We can’t even build a new railway line without a -year argument.And the fact is that when we finish our new bridge, midway through the rd Century, we will have linked a place called Larne to a place called Portpatrick.Now, I don’t want to have a downer on the plan.Butwe are going to build a -mile bridge over the sea, wouldn’t it be more usefulit went from Dover to Calais Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

More like an actress acting the part of someone who cares. As so many of them do.“I find Portman’s type of activism deeply offensive to those of us who actually do the work. I’m not writing this out of bitterness, I am writing out of disgust,” she wrote.Unfortunately, coming from someone who has been so integral in the protest movement, this sounds like sour grapes.Natalie’s response to Rose’s criticism was as elegant and as understated as her protest.She said: “I agree with Ms McGowan that it is inaccurate to call me ‘brave’ for wearing a garment with women’s names on it.“Brave is a term I more strongly associate with actions like those of the women who have been testying against Harvey Weinstein the last few weeks.”She also responded to Rose’s accusation that Natalie has only been directed twice by women.But in this criticism, Rose is seriously missing the point. Female directors don’t get as far in Hollywood as male ones, which is precisely what Natalie is pointing out with her cloak protest. Therefore, there are fewer available to work with.As Natalie said: “It is true I’ve only made a few films with women. In my long career, I’ve only gotten the chance to work with female directors a few times . . . Unfortunately, the unmade films I have tried to make are a ghost history.“Female films have been incredibly hard to get made at studios, or to get independently financed. If these films do get made, women face enormous challenges during the making of them.”By the way, this is not the first time Natalie has protested from within the system.While presenting the best director category at the Golden Globes in , she introduced the line-up by saying: “And here are the all-male nominees.”Again, it’s not a shouty, noisy street protest. But it served to make her point. Just that she did it in a dferent way than Rose might. And that’s fine.In fact, some people think that Rose’s in-your-face type of protest risks alienating some people.I think women should support each other when it comes to vying for equality.But also, Rose just sounded spiteful when she said Natalie was “an actress acting like someone who cares”.Rose is a hero to many women. But she needs to understand that whether their contribution is big or small, loud or subtle, anyone’s effort to affect change helps.JANE Fonda, who looked fabulous at the Oscars, has said she is done with plastic surgery.Well, I guess  is as good an age as any to stop nipping and tucking.She must have a great doctor, as whatever the actress has had done has been done very well indeed – because, in my experience, it’s not often you look better after a facelt than you did before.PERHAPS Andrea Leadsom had a premonition that she was going to be axed as Business Secretary in this week’s Cabinet reshuffle.She recently wrote a column obliquely warning Boris Johnson not to cut the number of female ministers in his Cabinet.Addressing the issue of female board members among FTSE  companies, Andrea wrote: “Working in the City in the Nineties, I saw myself how a male-dominated environment can limit a career.”Unfortunately for her, the warning did not save her skin and she has been sacked, along with Theresa Villiers as Environment Secretary and housing minister Esther McVey.By the way, eight of the  members of Mr Johnson’s first Cabinet were female –  per cent.Despite these sackings, that figure has actually risen – slightly – to nearly  per cent.Ideally, the split would be an even -.But the reality is that business and politics can both be brutal.Men and women alike must accept they might one day get the sack.It simply goes with the territory.Being selected on the basis of gender is just as wrong as being sacked on that basis.Right person, right job, regardless of their gender.THAT is what true equality means.SAY what you like about the bonkers lestyle advice dispensed by Gwyneth Paltrow on Goop – and some of it is seriously out there.But whatever she is doing clearly works.She is, at the age of , nothing short of radiant.In fact she looks amazing and also happy.Not only that but she became instantly relatable to parents everywhere with a confession that her -year- old daughter finds her embarrassing.That’s a good reminder there is nothing like a teenager to keep you normal and down to earth for fear that you will embarrass them, no matter what you do.Although, to be fair, perhaps Gwyneth’s daughter has had a predisposition to feel embarrassed by her mother ever since she named her  . . . Apple.What are the ethics of seat-reclining on a long-haul flight An American Airlines passenger raised the question after video-shaming a fellow traveller who punched and pushed her seat when she reclined it.Bearing in mind the recline button moves the seat about in, I suspect this chap has anger issues, as reclining a seat that has a recline button is hardly an act of aggression.I’d disable the recline button and then all you have to fight over is the armrest.DAMIAN Hurleys resemblance to his mother, Liz, is uncanny.More so than ever in the latest shots of the two of them together, which he posted online this week.Some people think it is vaguely unsettling that he looks more like Liz Hurley than Liz Hurley.But as a mum myself, I think it’s heartwarming a teenage boy should be so happy to emulate his mother.OH the utter folly of the face tattoo!The latest to succumb to this trend, which a few years ago would be, frankly, unthinkable, is Amber Rose.She has had the words Bash and Slash tattooed across her forehead in old English manuscript style.It’s a reference, apparently, to the model’s three-month-old son Slash, and six-year-old son Sebastian.

Please do not pimp your royal connections to any passing dodgy billionaire or investment banker who claims to care deeply about your charity work.Frankly, it doesn’t look good so far.The nation cringed when Prince Harry buttonholed Disney boss Bob Iger at the London premiere of The Lion King, aggressively pitching Meghan’s availability for “voiceover” work.A member of the Royal Family begging a Hollywood big-shot for work was not a pretty sight.When they handed in their letter of resignation, Harry and Meghan made lofty announcements about “collaborating” with the Queen, as though Her Majesty, , is some grime DJ who could be brought in to remix their latest single.The brutal truth is that we will not see much of Harry and Meghan in these parts.This week they sacked  loyal UK staff and shut their Buckingham Palace office.But by turning their backs on the royal le, Harry and Meghan have placed themselves in an almost impossible situation.They claim to want to be financially independent of Prince Charles and the British taxpayer.Then they will have to grab the big pay days where they can.They will have to earn phenomenal sums of money to fund the lavish lestyle to which they are accustomed.But there is absolutely nothing in either of their CVs to suggest they can make that kind of dough without flogging their royal connections to the highest bidder.If Harry and Meghan are going to support themselves, they are going to have to get their hands dirty in the working world.Harry’s discussions with Goldman Sachs may be focused on his charity work right now, but investment bankers are not renowned for their boundless human compassion.Big bankers — and mega-rich companies like Netflix and Apple — will look at Harry and Meghan and wonder what they can get out of them.Harry and Meghan are free to demean themselves, as Harry did so spectacularly when he shook his diamond-encrusted begging bowl at the boss of Disney.But please don’t demean this country.Please don’t debase the Royal Family, as Prince Andrew has done.Please, Harry and Meghan — do not embarrass the Queen.Because let’s face it, chaps — without your royal connections, the pair of you really don’t add up to very much at all.After all those wild decades, Keith – who is said to have smoked an estimated , fags in his time – clearly believes in moderation in all things.Especially moderation in moderation.IN a pithy turn of phrase worthy of Oscar Wilde, one commentator mused that Labour’s dishevelled Tracy Brabin looked like she had been “banged over a wheelie bin” in her off-the-shoulder frock in the House of Commons.Showing Tracy how it is done, Kate Beckinsale looked stunning in a very similar off-the-shoulder number at a pre-Oscars party.Kate also looks as though she has never even seen a wheelie bin.But it’s not true.

Its given everyone a bit of a buzz.I havent even spoken to my dad about it yet. I saw it on Facebook and immediately texted it to him. Its his birthday.The new graffiti is remarkably similar to Banksys iconic Balloon Girl mural.The piece shows a young girl with her hand extended toward a red heart-shaped balloon being carried away by the wind.It was first spotted in  in ious spots in London and has become one of Banksys most famous works.Banksy is an elusive graffiti artist whose real identity has never been revealed.His street art has been spotted around the south of England, including London, Brighton and Bristol as well as prominent international locations.He is one of the worlds richest and best known artists worth an estimated £million.But last year, his ex-agent Steven Lazarides released a series of exclusive pictures of the young artist at work.The snaps show the secretive street scribbler working on some of his most famous etchings, but his face still remains a mystery.He has at ious times been rumoured to be Bristol street artist Robin Gunningham and Massive Attack musician Robert Del Naja."},{"url":null,"title":"caroline flack honesty sunshine our life inspired","story":"She was also one of the most honest.Unlike so many of our cosseted household names she was approachable, witty and refreshingly open about her own le and struggles.She spoke with candour about her career and her personal le.She was unafraid to open up about her fears and in that way she inspired fans to be open and honest about the problems we all face in le at dferent times.She was a brilliant host of Love Island — funny and insightful without ever being patronising towards the contestants.Her untimely death is a tragedy, the third associated with the show and its future must now be in doubt.The Crown Prosecution Service needs to take a long look in the mirror and ask why it pursued its course of action given what they knew about her vulnerability.We may never know exactly what drove Caroline over the edge.But we will always remember how, like the weather at the TV villa, she brought so much sunshine into our lives.The Duchess of Cambridge’s candour about the joys and pressures of motherhood is to be applauded.Kate’s moving honesty in a new podcast about her feelings of loneliness and “mum guilt” will chime with women across the country.And the fact our future Queen has expressed her feelings so publicly shows how she is subtly modernising the monarchy as well as gaining in self- confidence.The contrast with Meghan and Harry’s complaints about being in the media spotlight will not be lost on the public.While the Sussexes have quit their Royal duties, Kate has kept working hard for her husband and the “firm”.She had to put up with years of jibes about her family and fashion sense, but the nation has now taken her to its heart.We are lucky – and proud – to have this Duchess of Dignity.BRITAIN’S standards in areas like the environment, the minimum wage and workers’ rights are higher than many EU countries.But Brussels is bizarrely demanding that we LOWER our internationally admired regulationswe want to sign up to its tarf-free trade deal.Boris must stick to his mantra of levelling up, not levelling down, and resist the Eurocrats’ race to the bottom.Anything  would betray voters.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was frightened that he would get in and kill me.“I’d lie down and turn the lights out — I prayed he would leave me alonehe thought I wasn’t there.”Joanne and McPhillips were together for  years before she kicked him out of their home in the town.She said he had become “distant” and “secretive” and would regularly fly off the handle for any reason.McPhillips moved in with a friend but soon began harassing her with vile texts and voicemails — sending hundreds of threats daily.In one sickening message, the cruel bully pretended to be her stillborn daughter.Joanne said of the texts: “They would start first thing in the morning and go on until last thing at night. He would say he was my wee girl and that I let her die — that I deserved the fact she is gone.“He threatened to cut my throat and blow up my car.

thousands turn to advance payments - but they have to be paid back out of your own benefits. These figures show advance repayments cost £m in one month alone - with struggling northern English towns the worst hitShareCommentsByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent:,  FEB News \" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailNearly £million of  Universal Credit benefit payments were clawed back from the poorest households in one month last year, according to the Tory government’s own figures. New claimants for Universal Credit have to wait a minimum of five weeks for their first payment to be processed, forcing many to take out loans form from the Government. The borrowing, known as Advance Payments, to cover their basic living costs before their first entitlement arrives and is then deducted from regular payments. The delay has faced harsh criticism with MPs warning that the need to borrow forces claimants into a cycle of debt with some ending up at food banks as a result.The Department for Work and Pensionsadmitted that in August , the latest period available, it deducted £ million from claimants across the UK to pay back their loans. The ten worst hit areas are in northern towns in what has been referred to as the Red Wall - traditional Labour seats in the North and Midlands many of which fell to the Tories for the first time in the December election.Knowsley was the worst hit with £, repaid for UC Advance Repayment deductions during August closely followed by Hartlepool on £, and Bootle with £,.In Glasgow South West, the constituency of Chris Stephens MP who asked for the figures, £, was repaid for UC Advance Repayment deductions in one month. Stephens described the figures showing the money being clawed back from some of the most deprived areas of the country as “astonishing” It is clear from this answer that the DWP Advance Payment system simply doesn’t work and demonstrates that the UK Social Security system is broken.” Stephens said: “I would urge all Parliamentary colleagues to look at these figures and to press the UK Government to build a social security system fit for purpose, starting with ending the five week wait.”  “What is required is to end the five week wait, and introduce a first payment within the first two weeks of a claim without the need to pay this back – the current system is a vicious circle of debt.”  A DWP spokesperson said: “In August  alone £.bn in Universal Credit was paid out across the UK, and advance repayments amounted to less than  percent of that figure.” In full: The  UK areas worst-hit by Universal Credit advances KEY: Constituency and how much was repaid in Universal Credit advances in August  alone. Other deductions were taken for other reasons - such as overpayments, arrears, fines or fraud - but advance payment deductions made up £.million of the £.million in total deductions across the country. .

She knows getting this wrong at the ­beginning makes for unhappy endings in teenage years and adulthood. She knows that one of the main causes of death in young mums is suicide, which is why she is building a support network to help them. Kate also knows that no matter where you come from, children and parents need support. But background determines whether that support will be forthcoming. Which is why the Tory attack on Sure Start centres is all the more shocking. Today we reveal how austerity cuts mean , have shut since  – that’s more than one in three. Yet Sure Starts do everything that Kate is talking about and more. They not only provide clinics, health advice and support for parents but can identy abuse and neglect early. Now , fewer children have such protection, and that is a national scandal. Better to prevent a child being abused in the first place than wring our hands in horror after the event. Better to spot a young mother’s depression and treat it than to weep at her graveside. Better that Sure Starts catch ­problems early than for them to fester and cost the NHS an extra £million a year. Sure Starts have proved their worth since being introduced in . Now it’s time for Boris Johnson to recognise their value too. Healthy attitude If there is one thing the three Labour leadership contenders can agree on, it is that the NHS needs to be protected from Tory threats to its existence.  Sir Keir Starmer tells the Sunday Mirror today of his own painful experiences sitting by the bedside of his mother and more recently his mother-in-law.Although he sadly lost them both, he has nothing but praise for the NHS care thatthey received.And it has made him all the more determined to ensure the health service gets the resources it needs.

I thought it might be a thank you or something but as soon as I saw the dishevelled sarnie in there I knew something was amiss. The dark brown pencil it was written with should have been a clue, it was a foreboding colour.  Pete had mixed feelings when he received the note as he was amused that Pearl had gone to the trouble to write the note. But he was also horried that his daughter aposmust have been Hank Marvin apos. He added: This is a very Pearl thing to do - she is what a casual observer might describe as apossassyapos. To her mother itaposs the sign of a strong woman but to me itaposs plain insolence.

When doctors told the couple that their daughter would potentially face a whole list of lelong medical conditions, including heart problems, they were heartbroken. But mum-of-two Meryn, from Chesham, Bucks, said Cara is defying the odds by not just walking and talking but modelling for catalogues and campaigns too. The social researcher said: The way the consultant broke the news to Duncan and I wasn’t good – he didn’t have a good bedside manner. “He told us Cara had Down’s syndrome and then listed all the medical issues she could possibly have, such as heart and bowel problems. None of which she does, luckily. “They present it as a really negative thing and just talk about a lot of medical issues.  “When you’re just presented with a long list of problems that your child is going to have, it’s very scary and a terrying thing to hear. “But Cara’s four-and-a-half now and I wish I could go back in time and tell myself that she would be fine and an amazing little girl. “It’s important that adverts and the media reflect society as it really is, and it’s fantastic Cara is contributing towards a more inclusive picture of society and counteracting negative stereotypes of Down’s syndrome. “She’s done so well and I’m so proud of her.”  Cara is now involved in a campaign, Downright Amazing, to educate midwives and doctors to break the news to parents their child has Down’s syndrome in a sensitive way. The idea to kick start her modelling career came from Meryn’s desire to battle the stereotype of the condition, showing children in a positive light. The precocious youngster had her first shoot at two when a local photographer asked for help building his portfolio and is now a natural in front of the camera.  Since then Cara has bagged an agent and picked up paid work for clothing range Little Green Radicals, as well as starring in Downright Amazingaposs campaigns. Sheaposs even become a celebrity in her local area and Meryn said her girl is recognised daily since she began modelling. Meryn said: “Cara loves seeing the photos of herself and she loves doing it because she just gets to play around in the garden having fun. She’s become really confident. “It’s been lovely to see how everything has come together. “She’ll see a picture of herself in the supermarket and she’ll point it out. She’s always smiling and waving at everyone.  “We were in an ice cream shop once and some children recognized her and it was really nice, she loved it.” The youngster’s condition means she is slower in reaching her milestones than her peers but she is now walking, talking and making friends at nursery as well as modelling for catalogues with her -month-old sister, Jessica, who doesnapost have the condition. But Meryn said she and lawyer husband, Duncan have received criticism for Cara’s slower development from people the family doesn’t even know.  She said: “We were in a car dealership a couple of years ago and a couple pointed at Cara and said she was way too old to be crawling. “They were quite embarrassed when I explained that she had Down’s syndrome.

William Smith was working as guard in the city centre when he recognised killer Michael Foran and alerted police. Foran strangled his girlfriend June Jones and then repeatedly stabbed her in a brutal attack at her West Bromwich flat in December . After going on the run, Foran was eventually tracked down and sentenced to le in prison in October .Speaking to the Liverpool Echo, Will said: I told [West Midlands Police] what Iaposd seen. They asked me to send the pictures, I sent them to them.They said theyaposd get to Liverpool for the Saturday morning. They came, introduced themselves and within half an hour this male was detained. June Katie Jones, , was found with  kne wounds around her neck and the left side of her chest and is believed to have lain dead in the bath of the flat she shared with Foran for three weeks before she was found. Her body was only discovered when police forced their way in to the property on New Yearaposs Eve, .  William identied him following a public appeal and alerted West Midlands Police to his whereabouts. Dad-of-six Will shared a chain of emails between himself and West Midlands Police in which an officer thanked him for helping them capture the wanted man.  In one message a detective working for the force told the -year-old security guard: Thanks Will, all down to you! Will said he wanted to make sure Foran was caught: Iaposm a father. I have a daughter, I have granddaughters. He claims he attempted to report the sighting of Foran to Merseyside Police before contacting the West Midlands force. However, a spokeswoman for the force said Merseyside Police were unable to locate any log of this call to operators.  Will received an award from Interr, the security company he is employed by at River Island, for his efforts in helping capture a wanted murderer. Foran, , from West Bromwich, was captured on CCTV leaving his flat with friend Keith OaposDwyer before  escaping to Liverpool in his accompliceaposs car. On January , Foran was spotted on a camera at an Esso petrol station in  Anfield and police said they believed he had  fled to the city in the hope of travelling to Ireland and evading justice. Just four days later, detectives confirmed that Foran was found  begging on the streets of Liverpool city centre, almost four weeks after police believed June was murdered on December .  He was arrested and transported back to the West Midlands where he was charged with Juneaposs murder. A Birmingham Crown Court In October , Foran was sentenced to le in prison to serve a minimum of  years before being eligible to apply for parole. Keith O’Dwyer, , from West Bromwich, pleaded guilty to assisting an offender. He was sentenced to  months in prison. The family of June, also known as Katie, released the following statement moments after he was sentenced.

"},{"url":null,"title":"hospices not places people delivered","story":"w.mantis  Hospices are not places people are delivered to die - they are full of love n Rachel Clarke is based at Katharine House Hospice in Oxfordshire. She has written a book called A Doctor’s Story of Love and Loss  where she talks about her experiences and the patients she has cared for n Rachel Clarke is a palliative care doctor at Katharine House Hospice in Oxfordshire.  nWhen patients are admitted, many are fearful of death.  nBut Rachel and her colleagues are determined to help them live le to the full before they die.  nIn a second moving extract from her book Dear Le: A Doctor’s Story of Love and Loss, she remembers some of the patients and their stories which will stay with her forever...  nDorothy  nDorothy was admitted to the hospice on a Monday. n“There is no point in spending time with me,” she declared on arrival. “I will be dead on Thursday.”  n“What makes you think that ” I asked, intrigued.  n  naposWe must act now to save our hospices - or children will go without careapos   nHospice doctoraposs heartbreaking description how cancer aposstole her dad bit by bitapos   n nShe gave me the kind of lingering stare a teacher reserves for the classroom dunce, then explained: “Mr Edwards. The senior consultant on the surgical ward told me my bowels had stopped working and I would be dead in six days. That was on Friday. I have three days left.”  nI knew the rudiments of Dorothy’s story. Admitted to AE with acute bowel ­obstruction. Given her age –  – an almost certainly terminal diagnosis. But at no stage was there mention of Thursday.  n“I will concede I do not feel full of death,” Dorothy stated. “I feel full of le. Butyou don’t mind, I would rather be left alone. I have little time left and I would like to read my newspaper.”  nRarely in my career had I been dismissed more magnicently. I hardly dared respond.  n“Based on my medical assessment, I am not at all certain you’ll be dead on Thursday,” I told Dorothy. “If you had more time, is there any way you would like to spend it ”  n  n   n“Were I not to be dead on Thursday, then I would certainly be playing bridge with my local group, as I have done every Thursday for the last two decades. But I can assure you I will be dying instead.”  n“How about this,” I proposed. “We plan for bridge, unless death intervenes ”  n“Young lady, I will humour youit makes you feel useful.”  nA good day, for me, in the hospice, is one in which I feel we have helped someone die with comfort and dignity intact.  nBut infinitely preferable are the days when we have helped a dying patient live – be that basking in a bath filled with insanely priced bubblebath, stroking the family Labrador, saying a rushed but no less momentous “I do” from a wheelchair decked in flowers in the hospice chapel, or watching gold finches gleam in the trees outside.  nIn a ward where every patient has a terminal diagnosis, le, in all its loveliness, goes on.  nOn Thursday morning, the nurses busied themselves with washing, sprucing, plumping and preening. When Dorothy finally emerged, dressed for her bridge trip, she could have been Boudica.  nDesperately thin, her chariot a wheelchair, a pre-emptive dose of morphine in her veins, yet nonetheless sitting ramrod straight with crocodile handbag perched on her lap and an impeccably coordinated green tweed skirt, cashmere cardigan and court shoes.  nFlushed with all the fuss and attention, Dorothy was, for that Thursday only, the queen of our ward – and she knew it. For a moment, our eyes met, and she nodded ­imperceptibly.  nThe next morning, when I arrived at her bedside to hear all about her trip, Dorothy bemoaned her poor form. “I simply wasn’t as sharp as usual,” she lamented.  nI raised an eyebrow. “To be fair, Dorothy, no one  around the table had the excuse that they were dying,” I observed. “Did anyone  seem to mind ”  nA mischievous grin, a twinkle in her eye, and then, finally, I was ­liberated from the dunce’s corner with the words: “Dr Clarke, it was magnicent.”  nA few days later, Dorothy died. Mr Edwards, it turned out, was wrong by only  hours, but in that time, how his patient lived.  n  n   nSimon  nSimon, a former policeman in his sixties, had retired a few months earlier. Shortly afterwards, he noticed a lump in his neck, painless, innocuous and perhaps, he had assumed, related to a recent head cold.  nThe lump continued to grow. Still more curious than concerned – he regularly ran  miles before breakfast – he visited his GP.  nThe speed of his referral to hospital impressed him, innocent of the fact he was on a two-week cancer pathway. The scan became a biopsy, the biopsy a consultant, murmuring cryptically about inoperability, as Simon sat stricken, pinned to his seat, hearing nothing of substance after “cancer”.  nI heard him before I set eyes on him. Specically, I heard the sound of air being sucked into his lungs through an airway severely compressed by a tumour.  nSimon was sitting bolt upright, eyes darting, his shirt ripped off and both hands gripping the bed like his le depended on it.  nBeside him stood a woman in her thirties, distraught and dishevelled, saying, “It’s OK, Dad. Look. Look, the doctor’s here. ­Everything’s going to be OK now.”  nSimon stared up at me, gulping for air. There was no way he could sustain this work of breathing. If, as I suspected, panic had exacerbated his airway obstruction, then I knew how to help.  nThe nurses brought the large dose of ­steroids that would, I hoped, begin to shrink the swelling in Simon’s neck. Next, a tiny dose of a fast-acting sedative, just enough to take the edge off his panic.  nI saw his daughter Sophie was crying. He began to describe living alone with cancer, having been widowed a few years previously. “It’s all been so quick. Too much to take in. Sophie,I’m honest, is my rock, but she has Timmy, her boy, to look after as well.”  n“Don’t be ridiculous, Dad,” Sophie ­interjected, almost angrily. “You know looking after you is no problem. We all love being with you, especially Timmy.”  nI broached the topic of the future. “Look, I’m not stupid,” he exclaimed. “I don’t have one, do I  This is it. I know what’s going on.”  nThere are moments in medicine when what you say next feels as pregnant with risk as a surgeon’s first incision. The right words, used wisely, can bridge the airiest expanse between you and your patient but,misjudged, may blow trust to pieces.  n“Simon, are you the kind of person who likes to discuss everything frankly,” I began, “or do you prefer to take things one day at a time, without speculating about the future ”  n“I already know I’m dying,” he responded. “What  could you possibly tell me ”  n“One of the things I’ve noticed working here, Simon, is how often patients feel unable to ask about the thing they’re most preoccupied with, which is what it’s going to be like when they die – and I wonder whether this is something you’d like to talk about ”  nI saw horror distort Sophie’s face, as though I’d trespassed somewhere no doctor should tread but her father,anything, looked relieved.  n“Go on,” he said cautiously.  n“OK...we tend to see the same patterns in people with cancer who are approaching the end of le. One of the first things many patients notice is losing their strength, their energy. I’m guessing you’re already aware of that ”  nA rueful roll of the eyes.  n“No kidding. I used to run marathons. Can’t even get up the stairs now.” “That loss of energy gradually worsens. You might find you need a nap most days, more than one, probably. Then, one day, you realise you’re sleeping more than you’re awake. It’s not painful or horrible, it’s just immensely frustrating. Patients can find it helps to try and plan in advance a bit, saving up their energy for the things that really matter.”  n“Like Timmy,” Simon ­interrupted. “I like to know when he’s visiting so I can have a sleep beforehand.”  n“I didn’t realise that, Dad,” said Sophie.  n“Well, I want to give him my best, don’t I  And I don’t want to lose a second with him.”  nSophie turned to me. “Timmy’s dad’s not around anymore, you see. Left when he was two. Only shows up around Christmas and birthdays. Dad’s more like his real father.”  n“I see,” I said slowly, computing the layers of loss. I went on. “Often, at the end, there aren’t any dramatic changes. That ­sleepiness continues. A patient finds they are sleeping nearly all of the time.  n“You stop feeling hungry and you don’t want to eat. You may stop feeling thirsty too. Then, one day, rather than sleeping, you slip into unconsciousness.  n“It’s not a distinction you are even aware of. Your brain is just more deeply unresponsive. Sometimes, I wonderthis is the body’s way of protecting the mind – you stop being afraid, you’re oblivious to it all.”  nSimon and Sophie were quietly crying.  n“How long do you think I have left ” he asked me directly.  n“I have no reason to think you are going to die today, Simon. I do think your time is short – weeks, not months, perhaps only very short weeks – but I would love to believe we can get you home for a bit,that’s what you would like.”  nSimon said nothing. The silence, though thick with emotion, was not strained. Finally, he raised his eyes and smiled.  n“OK. I will. Maybe I’ll get to my boy’s birthday too.

She has written a book called A Doctor’s Story of Love and Loss  where she talks about her experiences and the patients she has cared for nRachel Clarke is a palliative care doctor at Katharine House Hospice in Oxfordshire. nWhen patients are admitted, many are fearful of death. nBut Rachel and her colleagues are determined to help them live le to the full before they die. nIn a second moving extract from her book Dear Le: A Doctor’s Story of Love and Loss, she remembers some of the patients and their stories which will stay with her forever... nDorothy was admitted to the hospice on a Monday.  n“There is no point in spending time with me,” she declared on arrival. “I will be dead on Thursday.” n“What makes you think that ” I asked, intrigued. nWe must act now to save our hospices - or children will go without care  nHospice doctors heartbreaking description how cancer stole her dad bit by bit  nShe gave me the kind of lingering stare a teacher reserves for the classroom dunce, then explained: “Mr Edwards. The senior consultant on the surgical ward told me my bowels had stopped working and I would be dead in six days. That was on Friday. I have three days left.” nI knew the rudiments of Dorothy’s story. Admitted to AE with acute bowel ­obstruction. Given her age –  – an almost certainly terminal diagnosis. But at no stage was there mention of Thursday. n“I will concede I do not feel full of death,” Dorothy stated. “I feel full of le. Butyou don’t mind, I would rather be left alone. I have little time left and I would like to read my newspaper.” nRarely in my career had I been dismissed more magnicently. I hardly dared respond. n“Based on my medical assessment, I am not at all certain you’ll be dead on Thursday,” I told Dorothy. “If you had more time, is there any way you would like to spend it ” n“Were I not to be dead on Thursday, then I would certainly be playing bridge with my local group, as I have done every Thursday for the last two decades. But I can assure you I will be dying instead.” n“How about this,” I proposed. “We plan for bridge, unless death intervenes ” n“Young lady, I will humour youit makes you feel useful.” nA good day, for me, in the hospice, is one in which I feel we have helped someone die with comfort and dignity intact. nBut infinitely preferable are the days when we have helped a dying patient live – be that basking in a bath filled with insanely priced bubblebath, stroking the family Labrador, saying a rushed but no less momentous “I do” from a wheelchair decked in flowers in the hospice chapel, or watching gold finches gleam in the trees outside. nIn a ward where every patient has a terminal diagnosis, le, in all its loveliness, goes on. nOn Thursday morning, the nurses busied themselves with washing, sprucing, plumping and preening. When Dorothy finally emerged, dressed for her bridge trip, she could have been Boudica. nDesperately thin, her chariot a wheelchair, a pre-emptive dose of morphine in her veins, yet nonetheless sitting ramrod straight with crocodile handbag perched on her lap and an impeccably coordinated green tweed skirt, cashmere cardigan and court shoes. nFlushed with all the fuss and attention, Dorothy was, for that Thursday only, the queen of our ward – and she knew it. For a moment, our eyes met, and she nodded ­imperceptibly. nThe next morning, when I arrived at her bedside to hear all about her trip, Dorothy bemoaned her poor form. “I simply  nwasn’t as sharp as usual,” she lamented. nI raised an eyebrow. “To be fair, Dorothy, no one  around the table had the excuse that they were dying,” I observed. “Did anyone  seem to mind ” nA mischievous grin, a twinkle in her eye, and then, finally, I was ­liberated from the dunce’s corner with the words: “Dr Clarke, it was magnicent.” nA few days later, Dorothy died. Mr Edwards, it turned out, was wrong by only  hours, but in that time, how his patient lived. nSimon, a former policeman in his sixties, had retired a few months earlier. Shortly afterwards, he noticed a lump in his neck, painless, innocuous and perhaps, he had assumed, related to a recent head cold. nThe lump continued to grow. Still more curious than concerned – he regularly ran  miles before breakfast – he visited his GP. nThe speed of his referral to hospital impressed him, innocent of the fact he was on a two-week cancer pathway. The scan became a biopsy, the biopsy a consultant, murmuring cryptically about inoperability, as Simon sat stricken, pinned to his seat, hearing nothing of substance after “cancer”. nI heard him before I set eyes on him. Specically, I heard the sound of air being sucked into his lungs through an airway severely compressed by a tumour. nSimon was sitting bolt upright, eyes darting, his shirt ripped off and both hands gripping the bed like his le depended on it. nBeside him stood a woman in her thirties, distraught and dishevelled, saying, “It’s OK, Dad. Look. Look, the doctor’s here. ­Everything’s going to be OK now.” nSimon stared up at me, gulping for air. There was no way he could sustain this work of breathing. If, as I suspected, panic had exacerbated his airway obstruction, then I knew how to help. nThe nurses brought the large dose of ­steroids that would, I hoped, begin to shrink the swelling in Simon’s neck. Next, a tiny dose of a fast-acting sedative, just enough to take the edge off his panic. nI saw his daughter Sophie was crying. He began to describe living alone with cancer, having been widowed a few years previously. “It’s all been so quick. Too much to take in. Sophie,I’m honest, is my rock, but she has Timmy, her boy, to look after as well.” n“Don’t be ridiculous, Dad,” Sophie ­interjected, almost angrily. “You know looking after you is no problem. We all love being with you, especially Timmy.” nI broached the topic of the future. “Look, I’m not stupid,” he exclaimed. “I don’t have one, do I  This is it. I know what’s going on.” nThere are moments in medicine when what you say next feels as pregnant with risk as a surgeon’s first incision. The right words, used wisely, can bridge the airiest expanse between you and your patient but,misjudged, may blow trust to pieces. n“Simon, are you the kind of person who likes to discuss everything frankly,” I began, “or do you prefer to take things one day at a time, without speculating about the future ” n“I already know I’m dying,” he responded. “What  could you possibly tell me ” n“One of the things I’ve noticed working here, Simon, is how often patients feel unable to ask about the thing they’re most preoccupied with, which is what it’s going to be like when they die – and I wonder whether this is something you’d like to talk about ” nI saw horror distort Sophie’s face, as though I’d trespassed somewhere no doctor should tread but her father,anything, looked relieved. n“Go on,” he said cautiously. n“OK...we tend to see the same patterns in people with cancer who are approaching the end of le. One of the first things many patients notice is losing their strength, their energy. I’m guessing you’re already aware of that ” nA rueful roll of the eyes. n“No kidding. I used to run marathons. Can’t even get up the stairs now.” “That loss of energy gradually worsens. You might find you need a nap most days, more than one, probably. Then, one day, you realise you’re sleeping more than you’re awake. It’s not painful or horrible, it’s just immensely frustrating. Patients can find it helps to try and plan in advance a bit, saving up their energy for the things that really matter.” n“Like Timmy,” Simon ­interrupted. “I like to know when he’s visiting so I can have a sleep beforehand.” n“I didn’t realise that, Dad,” said Sophie. n“Well, I want to give him my best, don’t I  And I don’t want to lose a second with him.” nSophie turned to me. “Timmy’s dad’s not around anymore, you see. Left when he was two. Only shows up around Christmas and birthdays. Dad’s more like his real father.” n“I see,” I said slowly, computing the layers of loss. I went on. “Often, at the end, there aren’t any dramatic changes. That ­sleepiness continues. A patient finds they are sleeping nearly all of the time. n“You stop feeling hungry and you don’t want to eat. You may stop feeling thirsty too. Then, one day, rather than sleeping, you slip into unconsciousness. n“It’s not a distinction you are even aware of. Your brain is just more deeply unresponsive. Sometimes, I wonderthis is the body’s way of protecting the mind – you stop being afraid, you’re oblivious to it all.” nSimon and Sophie were quietly crying. n“How long do you think I have left ” he asked me directly. n“I have no reason to think you are going to die today, Simon. I do think your time is short – weeks, not months, perhaps only very short weeks – but I would love to believe we can get you home for a bit,that’s what you would like.” nSimon said nothing. The silence, though thick with emotion, was not strained. Finally, he raised his eyes and smiled. n“OK. I will. Maybe I’ll get to my boy’s birthday too. Thank you, Rachel – I mean it.” nWhen people askmy job is depressing, I reply that nothing could be further from the truth.

When patients are admitted, many are fearful of death. But Rachel and her colleagues are determined to help them live le to the full before they die. In a second moving extract from her book Dear Le: A Doctor’s Story of Love and Loss, she remembers some of the patients and their stories which will stay with her forever... Dorothy Dorothy was admitted to the hospice on a Monday. “There is no point in spending time with me,” she declared on arrival. “I will be dead on Thursday.” “What makes you think that ” I asked, intrigued. She gave me the kind of lingering stare a teacher reserves for the classroom dunce, then explained: “Mr Edwards. The senior consultant on the surgical ward told me my bowels had stopped working and I would be dead in six days. That was on Friday. I have three days left.” I knew the rudiments of Dorothy’s story. Admitted to AE with acute bowel ­obstruction. Given her age –  – an almost certainly terminal diagnosis. But at no stage was there mention of Thursday. “I will concede I do not feel full of death,” Dorothy stated. “I feel full of le. Butyou don’t mind, I would rather be left alone. I have little time left and I would like to read my newspaper.” Rarely in my career had I been dismissed more magnicently. I hardly dared respond. “Based on my medical assessment, I am not at all certain you’ll be dead on Thursday,” I told Dorothy. “If you had more time, is there any way you would like to spend it ”  “Were I not to be dead on Thursday, then I would certainly be playing bridge with my local group, as I have done every Thursday for the last two decades. But I can assure you I will be dying instead.” “How about this,” I proposed. “We plan for bridge, unless death intervenes ” “Young lady, I will humour youit makes you feel useful.” A good day, for me, in the hospice, is one in which I feel we have helped someone die with comfort and dignity intact. But infinitely preferable are the days when we have helped a dying patient live – be that basking in a bath filled with insanely priced bubblebath, stroking the family Labrador, saying a rushed but no less momentous “I do” from a wheelchair decked in flowers in the hospice chapel, or watching gold finches gleam in the trees outside. In a ward where every patient has a terminal diagnosis, le, in all its loveliness, goes on. On Thursday morning, the nurses busied themselves with washing, sprucing, plumping and preening.

Desperately thin, her chariot a wheelchair, a pre-emptive dose of morphine in her veins, yet nonetheless sitting ramrod straight with crocodile handbag perched on her lap and an impeccably coordinated green tweed skirt, cashmere cardigan and court shoes. Flushed with all the fuss and attention, Dorothy was, for that Thursday only, the queen of our ward – and she knew it. For a moment, our eyes met, and she nodded ­imperceptibly.The next morning, when I arrived at her bedside to hear all about her trip, Dorothy bemoaned her poor form. “I simplywasn’t as sharp as usual,” she lamented.I raised an eyebrow. “To be fair, Dorothy, no one  around the table had the excuse that they were dying,” I observed. “Did anyone  seem to mind ” A mischievous grin, a twinkle in her eye, and then, finally, I was ­liberated from the dunce’s corner with the words: “Dr Clarke, it was magnicent.” A few days later, Dorothy died. Mr Edwards, it turned out, was wrong by only  hours, but in that time, how his patient lived.  Simon Simon, a former policeman in his sixties, had retired a few months earlier. Shortly afterwards, he noticed a lump in his neck, painless, innocuous and perhaps, he had assumed, related to a recent head cold. The lump continued to grow. Still more curious than concerned – he regularly ran  miles before breakfast – he visited his GP. The speed of his referral to hospital impressed him, innocent of the fact he was on a two-week cancer pathway. The scan became a biopsy, the biopsy a consultant, murmuring cryptically about inoperability, as Simon sat stricken, pinned to his seat, hearing nothing of substance after “cancer”. I heard him before I set eyes on him. Specically, I heard the sound of air being sucked into his lungs through an airway severely compressed by a tumour. Simon was sitting bolt upright, eyes darting, his shirt ripped off and both hands gripping the bed like his le depended on it. Beside him stood a woman in her thirties, distraught and dishevelled, saying, “It’s OK, Dad. Look. Look, the doctor’s here. ­Everything’s going to be OK now.” Simon stared up at me, gulping for air. There was no way he could sustain this work of breathing. If, as I suspected, panic had exacerbated his airway obstruction, then I knew how to help. The nurses brought the large dose of ­steroids that would, I hoped, begin to shrink the swelling in Simon’s neck. Next, a tiny dose of a fast-acting sedative, just enough to take the edge off his panic. I saw his daughter Sophie was crying. He began to describe living alone with cancer, having been widowed a few years previously. “It’s all been so quick. Too much to take in. Sophie,I’m honest, is my rock, but she has Timmy, her boy, to look after as well.” “Don’t be ridiculous, Dad,” Sophie ­interjected, almost angrily. “You know looking after you is no problem. We all love being with you, especially Timmy.” I broached the topic of the future. “Look, I’m not stupid,” he exclaimed. “I don’t have one, do I  This is it. I know what’s going on.” There are moments in medicine when what you say next feels as pregnant with risk as a surgeon’s first incision. The right words, used wisely, can bridge the airiest expanse between you and your patient but,misjudged, may blow trust to pieces. “Simon, are you the kind of person who likes to discuss everything frankly,” I began, “or do you prefer to take things one day at a time, without speculating about the future ” “I already know I’m dying,” he responded. “What  could you possibly tell me ” “One of the things I’ve noticed working here, Simon, is how often patients feel unable to ask about the thing they’re most preoccupied with, which is what it’s going to be like when they die – and I wonder whether this is something you’d like to talk about ” I saw horror distort Sophie’s face, as though I’d trespassed somewhere no doctor should tread but her father,anything, looked relieved. “Go on,” he said cautiously. “OK...we tend to see the same patterns in people with cancer who are approaching the end of le. One of the first things many patients notice is losing their strength, their energy. I’m guessing you’re already aware of that ” A rueful roll of the eyes. “No kidding. I used to run marathons. Can’t even get up the stairs now.” “That loss of energy gradually worsens. You might find you need a nap most days, more than one, probably. Then, one day, you realise you’re sleeping more than you’re awake. It’s not painful or horrible, it’s just immensely frustrating. Patients can find it helps to try and plan in advance a bit, saving up their energy for the things that really matter.” “Like Timmy,” Simon ­interrupted. “I like to know when he’s visiting so I can have a sleep beforehand.” “I didn’t realise that, Dad,” said Sophie. “Well, I want to give him my best, don’t I  And I don’t want to lose a second with him.” Sophie turned to me. “Timmy’s dad’s not around anymore, you see. Left when he was two. Only shows up around Christmas and birthdays. Dad’s more like his real father.” “I see,” I said slowly, computing the layers of loss. I went on. “Often, at the end, there aren’t any dramatic changes. That ­sleepiness continues. A patient finds they are sleeping nearly all of the time. “You stop feeling hungry and you don’t want to eat. You may stop feeling thirsty too. Then, one day, rather than sleeping, you slip into unconsciousness. “It’s not a distinction you are even aware of. Your brain is just more deeply unresponsive. Sometimes, I wonderthis is the body’s way of protecting the mind – you stop being afraid, you’re oblivious to it all.” Simon and Sophie were quietly crying. “How long do you think I have left ” he asked me directly. “I have no reason to think you are going to die today, Simon. I do think your time is short – weeks, not months, perhaps only very short weeks – but I would love to believe we can get you home for a bit,that’s what you would like.” Simon said nothing. The silence, though thick with emotion, was not strained. Finally, he raised his eyes and smiled. “OK. I will. Maybe I’ll get to my boy’s birthday too. Thank you, Rachel – I mean it.” When people askmy job is depressing, I reply that nothing could be further from the truth. All that is good in human nature – courage, compassion, our capacity to love – is here in its most distilled form.

Liam Maguire, , counts famous footballers and high-flying Dubai business men amongst his clients after launching his own business three years ago. Now, he earns big money cleaning, polishing and waxing cars, charge anywhere from £ to £, per job. But as Liam, from Rainhill, Merseyside, explains, itaposs more than just washing a few windows.Speaking to the Liverpool Echo, he said: It falls down to who has the greatest level of OCD but doing it safely to ensure no excess contact or damage is caused to the car, while at the same time using high grade products to ensure the best finish.Everyday car washes can cause scratches and damage. I’m the guy you call to fix what they’ve caused and also promise you serious satisfaction. But it hasnapost always been fast supercars and rich businessmen for Liam, who has had to work his way up the ladder. He said: I started Urban Valets off the back of my old job. I worked for a company in St Helens since leaving school. I started at  as the aposrag handapos and I eventually became the valeting bay manager at , in charge of people twice my age with double the years in experience. I was unfortunately made redundant.My boss kindly helped me with a van and then became Urban Valets.I still to this day have a great relationship with my old boss and I also maintain his cars.” But the gamble paid off and Liam is now doubling his turnover year-on-year whilst working with some of the most luxurious cars in the business. Liam said: My services range from £ up to thousands. My highest paid job was £, and it took me a week solid. That was on a McLaren S in Manchester for a client who deals in Bitcoin and banking.As for my high profile clients, I never aimed for such football players as my business aim is to impress people who know about cars. I mean that in a respect in which to prove I’m the best at my job. Liamaposs first high profile client was the Red Bull drt masters racers, which then caught the attention of serious-level insurance brokers, multi-business owners who own supercars such as McLarens, Lamborghinis and Ferraris. He said: My greatest achievement is working on the rarest and most expensive supercar that’s in the UK currently, a McLaren Senna. The price tag with upgrades costs around £.million. I’m the only detailer to ever touch one of these rare vehicles. The owner is from Dubai and personally requested me and another valeter to meet at the Birmingham NEC autosport car show and work on this vehicle. I also recently completed a week-long detail down in Essex on a rare show spec  BMW E i which has to be perfect as it is attending a show in Austria in May. I was down in Essex all expenses paid for a week for this, which means a lot to little old me from Merseyside.” Liam admits working with these high-level clients is aposnerve-rackingapos but says that he aposthrivesapos upon the moment and sees it as his apostime to shineapos. Liam said: I know I’m good, I believe in myself and every multi-millionaire I’ve ever met has been that impressed theyaposve sat and gave me advice and wisdom. Something money can’t buy I suppose, so that’s what I enjoy most about my job.With his reputation growing, almost as a by-product Liamaposs Instagram also rocketed.Nearly  people follow Urban Valet on Instagram, which Liam says is due to his bright personality. He said: My following grew massively on Instagram due to my attitude, I shined light on a boring industry and made it fun.  I simplied everything so people could be involved...I shared tips and hints on my Instagram posts and also allowed people to see me and my personality.

Parents Bryn and Leigh Davies and their four children were living in a bungalow at a school where he once worked as a resident caretaker. But they claim they were thrown out by Hertfordshire County Council and given just an hour to pack a few essentials to take to a hotel where they were crammed into two rooms. Through tears, Mrs Davies, , said they are distressed and worried about their future, adding: We have nothing. We were a happy family and we’ve been robbed. We just want to go home and be a family unit again. Are you a struggling parent  Email your story to webnews@mirror. We are being treated like criminals. I’m scared I am going to lose my children. I can’t sit back and do nothing. I have four children. I have to fight for them. The Davies and their two sons - Rhys, , and George,  - are now staying in two small rooms in a converted office block  minutes from home. Their daughters - Grace, , and Emily,  - are staying where. Stay-at-home mum Mrs Davies toldthat the family moved into the three-bedroom bungalow at the now-defunct Sheredes Senior School in Hoddesdon, Herts, in January  when her husband was hired.  She said they paid £. a month in subsidised rent, were responsible for bills and maintenance, and carried out modications to accommodate Mr Daviesapos disability from severe back pain. But in July  Mr Davies, , was sacked by the school - unfairly, he claims - and the family were ordered to move out, with the council saying his right to remain in the property automatically ceased in accordance with his Service Occupancy Agreement. The family refused to leave and this led to a y legal battle that made its way to the High Court in October  and Supreme Court in . At the High Court, the Davies argued that they should be allowed to stay in the home and the council had failed to consider the welfare of their children, who were raised in the bungalow.  But the court sided with the council, saying the familyaposs right to occupy the home ended with his job and they had been trespassing ever since he was dismissed. It allowed the council to move ahead with the eviction, but remained in the bungalow, located next to the school gates, and continued to pay rent. The Davies claim they werenapost notied when the council applied for permission to enforce the writ of possession and the case went to court without their knowledge last year, meaning they werenapost giving an opportunity to mount a challenge. Mrs Davies claims the family had no idea they were being evicted until enforcement officers knocked on her door on February .  The council said since the summer of  it had asked the family a number of times to leave voluntarily, but Mr Davies refused. It said it held off from evicting the family for two years while Mr Davies appealed, and the appeals ended last summer. The eviction was authorised by the court, but the Davies claim it was unlawful because they werenapost give notice. They have launched a new challenge, arguing they were deprived of their legal right to seek a stay, and a hearing is due to take place on March . Mrs Davies, whose family have launched an online petition to publicise their case, said tearfully: There was a knock at the door and there were seven enforcement officers there to evict us.  They saidwe did not go we would be arrested and face  weeks in prison. At the end of the day, there were  enforcement officers. We were told just to take emergencies like medication and paperwork and clothes. It was absolute hell, we were in pieces. It was intimidating. At that point, we had to just go.  She added: We were illegally evicted. We were never served a notice.  The whole family has been split up. We’ve been told that the bungalow is to be sold. It’s all for profit, it is greed. The council said it has not yet made a formal decision on the future of the property. Mr Davies now works as a pest control supervisor in London. His we said he has suffered from depression and anxiety, and attempted to take his own le following a mental breakdown that occurred while he was working at the school.  He claims it was brought on by bullying and harassment in the workplace. Mrs Davies said he was sacked when he was on sick leave. Sheredes School closed in  - a year after Mr Davies was dismissed - and a new academy has since opened in its place. The council doesnapost run the school, but it still owns the bungalow at the site. After being forced out of the home, the family were put in two rooms in a hotel in Great Dumlow, Essex, and then moved into a former office block in Harlow. Mrs Davies said: The most distressing thing is Iaposm not with all of my children. Thereaposs no room for all of us.  We have two studio rooms with two single beds in each but they are not next door to each other. In my room there thereaposs a wardrobe with no hanging rail, a microwave, a washing machine and dryer, a fridge, a two-wing hob and a tiny bathroom. We have nothing to do. We have no TV. My children have no toys. All of our possessions are still in the bungalow and the locks have been changed. It was my husband’s th birthday last week, his presents are still in the home. Friends are taking care of their dog, two cats and budgee. Mrs Davies said the situation has brought anxiety and stress upon the family, adding: My sons are embarrassed. My -year-old said people are laughing because they know he was sleeping on the floor on a mattress at the hotel.

the omelette cooking mistakes we make and revealed a surprising checklist of what you should doyou want to cook the delicious egg dish to perfection  n They look simple to cook but making a perfect omelette can be a little more tricky.  nOver-whip your eggs and they end up scrambled while they also can  go rubbery and split within seconds.  n MasterChef the Professional host Marcus Waring has revealed to omelette lovers what they are doing wrong, Star Online reports. nIn his latest book - Marcus Everyday - he shows you exactly how to master the art in his omelette cooking tutorial.  nIt sounds elementary, but using the correct ingredients and utensils is Marcusapos first advice to omelette fans.  nBuy the freshest eggs you can and always use a non-stick pan and a spatula otherwise youaposll end up going down the pathway to scrambled rather than a delicious omelette.  n  n   n Roast potato cooking mistakes we all make - according to chef who has fed Queen  n Yorkshire pudding cooking mistake we all make - according to top chef   n n nThe Michelin starred chef writes: “The perfect omelette requires four key things – fresh eggs, butter, a non-stick pan and a spatula.  n“Believe it or not, the non-stick pan and the spatula are as important as the ingredients themselves.  n“Whisk the eggs thoroughly in a bowl and don’t add any salt yet.”  nHis next piece of advice is to avoid using too much heat as this could burn your ingredients.  n  n Man claims weaposve all been eating chip shop fish wrong - and criticsapos minds are blown nHe said: “Get your pan on the hob over medium heat – no hotter than that.  n“If the pan’s too hot, you’ll brown the omelette.  n“Put a generous knob of butter into the pan – make sure the base of the pan is covered and the butter is really bubbling, almost to the point where it starts to go brown.  n“Season the eggs and pour them into the pan.”  nAnd the final step is to be gentle with the use of your spatula to prevent your omelette from breaking.  n  n   n“If they’re whipped, they’ll almost look split and they’ll never come together as an omelette.  n“You need to just gently manoeuvre the egg around the pan.”  nTo complete the perfect omelette cooks are advised to flip it over at just the right time.  nIf the eggs are left until itaposs completely solid the omelette is likely to crack or split.  nMarcus advises: “Gently move the egg mixture around with the spatula, don’t whip it.  nTop news stories from n“That’s what we love about omelettes and scrambled eggs is their texture.  n“The moment to flip it over is when the mixture becomes one – but is still a little runny, Marcus advises.  n“If you don’t fold the egg over in the pan at this stage, it will just cook them from underneath – and you don’t want that – as it takes a while to cook through, and the egg on the bottom of the pan will be overcooked and the omelette will just crack when it comes to folding it over.  n“Remove from the pan immediately after folding.”  nEnjoy your perfect omelette courtesy of Marcus Wareing.  nFor more cooking tips you can find Marcus Everyday cookbook on Amazon from

– but is still a little runny, \" Marcus advises. n“If you don’t fold the egg over in the pan at this stage, it will just cook them from underneath – and you don’t want that – as it takes a while to cook through, and the egg on the bottom of the pan will be overcooked and the omelette will just crack when it comes to folding it over. n“Remove from the pan immediately after folding.” nEnjoy your

Just four weeks ago the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were ­sticking to the official line about ­“iding their time between the UK and Canada”. They told us they were forging a future as ­“progressive” royals – serving the Queen on the one hand while p­ursuing their ­humanitarian ­mission. And, as they settled into a wealthy pal’s ­£million Vancouver ­mansion, their  dedicated Buckingham Palace staff were ­desperately trying to make sure the Sussexes have their cake and eat it. But Harry and Meghan had ­already lost their appetite for Victoria sponge at teatime.] They could smell all those free maple cookies and American pie. And just look at how they’ve ­started feeding off fatcat bankers at a summit in Miami hosted by JP Morgan. So now we know what “le out of the spotlight” means for the struggling Sussexes. Turning up at ­billionaires’ ­bashes to bang on about mental health, Princess Diana’s death and saving the planet – for a hefty fee. Meanwhile back in Blighty,  members of staff are negotiating ­redundancy ­pay-offs.  Because Harry and Meghan have stopped pretending they want to be part-time royals and are ­closing down their Buckingham Palace office. But before they go, some of those axed aides will still have to organise the farewell ­engagements lined up for the Sussexes. They include the Commonwealth Day Service at Westminster Abbey on March , which the Queen ­asked them to attend. The monarch, who was so hurt by Megxit, wants to see Harry standing beside his ­brother William at the very heart of her family, before he finally quits the Firm.

The diagnosis comes a week after five others, including a nine-year-old child, who stayed at Contamines-Montjoie near Mont Blanc tested positive for the killer virus. Scout leader Steve Walsh, , dubbed the super-spreader, picked up the disease at a Singapore conference at the end of last month before he stopped at the resort for a few days to stay with his friends. He laterto his his home in Hove, East Sussex. The infected child is the son of British couple Bob and Catriona Saynor, who moved to the Alps three years ago, who also picked up the virus. Nine people in Britain are known to have contracted the illness but eight of those have since been discharged. Two Labour MPs temporarily self-isolated after they attended the same conference as a sufferer however they were then reminded that the risk was low and ended their isolation.Alex Sobel cancelled all events for almost a week after he was among  delegates at a bus conference in Londonaposs QEII conference centre.Lilian Greenwood, also cancelled all her events for a week.

Scientist Professor Neil Ferguson, of the School of Public Health at Imperial College London, told Channel : This virus is the one which probably concerns me the most out of everything Iaposve worked on.  Asked about concerns that % of the population could contract coronavirus, he said: Given how transmissible this virus appears to be and that fact that at least all adults can be infected, we have much less data in children, then % is a reasonable figure. Within the first  months or so. What we don’t know at the moment iseverybody infected. What proportion might die and what are the risk groups  Our best estimates at the moment is that maybe % of people who get infected might die.

Two bodies were pulled from rough seas on Saturday before the worst of the storm hit.One man was found following a huge search operation off Margate after an early-morning distress call, while another was found at Herne Bay. Leboats and the coastguard helicopter had been scouring the sea near Margate Harbour after reports of a man overboard, HM Coastguard said. In the other incident, Kent Police were called at .pm on Saturday to a report a person had been pulled from the sea in Herne Bay. The US National Weather Serviceaposs Ocean Prediction Centre reported winds up to mph and waves that could reach more than fthigh across the North Atlantic. Forecasters were expecting winds to reach mph along coastlines, while some parts of the country could witness up to .inof rain. Experts have warned that conditions amount to a perfect storm, with hundreds of homes at risk of flooding.The Met Office has issued eight weather warnings covering most of the UK this weekend.This includes amber warnings from midday on Saturday over southern Scotland, northern England, Wales and part of the South West saying that flooding could cause a danger to le.Thousands of travellers have had their flights grounded for safety reasons, with British Airways and easyJet confirming cancellations. More than  easyJet flights in and out of the UK on Saturday have been cancelled, while sports fans discovered several fixtures were also called off due to the weather. Residents in West Yorkshire, which was badly hit by flooding during last weekendaposs Storm Ciara, are being helped by British Army personnel sent out by the Ministry of Defence . A spokesman for British Airways said they are merging a small number of Heathrow short-haul flights to the same destination and using larger aircraft where possible to minimise disruption, while a spokeswoman for easyJet confirmed  cancellations. Ryanair said all its flights are operating as normal.A spokeswoman for Heathrow Airport said: To minimise the number of flights cancelled at short notice we have taken the joint decision, alongside our airline and air traffic partners, to pre-emptively consolidate todayaposs schedule. A spokesman for Luton Airport said the airport is fully operational, but added that a number of cancellations are expected later on Saturday. The MoD said  personnel from th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland, will be aiding the Environment Agencyin constructing barriers and repairing flood defences in Ilkley and Calderdale, while  Reservists from th Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment, have also been tasked with providing support where required. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: Our armed forces are always ready to support local authorities and communities whenever they need it. The rapid response of the Army today will help with provision of flood relief to local communities in West Yorkshire. The EA said flooding is likely to be worse than under last weekendaposs Storm Ciara due to rain falling on already saturated ground. In England alone,  properties were left flooded when Storm Ciara struck, the EA said. North Wales Police said very high winds had led to debris and branches falling off trees and Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service said it had rescued a motorist from a car stuck in flood water in the Liskeard area. Power cuts are also expected and there is a good chance that train and buses will see cancellations or delays and roads closed. The Met Office said the main areas of concern on Saturday are north and south-west England and Wales, with the South East bearing the brunt more on Sunday. At just after pm on Saturday, there were  flood warnings - meaning flooding is expected - and more than  flood alerts - meaning flooding is possible - in places across the country. Flood defences are due to be in operation this weekend, with additional temporary flood barriers being installed in Shropshire, Lancashire, Yorkshire and Surrey. More than  staff are on active incident duty and  mobile pumps have been deployed, the EA said.

Ofer Deshe, , died on Thursday after getting into dficulties near the pier at Famara Beach. He was rescued from the water by surfers, but went into cardiac arrest and was pronounced dead at the scene around pm on Thursday. Israeli-born Mr Deshe, who lived in Bath, was the supermarket giant’s Head of Experience Design and Research. The sports enthusiast had lived in the UK for around  years and was MD at City of London-based digital innovation consulting firm Tobias  Tobias before joining Tesco. Design boss Jason Mesut, from Norwich, Norfolk, said in a social media tribute: “RIP Ofer Deshe. A long-time peer and competitor. “More recently a colleague and a friend. Was looking forward to meeting him next week to discuss working together again. “Hugs and love to all that were touched by his heart and his leadership.” Tim Simpson added: “A dear friend and a wonderful, kind-hearted, immensely intelligent and inspiring man. “I’m heartbroken, as I’m sure all who knew him are feeling. Rest in peace Ofer. Thank you for your friendship. I miss you massively already.” A Tesco statement said: We’re extremely sad to hear about this tragic news and our thoughts are with Ofer’s family and friends. He was a much loved and valued part of the Tesco family who will be greatly missed.We will provide whatever support we can to Ofer’s family during this dficult time. Emergency responders were alerted just after .pm on Thursday.  A spokesman for the Civil Guard said: “We can confirm a -year-old British man has died in circumstances which are still being investigated. “There is nothing at this stage to indicate the death is in any way suspicious. “The autopsy will determine the cause of death.” Well-placed sources said they believed the autopsy could point to the death being the result of natural causes and not drowning, although unsubstantiated local reports before the autopsy have indicated he died from drowning. Autopsy results are not normally made public in Spain. One source said the Brit was aided by surfers after he got into dficulties near rocks and was seen collapsing onto his stand-up paddle board before falling into the sea.

called off following a string of calamities that wrecked her dream big day in CubaShareCommentsByGrace Macaskill :,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsSophie and Matt are planning a second wedding day in the UK

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailWhen Sophie Bohun booked her dream wedding she had no idea of the calamities that lay ahead. Sophie, , is a contender for Britain’s unluckiest bride after a ­series of traumas which ended with her big day cancelled. But she might have had an inkling things would not go smoothly after fiancé Matt Stevens chickened out from his proposal – twice. Matt, , first planned to pop the question at the top of a volcano in Bali at sunrise. But after climbing to the top with the ring in his pocket, his nerves got the better of him. Next he took Sophie to a posh London restaurant to do the deed and backed out again – because he thought the scene was too busy. Eventually he asked Sophie one morning in bed and they began ­planning a beach wedding in Cuba for  guests for October  last year. But six weeks before the big day, Matt’s mum Elaine, , had a bad fall while doing DIY in her kitchen and developed an infection. She could hardly walk and medics told her she might not be able to fly. Days later Sophie’s sister Kirsty, , was diagnosed with mouth cancer. Her emergency operation was booked for the week of the wedding. Sophie and Matt, from Minehead, Somerset, decided to go ahead ­without her despite Kirsty being the chief bridesmaid. Sophie said: “We were all ­devastated. Kirsty’s health was more important than the wedding but ­everything was already booked so we felt we had to go ahead. “Kirsty’s children Bertie, who is four, and seven-year-old Beatrice were meant to be my page boy and flower girl, along with their cousins, but they wouldn’t make it either. “I didn’t want my mum Paula to have to choose between Kirsty and me so I told her to stay in England to look after my sister, which meant my dad most likely wouldn’t come out to see me get married either.” Just when they thought things couldn’t get any worse, there was a blow four weeks before the ­ceremony when Thomas Cook went bust. The couple had booked a £, wedding package with the firm at the Iberostar hotel in Playa Pilar in Cuba.  Sophie said: “Thomas Cook staff were convinced there was going to be a buyout. They sent us an email the night before the collapse saying ­everything would be OK. “But then we never heard from anyone again. The staff that we had been dealing with had lost their jobs. “I was already doubting whether we should board the plane because I was worried about my sister, and Matt’s mum was hobbling about with her foot. “In some ways it was a bit of a relief when Thomas Cook folded and we were told the whole thing was ­cancelled but, after everything that happened, we felt numb.” The couple ended up booking a last-minute consolation holiday to Mexico and spent the day they were meant to marry on the beach. Last month they ­finally got back the £, they had paid for their ceremony, hotel and tickets. Their guests, who had booked through Thomas Cook as well, also got their money back because the trip was covered by the Atol financial protection scheme.  Sophie’s sister Kirsty’s operation was a success and she is now almost fully recovered. But the £, the couple spent on gts for their guests was wasted ­because they were etched with last October’s wedding date. Sophie, a personal assistant, said: “We knew Cuba was a long way for our  guests to travel so bought ­everyone jewellery and watches to say thank you. Unfortunately it’s all now sitting upstairs useless. “All the napkins and table ­decorations and stationery had the date on too. So that’s also money wasted. It’s been a nightmare.” The couple, who first got together in  while both working in HR at Debenhams, say planning a new date has left them feeling flat. Sophie said: “It’s hard to get motivated to rearrange everything again.  “We’ve started to throw some ideas around but nobody seems excited about it because they’ve been through all the disappointment with us. We are just disheartened. “My dress is a beautul summer one with little straps so I’d be keen to get married in sunshine. “But I don’t think we will go abroad after our last experience. I don’t want to risk any more bad luck.” "},{"url":null,"title":"vandals scrawl obscenity over banksy","story":"w.mantis  Vandals scrawl obscenity over Banksy mural hours after artist confirms making itJust  hours after the mysterious artist revealed the artwork in Bristol was made by him, someone scrawled w***** over it.

Witnesses were devastated as they watched the fin whale slowly die after being discovered in trouble by a beach clean group who sparked a desperate rescue operation. It was initially hoped that with the tide coming in a group of volunteers could help turn it around - but rescuers have confirmed the whale, part of an endangered species which is the second largest in the world, has now lost its battle for survival. Steve Green, of Clean Ocean Sailing, told Cornwall Live they had encountered the whale earlier today before seeing it in trouble at the privately-owned Nare Point on the Lizard in Cornwall this afternoon. He said: I think it was a fin whale. It is so sad as she was swimming with us just this morning and it was wonderful to see her alongside us. About where we anchored we were doing a beach clean up and we were horried to see her stranded on the rocks. It was heartbreaking to watch her die. We were hoping to get a load of people on the tide to help her turn around - but that hasnapost been possible. It is devastating. Steve said he was told by the rescuers that the whale had been crashing around for several hours to try and get off the rocks but due to its size is believed to have crushed its internal organs.  The British Divers Marine Le Rescuegroup have been called and the public have been asked to stay away from the area. The animal, thought to be ft long, was pronounced dead at about .pm this afternoon after it beached on the rocks. Julia Cable, national coordinator at BDMLR, said the creature is a fin whale, which are also known as finback whale or common rorqual and formerly known as herring whale or razorback whale.

While the Chinese government said the outbreak started inside a wet market in Wuhan, scientists from South China University of Technology in Guangzhou said the possible origin of the virus could be from Wuhan Center for Disease Control . Scholars Botao Xiao and Lei Xiao published a research journal titled aposThe possible origins of -nCoV coronavirusapos on Research Gate, where they claimed WCDC aposhosted animals in laboratories for research purposesapos, including  bats captured in the Hubei and Zhejiang provinces. The report mentioned one researcher, known as JH Tian, aposwas once attacked by batsapos and that aposthe blood of bat was on his skinapos. Tian quarantined himself for a total of  days after aposbats peed on himapos. The lab is located  metres from the infamous wet market and adjacent to the Union hospital where the first group of doctors was infected. It read: It is plausible that the virus leaked around and some of them contaminated the initial patients in this epidemic, though solid proofs are needed in future study. A second laboratory, located at approximately km from the wet market, was mentioned in the report, as it said: This laboratory reported that the Chinese horseshoe bats were natural reservoirs for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruswhich caused the SARS outbreak in . The laboratory is said to belong to Wuhan Institute of Virology and is classied as P, the highest level of biosafety laboratory. The plague has since spread to over  countries around the world and infected over , people. A total of , people on the Chinese mainland have died from the illness as of February , according to real-time figures provided by Chinaaposs National Health Commission.

Daria, , and Ivan, , have appeared on TV in Russia ahead of their babyaposs arrival to share details of their relationship. According to the children they met each other a year ago and fell in love at first sight. Daria, who is just eight weeks pregnant, said during the On Air show, which they appeared on with parental permission: A friend of mine introduced us and two days later we started dating. Ivan said he was in love with me. We tried to spend as much time together as we could. We like walking down the streets holding hands and kissing. But there are some questioning whether the -year-old boy could have fathered a baby at all. Local paediatrician Nikolai Skorobogatov said: Theoretically both children could have reached reproductive age. But Dr Evgeny Grekov, a urology and andrology expert, says Ivan could not be the father. He said: We rechecked the laboratory results three times so there cannot be any mistake. There cannot be sperm cells. He is still a child.  There is even no testosterone. And just to add, he still has childish sex organs. Puberty has not started. So we have a lot of questions. According to the girl, who is planning on keeping the child, she and her boyfriend take care of each other and set their social media as aposmarriedapos. The schoolgirl said: Ivan has gastritis and I do not allow him to drink carbonated beverages. Sometimes I worry about my weight but he says that I am in perfect shape and do not need to go on a diet. He is very kind. Daria revealed that she and Ivan had sex at his home when his mother was away. She said: After we did it for the first time, we hid from each other under the blanket out of shame. Soon after Daria started to feel sick and had nausea most days. The girl’s mother Elena took her to hospital for examinations but doctors failed to find the cause of her aposillnessapos. Finally, Elena bought a pregnancy test kit for her daughter. Elena, who was also participating in the show, said: The test showed that Daria was pregnant. After that, she confessed to having sex with Ivan.  I was in shock. I could not say a word. When we started talking she said she would not kill the baby and I support her decision. I do not want her to go under the kne. Ivan and his mother Galina, , are planning to help Daria to raise the child. Galina said: I did not know what to say after learning that my -year-old son fathered a child. I think Ivan himself does not quite understand what happened. He said they came to our apartment and Daria offered him to have sex.  They did not use any contraceptives and obviously did not realise the possible consequences. Some of the familiesapos neighbours express doubts over whether the boy is indeed the father. A man living next door said: I think somebody  got the girl pregnant and now they want to put all the responsibility on the boy. And a woman said: I do not believe the boy is the father of the child. I doubt he is developed enough for that. Father-to-be Ivan said: Daria has never been with another man. I know that for sure. I am the father of her baby. The children say they became a target for bullying in their hometown of Zheleznogorsk in central Russia’s Krasnoyarsk Krai region. Daria said: aposSome children from my school called me a w***e and said that I am sleeping around. I wanted to die after hearing that.

Paul Hartley played him further back in front of me and whoever I was partnering but I always felt he was more of a threat further up the pitch.“He creates real problems for defenders because they don’t know whether to follow him when he naturally drops back.“What Gowser does is take real care of the ball when he’s got it and he turns and can see a pass.“The ball he played through for Kane Hemmings’ second goal had to be right and he set the goal up.“I was delighted with Gowser up front and with Kane next to him.”With striking options limited following Danny Johnson’s departure in January and Andrew Nelson’s surgery, James says that plan would have been put to use the previous week against Morton.However, a knock picked up in training ruled McGowan out of the draw at Cappielow.And it was sporting director Gordon Strachan who reminded the Dark Blues manager of the possibility.McGowan started his career at Celtic while Strachan was manager at Parkhead and was given his debut in an advanced position.James added: “It’s something we would have done earlierwe could have.“We probably would have done it at Morton.“He started his career out there.

It was going in but Kane is a good striker and good strikers make sure –he wants the goal, he can have it!“The main thing was to get the win and a clean sheet as well – I would trade the goal for a clean sheet, to be honest.”Saturday’s shutout was Dundee’s first since they last met the Jags on December  and their first at Dens since October .“We got a lot of clean sheets at the start of the season and I think we came away from basing our game on that,” added Forster.“It’s nice to be back in the team, not quite scoring, but helping us get three points.“It was a blustery day and conditions on the pitch weren’t brilliant.“I think we made the best of it and got the best possible outcome.“The boys played well, we were really dficult to beat and we made a big thing of getting to second balls and closing people down.“We worked harder than we have been – that can be a hard thing to say to players but I think it has showed in the last couple of games where we have really got after teams and put them under pressure. Other teams do that to us and it’s dficult to deal with.”The victory puts Dundee back in the play-off spots as they retook fourth place.“The league is very tight. There have been a lot of tough games recently and I’m sure everyone was looking at the league table and saying ‘ we win this, we go there,we lose, we’re here’, that’s human nature.“We were fully aware of how big and important Saturday’s game was.“Come pm, we’ve won - and getting the three points is good news. It was a good day all round.”The Dark Blues head into a two-week break in good mood after ending their run without victory ahead of a trip to Queen of the South on February .“It’s human nature,you lose then there’s two weeks to think about that until the next one.“It was nice to get the three points after the previous few weeks and gives us something to work on for the next game.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"podcast twa teams one street dundee emerge from the ashes and why lawrence shankland is just getting started","story":"This week Tele sports reporters Calum Woodger, George Cran and Graeme Finnan discuss how Dundee got their season back on track, Lawrence Shankland’s pledge that more is to come and the Walk and Talk men’s mental health event.Call the #Twa Teams, One Street# fan line on   to leave a message for the boys about anything Dundee, United or from the wider world of football.For iTunes: click hereFor Spoty: click hereOr search #Tele Twa Teams, One Street# in the podcast app of your choice."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-wallace-bruce-glasgow-bishop-shaped-scotlands-history","story":"ONE of the most puzzling aspects of Scotlandrsquos wars of independence is the way that prominent figures often changed allegiances, especially in the period when Robert the Bruce was fighting for ndash and indeed murdering his enemies for ndash the throne of Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"oz-glasgow-memories-judy","story":"THE story of Judy Garlandrsquos le continues to fascinate film-makers ndash the latest movie about the Hollywood star who shot to fame after playing Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz, is currently lighting up cinemas and winning awards around the world."},{"url":null,"title":"70k-raised-place-mandela-statue-glasgow","story":"FUNDRAISING for a statue of Nelson Mandela in Glasgow has been stepped up on the th anniversary of his release from prison."},{"url":null,"title":"masterchef-star-gary-maclean-chats-new-bbc-show-corner-shop-cook-off","story":"MASTERCHEF winner Gary Maclean will star in a new show that aims to prove you can cook a three-course meal for just pound with items bought from your local corner shop."},{"url":null,"title":"students-campaign-glasgow-universitys-3m-arms-trade-stake-re-engagement-fossil-fuels","story":"Glasgow University students have gathered in the institutionsquads to protest over the its involvement with the arms trade and potential re-engagement with fossil fuel investments."},{"url":null,"title":"mini-golf-course-set-st-enoch-centre-plans-approved","story":"A MINI-GOLF course is set to open in the St Enoch Centre, a move which will see world famous toy store Hamleys downsize."},{"url":null,"title":"public-can-help-shape-glasgows-response-ecological-emergency","story":"GLASGOWrsquoS response to the climate and ecological emergency can be shaped by the public after the council launched a new consultation."},{"url":null,"title":"dr-punam-krishan-farting-normal-talk","story":"Because everybody farts, itrsquos normal you see,"},{"url":null,"title":"city-science-plutos-journey-fascinating-one-planet-continues-surprise-us","story":"NEXT week marks  years since Plutorsquos discovery.

tram network","story":"They were a major part of Aberdeen’s transport infrastructure for more than  years, before being burned at the beach in the s.From horse-drawn affairs to the more modern electric offerings, trams were a popular and easy way to travel around the city.A new book illustrating the forgotten history of Aberdeen’s famous trams is to be published later this month.Author Peter Waller’s The Lost Tramways Of Scotland: Aberdeen is due to hit the shelves on February .It explores the rich history of the mode of transport.Published by Graffeg, the book aims to draw attention to the transport system, and documents how it was developed in Aberdeen throughout the years, and how it affected the community.It also looks into the social history of the city from the late nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries.Each page includes stunning photos of the historic vehicles, taken from the Online Transport Archive, which show the layout of the streets at the time.Mr Waller, director and secretary of the Online Transport Archive, has been writing about transport for the past  years.Aberdeen had two electric tramways – the corporation’s services within the city and the Aberdeen Suburban Tramways Co, although this was short-lived.The vehicles covered a large portion of Aberdeen, going as far as Bankhead, Bucksburn, Woodside, Kittybrewster, Bridge of Don, the Beach, Torry, Duthie Park, Bridge of Dee, Woodend and Hazlehead and into the West End as far as Bieldside.City centre areas such as Queens Cross, Rosemount, Union Street and Ferryhill were also serviced.Depots were created to house the vehicles.The first such depot to be built was in Queens Cross.It opened on August  .In the years after Second World War it was also viewed as one of the safest tramways in the United Kingdom.Mr Waller said it had been hoped that the Aberdeen trams would have enjoyed a secure future at the end of the Second World War.However, they were rendered obsolete by the introduction of the diesel bus. The final trams ran on May  .A final procession was made up of a restored horse tram which was followed by six electric cars.Following this event all of the remaining trams were burned at the beach, including the modern, streamlined cars.In the book Mr Waller states: “These had been offered to both Blackpool and Glasgow, but neither was interested in acquiring them.“Although no Aberdeen electric tramcar was preserved following closure, one of the horse trams operated by Aberdeen District Tramways, built by R  J Shinnie in  and converted into an electric car in about , was preserved on withdrawal in  and restored as a horse tram.“The preserved horse tram is normally on display at the Grampian Transport Museum.”A book on Dundee’s tramways has also been published as part of the Lost Tramways of Scotland series.The series also exists for England and Wales, and includes many cities, including Southampton, Nottingham, Coventry, Bristol, Brighton and Bradford."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/02/pj-jri-110220-02-023-910x564.jpg ","title":"six local heroes get recognition forever as part of city mural1","story":"Six Aberdonians who have made a dference to the lives of others have been added to a mural celebrating the city’s everyday heroes.From showing generosity towards Canadian soldiers in the Second World War to spearheading a campaign which changed the law, the six new additions to the mural on the city’s Flourmill Lane have changed lives in a multitude of ways.Originally created during the  Nuart Aberdeen festival, the project aimed to highlight people who have contributed to the le of the city.The mural, relocated to Flourmill Lane last year, has now been extended after funding from Aberdeen City Council’s Creative Funding programme.The new everyday heroes, chosen by a  of judges from nominations put forward by the public, are: Barbara Russell, a landlady in Aberdeen during the Second World War Justin Ritchie, a volunteer with Street Friends Helping the Homeless and Steve Rae, a Piper Alpha survivor and safety activist.Also chosen were Mark Taylor, for his fundraising efforts, Michael Brown, who campaigned for Clare’s Law after the murder of his daughter and dance teacher Jemma McRae who died after her battle with cancer.Lisa Campbell, great-granddaughter of Barbara Russell, said: “During Dunkirk, soldiers from all over the world who couldn’t get home were dropped anywhere in ports across the UK and the citizens of Aberdeen were asked to help them out.“My great-grandmother took in over  soldiers, mostly from America and Canada and looked after them.“It’s important we get the message out that Aberdeen is a place that welcomes anyone, especially in a bad situation.”Marlene and Alan McRae, parents of the late Jemma, said: “It’s unbelievable that Jemma is up there with the other  heroes. She would be so proud.“Even more importantly for us as a family is that Academy Street Dance Studio will continue to run and that’s a legacy it its own.“She always called the studio her extended family and that’s how it still is.”Offshore safety expert Mr Rae said: “When I was informed that I was chosen I was in disbelief.“As an Aberdonian born and bred it fills me with pride to be recognised as one of its everyday heroes.”Clan fundraiser Mr Taylor said: “I am shocked and also honoured to have been chosen for this award and I would like to thank my family and friends that nominated me.”Mr Brown said: “I’m delighted and humbled to be honoured by my city of birth and raising awareness of Clare’s Law is invaluable.”And Mr Ritchie added: “It feels amazing to be recognised in this way – thanks so much to everyone that nominated me.”Aberdeen Inspired community and environmental co-ordinator Angela Joss said: “While working on this project it became obvious to us that the everyday heroes had changed Aberdeen and the community around them.“We have six examples of amazing Aberdonians and it makes me really proud to be one.”Lord Provost of Aberdeen Barney Crockett praised the scheme and said each of those honoured was a “fabulous ambassador” for the city.And Mike Melvin, ACVO co-ordinator who was on the judging , said: “All nominations were outstanding and very inspiring.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along. We did not have the new kitchen then. The hotel has always cooked the turkeys for us but cooking big pots of potatoes and vegetables was quite a job with just the gas rings. Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished.

After the session, as the children were heading for lunch, a girl from the class came up and said: ldquoI think the moral in that tale is that we should be kind, but that itrsquos often not easy to do.It was a traditional tale in which the tables are turned on a selfish rich man who had shown no compassion, but then hoped for kindness when he was the one in need. In the brief discussion with this young person, we agreed that itrsquos easier to show kindness to someone who we believe truly deserves it.She told me: ldquoI think the woman in the story did the right thing butIrsquom being honest,it had been me I donrsquot knowIrsquod have been able to be kind like her, because Irsquod have wanted revenge. Thatrsquos the problem, I think, we always think about revenge first. It can make us feel better for a short while but really makes things worse, well at least not better anyway. I try to be kind, sometimes it isnrsquot easy, but I try. Kindness is like a seed we have to plant.I shouldnrsquot have been bowled over by this, for I know a -year-old can have wisdom that many so called grown-ups have forgotten. But I was deeply impressed by her reflection on the storyrsquos message, and her honesty and integrity.This conversation also revealed the power of stories to raise moral dilemmas and human issues without finger pointing or being preachy.And she is right, it can often be very dficult to be kind. The world seems so full of stress, selfishness, anger and intolerance that there seems little space for kindness, except towards those we love and care about. On top of that, it seems increasingly dficult to survive, keep a roof above our heads and pay the bills. Kindness begins at home and often there is little energy, emotion or resources left to think or care about others we arenrsquot responsible for.There can even be a real fear thatwe show lsquotoo muchrsquo kindness we risk becoming a doormat, being used or treated unfairly. We can sometimes watch a child being kind to another and it not being reciprocated, and the temptation then is to suggest kindness isnrsquot shown next time.ldquoWe need to teach people a lesson, is often the mantra which derails our instinct to be kind another way of saying we want revenge. And letrsquos be honest: cruel, uncaring and selfish people can take advantage of someonersquos kindness and revenge does often make us feel better, in the short term anyway.But is the answer to allow unkind behaviour to frame the way we want to live and be treated  Do we respond to unkindness with more unkindness in   So consequently, cruelty with more cruelty, intolerance with more intolerance, selfishness with yet more selfishness  Doesnrsquot this mean that we allow lsquothe lessonrsquo to be that kindness doesnrsquot pay  As Gandhi is famously reported to have said: ldquoAn eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.The truth is, kindness is not weakness but strength. It often isnrsquot easy and takes great courage. It doesnrsquot mean that people should not face consequences for their actions, or that people should be asked to forgive the unforgivable. But it does mean not allowing the unkindness of others to define how we are. We should not allow such acts to clip our butterfly wings.What do I mean by this  There is a theory called the lsquobutterfly effectrsquo. In this theory, it is said that the flapping of a butterflyrsquos wings could cause a chain reaction in which a hurricane could be caused on the other side of the planet. It is not meant to be taken literally, but to show that a very small act, although seemingly insignicant in itself, can have huge, unforeseen repercussions.In this way, kindness is a butterfly. Small acts of kindness may have a huge effect that touches people beyond the knowledge of the person who displayed the kindness. Acts of cruelty and hate also have the same power but all the more reason to flutter the wings of kindness so the wind more likely blows in the right direction.In this way, our behaviour is a butterfly. The way we flap its wings can have huge unforeseeable consequences, either for good or bad, both for ourselves and others. When we are kind, we actually makes ourselves happier too.So to make a real dference, we need only do tiny acts that are easily within our power, and as often as we can. A smile, a moment you truly listen to someone, a helping hand, holding the door open, trying to understand how someone feels, making a cup of tea, not meeting anger with anger, trying not to gain revenge but a change of heart and so on.This is what will truly make up the index of a healthy and happy society. And all of us can be players in this, and beneficiaries of our own kindness.David W Orr, a professor of environmental studies and politics, has said: ldquoThe plain fact is that the planet does not need more successful people. But it does desperately need more peacemakers, healers, restorers, storytellers and lovers of every kind.Great words, but that -year-old school girl already got this. Young people like her give me hope for the future."},{"url":null,"title":"john-muir-house-car-park-opened-public","story":"The car park, off Court Street, is home to about  spaces but can only be used by council employees and council HQ visitors between am and pm during the working week.That could soon change, with a number of spaces potentially being made available for public weekday daytime use.The idea comes as the council looks to increase the overall number of short and long stay car parking spaces in and around the town centre.Last year, discussions took place with members of the public surrounding the idea of creating a lsquotransport hubrsquo off the townrsquos Whittingehame Drive.Now, a further two-day consultation is taking place in Haddington Town House, when members of the public can discuss parking issues in the town.The consultation will focus on parking throughout Haddington, including possibly changing the long-stay car park near the townrsquos Tesco store into a short-stay car park.Tom Reid, head of infrastructure at East Lothian Council, said: ldquoFor many years, wersquove been keen to enhance the town centre so that it offers the best possible environment for all users ndash including people with restricted mobility, pedestrians and cyclists ndash to ensure easy access to the local services and businesses on which Haddington depends.ldquoAs well as improved options for active travel and public transport, we recognise there is a need to create more parking spaces in and around the town centre.ldquoFor this to happen, we need to change some existing parking from long stay to short stay, and deliver a new long-stay parking option for drivers who need to leave their vehicle in the town throughout the working day.ldquoOne proposal is the potential re-designation of the existing lsquoTesco long-stayrsquo car park, which could free up an additional  spaces in the town centre for short-stay, public parking.ldquoWe will also review the status of the car park at John Muir House, East Lothian Councilrsquos head office, to consider the potential for an area here to be available for wider public use.More than  people attended the previous exhibition in the Town House.

We felt it was a really positive opportunity to discuss many of the changes that have happened in Musselburgh over the last few years to stabilise and develop primary care services.ldquoIt is really important for us at Riverside to understand the views of the community we serve, which can be hugely supportive in improving services. For example, feedback on our old phone system helped us to understand the issues that our patients were experiencing and led to us developing a new telephone system that was more suitable for our patientsrsquo needs as well as those of the practice.ldquoRiverside, along with other practices in the county, are collaborating with and supporting East Lothianrsquos Health and Social Care Partnershiprsquos plan to grow health services to meet the needs of a growing population.ldquoWe remain keen to improve our engagement and communication with the local community, and the meeting was a positive step to build links with local groups.ldquoWe are grateful to the community council representatives and local councillors for taking the time to visit us at Riverside Medical Practice and we look forward to developing a closer and collaborative relationship with them.An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: ldquoWe thought the meeting with Riverside and the community council was very positive. We were impressed by Riversidersquos commitment to engaging with the community and communicating developments. We look forward to supporting them in any way that we can.Councillor Mackie added: ldquoIt was a helpful meeting with community stakeholders and local GPs.

The way things are going itrsquoll likely be a bridge between two independent countries.There is Sinn Fein winning the popular vote in Ireland and demanding a referendum on reunication. And Scotland is to have one next year, according to Nicola Sturgeon.Well, in your dreams.Therersquos unlikely to be a Scottish referendum any time soon. Sinn Fein is in no position to demand a border poll, while it remains a minority in the Irish parliament, the Dail.It wasnrsquot only or even mainly Sinn Feinrsquos policy on a United Ireland that drove leader May Lou McDonaldrsquos success. The campaign focused on housing, health and pensions.Moreover, not everyone in the Republic is enthusiastic about reuniting with the North. Even some nationalists worry about taking responsibility for the pound billion or so the UK pumps annually into The Six Counties, as Sinn Feincalls the province.Then therersquos all the sectarianism and the legacy of the Troubles. Unionist paramilitaries havenrsquot gone away either. This makes it all the more remarkable that what used to be the political wing of the Irish Republican Army has become a major player in Irish politics. SF was regarded as de facto terrorist itself until recently. The idea it could ever get near forming a governing coalition was regarded as ridiculous.But after this election, Sinn Fein can no longer be dismissed as a relic of sectarianism. It came top with  per cent of the popular vote against  per cent for Fianna Dail and  per cent for Leo Varadkarrsquos Fine Gael. Had Mary Lou McDonald fielded more candidates, SF might have won more than its  seats in the Dail, one fewer than Fianna Faacuteil. It was a rare case of a political party actually under-estimating its electoral support.Seismic is an overused term in politics,but this election really is earthshaking, not least for the future of the UK. Leo Varadkar, the Fine Gael Taoiseach, has been looking suitably shaken.He insists he will not contemplate any alliance with ldquoextremist Sinn Feiners, one of whose TDs launched into a rendition of the Irish rebel song ldquoCome out ye Black and Tans at a Dublin count. Michael Martin of Fianna Faacuteil isnrsquot ruling out a coalition but is instinctively hostile.The establishment parties will do all in their power to lock Sinn Fein out of office during the coming weeks of coalition horse trading. But it seems unlikely they can keep the charismatic Mary Lou in her box.This is because nationalism is back in a big way in Ireland as in the UK. Yes, the grievances of young people without housing and older folk worried about pensions arenrsquot intrinsically nationalist. But these grievances are now being expressed by voting for the party of Irish nationalism par excellence.It is similar to the way many Scottish voters, with similar complaints, turned suddenly to the independence cause in , obliterating Labour in Scotland.Radical nationalism is now the driving force in modern politics. It is redrawing the political map across Europe as voters turn away from neoliberalism and globalism.We see it in the Yellow Vest movement in France, in populist parties in Italy and, yes, even in Brexit. That was essentially an English nationalist rebellion against the EU.The BBCrsquos former World Affairs Editor, John Simpson, attracted much criticism for tweeting his regret that Ireland had ldquosuccumbed to populism. The implication is that Sinn Fein remain extremist and its success is a bad thing.Commentators like Simpson used to say much the same about Alex Salmondrsquos SNP. Many metropolitan intellectuals still regard populism as synonymous with racism and bigotry.But this equation of nationalist movements with the political right makes little sense. Both the SNP and Sinn Fein triumphed from the left. All nationalisms not the same.Fianna Faacuteil and Fine Gael are also nominally nationalist parties, dating from the Irish Civil War. Theyrsquore ldquoSoldiers of Destiny and ldquoTribe of the Irish respectively. Sinn Fein, meaning ldquoWe Ourselves actually sounds less militantly nationalist.In recent years theyrsquove become identikit centrist parties. Fine Gael is generally considered slightly more right wing and pro big business than Fianna Faacuteil, which used to represent farmers and small business. But itrsquos hard to tell. The two old parties are basically rival networks of patronage, cronyism even, with little ideological depth.Fianna Faacuteil had the misfortune to be in office during the  financial crash, which hit Ireland hard. The country was traumatised by the weight of debt left by the collapse of the Irish banks.Fine Gael under its seemingly more progressive Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, thought it had inherited the upswing. In GDP terms it has. Ireland has one of the highest growth rates in Europe and national income per head is higher than the UKrsquos.Mr Varadkar, who is openly gay, won plaudits for legalising abortion and same-sex marriage. But this progressive gloss did not prevent Fine Gael being seen as in the pockets of rampant capitalism.He won the battle of Brexit too, but lost the war for domestic popularity as young and old turned in disgust from the grotesque inequalities of wealth in Ireland. Brexit was not, by common consent, a signicant issue in the election. But it must have played a part,only subliminally.The North is to remain in regulatory alignment with the Republic, while Britain erects a border in the Irish Sea. This de facto economic reunication of Ireland has transformed the border question.Itrsquos no longer a question of Brits out. Theyrsquore going. Irish nationalism is no longer about the gun, but about the EU single market. The dream of Irish unity is becoming a reality through the ballot box. Formal unication seems only a matter of time.The SNP has historically shunned Sinn Fein, fearing guilt by association. That must surely now change. It is now a legitimate democratic force.But there is a warning here for Nicola Sturgeon. The SNP canrsquot afford to abandon its left-wing radicalism, or trade it for LGBT and gender politics. If the SNP becomes another party of the establishment it could share the fate of Leo Varadkar."},{"url":null,"title":"transport-secretary-brands-idea-northern-ireland-bridge-link-vanity-project","story":"Boris Johnson has said work is under way to establish the feasibility of a road crossing between Portpatrick in Dumfries and Galloway and Larne in Co Antrim.The devolved administrations said the estimated pound billion cost should fund vital projects in both countries instead and expressed anger that they had not been consulted.:Whitehall officials begin scoping work on Boris Bridge linking Scotland and Northern IrelandScottish transport secretary Michael Matheson said: ldquoI strongly believe thatpound billion is available for investment in infrastructure in Scotland and Northern Ireland that, rather than indulging the Prime Minister with this vanity project, such funding should be made available to our respective governments so it could be better spent on meeting the priorities of the people we represent.Downing Street said a ldquorange of officials were looking at the idea, but was unable to say how many civil servants were examining proposals.The Prime Ministerrsquos official spokesman said it was a ldquoproper piece of work and Mr Johnson was ldquoambitious about infrastructure projects across the country.Mr Johnson has repeatedly spoken about the prospect of a bridge, even though experts have warned that the depth of the Irish Sea and the presence of dumped munitions would cause problems for any project.Stormont infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon said: ldquoI am extremely concerned that pursuit of this project, costing pound billion, will be a waste of signicant money and resource that could be put to better use by addressing pressures and deliverable projects here in Northern Ireland and where.ldquoBy spending just a fraction of the reported cost of this bridge, I am of the view that we could bring signicantly more benefits to people across the north by investing in infrastructure here and making a real dference to improving the lives of citizens across Northern Ireland.The distance from Larne to Portpatrick, one of the most likely routes for a bridge, is around  miles.There is no problem with distance, money or the Beaufortrsquos Dyke explosives disposal area, according to the Prime Minister.:Prime Minister brands idea of Boris bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland very interestingAn engineer has suggested the span could be ready within  years.In a letter to UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, Mr Matheson called for urgent talks with the UK Government.He wrote: ldquoGiven transport is devolved to both the Scottish Government and Northern Ireland Executive, I look forward to hearing from you on the availability of the pound billion to us, and to assurances that in future any such proposals will be discussed with us first and will fully respect the devolved settlements and the role of the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Scottish Parliament."},{"url":null,"title":"unspun-political-diary","story":"A REDDER face than usual this week for Jackson Carlaw after he slagged the Queensferry Crossing for closing due to falling ice.

So Mr Carlaw is gearing up to go hell for leather into .On the basis of recent comments, shamelessness is a key part of the plan.Unpopular policies are to be binned in a sweeping review.

Fairness in education, fairness in healthcare, fairness at work, fairness in housing. ldquoI will lead a party... for which fairness for all is a guiding principle, announced the former Glasgow Academy pupil.No shrinking violet when it comes to blocking another independence referendum, Mr Carlaw also said he wanted to ldquoput the constitutional arguments behind us and focus on what voters want. The Carlaw chameleon is a very adaptable beast.With Scottish Labour a busted flush and the LibDems in the post-Brexit doldrums, Mr Carlaw evidently hopes his party can occupy swathes of the centre ground in , a generic, unthreatening everyman party that can appeal to voters who would previously have gone where.If Boris Johnson can demolish a red wall, maybe Mr Carlaw slice through the central belt. Well, in theory.The reality does not look good.The Tories won  MSPs in , less than half the SNPrsquos . Thatrsquos still more than the base Alex Salmond had going into the  election, when he increased his tally from  to .But Labour only had  MSPs in , and it only fell to . The SNP barely scratched the main party of government. It won by picking up MSPs on regional lists, largely at the expense of the Greens and Socialists.However  of todayrsquos  Tory MSPs are on the lists. Theyrsquore unlikely to improve much on that.The Tories need to take seats from the SNP and ramp up their vote share on the list to make serious progress.That is a very tall order.Mr Carlaw says he wants to overhaul the list system to get more women and ethnic minority candidates in winnable positions.Culling the current deadwood wonrsquot hurt, but it wonrsquot do much to the overall numbers. Meddling with the list system is also going to put Mr Carlaw in conflict with the party membership, who covet their ability to determine the list rankings.He doesnrsquot have time for a fight.But the most important number to emerge yesterday was not Mr Jacksonrsquos % win, it was the partyrsquos membership. This is usually secret.:Next Scottish Conservative leader warned not to lsquokowtowrsquo to Boris JohnsonThe last time it surfaced was during the  leadership election, when it was just under ,. Almost a decade on, it is now just under ,.The SNPrsquos is ten times that.True, Mr Johnson can steer Tory donor cash Mr Carlawrsquos way in , but the Tory ground operation is pitul compared to the SNPrsquos army.Mr Carlawrsquos comparison with the Major government is also wishful thinking. The Major government was dysal on a truly epic scale.It was crippled within months by Black Wednesday and the UKrsquos forced exit from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.It never regained public trust.Then there was lsquoBack to Basicsrsquo, constant sex scandals, brown envelopes and cash-for-questions.Nicola Sturgeonrsquos government is certainly showing its age. Its failures are growing and it looks accident-prone. The Derek Mackay scandal has shaken it. Mr Salmondrsquos trial is round the corner. But it is definitely not on a par with the Major era.And Mr Carlaw, letrsquos remember, is no Tony Blair riding to the rescue. He comes reeking of Eau de Brexit and will be tainted by Boris Johnsonrsquos broken promises and screw ups.And yet the Major government does offer one lesson for Mr Carlaw.Once governments start to go off, public opinion can change rapidly.So Mr Carlaw will pursue a twin-track approach, sugar-coating his own party and throwing every bit of mud he can find at the Nationalists.He will try to make it sound like a moral failing to support the SNP, practically wicked to side with them.His goal will then be ensuring his folk go to the polls, while hoping the SNPrsquos folk get queasy and stay home.For all the fine talk of fairness and fresh ideas, the coming election will be a brutal fight over dferential turnout with the Union on the line."},{"url":null,"title":"crew-member-platform-off-shetland-thailand","story":"The male crew member on the Tern Alpha  off Shetland had presented with \"minor symptoms\" after ing from a holiday in Thailand and is being treated by a medic.Tern Alpha is a fixed installation serving as a manned drilling and production installation in the East Shetland Basin of the northern North Sea.A spokesperson for Platform operator Taqa said: \"A member of crew on board our Tern Alpha  has presented with minor symptoms after ing recently from holiday in Thailand.\"The inidual is being attended to by the medic on board the  and as a precaution he is remaining separated from the rest of the crew until the results of tests are known.\"Both the inidual and Taqa continue to take the appropriate actions and precautions in line with the UK Government guidelines.\"Taqa is working closely with the relevant authorities and has put in place travel restrictions to its offshore s by iniduals who have travelled recently to countries identied by the UK Government.\"https:www.heraldscotland news .coronavirus--scottish-patients-test-negative-leeds-mp-self-isolates-disease-fear The Scottish Government said  people have now been tested for the virus, officially named Covid- by the World Health Organisation.Separately, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clydesaid staff in protective suits from its public health team will begin visiting the homes of people who have complained of symptoms associated with the virus.They will undertake testing and offer advice.Dr Emilia Crighton, deputy director of public health at NHSGGC, said: \"I would encourage anyone who needs advice or information on coronavirus to access the NHS Inform website.\"The risk of catching this illness in the UK is extremely low and only those ing from at-risk areas, or people in contact with someone diagnosed with the illness are at risk.\"Our staff carrying out the testing will be wearing protective clothing as a precautionary measure and we would appreciatethe public show their support for our staff.\""},{"url":null,"title":"new-cabinet-presses-ahead-points-based-migration-system","story":"However, No  could not say when net migration would begin to fall. Details of the new system are expected to be published next week.Last night, the SNP said the UK Governmentrsquos plans would ldquodevastate Scotland and that its focus on cutting the numbers of low-skilled migrant workers was ldquomassively concerning.At the first meeting of senior ministers following the controversial reshuffle, which saw Sajid Javid resign as Chancellor, the Prime Minister told colleagues the Government was elected to improve the NHS, tackle crime and level up opportunity across the UK through investment in infrastructure, education and training and that the new One Nation Government had a ldquoresponsibility to level up and unite the country.One of the Governmentrsquos first measures will be to overhaul Britainrsquos immigration system and seek to begin to realise the Governmentrsquos long-term promise to cut levels of net migration.The PMrsquos deputy spokesman said the Cabinet, after discussion, had agreed to the implementation of a points-based system, which would be ldquosimpler and fairer than the current one.He explained: ldquoIt would not discriminate between countries and wouldthe democratic control of immigration to the British people. The PM stressed we must demonstrate that the UK is open and welcoming from talent from across the world but the new system would end reliance on importing cheap, low-skilled labour, bringing down immigration numbers overall.Under existing legislation, workers from the EU and European Economic Area countries can come to the UK to live or work without a visa. But Mr Johnson is keen to close the route for low-skilled migrants but short-term visas will be considered for occupations experiencing shortages.It has been calculated the new points-based system could cut the number of low-skilled EU migrants by , per year, which would represent a  per cent reduction in the numbers of EU citizens who come to the UK on a long-term basis.Asked about the possibility of a change in the salary cap, the spokesman declined to answer and said the details of the new system would be ldquoset out shortly.Questioned about how migration numbers would be cut, he said the new system would enable the Government to control the number of people coming into the UK it would, by its very nature, ldquoprovide the Government to control who comes in and out and would end the countryrsquos ldquoreliance on low-skilled workers.Askedthere was a target and how soon migrant numbers would fall, the spokesman simply repeated that details of the new system would be set out shortly.Pressed on whether there was discussion on any special dispensation for Scotland ndash the Scottish Government wants policy on immigration to be devolved ndash he said he would not go into the detail of Cabinetrsquos ldquowider discussion.But Stuart McDonald for the SNP described the Governmentrsquos approach as a ldquototal shambles.He noted how the Tory Government had had  months to produce proposals for a new migration system but people still knew ldquonext to nothing about what it will look like.Mr McDonald insisted: ldquoFree movement is about the only bit of the UK migration system that works well we should retain it, not scrap it.The MP for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East added: ldquoConfirmation Boris Johnson is still intent on cracking down on so-called low skilled migration is massively concerning.

Peatlands are renowned for their ability to soak up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, to promote bioersity and to provide high quality water.The Thurso-based scientists will benefit from access to the Flow Country, the largest blanket bog in Europe and a region that is under consideration for World Heritage Site status ndash joining the ranks of Australiarsquos Great Barrier Reef, the Grand Canyon in America and the Taj Mahal in India.The project will also support new initiatives across the universityrsquos research centres and foster national and international collaborations, including work with Canadian peatland research groups.Dr Andersen said: ldquoPeatlands are the Earthrsquos most efficient terrestrial carbon store. They regulate water and climate and support unique bioersity.ldquoHowever, their degradation affects the delivery of these key s. In the UK, the cool, wet climate supports a globally rare peatland type: blanket bogs.ldquoMost UK blanket bogs have been degraded by human activities and, left alone, they make a signicant contribution to our greenhouse gas emissions from the land use sector. However, unprecedented efforts to restore our blanket bogs are under way, for example through the Peatland Action programme in Scotland.ldquoAstonishingly, we do not know the extent to which these interventions work or how blanket bogs, restored or otherwise, will cope with the added threat of climate change.ldquoI am thrilled to have been chosen by the Leverhulme Trust for this Research Leadership Award. I look forward to working with my team to pioneer approaches from molecular to landscape scales to fill some of these gaps in our knowledge and to inform UK and global peatland management strategies.The project will focus on three key areas of research. The team will explore how environmental conditions can affect Sphagnum mosses, one of the building blocks of peat in blanket bog.They will continue to develop a method that uses satellite data to measure how the seasonal patterns of swelling and shrinking of bog surface, known as ldquobog breathing, change in response to climate extremes and restoration activities. They will also work to refine models that predict how blanket bogs may respond to dferent management approaches in future climate change scenarios.Emma Goodyer, manager of the International Union For The Conservation Of Nature Uk Peatland Programme, said: ldquoThe area covered by near natural peatland worldwidestores more carbon than all other vegetation types in the world combined. However, drained and damaged peatlands contribute about  per cent of greenhouse gas emissions from the land use sector annually, despite covering only .% of the global land surface.ldquoScotland has become a global leader in peatland management. The research hub in the Flow Country has been instrumental in delivering programmes of research that tackle some of the most pressing issues for peatland restoration and policy. This signicant funding boost will offer the opportunity to understand the resilience of peatland ecosystems in the face of the climate crisis whilst also reversing bioersity losses.The Flow Country of Caithness and Sutherland has bogs in the tundra-like landscape that have been growing since the end of the last Ice Age more than , years ago. The arearsquos peat is up to ft deep and its soil stores about  million tons of carbon.Wildle in the area include otters, deer and common scoter ducks.In the UK, common scoters breed at only a few locations, including the Flow Country and the lochs and and glens near Inverness.Six of the UKrsquos  World Heritage sites are in Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"bearsden-climber-battling-tough-weather---climbed-10-peaks-one-day","story":"Halfway through epic  Munro trekKevin Woods yesterday the red, on the ridges above Glen AffricKevin Woods, , from Bearsden, East Dunbartonshire, set off on his ambitious expedition on December , the day of the winter solstice.

It’s always very interesting when we get an unusual request like this, and we’re delighted to be able to help restore a building of such signicant historical interest.”The building slowly fell into a state of decline and in  was declared unsafe by the fire department.Two years later it was bought by a developer and the major refurbishment will see the building reopen its doors as a plush hotel, with retail space and a number of private apartments.The pillars have been produced, polished and finished at Fyfe Glenrock’s base in Oldmeldrum and are now being shipped to the USA where, said Mr Collinson, they will not look out of place.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Respitality support worker Ann Brodie alongside colleagues from Energie Fitness\"  ‘Respitality’ links to support carers viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"vehicles are in demand at thainstone","story":"ANM Group hosted its first collective machinery sale of the year on Saturday, January .The sale saw more than , buyers and sellers in attendance at Thainstone Centre.The auction featured an entry of more than , items and achieved a strong sales rate of  percent.Mark Barrack, head of Thainstone Specialist Auctions, said: “Consistent prices were achieved across all sections with the light commercial and x vehicles category seeing several lots sell in excess of high trade guide prices due to the scarcity of quality stock available in the wider market.“The tractors section was outstanding again, and strong conversion rates were achieved for heavy commercials with many buyers from England bidding keenly. “Scotland’s largest sale of plant, machinery and equipment continues to grow in popularity, and we’re delighted with the strong start to .

Winter is a tough time for wild birds, but as spring approaches, and the weather becomes warmer, we should expect to hear more tweeting in our gardens.The company is asking keen photographers to share their snaps, with a chance to win a gt card for the store. Daniel Bingham, senior pets buyer for Wilko, offered some advice on helping wild birds thrive during the colder season.He said: “Birds feed every day and don’t store energy well, so one or two bad days in cold weather or without food can be very dangerous for them.“Put out a good selection of food in feeders or on tables to attract birds to your garden — things like fat balls are nutritious and high in energy — perfect to help them maintain weight and stay fuelled.“Put some soft food down for the songbirds who can’t reach the feeders. Suet blocks and pellets work particularly well, as they give the birds a great energy boost and plenty of calories.“Don’t forget to provide fresh water. Ponds, puddles and other water sources may freeze over, making them inaccessible to birds. Birds can be timid so you’ll need to be patient build up trust by sharing plenty of treats and you could soon be rewarded with the perfect wild bird shot”.The Wilko wild bird competition runs until March .

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”In a response to Councillor Stockan, the minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, says Orkney Islands Council is “wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.”He says minsters understand the “signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities with responsibility for ferries” and that the Government has “made clear our commitment to Orkney’s internal ferry services” with additional funding of £. million in total over the past two years.Councillor Stockan said: “I am extremely disappointed that the First Minister has chosen not to respond to our considerable concerns directly, or to meet with me to discuss an issue of fundamental importance to our community.“I can only describe the Government’s current position as irrefutable discrimination against the people of Orkney. The additional funding we received over the last two years was welcome, but fell far short of what is needed to fully fund our internal ferry service.“I call on the Government to address this when the budget is published this week — and I have asked the other parties at Holyrood to offer us their full support in securing full and fair funding for Orkney.“The running and replacement costs of Western Isles ferries are fully subsidised by the Government. It is only right and proper that we in Orkney should be treated in the same way.”In the letter, Councillor Stockan also criticises the Government for its continued failure to introduce Road Equivalent Tarf on routes linking Orkney to the Scottish Mainland.“The roll-out of RET began on West of Scotland ferry routes more than a decade ago, reducing fares for local people and visitors alike,” he added.“It is our firm belief that there is no impediment preventing RET being introduced on Orkney routes, and that any further delay is unfair and will result in signicant prejudice against local ferry users.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He played in bands in London, rubbing shoulders with the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton and his jamming buddy, Ritchie Blackmore, who went on to form the legendary rock bands Deep Purple and Rainbow.He even jammed at a party with Cream bassist and vocalist, Jack Bruce.A visit from Screaming Lord Sutch, who wanted him to go to Germany with him as a bass playermade Jim think again about a career in rock music.His first passion was always art, and comic book art was his favourite genre.He declined Lord Sutch’s offer and after a few years ed to his beloved Orkney. Here he continued drawing for TV comics before working for AD. He was then head-hunted by the American giants, DC Comics and Marvel Comics.Sadly, Jim suffered with Parkinson’s Disease for over  years and passed away on December , .Despite the diagnosis he continued drawing, painting and writing original sci-fi stories for many years.This celebration of his le and art is dferent from other recent exhibitions, as it contains his le story, original artwork and artefacts relating to him.It also features many Orkney related pieces, rather than just sci-fi heroes like Judge Dredd and Batman.Local characters from the th century hang alongside paintings showing the story of St Magnus, wartime Hoy and illustrations from books, like The Bard of Ballarat and Willick o’ Pirliebraes.Jim’s we, Wendy, said: “I am delighted that the Orkney Museum is having an exhibition of my late husband Jim’s work.“The fact that a young boy from the small Orkney island of Hoy should become world famous in his chosen field of comic book illustration is an achievement in itself, but there were many other aspects to Jim’s le.“This exhibition gives an insight into his early le in Hoy, as well, as his time in the RAF and the excitement of being in the London music scene during the ‘swinging sixties’.“I think it is a true reflection of the times he lived in and I hope it will interest the folk who see it.”The Orkney Museum is open Monday to Saturday, .am-.pm, .pm-pm.

Since then, using successive budgets, ministers have singled out HIE for deep cuts while increasing support for economic development where in Scotland. On the face of it, this is just centralisation by another name.“The consequences of this ill-judged decision should not be underestimated. With Brexit already posing a real threat to economic development across the region, including here in Orkney, it makes no sense for this SNP government to compound those dficulties by further slashing HIE’s funding.”Shetland MSP Beatrice Wishart added: “HIE have shown that locally-based support can make all the dference for rural enterprises. There can be no good reason to backtrack on that principle through cuts to their funding.“The solution to local challenges can’t always be found in the central belt.

He has urged the Scottish Government to take the issue of fly-tipping more seriously, highlighting the environmental and social impacts of the incidents.Speaking later, Mr Halcro Johnston said: “Rural communities, like many across the Highlands and Islands, are particularly vulnerable to the utterly irresponsible and, of course, criminal activity of fly-tipping.“Incidents can cause real distress, as well as serious environmental concerns, for those communities blighted by fly-tipping. And the problem is often compounded when the waste which is dumped is not removed and then attracts even more incidents.“While fly-tipping is often carried out by a small number of offenders, too few of those responsible are being brought to justice. With both Police Scotland and local council budgets squeezed, that undoubtedly impacts on efforts to identy and prosecute offenders, as well as hampering efforts to clean up blighted areas.“The importance of a clean and attractive environment to the health and well-being of local residents is often overlooked. Many are rightly proud of their local communities and are left angry at those who fly-tip, as well as frustrated at efforts to combat it.“The Scottish Government needs to ensure there is a greater emphasis on tacking the scourge of fly-tipping, bringing to book those responsible for it, and making sure Police Scotland and local councils are properly resourced to do so”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In , Tavish Scott and I voted to support the budget.“Since then, however, the SNP has sought to backslide on this commitment and short change the communities in Orkney and Shetland. This year, that amounts to a shortfall of £m.“It is not good enough for SNP Ministers to claim they are open to negotiationthey so brazenly fail to honour the commitments they have made in previous negotiations. What trust can anyone have in the promises they make “Derek Mackay may have had to fall on his sword but the commitments he made to fair ferry funding for the Northern Isles was one made on behalf of the government as a whole. It is one that must now be delivered: no s and no buts.”Ms Wishart added: “The principle of fair ferry funding was not only accepted by this SNP government, it also reflected the will of the parliament.“Any responsible Government budgets for basic leline services needed across the country.

Yes ndash all the time.The duchess, who has a nanny, Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo, said during the podcast: ldquoTherersquos such a pull, but I am such a hands-on mum, and whatever yoursquore doing you want to make sure yoursquore doing the uttermost best job you can for your children.Kate said she wanted to begin a ldquogenerational change in early years development, and highlighted her Five Big Questions On The Under-Fives survey, launched in January to spark a UK-wide conversation about creating the best foundations for children to thrive.The month-long online poll, conducted by Ipsos Mori on behalf of Katersquos Royal Foundation, is thought to be the biggest survey of its kind and the data will guide the duchessrsquo future work.The Five Big questions On The Under-Fives has now attracted , responses.ldquoWhat wersquore doing with the survey is asking people ndash what is it that matters for them in raising their children today,lsquo Kate said.ldquoItrsquos going to take a long time, Irsquom talking about a generational change, but hopefully this is the first small step: to start a conversation around the importance of early-childhood development.Katersquos interview was recorded at the end of January after the duchess made an early-morning visit to a nursery and pre-school in Stockwell, south London, and she joked about how her two eldest children chastised her over her priorities as a mother.She said: ldquoAnd you know, even this morning, coming to the nursery visit here, George and Charlotte were like, lsquoMummy how could you possibly not be dropping us off at school this morning rsquoldquoBut no, itrsquos a constant challenge, you hear it time and time again from mums.

America’s Uncle Joe, Obama’s right-hand man, Joe Biden, former Vice-President of the world’s richest country, stumbled from New Hampshire to South Carolina in search of the African American votes that may yet save his presidential ambitions.But he looks a broken man, his ebullient personality dampened by the rise of noisy left-winger Bernie Sanders and the more moderate,slightly duller, Pete Buttigieg. Vice President Biden’s retirement from the public stage may be only a few weeks away.Saulos Chilima, on the other hand, is a vice-president with a future. First elected as Malawi’s number two in , the former telecoms chief executive failed in his bid to become his country’s youngest president last year. His former party boss, Peter Mutharika, won a second term.: The country where average income is £ a year and aid workers stay in £-a-night hotels – Susan Dalgety: Malawi gives us a warm welcome while the UK is hostile in– Patrick Grady MPSome said his political career had ended before he reached . “He is going back to the corporate world,” they whispered. But last Monday, Malawi’s constitutional court ruled the  presidential election null and void, called for a new poll by  July, and in a move that surprised everyone, including Chilima, re-instated the  presidential team until the new election.‘Call to national duty’Dressed in casual but smart sports gear, sitting behind the desk of his private office in one of Lilongwe’s leafier suburbs, Vice President Saulos Chilima looks more like a corporate boss working from home than a senior African leader.Apart from the very friendly soldier on guard at the entrance to his home, there is no pomp or ceremony surrounding him. No entourage. No hangers-on. Just a few builders working on his home and that smiling soldier. “I’ll be with you in a moment,” he said, “Please sit,” he added, as he finished some paperwork.A few minutes later he turned his full attention to me, and in perfect English, invited me to ask my questions. “We have  minutes,” he added, in a very business-like manner.I glanced at my list. “Why did you give up a successful career as chief executive of Airtel to become a politician,” I asked, too quickly.He relaxed. Then laughed. “I will repeat what I said before, it was a call to national duty. People told me that I had the potential to contribute to the greater good, so I discussed it with my family, with other people.“Some told me politics was dficult, but I opted to set aside my private sector career to respond to the call, to seemy expertise, the knowledge that I had acquired over many years, could be used to benefit many more people than just myself.”Marathon runnerHis CV is a glittering testament to a successful career in the private sector. An economist by trade, with a PhD in knowledge management, he worked for Unilever and Coca-Cola before joining Airtel Malawi, where he rose to chief executive. During his time in charge, the company grew from , customers in  to . million by .And his sports gear is not for show. He runs marathons, is a regular gym-goer, and at , still plays basketball. “Our bodies are the best God-given gts. These we must look after and invest in accordingly,” he said in a recent interview.A devout Catholic, father of two children, Sean and Elizabeth, his we Mary is regarded as a huge political asset. “She is full of le, very bright,” says one associate. “She will make a great first lady,” says another.But first Chilima has to be elected President. He missed his first chance last year, when he came third with  per cent of the national vote. Lazarus Chakwera, leader of the MCP, polled  per cent and Chilima’s old boss scraped in with  per cent.He won’t be drawnhe will stand in the new presidential elections in a few months’ time.He smiled. “We will see, there are discussions happening,” he says, enigmatically, alluding to talks between his UTM party and other opposition groups.Good governanceThe numbers may look stacked against him, but the court’s ruling that the new election must be run on a  per cent plus one basis gives him a chance of victory. And whathe did become leader of one of the world’s poorest countries “I wish we had the luxury of saying this is priority number one, number two, number three. Unfortunately, we don’t. “Food security is an issue. Health is an issue. Unemployment. Education. Security. Gender is an issue.“They need to be dealt with in tandem. Butwe say, let’s try and do some prioritisation, we need to deal with food security once and for all. We must make our agriculture sector work properly.“We also need to do away with avoidable diseases, through better health and education.“Then you would begin to look at young people, the empowerment of women. We must develop our human capital.“And for all of this to work, you must have good governance as the centre-piece. We need to get rid of fraud and corruption. The judgement last week showed the rule of law works here.”‘Three meals a day’The successful corporate boss who cites Coca-Cola’s business model as an inspiration is also a classic Keynesian. At times of trouble – and Malawi’s economy is most certainly suffering – Chilima believes the government should borrow to invest in the country’s future.His party’s  manesto promised “one million jobs in one year”, a pledge that many ridiculed, not least the BBC’s Zeinab Badawi during a recent HARDtalk interview.But Chilima is unabashed. “Of course, it can be done, it is doable,” he told me.“We have to find a way of jump-starting the economy. One way is a loan fund for the people who already have business. Invest there, so their businesses will grow, and they employ more people. Invest in the village banks, the co-operatives where people lend to each other to support economic activity.“Invest in infrastructure, and the construction sector absorbs a lot of people immediately. They need suppliers, and they need to eat. The chain continues. We have a simple promise,” he says, drawing the interview to a close,  minutes after my allotted half hour. “We want a happy nation, to be a middle-income economy where people enjoy three meals a day,” he says, walking me back to the gate. “And we can do it.”Vice President Biden’s political career may be drawing to a close in the southern states of America, but here, in the heart of southern Africa, it feels asVice President Chilima’s is just about to take off.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"it s nessie mystery skeleton washed up on scots beach leads to speculation it s loch ness monster","story":"The photos of the rotten carcass on Balmedie Beach in Aberdeen were posted on a local community Facebook page - Fubar News - after it was revealed following the powerful storm which battered the country last week.

While this year’s results have been magnicent, we are also aware that over the last number of years SLG has been a top performing school in NI and that these results from our students merely consolidate our achievements of the past as well.Consistently outstanding academic outcomes such as these, over a number of years are the combination of engaged students, deep curriculum planning, high quality learning and teaching experiences for students, rigorous tracking of student progress, supportive parents and of course a superb teaching staff.As a school we are constantly monitoring and evaluating all aspects of curriculum delivery including engaging with our students regularly to ensure our students are not only achieving highly, but are both happy and enjoying their learning too.Good Governance, recent school investments in new pedagogies for the CPD of our staff, as well as recent DE capital investments have also contributed to the year on year academic success which has left our school well established as a top ranking school in NI and in the UK.All associated with the school are proud of our achievements to date and our teachers are privileged to be able to support our students, as they continue to achieve highly and are in strong positions to contribute to society in the future, through access to an exciting range of career pathways”.

However, a letter’s been sent to the family home asking her to “contact a monumental sculptor” to “make this memorial safe”.A family member – who prefers not to be identied – told us about her upset when she opened the letter.“It was a bit of shock, to be honest,” she said. “Everyone can make mistakes, but this is one that could so easily have been avoided with a bit of sensitivity and professionalism. City Hall keeps records of deaths, so obviously nobody bothered to do any cross-checking. And it would be a very simple matter for the workers inspecting the headstones to take a note of who’s in the plot as an extra precaution. Manynot most of the graves in the cemetery are family plots and somebody should have taken that into consideration before this process started. It’s just a lack of thought and care, in my opinion, and it was totally avoidable.“I would ask them now just to do what they can to make sure their process is tightened up to make sure this sort of thing doesn’t happen to any more families. I’m sure it’s happened before and it will certainly happen again unless the system is improved.”Like many local authorities across the north and in Britain, Belfast City Council is in the midst of a memorial inspection programme launched in  after an eight-year-old boy was killed by a falling headstone in Scotland the previous year.In the letter to the local family, the City Hall Director of City Service said while the Council does “not wish to cause any further upset” to bereaved families, it must “make sure” its cemeteries are “safe places” for workers and visitors.In a statement to the Andersonstown News, A Belfast City Council spokeswoman said: “We are sincerely sorry for the upset and hurt caused to the family. As part of our memorial safety inspection started in , we have written to around , deed holders. Some of the information we hold may not have been updated by relatives or family members, hence this administrative error has occurred. We recognise this will have been very upsetting for those receiving the letter and apologise for the error.”But the family member rejected any suggestion that families should be required to update information about their loved ones for the Council. All deaths in the city are legally required to be registered with Belfast City Council, which also holds burial records for the City Cemetery.“The death was registered with City Hall,” she said. “They have the information at their fingertips and that is enough. The simple fact of the matter is that they made no effort to access that information and are just sending out letters willy-nilly to deed-holders, most of whom are going to be older people. It’s very unfair of the Council to try and turn this around like that. This is too sensitive a matter to be treated in such a slipshod manner.”Askedupdating the Council’s records after the statutory death registration process was the responsibility of the deceased’s family, a Council spokeswoman said: “While we make every effort to ensure the information we have is accurate and up to date, which can be challenging given the passage of time, on this occasion details were missed. We will review the process of writing to deed holders to ensure further checks are in place to try to prevent any similar errors or upset for another family.We sincerely apologise for the error.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"familys fitting tribute to danielle","story":"THE family of a Glengormley woman who died just weeks before she was due to begin a new le-extending cystic fibrosis drug have raised over £, in her memory.Danielle McFalldied at Antrim Area Hospital in October after a week in intensive care.She was diagnosed with the disease aged just six weeks and after being diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of  she developed cirrhosis of the liver.Danielle was due to start the new drug, Orkambi, which can improve lung , after a deal was struck with US drug manufacturer Vertex.However, Danielle became ill on October , soon after the announcement was made, and died on October .In her memory, her family decided they wanted to do something and recently held a fundraiser for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust in Cltonville Golf Club.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Danielle’s mother Angela explained: “She fought long and hard all her le and we all really miss her.“We wanted to do something in her memory but had never done anything like this before.“It was a daunting task to organise something from nothing but we sat down and got sponsors who donated vouchers and prizes for a ballot.“As we got closer to the event, we worried more and more about whether it would be a success.“It was a freezing night in January and we were worried that people wouldn’t come out but thanks to a combination of hard work and incredible generosity, we raised far more money than we ever expected to.“We put on a buffet, had great music from DJ Gerry and a ballot draw.“We had vouchers for make-up salons and barbers, loads of drinks hampers, tickets to the Belfast Giants and the Game of Thrones Giant’s Causeway tour and the main prize, which was a gigantic perfume and make-up hamper from Medicare in Northcott.”Danielle’s family managed to raise an amazing £. for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and Belfast International Airport have pledged an additional £ to the total raised.“It was a really fun-filled night and as a family, we would like to thank all who helped make it possible.“We’re overwhelmed by the result and are glad that out efforts paid off as fantastically as they did.

It’s time they packed up and disbanded.”Ms O’Neill and Mr Kelly’s attendance at a PSNI recruitment event was hailed by Chief Constable Simon Byrne as “seismic and historic”.It was the first time such a senior Sinn Fein figure had attended such a meeting, although the party has expressed support for police in Northern Ireland on many occasions in the past.Last year there were attempted bomb attacks by dissident republicans targeting police in Belfast, Craigavon in Co Armagh and near the Irish border in Fermanagh.The New IRA and Continuity IRA are involved.Police have branded as “cruel and disgusting” anti-PSNI recruitment posters depicting an officer who was severely injured in a bomb attack.The posters used a picture of Peadar Heffron along with a warning that anyone thinking of joining the police could suffer similar injuries.Mr Heffron lost a leg when a dissident bomb detonated under his car near Randalstown in  as he travelled to work. He now uses a wheelchair.Meanwhile, Ms McDonald commended her negotiating, Executive and Assembly teams – led by Ms O’Neill – for “working hard for citizens”.She listed recent successes following the restoration of devolved political powersharing at Stormont.The party leader said: “Already in the Executive we have seen measures taken to tackle poverty, including moving quickly to end the nurses dispute of equal pay extending welfare mitigations, a new house building programme has been announced.“Additional funding has been made available for education and the victims and survivors of the contaminated blood scandal in the north will receive compensation payments.”PA,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadValentine#s Day calf born with heart-shaped patch in Co AntrimTributes to Arnie Clarke who drowned in desperate bid to save dog in Co Down riverNorthern Ireland councils in debt to tune of £m as some ratepayers face raft of cuts to servicesNorthern Ireland school principal working with police after #vicious# lies about staff and pupils posted onlineBelfast fraudster Mackie back behind bars after thefts from church and charity,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Conor needs to find the courage to do the same.Why will he not speak the same words as his Sinn Fein colleagues Mrs Quinn will arrive in Parliament Buildings as MLAs gather for a plenary session.We are delighted to have the opportunity to talk to the politicians face-to-face, she said.We will be appealing to them to use whatever influence they have with Conor because he hasn#t listened to us so far.I would hope that our presence in Parliament Buildings would encourage him to look into his heart and say the words that would mean so much to us.Mrs Quinn said that Mr Murphy had a big job now as Finance Minister. She said: I know that he#s has a lot of things to do but he still has a responsibility to my family given the great wrong he did us in .We appreciate what Mary Lou and Michelle have done. But it was Conor who blackened Paul#s name and we need to hear those words from him.Mrs Quinn added: It was never about the Dail election for Stephen and me. We#ve been talking about Paul for  years, and we#ll talk about him for another we have to.Paul Quinn was beaten to death by the IRA in a barn in Oram, Co Monaghan, in . The -year-old Cullyhanna man had previously clashed with the son of the local Provisional commander.Following the murder Mr Murphy branded Paul a criminal and a smuggler.He later denied making the remarks but was forced to admit them after a tape of the BBC interview was unearthed.He retracted his comments last week and apologised but has refused the family#s demand that he categorically state that Paul wasn#t a criminal. Stormont#s Finance Committee has written to the minister telling him that his conduct calls into question his fitness for office.The letter asks him to explain why he branded Paul a criminal and why he denied the comments for the past  years.It states: It is the committee#s view that your conduct calls into question your fitness for office.Responding to the letter, a Sinn Fein spokesman said: When Conor Murphy took up the post of Finance Minister only weeks ago, nearly all of these parties wished him well and supported him in the role.And now, over the last week, they have developed serious considerations about his place in office over remarks made  years ago.Conor has written to the family, unreservedly withdrawn his remarks and apologised, and he continues to carry out the important task of Finance Minister.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadValentine#s Day calf born with heart-shaped patch in Co AntrimTributes to Arnie Clarke who drowned in desperate bid to save dog in Co Down riverNorthern Ireland councils in debt to tune of £m as some ratepayers face raft of cuts to servicesNorthern Ireland school principal working with police after #vicious# lies about staff and pupils posted onlineBelfast fraudster Mackie back behind bars after thefts from church and charity,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Many of the pupils at Ballougry PS have a family link to the school and children come from as far afield as Eglinton and Donemana to be educated there.We have children whose parents, grandparents and even great grandparents have been at the school.The parents have such fond memories of their time here that they want their children to enjoy the same type of education, no matter where they are living.Mr OKane believes that attending a small primary school equips children well for the transition to secondary school.In a small school setting you have to get on well with everyone and the children thrive on it.In bigger schools you can jump around friendship groupsthings arent working out, but here you just have to work it out.We were very happy with out recent transfer test results and our children will be moving on to every post primary school in the city.”Mr OKane concluded: The feedback that we always get is that the children really do represent us well.Among the schools best known past pupils is renowned actress, Amanda Burton, well known for her television roles, including Heather Black in the Channel  soap opera Brookside, Beth Glover in Peak Practice, Sam Ryan in the BBC crime drama series Silent Witness, Clare Blake in The Commander and Karen Fisher in Waterloo Road.Her father was a headmaster at the school. googletag.cmd.push Photos: Tom Heaney   googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In an ‘Embrace the Giant Spirit’ event organised by Tourism NI, actors Stephen Rea, Tara Lynne O’Neill and Laurence Kinlan, musician Neil Martin and the singer-songwriter Lisa Hannigan, gave a unique and moving performance to celebrate Seamus Heaney’s work at Christ Church Cathedral in Dublin.The programme was curated by Seamus Heaney HomePlace, the literary centre in Bellaghy, Co Derry, which takes visitors on a journey through the le and literature of the poet, with an invited audience including members of the Heaney family, representatives from the local tourism industry as well as arts, culture and media.The performers came together as part of an initiative which aims to highlight the literary connections between Seamus Heaney HomePlace, which recently reached its , visitor milestone, and the hugely successful ‘Listen Now Again’ exhibition, which draws on the National Library’s extensive Heaney archive and has welcomed over , visitors since it opened in Dublin in July .Featuring powerful performances of Seamus Heaney’s work, including an adaptation in words and music of an excerpt of Aeneid: Book VI and a haunting performance of Anahorish by Lisa Hannigan, the event comes as HomePlace prepares to extend its visitor experience into the landscape which so inspired the poet and which features in his work.A total of  locations of signicance to Seamus Heaney are being developed, notable among them being Lough Beg a place of ‘special memories’ for the poet where a boardwalk will lead visitors to a newly constructed viewing point to see Church Island and its famous spire, with extracts of poetry audible, as well as visible along the route. A riverside walk by the Moyola River is also being created and a newly commissioned sculpture will form the focal point for visitors to hear and read poetry at the eel fishery in Toome. Visitors will also be able to download an app, which will allow access to augmented reality as they journey through each location.Fiona Cunningham, RoI Market Manager for Tourism NI said, “With the impressive Seamus Heaney HomePlace, situated in Bellaghy, only two and a half hours from Dublin, visitors can really immerse themselves in our greatest poet’s writing and discover many areas of his beloved hometown that inspired so much of his work.“Over , thousand have visited the Dublin exhibition since it opened in , and many may be unaware of the very unique and spiritually moving experience one can also get when visiting Heaney HomePlace.

That feeling of love and happiness between the three of us was just perfect. This led to a conversation between my son and I, and later his girlfriend and his dad, about what holding hands means, about the memories it provokes and how we hold hands.How we hold hands  I hear you ask, don’t we all hold hands the same  Well I thought we did but no we don’t. . There’s the palm together hand hold, the fingers entwined hand hold, the just fingertips entwined hand hold and there are more. Which one you are, my son told me, depends on who you are holding hands with! Well I disagreed I always hold hands in a palms together way - but apparently that’s just a mummy hold according to my son!. Yes, his dad disagreed, but my son’s girlfriend didn’t.So, what does holding hands mean, what does it make us think, what does it make us feel and remember  George was smiling as he remembered his grandad holding his wrist - yes, his wrist not his hand - to cross the road. George said he really didn’t like this as he was about eight years old at the time but he does remember letting his grandad do it because he thought it made his grandad happy. His dad laughed when George said this and told George his grandad did the same to him – hmmm, I wonder, will this become a family tradition  I remember holding hands with my mum lots of times, but most of all I remember her sliding her little finger up my wrist as she held my hand and that this would make us both laugh together. My son’s girlfriend said, although she remembered holding hands with her mum, she also remembered always holding hands with her best friend everywhere they went. Personally, I can remember telling my son that he had to hold my hand when we were out so I didn’t get lost - great excuse to keep him safe. I had this same “holding hands” conversation later that week with my friend who told me she loved holding hands with her little one as they sing row your boat and with her older child who loves to walk on the walls in front of people’s houses. I think a favourite of mine, apart from that with my son nieces and mum, of course , is when I am in school or nursery and I see all the children holding hands with mum or dadchattering away and smiling together. I’m smiling as I’m writing remembering all these things - I know you’ll have your own happy hand holding memories too. It’s a simple gesture but does show how much we care, how much we love, does send a message of caring through touch, does support a loving bond, can help us feel, and give, security and a feeling of belonging to each other. googletag.cmd.push But, as our babies, toddlers and children grow into pre-teens the hand holding begins to disappear - unless you are lucky enough to have an affectionate teenage daughter.So, enjoy it today, remember the feeling of those little hands in yours, take time to hold hands together whether walking along, sitting and watching tv or singing a simple rhyme. For these memories will take you through the stroppy teenage years - teenage years wherein their idea of holding hands with you in public is just the most embarrassing thing ever, and all the way to Grandparent days!!!Written by, on Facebook, Me  You @meandyoubyjenni to support the Greater Shantallow Talking To Our Babies, Greater Shantallow Area Partnership.

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

The Kindness of Strangers charity was set up to support low income families and iniduals. It runs a shop at Castle Street in Derrys city centre.

Writing on their Facebook page, a spokesperson for Kindness of Strangers said: A kind stranger called Connor came into our office and handed us a blank cheque. googletag.cmd.push The kind stranger said he lives in Strabane and that he is delighted to hear that we are going to open up a new Kindness of Strangers shop there. Connor said he would like us to identy any shortfall we have in our setting up costs and add a few activities for local children. Connor told us to go ‘all out’ and ‘not to be shy’ when writing out his cheque.

But that changed when he started at St. Patricks Athletic in April and scored a picture perfect free kick that helped his team on their way to a convincing away win. Slowly but surely Bruna began to have more influence on the pitch and it got to the point where Declan Devine could no longer ignore that fact. Bruna became a regular starter and was hugely influential, his range of passing ability on a cultured left foot key to unlocking defences, as teams such as UCD and Finn Harps found out to their dismay. Bruna has settled off the pitch as well, his young family loving le in Derry, and that convinced him to sign a new deal at the club. A dferent kind of midfielder, the type that every successful team needs, Bruna could yet again have a signicant part to play. He missed the end of last season with a knee injury, but he is back fit and raring to go. “I had to work extremely hard in the off season to be in the best shape possible for this coming season and thats what Ive been doing,” he explained. “I knew it was going to be a tough off-season because of how I finished the last campaign. I have been working with Mickeytrying to fix what I was carrying and Im just really happy with the place Im in now.”Bruna was involved in some memorable encounters throughout the  campaign and he admitted he was impressed with the standard in his first season in League of Ireland football.“I would probably say yes, I think it was very good,” he continued. “I have played in a lot of dferent places, dferent countries with dferent levels of football and I was really impressed. It was a nice surprise. Im looking forward to the season now and hopefully I cam compete hopefully a little bit better than last year.”Inidually and collectively, there are goals for everyone this season, and Bruna is hoping to stay clear of further injuries so that he, and his team mates, can strive to build on the giant strides made last season.“I feel good,” he insisted. “I tried to do the best I could and try to do what the staff wants me to do by helping the team, distributing the ball and moving it around and helping the players in front of me create chances so thats what Im going to keep doing. Im going to keep working hard and enjoying it and hopefully I can do well.“We achieved Europe last year and hopefully we can achieve it again this year. We probably want to a little bit better. Obviously we dont want to put too much pressure on ourselves but I do think we can, with the lads that have come in and the squad we have this season, I think we can do really well. Lets not just say it, but go out there and do it.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Despite playing well that day, Derry left empty handed, which was of little consolation considering the importance of points at this stage of the season. “I try not to look at the table too much because it is completely psychological,” McCarter admitted. “You can be playing really well and still sitting second or third bottom, but you knowyou pick up four or five points, you can be well up that table. We have to keep our eyes off the table and concentrate on the matches and make sure our performances are worthy of those points.“We have itchy feet after three weeks, especially after a defeat because you just want to try and put it right the following Saturday, but whenever you have a two or three week break you cant do that. You just try and stay productive and keep focused on the next game and its finally coming around.”City of Derry played miserably in their last home game against Midleton but still won, whilst they scored three tries at Enniscorthy but came away with nothing. Its never straightforward when it comes to Derry this season. “It was actually a really encouraging performance,” McCarter reflected. “I know we had beaten Midleton but we were disappointed with how we had played that day. On the flip side of that, we gave a good account of ourselves against Enniscorthy but we got nothing from it. “It was really frustrating from that point of view. We definitely deserved something from that game, evenit was a losing bonus point, but to come away with nothing other than that encouraging performance was frustrating. It has been a long few weeks now and were just looking forward to getting back into it on Saturday.” googletag.cmd.push Must winThere is no getting away from the importance of this weeks home game against Bangor, who sit two places and one point above Derry. A victory could take Derry into the top five, but defeat could all but end any hopes of a play-off place. That reality is not lost on anyone at the club. “Looking at the table, everyone is right beside us so they are all big games for us,” McCarter agreed. “Saturday just feels really important being a home game, being an Ulster derby, and the fact that they are closest to us in the table. It is a big one, and we just have to try and play the game and not the occasion, We cant be overawed. We want to play rugby, we want to play the way weve been training and sometimes you can get away from that when the occasion has been hyped up.”Whatever the weather this Saturday, and whatever the performance, McCarter just wants the win. At this stage of the season, thats all that matters.“Were desperate to win it,” he said. “I was frustrated after Midleton but I would take that every week as opposed to a gloried defeat like we had in Enniscorthy. Were prepared for whats going to be a mentally tough last few weeks. We have got to get ourselves up for it and find ways of winning these games.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

As a result, innovative ways will have to be found to include the building in the new retail scheme which could also include new housing.There are also some who believe that a multi-storey car park mdash with retail outlets on the ground floor mdash should be considered in the new development and built on top of the existing Irish Street car park footprint.Local council officials say that they are committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site.They hope that working alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal will provide consultants charged with coming up with a design on the way forward with an understanding of what residents and traders would like to see and what would work at this particular site.The development brief for the town centre location is expected to outline what all those involved in the process would like to see happen in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in the Irish Street location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre.It is over two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative, with local council officials confirming recently that ious pockets of land which make-up the Irish Street site have now been purchased.Downpatrick councillor Oonagh Hanlon has welcomed confirmation that a so-called soft market testing exercise is to proceed shortly.ldquoThis will allow potential developers and interested parties an opportunity to visit the Irish Street site during a planned open day. This will allow them to give their views on the potential of the site and point out any likely constraints within any proposed project, she explained.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoThe feedback provided will be used to assist the Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council to prepare a development brief for the site.ldquoThe regeneration project for the former police base site provides an opportunity to regenerate Downpatrick town centre.

He hopes, however, that he has allayed their immediate fears by stressing that he would not tolerate bad behaviour on his premises. He was willing to give a lead to stop it.He made the point to objectors that the ldquosinister element was already in the town and he did not want trouble any more than other shopkeepers or residents who had suffered at the hands of vandals.DOWNPATRICK mdash A young Downpatrick pop group has made a spectacular comeback on the local music trail after a two-year layoff.The former Sunbeams, now calling themselves Memphis, have been travelling up and down the country fulfilling engagements in halls, clubs and hotels.Ironically it was transport problems which forced them off the road in  but they have since been organising their comeback and are now better equipped and more experienced.Their repertoire is packed with the latest sounds and such is their wide selection of numbers that they played non-stop at alast month for five and a half hours.The group is fronted by the delectable and talented Janet Wilcox who is joined by her brother Stewart , Patrick McAuley , Danny Skeffingtonand Philip Hynds .Up to now most of their engagements have ben south of the border but they are now ready to make their mark up north, particularly around Co Down.BALLYKINLAR mdash Portaferry Dramatic Society will present the play lsquoIs the Priest at Homersquo  in the Parochial Hall, Ballykinlar, tomorrow night at pm.Written by the internationally famed Joseph Tomelty, himself a former resident of the town, the play is set in a priestrsquos home in a small in Northern Ireland during the early s.It is currently enjoying a very successful run in parochial and community halls throughout the Ards and Lecale peninsula, and indeed, in response to public demandperformances are being planned at some venues.Two of the playwrightrsquos brothers are members of the society, with Jim Tomelty playing the leading role of the curate.

But I am committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives across Northern Ireland.ldquoI will be assessing the pressures across my department reflecting on my priorities, the commitments in the lsquoNew Decade: New Approachrsquo document and the budget made available for the period ahead.Ms Mallon said that as a result, it is therefore ldquotoo early to comment on specic schemes such as the Ballynahinch bypass.Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.During last weekrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, there was across-the-board political support for a motion seeking a meeting with Ms Mallon and seniors roads engineers to discuss the Ballynahinch scheme.It was tabled by Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who is keen to see work starting on the near two-mile scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads.He said the scheme has been shovel ready for some time and is hoping the Department for Infrastructure will allocate funding to allow construction work, which is expected to take in excess of  months to complete, to begin.Cllr Walker argued that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has missed out on signicant roads funding for decades, with many major schemes constructed in other parts of the Province.He added: ldquoThe time has come for this council to demand its fair share of infrastructure funding. I have been a councillor for over  years and the bypass issue has been raised during every one of them.Slieve Croob councillor Cathy Mason described Ballynahinch as the ldquogateway to the wider South Down area through which all traffic must pass, including HGVs. She said this not only frustrates drivers who are part of the through traffic, but increases tension and danger for those living, shopping and working in the town.Cllr Mason said that housing is also being permitted up to the line of the planned new road and includes the potential for a park and ride site.She added: ldquoThe bypass has been proposed since the s and for decades local community and political representatives from all parties have demanded this new road. The new infrastructure minister must signal the start of work on the multi-million pound road scheme.Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess is also keen to see work on the bypass get underway and hopes that Ms Mallon will also formally sign off the scheme to upgrade the final section of the A between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden in Saintfield.He said: ldquoThe bypass is critically important to the social and economic regeneration of not only Ballynahinch, but the wider South Down area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12th February 2020 New Queens.jpg","title":"New queens of Ulster  ","story":"ST Maryrsquos High School, Downpatrick, lted the prestigious Erne Cup for the first time at the Mid Ulster Sports Arena, Cookstown, last Wednesday afternoon with a blistering display of attacking football.Victory was no more than the local girls deserved when they gained revenge for last seasonrsquos heartbreaking cup final defeat to the same opposition.St Maryrsquos started the game strongly and turned their possession into scores with an early goal from Saulrsquos Cara Doran settling the nerves.The Enniskillen girls were simply not allowed to play their vaunted expansive game and Katie Convie raced in almost immediately to make it - to - when she capitalised on a poor kick-out.St Fanchearsquos had no intention of giving up their title without a fight and replied with three consecutive points. However, a buoyant St Maryrsquos outfit replied with points from Cora Convery, Alishia Lundy and Shannon Sloan to maintain their six-point lead.Six points quickly became  by the half-time break as St Maryrsquos continued to terrorise St Fanchearsquos and scores from Doran , Abi Murphyand the lethal Shannon Sloangave the locals a commanding - to - lead.St Franchearsquos came out fighting in the second half, scoring a goal and two points without reply to reduce the arrears to  point, but that was as good as it got as St Maryrsquos quickly regained the initiative and went for broke.They certainly put the foot on the gas and points from Erin Sands, Katie Convie and Cara Doran had St Maryrsquos well clear St Fanchearsquos kept on to the bitter end and forced a great save form St Marys goalkeeper Fia McFaul as they tried to get back into contention.However, McFaul and her defensive wall of Keely OrsquoNeill, player of the match Nora Maguire, team captain Neva Loudon, Katie Black, Louise Lundy and Lucy Morgan kept St Fanchearsquos at bay.At midfield, Eimear Teggart and Erin Sands dominated throughout the game and kept their dazzling forward busy with a constant supply of good ball.Abi Murphy, Cara Doran, Alishia Lundy, Cora Convery, Shannon Sloan and Katie Convie were literally unplayable and gave the St Fanchearsquos defence a torrid time all afternoon.St Maryrsquos: Fia McFaul, Keely OrsquoNeill, Nora Maguire, Neva Loudon, Katie Black, Louise Lundy, Lucy Morgan, Eimear Teggart, Erin Sands, Abie Murphy, Cara Doran, Alishia Lundy, Cora Convie, Shannon Sloan, Katie Convie.

Local authority officials hope that work on the much-needed project can start within four years.News of the new leisure centre plan, exclusively revealed in the Recorder last October, is being discussed by senior council officials and local politicians and recently topped the agenda during a special workshop examining the way forward.Among the proposals being examined are building a new complex at the rear of the current Newcastle Centre, which enjoys protected status. This would also result in the current outdoor Tropicana swimming pool being bulldozed.Local politicians were recently presented with an update on progress on a new leisure proposal, with council officials confirming this week that a review of ious feasibility studies and their findings is being considered by the organisation.While the local authority said that it is not yet in a position to confirm any plans or timelines in relation to the Newcastle Centre or indeed the Tropicana, it insists any new-build will not encroach on the promenade at the rear.Most signicantly, the council has confirmed that any commissioning of a full economic appraisal and business case would involve consultations, including public meetings, as part of the process.Council officials say that they are ldquoacutely aware of the need for improved leisure provision in Newcastle and are keen to address criticism that on wet days in the resort, there is little provision for both residents and tourists.While redeveloping the existing Newcastle Centre, which forms part of the Annesley Buildings, is one option moving forward, there are suggestions that given the age of the building, the scale of the work involved an the constraints of the site, a new-build at the rear would be more most cost-effective.One of the key issues the council will have to address is how it intends to replace the Tropicana , as widely expected, it will be bulldozed. There are those pushing for an indoor water facility which would be available all year round.Council officials are also keen to ensure that the redevelopment of the Main Street site is in keeping with a part of the resort where millions of pounds have been invested over recent years. Serious consideration will also have to be given to on-site car parking, included adequate disabled provision.In addition, council officials say that they recognise that as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor leisure facility which has been its Achilles heel for some considerable time.Two sites were previously identied for a new leisure centre in the resort, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive. Despite a number of attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed with local church officials, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl to develop a new store and dedicated base for the Mourne Mountain Rescue Team.Councillors are keen for the local authority to take the lead and ensure that Newcastle boasts an ultra-modern community and leisure facility.They say that the provision of a new centre for residents and visitors is long overdue and that a resort the size of Newcastle should and must have adequate leisure provision. Some councillors are keen to see a family fun pool in the proposed new-build.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman confirmed that several feasibility studies and strategic reports have been compiled in relation to the Newcastle Centre.She also confirmed that a recent review of the feasibility studies and their findings has been completed and is being considered by the local authority.ldquoUntil further scoping works are carried out, the council cannot confirm any plans or timelines in relation to the Newcastle Centre or the Tropicana, said the spokeswoman.She added: ldquoHowever, encroaching on to the promenade is not anticipated.

The clear message from voters of all parties was that our Province could not continue to drt after three years without local decisions on everyday issues like our roads, schools and hospitals.By Arlene Foster, First MinisterSaturday, th February , : am\"\"Arlene FosterAlthough the New Decade New Approach deal is not perfect it was fair and balanced. We should take the elements about respecting each other’s identity and use it as the vehicle for promoting a vibrant and prosperous Northern Ireland, as an active and integral and part of the UK, as we approach the centenary of the place we are proud to call home.Those pretending that the political vacuum of the last three years was in Unionism’s best interests offer only a short-sighted strategy. That is not the position of the DUP. The reality is that people living in every part of Northern Ireland whatever their political outlook, want delivery of effective frontline services, not the ision of a border poll or distraction of recycling the Brexit debate. Despite some of the spin, the  RTE exit poll showed almost one in five of SF voters didn’t even support a border poll. Instead % prioritised healthcare.We should not be complacent in defending and promoting the overwhelming benefits of being part of the UK. However we should not lose sight of the fact that the best defence against those who wish to take us out of the UK is to create a socially thriving and economically prosperous Northern Ireland. A Northern Ireland where everyone feels at home and where everywhere has a genuine and active stake in determining their future. Despite its accepted weaknesses and frustrations, devolution is still the key to this. Yesterday I attended a business breakfast in the Castlereagh Hills. There I presented my vision of making our Province a better place to live, work, grow up, raise a family and do business. That means building a dynamic and successful regional economy. Protecting first and foremost unfettered access for trade with Great Britain, in both directions, and ensuring local interests are met in the implementation of Brexit. It means pursuing better infrastructure connections both with Great Britain and between dferent hubs of jobs and growth within Northern Ireland. This will increase the number of households seeing practical benefits of living their lives within the fth largest global economy.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...It is also our job to incentivise young people to stay in Northern Ireland as part of a skilled and future-proof workforce. It is not in the wider interests of unionism to allow the brain drain to continue. We are committed to working with domestic and international businesses to identy skills gaps and create better links between education routes at all levels and the needs of employers not just tomorrow but in five or ten years’ time. All the while ensuring affected sectors like agri-food and hospitality have access to the outside labour they need in the short-term. At the same time we have to showcase Northern Ireland, building on the strong tourism brand already established. Earlier this week the Tourism NI’s Visitor Attitude Survey reported that % of visitors to Causeway Coast and Glens thought it met or exceeded expectations. The future for Northern Ireland as a positive brand is bright. The possibilities are limitless and we will work proactively with the newly appointed Cabinet Minister for the Constitution and Devolution to make even further strides.Last year the DUP began work on developing a “Next Generation Unionism” approach. This work continues and we must seek to be pro-active in developing our case rather and building the broadest possible support. I am clear that restoring Stormont isn’t a barrier to a vibrant and forward-looking brand of Unionism. It presents a fresh impetus that we must be ambitious to exploit. The road will not always be easy. There will be challenges. However this is how we will protect the interests of unionism and secure Northern Ireland’s place for the next  years. We all have a role to play in this process and I look forward to getting started.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

She saw the fairnessof our case but that ultimately moving on it would depend on other things happening.Of course it is possible that her response was tailored by the fact that she needed our nomination.This possibility was forcefully raised at the meeting so we were all aware of that possibility.

It’s a conversational well that is unlikely to run dry given the numerous prompts that adorn the walls, the rails and the display counters.Northern Ireland might not be as big a force in world football as the likes of Germany, France and Brazil, but per capita the Province punches well above its weight in terms of a fanaticism for football, be it the Irish League, the national team or an adopted team in England or Scotland.Mugs featuring the Irish Leagues finest: Glenn Ferguson, Gregg Davidson, Chris Walker, Billy Caskey, Jamie Mulgrew, Joe Gormley and George McMullan \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...The shop which was opened in August by Ryan Gilmore, , and his business partner Pete McDonald, , taps into the rich demand for memorabilia amongst the nation’s football mad population.It leans towards the local game, celebrating the old kits and legendary stars of the Irish league, and immortalising national heroes such as Best, Whiteside, Jennings and more latterly Evans, McAuley and Healy. Ryan explained how a friendship forged in football gave birth to what is believed to be the only dedicated retro football shop in Northern Ireland.He said: “Pete and I are both Bangor fans – that’s a real labour of love – but we didn’t know each other until we met through work. We worked together for years in Yell where we pretty much talked about football non-stop.A Linfield shirt from  “The idea to start selling shirts online came after I’d been over to watch the Frampton fightand I went to the Classic Football Shirts Shop in Manchester. It’s  times bigger than the shop we have here.“I was with my fiancee at the time, now my we, and I said to her I’m going to try and do something like this online. I know how to do marketing, I love football, social media is easy enough when you know what you’re doing so I thought, I’ll give it a go. She didn’t object so that was a good start.“I started doing the shirts online last December. I got a bit of traction so I applied for a stall at St George’s in December and again in August.“I was getting married in July so I probably should have only been concentrating on that and nothing , but then I found out this unit in Smithfield was available. The Northern Ireland Subbeteo print is the top seller“Just before I was getting married – I think it was only a couple of days – I signed for the unit. Just before we got married I had to break the news to my we that I now owned a shop.“Around that time I spoke to Pete about coming on board. He said, ‘you don’t know what you’re doing, I don’t know what I’m doing, let’s see what we can do together’.”Askedthe dynamic changes when something you love becomes your job, Pete said: “I could never see us getting bored of it, I think I’ll forever be in that bubble, it’s something I love. “People work in office jobs and talk about football all day, that’s what we were like. Now we’ve got a set up where we can talk about football to whoever comes in and it’s part of the job.”Some of retro kit coasters for saleRyan commented: “On the business side of things we’re talking to clubs, striking up partnerships with other companies. Everything revolves around a love of football.”Pete said: “It’s good getting into the business side of it. There’s a buzz that comes from speaking to commercial managers of football clubs, trying to strike up partnerships.“It’s really easy to speak to people over here, quite a few clubs have heard of us.”He continued: “We’ve four clubs from the Irish League we’re in partnership with – Portadown, Linfield, Glentoran and Cltonville – and we’re branching across into England too.”At the moment the NI Classic Shirt Co is a part time venture, with the shop open on Thursday afternoonsand Fridays and Saturdays from . to .pm.Pete said: “We’re hoping to get full time. We’re going after clubs in England, Scotland and the League of Ireland as well as more local clubs. If they put in orders of a lot of units that can allow us to get a regular income and go full time.The interior of the shop in Smithfield market“We want to do as much Irish League stuff as we can with every club, that’s including the Championship. It would be great to get everyone on board. We’ve got a concept that can work with any club in the world.”Some of the shop’s best selling items are art prints of Subbuteo players from the Irish League or national team in kits from the eras in which they played. Another popular line sees a selection of classic kits displayed on coasters, mugs, T-shirts and art prints.And for those who like memorabilia they can wear the shop has a great range of old shirts, some match-worn.The strike partners leading the retro football revolution in Northern Ireland talked about some of their key team mates in their bid to climb the commercial ladder.Ryan said: “Tom Woodsdoes the Subbuteo prints. I approached him way back in the summer. I saw what he was doing with teams all over the UK. I commissioned him to do the Northern Ireland one which is a fantastic seller for us. “It’s kits from ious eras worn by  of the best ever players – there’s nothing like this available anywhere .“For the Subbuteo designs the club sends us photos of the players, we send them onto Tom and he works his magic. “We’ve also got him to do some Irish Leagues teams that we’ve teamed up with.” Pete continued: “With Hally Designs, they produce artwork featuring classic kits and you can turn them into prints or coasters or mugs or T-shirts. “They also do art prints of classic moments like when we beat England -. “We persuaded them to branch into the Irish League.”Ryan said: “There’s always new ideas out there, new brands to team up with.”In one of the framed prints by Hally Designs I spot the dubious yellow Broomhill kit which Glenavon wore in . It’s a kit I still own, but can’t recall wearing this side of the millennium.“Some of the worst kits are the best loved,” commented Ryan. “Some of them are an acquired taste. The fans love the Cltonville Kit Kat kit, we keep selling out of that on the coasters.”As well as the bespoke printed items, the shop is home to an array of old football programmes and some rare football shirts.Pete, an Arsenal fan, is particularly proud the shop has recently acquired the club’s yellow and blue ‘bruised banana’ away kit from - as well as a ‘Bergkamp ’ Holland shirt from .He said: “Bergkamp was the top man for me. It’ll pain me to sell those shirts but that’s how a business works.”Ryan said: “When I say we get shirts from all over the world I’m not trying to be vague, they genuinely come from all over the world. “There’s a Linfield top in there I got from Hong Kong. We’ve worked with collectors in Thailand, we’ve got stuff from America. “We get stuff locally as well, for example we sold a ‘ Red Star Belgrade top that had belonged to a guy who lived just outside Belfast. It was bought by someone in Miami, Florida. That shirt has done some miles.“There’s a Rangers match-worn Alex Cleland in there with number two on the back. It came from a collector in Asia.“We do get requests from people looking for specic shirts. There’s a network of collectors you can put a message out to and see what people have.”Of the resurgence in the Irish League that has helped boost the sales of memorabilia, Pete said: “We’re finding a lot of people are coming back to Glentoran and there’s been a big cash injection at Larne. “Some matches are on BBC, some on Sky Sports. You are getting good crowds again, it’s coming back.“Just last week we sold a the Glentoran home kit from - by auction for £. I reckon it would have cost about £ to £ at the time.“The Irish League is our bread and butter, but we want to branch out into the lower leagues in England and Scotland. “We’d especially love to get our own club Bangor on board. There’s a big fanbase still there.”Ryan said: “We’ve spoken to a few Irish League players on Twitter – we’ve got feedback from Joe Gormley and Liam Boyce, they both like their versions on the Cltonville Subbuteo print.”Ryan continued: “We don’t come from a retail background, we’re just football fans.“Initially I was just emailing every address I could find, pitching to them and explaining what I was trying to do. Now we’re speaking to clubs on the phone.“Obviously George Best put Northern Ireland on the map but recently with us doing well in the Euros people are paying attention outside of here.”While the online shop is rising in prominence the lads are trying to spread the word that they have a physical shop in Smithfield as well. “So many people come in to the shop and say they didn’t know we were here,” said Ryan. “Now they’re coming once a month to see what new things we’ve got in. Word of mouth for us is massive, customers telling their friends.“In most sports shops in Northern Ireland you can only get the most recent kits from the main Premier League, European and Scottish teams. We’re trying to offer something a bit dferent.”\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This in turn benefits their schoolwork across the whole curriculum, not just in literacy.\"We are also grateful to the local businesses who generously donated the coffee shop vouchers to help make this happen.ldquoThe contributions of local businesses show once again what great community spirit we have here in Penarth!\"In total,  local businesses donated coffee shop vouchers.

His second vegan recipe book, Dirty Vegan: Another Bite, was released last month alongside a tie-in BBC cookery programme.Last Friday, Matt Pritchard visited the Penarth Pier Pavilion to discuss his latest culinary enterprise and prepare a vegan dish with Mel Grfin of Grfin Books.Pritchard has not lost his mad-dash style and performative vigour. He relished his new role as he prepared for the talk: ldquoI enjoy it, man. Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great. It was just  years of mayhem.ldquoWe were getting paid to travel around the world. Getting drunk and off your head with your mates ndash thatrsquos like winning the lottery when yoursquore that age.ldquoI loved it. But then it took its toll on my mental health.

On my th birthday Irsquoll be doing  of something for  years.ldquoItrsquos another way of proving to people that veganism helps me, and that age is but a number.Pritchard became vegan in  and began to film his own cooking show on YouTube. In , the BBC aired the first series of Dirty Vegan.ldquoIf yoursquod told me  years ago that Irsquod be sitting here with you now and talking about vegan cooking books, I would I have laughed in your face, he said.Pritchard said that he was forced to leave Twitter last year because of abuse from online trolls and members of the Welsh farming community.Why were people so hostile ldquoBecause of guilt. Anger does it. Cognitive dissonance. Theyrsquore too lazy to change or they donrsquot want to believe it.ldquoBut the evidence is there. What I care about is the evidence and the animals.\"I donrsquot want to kill something that doesnrsquot want to be killed. If you eat steak, how can you say you care for all animals In his characteristic salt-of-the earth way, Pritchard hopes to entertain audiences with his new series whilst gently educating them about the benefits of vegan cooking.ldquoYou know, therersquos   arguing about Brexit. Therersquos   arguing about meat and veganism.ldquoWersquore all arguing amongst ourselves like lunatics. This show is just there for people to enjoy. ldquoTherersquos a bit of fun in it.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win. Keir fits the bill. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

She said: ldquoIt has been a privilege to be headteacher of Dinas Powys Primary for so long.ldquoEvery day is dferent, bringing its own rewards and challenges.ldquoI have witnessed the great success of our pupils and now have the wonderful experience of over  children of our past pupils attending our school.ldquoThe whole team of staff ensures the best possible opportunities are provided for all our lovely children.ldquoIt is dficult to choose a single highlight. I enjoy it all ndash from meeting the parents and their child on admission, to organising the annual budget and ensuring the school is well resourced and maintained.The school recently renewed its green status under the Welsh Governmentrsquos coloured banding system which recognises its high performance.The New Curriculum for Wales, which will be implemented in , has already been fully embraced by the school.Staff have been trained in co-operative learning and emphasis has been placed on active participation in class.The school prioritises the health and wellbeing of its students.Mrs Thompson said: ldquoThe school has a recognised ethos of warmth, care, and love with an inidual approach to all pupils and their families which ensures that children feel secure and make the best academic and social progress throughout their school le.In January, the school was invited to become a flagship school as part of the Jigsaw programme, a mindful approach to personal and social education.This is further supported by the schoolrsquos Values Programme which promotes values such as honesty through books, lessons and visiting speakers.There are also several wellbeing groups which support the childrenrsquos needs.As part of its movement towards the New Curriculum, the school developed a new project this year, CF: Our Local Area and Beyond.This encouraged children to explore their local community and express what they liked about it.As part of the CF project, Year  visited Peter Alan and are currently undertaking drawing work to be displayed in the estate agentrsquos window.Year  were invited to the opening of the play park in the Edenstone Woodlands housing development where each student planted a flower bulb as part of the CF project.The school received pound from Studio Response for their participation.As anyone who visits the school will know, books are highly valued. Mrs Thompson is personally committed to creating a culture of enthusiasm for reading and said that she enjoyed seeing children becoming readers and getting ldquohooked on books.ldquoTo be able to read opens all education to our children, she continued.ldquoResearch is forever reporting that a child who is read to or who reads for pleasure will become a success.The schoolrsquos library holds an extensive collection of literature and each term a portion of the school budget is allocated for the purchase of books.On World Book Day, the owner of Grfin Books, Mel Grfin, will bring a pop-up book shop to Dinas Powys Primary where children can buy a book for pound.The school also participates in eCalm in collaboration with Dinas Powys Library, meaning that every child is a member.The school has its own student council, Pupil Voice, which is active on both sites.The Eco Committee recently introduced an Eco Bear to encourage all pupils to be eco-friendly and this year the school had its Platinum Status renewed by Eco Schools.The school has invested heavily in Lego resources and iPads and has received grant funding from Dow Corning supporting this investment in promoting science, technology, engineering, and mathematics .As part of its commitment to the importance of STEM, the school participates in the National Primary Maths Challenge.Two students from Dinas Powys Primary have reached the Bonus Round in this yearrsquos challenge.The school has achieved the Cymraeg Campus Bronze Award Charter that commends its commitment to the Welsh language and culture.Strong links with outside agencies include CAVMS music tuition and JAFFA Club.Last November, students from Dinas Powys Primary School performed Shakespearersquos The Tempest at The Riverfront Theatre, Newport, as part of the Shakespeare Schools Foundation.They also sang at St Davidrsquos Hall with the Cardf and Vale Christmas Showcase Cluster Choir in December.The schoolrsquos two dance squads will shortly be performing at Barry Memorial Hall for Best Foot Forward on Wednesday, March .For more information on the school, visit dinaspowysps article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yes ndash all the time.The duchess, who has a nanny, Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo, said during the podcast: ldquoTherersquos such a pull, but I am such a hands-on mum, and whatever yoursquore doing you want to make sure yoursquore doing the uttermost best job you can for your children.Kate said she wanted to begin a ldquogenerational change in early years development, and highlighted her Five Big Questions On The Under-Fives survey, launched in January to spark a UK-wide conversation about creating the best foundations for children to thrive.The month-long online poll, conducted by Ipsos Mori on behalf of Katersquos Royal Foundation, is thought to be the biggest survey of its kind and the data will guide the duchessrsquo future work.The Five Big questions On The Under-Fives has now attracted , responses.ldquoWhat wersquore doing with the survey is asking people ndash what is it that matters for them in raising their children today,lsquo Kate said.ldquoItrsquos going to take a long time, Irsquom talking about a generational change, but hopefully this is the first small step: to start a conversation around the importance of early-childhood development.Katersquos interview was recorded at the end of January after the duchess made an early-morning visit to a nursery and pre-school in Stockwell, south London, and she joked about how her two eldest children chastised her over her priorities as a mother.She said: ldquoAnd you know, even this morning, coming to the nursery visit here, George and Charlotte were like, lsquoMummy how could you possibly not be dropping us off at school this morning rsquoldquoBut no, itrsquos a constant challenge, you hear it time and time again from mums. Even mums who arenrsquot necessarily working, arenrsquot pulled in the directions of having to juggle work le and family le ndash therersquos always something.# Listen to The Duchess of Cambridge talking with @MrsGiFletcher about her #BigQuestions survey, the importance of the early years, and their shared experiences of parenthood.Have your say in the biggest ever national conversation on the early years #https:t.co MaMnlxysJ pic qOijJmmdash Kensington PalaceFebruary , Kate added: ldquoAnd always sort of questioning your own decisions, and your own judgments, and things like that, and I think that starts from the moment you have a baby.At the start of all of her pregnancies, the duchess suffered from a form of morning sickness called hyperemesis gravidarum ndash which causes severe vomiting and can lead to dehydration, weight loss and a build-up of toxins in the blood or urine.Because of the illness, she described herself as ldquonot the happiest of pregnant people, adding: ldquoLots of people have it far, far worse, but it was definitely a challenge.

He definitely wasnrsquot. I didnrsquot even ask him about it, but it was just something I wanted to do for myself.ldquoI saw the power of it really, the meditation and the deep breathing and things like that, that they teach you in hypnobirthing, when I was really sick, and actually I realised that this was something I could take control of, I suppose, during labour.

He said: \"The Historical Environments Division is a section of the Department for Communities whose responsibility is to protect historical sites in Northern Ireland and therefore safeguard our heritage.In respect to Knock Iveagh on the outskirts of Rathfriland - a prehistoric burial site date back to  years BC and the site where the inauguration of medieval Irish Kings took place - the HED has failed and they have failed miserably. In fact had it not been for the ‘Friends of Knock Iveagh’, a public interest group, this Neolithic site would have destroyed by development that should never have been allowed.\"Having asked written questions of both the Ministers for the Communities and Infrastructure it is clear that their failing from  has led us to a situation where they have now passed the issue onto Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough council planners.\"This has put the local government planners in a dficult position. If they were to apply enforcement orders on the developers on Knock Iveagh, the ones that were given permission to develop by the Department for Infrastructure and were not stopped by the Department for the Communities, then there may be a massive compensation or legal cost for such action and that will be passed to the rate payers of the local council area. \"How can it be fair that the rate payers of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon could pick up the cost of the failings by DfC and DfI.\"It is time that both DfI and DfC - who have the powers to put Knock Iveagh back to the way it was before they mistakenly gave authority for a wind turbine development - to step up and take the financial responsibility for their mistakes. The government sponsored vandalism of a site scheduled for protection under the Historical and Archaeological Objects Order is a disgrace but allowing local council to pick up the cost compounds the damage started in  and should not be acceptable.\"A Department for Infrastructurespokesman said: “Councils are responsible for the proper administration and lawful processing of their own planning and or enforcement cases. The Department recognises the concerns and strength of feeling but, under the Transition Provisions for the transfer of the majority of planning s to the new Councils in April , responsibility for planning application permission does now lie with the Council. “The planning and enforcement issues in what is a highly complex case are also a matter for the Council. “A spokesperson for ABC Council said: “The Council is currently considering a number of Planning matters in relation to the site at Knockiveagh including requests to revoke discontinue planning permission for the wind turbine.“All of these planning matters remain under consideration at the present time,” said the spokesperson.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/258/172/true/GN4_DAT_2743935.jpg--.jpg?1581604995000\\","title":"no one located after multi agency search of strule river ","story":"Police received a report of a concern for safety in the Drumragh Avenue area of Omagh in the early hours of this morning .

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here. Manufacturing Month NI, led by Manufacturing NI, will run for the entire month of March. It will include a series of events, business breakfasts, seminars, workplace tours, and the flagship annual Anchor High leadership summit will be held across Northern Ireland to highlight local manufacturing success stories, address major challenges as we enter the new decade, and inspire the next generation of manufacturers and engineers. The event, sponsored by KPMG, Siemens, Willis Towers Watson, Barclays, and Invest NI, Manufacturing Month NI will bring together industry leaders, politicians and policy experts, young people and schools, and other business leaders to celebrate manufacturers and engineers, and explore and discuss the challenges which face the industry in Northern Ireland. “We are very pleased to be launching the inaugural Manufacturing Month NI, taking place this March,” Stephen Kelly, chief executive, Manufacturing NI, said. “The manufacturing sector in Northern Ireland is the foundation of our regional economy. Manufacturing Month is a celebration of the great people, in great local companies, making great products used at home and around the world. From food processing and pharmaceuticals to aeronautical technology and new, emerging tech like AI and machine learning, Northern Ireland punches well above its weight when it comes to producing world-class products and services.” “This new initiative not only celebrates the people who make our manufacturing sector the world leader that it is but will create a legacy and a pathway for the next generation of sector leaders. A key feature of Manufacturing Month NI will be a major outreach and engagement programme with schools and regional colleges, focused on promoting the sector to young people, developing the crucial skills they need as they enter the industry.” “We hope to see as many companies as possible across theand breadth of Northern Ireland get involved with Manufacturing Month NI. We are keen to highlight new products, new initiatives, workplace tours, business expansion, and everything  in between to showcase the strength and quality of our local manufacturing sector.” And Economy Minister, Diane Dodds, said: “I commend Manufacturing NI for this new initiative which celebrates one of Northern Ireland’s most vital sectors. Northern Ireland has a long and proud history of manufacturing and engineering brilliance. Manufacturing Month NI will highlight the immense talent of the local sector. By supporting innovative initiatives like Manufacturing Month NI, we are showcasing the best and brightest in one of our most important industries.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cath1.jpg","title":"belfast city centre pubs facing m rates surge","story":"Posted on Thursday  January  by John Mulgrew The heart of Belfast’s pub and hotel scene could see rates bills soar by % and have a “crippling effect on the area” – amounting to an additional £.m a year – as part of a government revaluation, Ulster Business can reveal.A study of almost two dozen hospitality businesses in the popular Cathedral Quarter area – one of the main destinations for tourists visiting Belfast – could see a rates increase on average of almost % for pubs, while hotels in the area could see bills rise by more than a third.A survey of  bars shows the total expected rates bills could rise by £, a year, while five hotels in the area could see them in total rise by £,.It’s claimed the surge could have knock on effect on the area, including rising prices for the consumer. The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
