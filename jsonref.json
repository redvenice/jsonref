Photograph: iStockThe Government’s new retrofitting scheme could become a “problem” as landlords may use it as a reason to end tenancies, the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) has told the Dáil’s Public Accounts Committee. The Home Energy Upgrade Scheme, announced earlier this month, is to provide people with grants to improve the energy efficiency of their homes. The scheme, part of the State strategy to combat climate change, aims to retrofit 500,000 homes by 2030. Landlords can end tenancies if they plan to carry out a “substantial refurbishment” of the property. There is also an exemption available from the rules limiting rent increases in rent pressure zones (RPZ) if the landlord plans to make a “substantial change” to the property, including substantially improving its Building Energy Rating.  Sinn Féin TD Imelda Munster raised the issue during Thursday’s committee meeting and asked the RTB representatives if the new retrofit scheme will appeal to landlords as a means of circumventing RPZ regulations.RTB chairman Tom Dunne said it is a “very good question because clearly one of the reasons why you can ask a tenant to leave the accommodation is if the accommodation is in need of refurbishment”.He said: “If you give incentives to people who own property to bring the standards of insulation etc up. . . clearly a number of landlords may choose to undertake that work and in order to undertake it they may need to get the tenant out of the property. So that’s one of the issues that might arise because of that.”Ms Munster suggested it could add to the crisis in the rental sector and asked if the RTB had come across this issue as a result of previous retrofitting schemes. Mr Dunne said this had not been researched. “I don’t think there has been a scheme as extensive as this. There were always incentives from the sustainability organisations to incentivise people to insulate their houses. . . and I’ve never come across even anecdotally that being a problem. What I’m saying is it might become a problem now.”Mr Dunne said the issue came up at a recent meeting with Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien and “it is something that one needs to be thinking about”.The RTB later told the  that landlords can end tenancies if they want to carry out significant refurbishment but they must satisfy a number of criteria. These include stating if planning permission is required and the duration of the proposed works, and the notice of termination must contain a certificate from a registered professional stating that the proposed work poses a threat to a tenant’s health and safety.It said that once the works are complete the landlord must offer the property back to the original tenant.Senior officials from the RTB also faced questions over an information technology project - a tenancy management system - that was delayed and more than doubled in cost to €6.9 million. Comptroller \u0026amp Auditor General Séamus McCarthy outlined how the cost of the project at the end of 2020 was expected to be €5.2 million, which was some €1.9 million more than the originally budgeted €3.3 million. The project did not go live until last November, more than 18 months later than originally planned. RTB’s head of finance Bryan Kelly later told the meeting the full cost would be around €6.9 million. He defended the development process but said there were technical complexities including issues in transferring the data from defunct technology to the new system that had not been expected. Mr Dunne said the RTB’s board was “very concerned” about the project and has commissioned a study to be done on it by Mazars. Mr Dunne replied: “It’s an understatement to say that those lessons have been learned.” He said one of the biggest is that “IT projects are troublesome to say the very least”.The RTB said the new system is “performing well” and it is “confident it will accommodate the significant uplift in activity which the new Annual Registrations regime will introduce - expected to be a tripling of tenancy registration volumes”.

Video: European Commission British foreign secretary Liz Truss arrives at Downing Street on Thursday morning for  an emergency meeting to discuss the UK response to the crisis in Ukraine. Photograph: Jeff J MitchellGetty ImagesThe European Union has vowed to unleash unprecedented sanctions against Russia as leaders head for Brussels for an emergency summit in response to the invasion of Ukraine. The prospect of cutting Russia off from the international banking system is on the table as well as blocking its supply of crucial electrical components in a bid to force Moscow to change course.A group of EU member states that border Russia have called for Nato to convene to consider a collective response, warning that Russia’s actions are a threat to them.Some EU national leaders had wavered about imposing such sanctions for fear of the price that EU economies would also pay, and concerns over the continent’s reliance on imports of Russian gas at a time when costs are already high and supplies short.But the strikes on targets in across the country including Ukraine’s capital Kyiv and advance of Russian troops over the borders is said to have hardened EU resolve and forged unity among the 27 as their ambassadors convened in Brussels to prepare a response early on Thursday.“These are among the darkest hours for Europe since the end of World War Two. A major nuclear power has attacked a neighbour country, and is threatening reprisals on any other states that may come to its rescue,” the EU’s foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell Fontelles said in a hastily-convened address.“This is not only the greatest violation of international law, it’s a violation of the basic principles of human coexistence. It’s costing many lives, with unknown consequences ahead of us.He vowed that the EU would “respond in the strongest possible terms” with “the strongest package, the harshest package of sanctions we have ever implemented”, and that Russia’s leadership would face “unprecedented isolation”.“This is not a question of diplomatic power games, it’s a matter of life and death. It’s about the future of our global community and we will stand united,” he continued.Beyond sanctions, some EU member states that are members of Nato have called talks to consider a military response.Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland, which all border Russia, were once ruled by Moscow and fall within the area to which Russian President Vladimir Putin has said his country has a historical claim.All agreed to hold talks under Nato’s Article 4 on Thursday, according to a statement from the Estonian government. Article 4 provides for joint Nato consultations and potentially a response if any of its members feel “the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened”. It has been used six times since 1949.“Russia’s widespread aggression is a threat to the entire world and to all Nat0 countries,” Estonia’s prime minister Kaja Kallas said in a statement.‘Bloodshed and destruction’Boris Johnson has promised to respond decisively to what he described as Vladimir Putin’s choice of “a path of bloodshed and destruction” in Ukraine. Mr Johnson, who was woken up shortly after 4am with news of the Russian invasion, chaired an emergency Cobra meeting in Downing Street at 7.30am. “I am appalled by the horrific events in Ukraine and I have spoken to President Zelenskiy to discuss next steps. President Putin has chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction by launching this unprovoked attack on Ukraine. The UK and our allies will respond decisively,” he said. The British prime minister, who faced criticism for the weakness of sanctions he announced earlier this week, will unveil tougher measures later on Thursday. Labour leader Keir Starmer said Britain and Nato must respond decisively to Mr Putin’s actions, which he said would have “horrendous and tragic” consequences. “There can be no space for equivocation when faced with the evil that Putin has unleashed. His actions pose a grave threat to the international order on which we all depend. There will be dark days ahead. But Putin will learn the same lesson as Europe’s tyrants of the last century: that the resolve of the world is harder than he imagines and the desire for liberty burns stronger than ever. The light will prevail,” he said. “We must now match our rhetoric with action. We must urgently reinforce our Nato allies. The hardest possible sanctions must be taken against all those linked to Putin. The influence of Russian money must be extricated from the UK. And those who have for too long turned a blind eye to Russia’s actions must reckon with their own consciences.” Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, said that Britain and its allies should not be squeamish about imposing sanctions on Russia that will come at an economic cost to themselves. He said the cost of living crisis in western countries would get worse if Mr Putin is allowed to go unpunished for his action in Ukraine. “The decisions made around Europe are absolutely going to shape the way Vladimir Putin sees this,” he told the BBC. “The reality is that if we leave this to stand, if we let this pass, you can forget about petrol at £1.70 a litre, which is where it’s heading now. It will be significantly higher. 10 per cent of the world’s wheat is grown in Ukraine and the idea that this year’s going to be a good crop, I’m afraid, is for the birds. This is absolutely one of those moments where we’re going to see the cost-of-living crisis driven by war.” ‘Terrible day’German chancellor Olaf Scholz has condemned the Russian invasion as a “blatant breach of international law, that is in no way justifiable”.Mr Scholz has called an emergency meeting of the G7, of which Berlin is current head, before this evening’s emergency summit of EU leaders.“Our solidarity is with Ukraine and its people. Russia must stop this military action right now,” said Mr Scholz in a written statement. “It is a terrible day for Ukraine and a dark day for Europe.”German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said “the world community will not forget Russia’s day of shame”.On Wednesday night, Berlin city officials bathed the Brandenburg Gate in Ukraine’s national colours of blue and yellow.Polish president Andrzej Duda said that, “despite the efforts of the international community, Ukraine has fallen victim to a brutal, unprovoked and unjustified Russian attack”.“We will jointly respond to Russia’s brutal aggression and will not leave Ukraine without support,” he said, adding he had spoken to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenski just before 6am.Polish president Mateusz Morawiecki appealed to other EU leaders to approve the “fiercest possible sanctions” this evening. “Our support of Ukraine must be real,” he said.A Polish government spokesman confirmed the request under Article 4, allowing for consultations “whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened”.Latvian prime minister Krisjanis Karins also called for Article 4 consultations.“The Russian military aggression against Ukraine’s sovereignty, people and democracy is totally unacceptable,” he said. “It is Putin’s responsibility to end it immediately.”The Nato founding treaty’s Article 5 calls for collective defence measures after attack on any member of Nato, which does not include non-member Ukraine.Lithuania’s President Gitanas Nauseda has signed a decree calling for a state of emergency in his country, according to public broadcaster LRT.As members of Nato and the EU – but also the former eastern bloc - history and geography have made the three Baltic countries – Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia - and Poland particularly mindful of Russia’s intentions in the region.Last week Lithuania’s foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis warned: “The battle for Ukraine is a battle for Europe. If Putin is not stopped there, he will go further.”“ France firmly condemns the Russian decision to invade Ukraine,” President Emmanuel Macron tweeted. “Russia must put an end to its military operations immediately. France stands in solidarity with Ukraine. She is beside the Ukrainians and acts with her partners and allies for the war to end.” Mr Macron will participate in a G7 videoconference on Thursday afternoon and then go to Brussels for the summit of EU leaders to decide on “massive” sanctions against Moscow. The ambassadors of all 30 Nato members are to hold an emergency meeting in Brussels this morning.

Rents in the city are up by 16 per cent and in some boroughs  have increased by 30 per cent. Photograph: Getty ImagesTim was trying to showcase the soundproofing effect of an extra sliding panel on the bedroom window but as he yanked and pushed from every angle he could think of, it remained resolutely stuck halfway across.“There’s a few bits and pieces that need fixing,” he said.He had used the same words a few minutes earlier as he pointed to a missing knob on a kitchen drawer, ignoring the cracked, discoloured sink next to it and the broken fan above. I was fairly sure I didn’t want to live in this dark, poky and rather grubby flat but it did have one thing going for it: it was available.When I heard a few weeks ago that I had two months to leave my current place, my first response was to ignore it, hoping for the date to be deferred until something turned up unbidden. I sidled up to the porter, asking him if he knew of anyone moving out of the building so that I could minimise the disruption and avoid the trouble of changing address.He had a hot lead on a flat one floor below me with a slightly better view but when I called the agent, he told me it had gone within a couple of days of going up on the website. I looked at a place across the square, led through his bedroom by the current tenant as he picked up clothes strewn across the floor but it soon became clear that I would have to look further afield.The scale of the challenge took shape right away when Angelika took me on a lightning tour of a large flat in a gated community, available immediately for a king’s ransom. She told me that if I was interested, I had better get an offer in right away because it was likely to go quickly, possibly at above the listed price.“This month last year I had 100 properties to let around here. Now I have 16,” she said.Grim reportsWhenever I saw something promising, a friend would warn me that the innocent-looking building I was considering was a thriving hub for sex work or had some other unwelcome distinction. One handsome old building overlooking the river had three flats available but its charm dimmed when I heard about an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease there two years ago and grim reports about its ancient infrastructure.I thought I had struck gold when Mario showed me a lovely, bright flat in an old-fashioned mansion block known locally as the Elephant’s Graveyard where I would have been among the younger residents. But before the viewing was over, he offered to show me another place “just in case”, which turned out to have all the character of a brightly lit lavatory in a half-empty shopping mall.During the pandemic, London estate agents reported a “doughnut” effect as people left the city centre for the outer suburbs, looking for bigger homes to work from. Executives renting a pied à terre in central London found they no longer needed it during lockdown and at the other end of the scale, students went home to their parents as lectures went on Zoom.This time last year, rents in inner London were falling by an average of 10 per cent per annum as landlords found themselves with empty flats they were desperate to rent. Now they are up by 16 per cent and in some boroughs rents have increased by 30 per cent.The supply problem that Angelika identified is driven by a number of factors, including the reluctance to move out of tenants paying rents agreed during lockdown. But supply is squeezed further by a surge in landlords deciding to sell up, as mine has done after more than 20 years.A rising property market is one reason for landlords to sell and one estate agent suggested that some sales were driven by a need for cash as businesses found themselves in trouble during the pandemic. Angelika had a more interesting theory.“Everyone’s getting orced after the lockdown,” she said.In fact, there were fewer orces in England and Wales in 2020 than in the previous year although the suspension of family court sittings may conceal the true extent of marital unhappiness. Touring an attic flat a few days later, the estate agent told me that although the tenants had left, they had yet to remove all their belongings.“They broke up,” he said.“But they were very happy here.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"About 2.4 million forced to leave their homes during 13-year-long war with Boko HaramTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"bristol university students distressed shown recorded lectures","story":"University students have complained of their distress at receiving pre-recorded lectures from an academic before being informed that she had passed away.First year mathematics undergraduates at Bristol University were made to watch a series of pre-recorded lectures by Dr Lynne Walling, who had died suddenly some months earlier.Students are understood to have complained about their distress at finding out - several weeks into the term - that their lecturer was no longer alive.Ministers are understood to be concerned that universities are continuing to offer lectures digitally rather than in-person, despite official guidance stating that there is no longer any need for this.Many institutions have started to promote the benefits of “blended” or “hybrid” learning to undergraduates.One Bristol University student described how the vast majority of his lectures are still pre-recorded videos which are delivered online.“The lectures we are having this term and last term were pre-recorded last academic year,” he said. “This year they are recycling them again. It is a bit of a joke because Covid restrictions have stopped.”The student described how during the autumn term, one particular maths module was taught by Dr Walling.But undergraduates were not told that Dr Walling, who was the director of Bristol University’s Institute of Pure Mathematics, had in fact passed away suddenly last May after being diagnosed with terminal cancer.“They didn\u0027t really tell us for a while. Some people started to clock on and word spread, then they sent an email about half way through the term,” the student explained. “It feels quite disrespectful to be using her content in this way.”The University College Union (UCU), which represents academics, warned that universities must be “incredibly careful” about how they use pre-recorded lecturers.Nick Varney, the union’s official for the South West, said: “It will have been upsetting for students to belatedly realise the person teaching them had already passed away.“This unfortunate situation shows why universities need to be incredibly careful about how recorded lectures are used.”A Bristol University spokesperson said it is “regrettable” that some students were not “initially aware” that Dr Walling had passed before her online lectures were used in the autumn term.They said: “Dr Lynne Walling was an outstanding academic and teacher who was much loved by her students. This unique course was created by her and the materials she produced were used as part of the overall teaching provision which is led by an experienced academic lecturer.She very much wanted these to continue to be used and we are pleased to be able to honour her legacy in doing so.“We are delivering as much in-person learning as we safely can, including lectures, seminars, and laboratories on campus. We have retained some of the more effective elements of blended learning that have been well received by students.”Universities must be open about quantity of online learningEarlier this month, The  revealed that universities could be made to declare how much of their teaching will be online when they make offers to students, under plans being considered by the Government.Vice-chancellors have been warned that they must be open with prospective students about how much face-to-face learning their course will entail.The Department for Education has started drawing up plans which could see universities obliged to state on Ucas, the university admissions service, how extensive their in-person offering will be.This would mean that when students use the service to choose which course to accept, they will be clearly informed about the mode of teaching they can expect.More from NewsUkraine invasion latest: Russia looking to mass \u0026#39overwhelming forces\u0026#39 around Kyiv‘It’s a matter of life and death’: Ukrainian expats head home to fight RussiaGhislaine Maxwell granted rare post-verdict inquiry into whether juror failed to disclose sexual abuseBBC accused of giving Vladimir Putin politician a ‘propaganda’ platformChina denies Russia has invaded Ukraine amid fears of a tipping point to new world orderLabour MPs withdraw backing for Stop the War letter criticising Nato over Ukraine crisisMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"horror zoombombing pushing jewish life underground","story":"We were 10 minutes into my synagogue’s Zoom quiz when it was interrupted with a horrific display of child sexual abuse, with images I will never be able to unsee.It was May 2020 and that very same evening a friend told me her mother had been distraught when an online shiva, the Jewish mourning period after burial, for her relative had been disrupted with images of swastikas and people shouting “Heil Hitler”.I soon discovered that what we had experienced was Zoombombing, when internet vandals hijack video calls with offensive material. And this week I learnt these online attacks helped fuel a record high of anti-Semitic incidents in the UK last year.The Community Security Trust (CST), a charity that monitors anti-Semitism, recorded 2,255 anti-Jewish hate incidents in 2021, the highest number it has ever recorded, and a 34 per cent increase from 2020. Of these, 173 were violent assaults and 16 were Zoombombings, contributing to 552 online anti-Semitic incidents overall in 2021.“Before the pandemic, we’d never heard of Zoombombing but in the first week of lockdown, two incidents were reported to us,” says CST policy director Dave Rich. “In normal times, you can’t wander into a synagogue or a Jewish community event because there’s security on the door. Moving communal life online meant people had access to Jews in a way they hadn’t previously.”As a result, my tiny community of 280,000 or so has had to learn to treat online events as if they were physical ones. When Rich says “security on the door” he refers to the guards we have employed to protect our schools, our community centres and synagogues for as long as anyone can remember. We are more than used to looking out for ourselves.After my synagogue quiz was Zoombombed, my rabbi reported the incident to the CST, the police and Zoom, and cyber security was tightened. And it was far from relaxed before. Now the time and dates of our meetings, our ID and links are only shared on the community’s weekly email and a private Facebook group, which is tightly monitored.Cyber-security expert James Bore says: “Whatever precautions we take, Facebook remains a pressing problem. It takes just one post from someone who has not bothered to set their privacy settings properly for information about a private or communal event to get out.”Or, as Rich puts it: “It’s the online equivalent of leaving the door open.”But even if you are careful about your privacy settings, or limit certain posts to certain people, some of your so-called friends might have fake profiles, says Bore. “When people want to target particular groups, they will often create a fake profile, post some reasonable stuff and then sit back and quietly gather information.”And once they have the information they want, it is a short step to Zoombombing. “It takes very little technical knowledge I could teach someone how to do it in five minutes. You just need some virtual camera software, a nasty video and the link to the event you want to disrupt,” says Bore.So easy, in fact, that while Jews have been a particular target for Zoombombers, anyone can fall victim to the malice. In America the problem became so widespread, the FBI issued a warning about it in March 2020. The pernicious phenomenon was particularly acute in virtual classrooms and lecture halls where the n-word appeared on screens and racist slurs were made against black students. In these shores, child abuse videos have interrupted corporate meetings, gym sessions, online cheese-and-wine tasting events and support group videos for people giving up alcohol, after meeting details were shared on social media.Because not all Zoombombing stems from racist and extremist views. “I hate to say it, but some people disrupt online events because they think it’s funny,” says Bore.But when Jews and other minority groups are targeted, it is with the specific intention of causing them harm, he says. “These people are trying to hurt and upset it’s not that different from stopping someone in the street and screaming in their face. It’s emotional violence.”Although the attackers generally use the language and tactics of the far Right, they aren’t usually known extremists or members of established far-Right groups, says Rich. “They shout ‘Heil Hitler’ because they know that’s what you shout at Jews. In the main, these people are anti-social trolls rather than formal groups people who are already caught up in online troll culture”They are also mostly single men under the age of 30 who have problems operating socially, says Bore. “And they tend to think everyone hates them. It makes them particularly susceptible to Facebook’s algorithms, which are built to encourage people to lean towards ever-increasing emotional and extreme content because that’s what creates discussion and engagement on the platform.”Plus, you get outpourings of admiration on Facebook, or “love-bombing” as it has been dubbed, which for social misfits can be very powerful. “You’re someone who gets criticised for your out-there opinions. You go on Facebook and your network tells you what you said what was right. They say you’re being criticised because you are telling the truth, and they feed you more information about Jews or other minority groups. It’s one way people become extremists.”Meanwhile, for those of us who have experienced anti-Semitic Zoombombing, it feels like a new and powerful way to spread the hate in a year that was already very difficult for Jews in Britain. The record-high tally of anti-Semitic incidents last year included Islamic State-style convoys sweeping across north London blasting “F*** the Jews, rape their daughters” on loudspeakers, and the highest volume of university-related hate ever recorded, half of it erupting during and after the Israel-Gaza conflict in MayAfter the first few incidents of Zoombombing were reported to the CST, the charity acted quickly, producing online security guidance information that it disseminated across the Jewish community and also shared with other ethnic and minority ethnic groups. “It happens less than it did at the beginning of the pandemic, but there are still cases and as long as parts of Jewish communal life remains online, I’m sure they will continue,” says Rich. “Once anti-Semites discover a new tactic, they keep trying it.”In fact, Manchester Reform Synagogue – where Ridley Road, the television drama about Jewish opposition to British fascism in the 1960s, was filmed – was Zoombombed as recently as October. “Halfway through our Friday night service, during a song about liberation, the intruders started shouting and put a swastika and other dreadful racist images on the screen,” says Rabbi Robyn Ashworth-Steen. “We kicked them out immediately, but they kept trying to get back in. We were very shaken by the incident – and we are used to seeing far-Right gatherings near the synagogue and receiving anti-Semitic phone calls. But this made us feel particularly violated.”Which is of course exactly what the Zoombombers want. “It is a very effective way of causing disruption and upset,” says Bore. “We can’t say exactly how many people are involved in Zoombombing, but we can say that unless there is legislation to make social companies act more responsibly, be more accountable, it is not going to go away.”More from NewsUkraine invasion latest: Russia looking to mass \u0026#39overwhelming forces\u0026#39 around Kyiv‘It’s a matter of life and death’: Ukrainian expats head home to fight RussiaGhislaine Maxwell granted rare post-verdict inquiry into whether juror failed to disclose sexual abuseBBC accused of giving Vladimir Putin politician a ‘propaganda’ platformChina denies Russia has invaded Ukraine amid fears of a tipping point to new world orderLabour MPs withdraw backing for Stop the War letter criticising Nato over Ukraine crisisMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"could beginning end vladimir putin","story":"More from News‘It’s a matter of life and death’: Ukrainian expats head home to fight RussiaUkraine invasion latest: Russia looking to mass \u0026#39overwhelming forces\u0026#39 around KyivGhislaine Maxwell granted rare post-verdict inquiry into whether juror failed to disclose sexual abuseBBC accused of giving Vladimir Putin politician a ‘propaganda’ platformChina denies Russia has invaded Ukraine amid fears of a tipping point to new world orderLabour MPs withdraw backing for Stop the War letter criticising Nato over Ukraine crisisMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"last university tanker turned","story":"Progressive people are, rightly, keen to challenge the way that decision-makers unconsciously promote their own kind. But they have been blind to the way those decision-makers have spent 30 years promoting just one kind of post-school education, namely the classical model of full-time, academic-generalist three-year university degrees aimed at 18-year-olds.Mass higher education was supposed to mean higher productivity and a more tolerant, socially mobile society. Teachers favoured it and parents saw it as the route to success for their children. It was administratively simple, with universities providing courses students wanted, underpinned by a generous state loan system. But now we have reached Tony Blair’s goal of half of school leavers at university, the unintended consequences of this model have become unbearable. The Government is today announcing sanctions for poor quality university courses, a rejigging of student finance so more will repay their loans, and a renewed focus on non-academic technical and digital courses.The great rebalancing of post-school education and training is under way. And not a moment too soon. We need our great research universities to flourish and must continue to attract foreign students. But from under-providing higher education in the 1980s we are now oversupplying it and the consequences are economic, social and political.The labour market is flooded with academic-generalists when their professional-managerial jobs have, with some exceptions, stopped growing. One third of graduates are not in graduate jobs 10 years after graduating while we have a chronic shortage of “missing middle” technical skills, and a recruitment crisis in care.Employers have noticed that the signalling system that meant someone with a degree had a high level of general academic ability no longer applies. There is a switch to hiring school leavers supported by the Government’s lifetime skills guarantee and other measures. Parents, too, no longer assume that a degree is a ticket to security according to recent polls, (though many young people still like the idea of three years away from home subsidised by taxpayers).Socially, some people from disadvantaged backgrounds have risen up via university into the elite, but that happened before mass higher education, too. As recently as the late 1980s, when only 20 per cent of school leavers went to university, most professionals didn’t have degrees and completed on-the-job training combined with part-time study.Social mobility academics say mass higher education has, if anything, slowed mobility because universities are monopolised by the middle and upper-middle classes. And because of our mainly residential system, many of the brightest kids from declining areas leave home and never return. This graduatenon-graduate schism contributed to Brexit.What has been called “elite over-production” produces two sets of losers: those who didn’t go to university in the first place who see all the prizes reserved for graduates, and the bottom part of the graduate class who aren’t getting the high-status jobs they expected. Educated people tend to be more extreme and more ideological in their thinking: mass higher education plus social media equals a more intolerant political culture.Turning the tanker will take time. Record numbers are still heading to university and government sanctions will be easy to avoid. But many of the newer universities are likely to revert to something like their old polytechnic status, offering vocational and technical courses (as they already do) on a more flexible basis, to a broader age cohort of students. I would also like to see a sharp reduction in the 40 per cent of jobs that are advertised as graduate-only, which artificially sustains many courses. There are plenty of capable people who didn’t do well at exams and who, in recent years, have found themselves squeezed out of professional careers in which they could have flourished.Going to university was always partly a copy-cat status game. Rising pay levels for skilled trades and technical occupations is now shifting ideas of status, as is the rise of what James Kirkup has called the posh apprenticeship. When, for all but the most academically inclined, not going to university is cooler than going, rebalancing will be unstoppable.More from NewsUkraine invasion latest: Russia looking to mass \u0026#39overwhelming forces\u0026#39 around Kyiv‘It’s a matter of life and death’: Ukrainian expats head home to fight RussiaGhislaine Maxwell granted rare post-verdict inquiry into whether juror failed to disclose sexual abuseBBC accused of giving Vladimir Putin politician a ‘propaganda’ platformChina denies Russia has invaded Ukraine amid fears of a tipping point to new world orderLabour MPs withdraw backing for Stop the War letter criticising Nato over Ukraine crisisMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"russia has triggered return existential dread","story":"If the BBC was fuelling the sense of foreboding that, once again, seems to permeate modern life, it was compounded by the man of the hour himself. Vladimir Putin’s blood-curdling rhetoric belied the assessment some had of the Russian leader as a pragmatic master-strategist. Here, it seemed, was a barking-mad demagogue intent on conquest.As the T-64 battle tanks rumbled forwards and SU-27 fighters screamed over the port of Odesa, he said: “Whoever would try to stop us and further create threats to our country, to our people, should know that Russia’s response will be immediate and lead you to such consequences that you have never faced in your history. We are ready for any outcome.”Watching this tragedy unfold were our poor children. They have spent the past two years terrified that their parents or grandparents will be killed by a virus they are blamed for spreading, even if does not affect them much. They are assailed daily by predictions of imminent climate disaster. And now they are faced with wild talk of a Third World War.We must hope such predictions are wide of the mark, and they surely are, but the fear is real enough. Helen, a 56-year-old mother of four from north London, recounted how her daughter, 16, had called down from her upstairs bedroom about the Russian threat. “She had been reading a website that recommended building a fireproof shelter in the event of a nuclear strike and was wondering if we should get some materials. She was quite serious. We didn’t know what to say.”Helen says: “Like many of her friends, she became terribly anxious during Covid, fearful that she might infect us or her gran – and now this. You want to say everything will be fine, but they are not daft.”Others fear this will end with their sons conscripted to fight the third full-scale European war in just over 100 years. One mother said: “It brought to life all those documentaries they watch about the Second World War. They were also listening to the sirens and wondering whether there are sirens set up around London – Kyiv doesn’t look that dissimilar to them, so it all feels very real. And hopeless: they can see it’s a David vs Goliath situation, so listening to people in Kyiv talking about defending themselves and their families feels heartbreaking.”To be fair to our political leaders, they had been predicting this eventuality for weeks, even being accused by Putin apologists of “war-mongering”, despite 150,000 troops amassed on the frontier rather giving the game away.Because so many in the West do not trust what their governments say about anything, the invasion warnings issued by Joe Biden and Boris Johnson were given short shrift. But for once, our intelligence was on the money.That the invasion came as such a shock is partly down to a sense, developed over years of peace, that such things just don’t happen in Europe anymore, even though they did relatively recently in the Balkans.When Moscow was the centre of the Soviet Union, things were simpler, if just as scary. The Cold War was as much an ideological as a territorial conflict. The communists wanted to spread their creed around the globe the free, capitalist West wanted to stop them. We won.During the Cold War, we lived under the constant threat of nuclear obliteration as the two sides built up an ever greater capacity to wipe out humanity 10 times over. Terms such as “nuclear winter” and “Mutually Assured Destruction” (or MAD) were part of everyday conversations. Films like Dr Strangelove told of deranged generals taking over nuclear bases, sending bombers to drop their payloads on Moscow and triggering a response that wiped out life on Earth.The Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 came close to pushing the world over this precipice and has parallels with today. The US objected to the presence of Soviet missile bases on an island a few hundred miles from Florida, just as Putin has long resented Nato pushing up to the threshold of Russia.President Kennedy threatened a nuclear war, forcing Nikita Khrushchev to back down. In 1983, Soviet radar picked up the launch of American intercontinental ballistic missiles against Russia and, had it not been for the scepticism of a Red Army general, could have led to a retaliation, plunging the world into war. The Soviet early warning system had malfunctioned and we came close to Armageddon.Throughout the Sixties and Seventies, nuclear war, not climate change or pandemics, was what kept most of us awake at night – but it never seemed a real threat because the price was terminal for everyone. We were told we had four minutes to prepare for oblivion if an attack was launched. One public information film suggested taping brown paper to the windows, though why was never made clear.Fear of a nuclear holocaust abated with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990. Although the stockpiles were retained, no one seriously thought we would end up using them. There has never been anyone insane enough to contemplate it. We can only hope there still isn’t.Previous generations had their own nightmares. When the Second World War began in September 1939, nothing much happened in the west while Germany and Russia carved up Poland between them and the Wehrmacht moved towards Ukraine. The months of so-called Phoney War offered hope that Hitler’s ambitions lay elsewhere, until May 1940 shattered that illusion. In August 1914, on the cusp of the Great War, the threat was hardly mentioned in British newspapers that were more preoccupied with goings-on in Ireland.Surely by now we had learned our lessons.Yet rather than seeking to incorporate Russia into the comity of nations, there was an element of western triumphalism that rankled with nationalists like Putin, and a loss of land they were determined to reclaim at some point. That point has come.For the greatest part of man’s existence war, famine, privation, plague and misery have been ever present. Covid notwithstanding, none of these has been visited on us in the West for two or three generations. We have forgotten the fear and alarm they can generate.But we should also acknowledge that we are still the lucky ones. The real war is more than 2,000 miles away, and its victims are the 44 million people who live in a vast and fertile country long known as the “breadbasket of Europe”.The shock there is palpable. Many had thought Russia was bluffing. As the reality dawned, people who were able to fled westwards, jamming the highways, while those who stayed queued for food and drained the banks of cash. A few tried to carry on as normal and went to work. One resident moaned: “The only unusual thing is that you can’t find a taxi.” Such stoical resistance may yet give the Russians a bloody nose, as the Afghans 40 years ago.Ukrainians will fight for their land so if people here feel dread and apprehension, think of them. The wail of air raid sirens, a sound that once chilled the blood of millions of Europeans, is once more echoing in the streets of Kyiv and Kharkiv. Not for the first time, the forward march of history has slammed on the brakes and gone into reverse.Somehow we must find the words to address and soothe the very real fears of our children.More from NewsUkraine invasion latest: Russia looking to mass \u0026#39overwhelming forces\u0026#39 around Kyiv‘It’s a matter of life and death’: Ukrainian expats head home to fight RussiaGhislaine Maxwell granted rare post-verdict inquiry into whether juror failed to disclose sexual abuseBBC accused of giving Vladimir Putin politician a ‘propaganda’ platformChina denies Russia has invaded Ukraine amid fears of a tipping point to new world orderLabour MPs withdraw backing for Stop the War letter criticising Nato over Ukraine crisisMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"11 labour mps face suspension","story":" Labour MPs threatened with suspension for signing Stop The War letter attacking NATOOne Labour source warned the left wingers they “can be a mouthpiece for the Kremlin or a Labour MP, but not both”Shadow Foreign Secretary David Lammy, Labour Party leader Keir Starmer and Shadow Chancellor Angela Rayner Image: REUTERSByRachel WearmouthSenior Political Correspondent:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |comments Labour MPs who signed a Stop The War Coalition letter slamming NATO and accusing the UK of sabre rattling over Ukraine face being suspended, the Mirror understands. Some  Labour MPs signed the open letter by the left-wing campaign group, which questioned NATOaposs legitimacy and accused the defensive alliance of eastward expansion.It also claimed the UK Government of having no proposals for a diplomatic solution to the crisis and says Britain needs to change its policy, and start working for peace, not confrontation. The partyaposs chief whip Sir Alan Campbell has contacted the  MPs warning them they faced losing the party whipthey do not back down. It is understood all  asked for their signatures to be removed as a result. It comes as Russian troops advance towards Ukraineaposs capital of Kiev and news that Moscow forces had taken the former nuclear plant of Chernobyl.A Labour source told the Mirror: “You can be a mouthpiece for the Kremlin or a Labour MP. But not both.”The letter was signed by former frontbenchers Diane Abbott, John McDonnell, Richard Burgon and Ian Lavery, as well as Beth Winter, Zarah Sultana, Bell Ribeiro-Addy, Apsana Begum, Mick Whitley, Tahir Ali, and Ian Mearns.Two independent MPs - former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Claudia Webbe - also signed the letter.It comes as more than  have been killed after Moscow launched a brutal invasion of Ukraine by land, sea and air. NATO general-secretary Jens Stoltenberg described the assault as a deliberate, cold-blooded and long-planned invasion” by Putin.  Several Western governments, including the UKaposs, have spent days urging the Russian President not to launch an assault on its neighbour, as Putin spread disinformation and amassed , troops at the border. Despite Putinaposs assault on Ukraine, the letter calls for a diplomatic solution, and adds STW believes NATO should call a halt to its eastward expansion and commit to a new security deal for Europe which meets the needs of all states and peoples. The letter says: We refute the idea that NATO is a defensive alliance, and believe its record in Afghanistan, Yugoslavia and Libya over the last generation, not to mention the US-British attack on Iraq, clearly proves otherwise.  Boris Johnson told the Commons the UK was bringing forward the largest and most severe package of sanctions that Russia has ever seen. The Prime Minister told MPs “this hideous and barbarous venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure” as he revealed London will now target all major Russian banks, five oligarchs and more than  companies and iniduals. Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer said in a TV address on Thursday that Vladimir Putin’s “bandit rule” must fail.He said it “must be a turning point in our history, adding: We must look back and say that this terrible day was actually when Putin doomed himself to defeat. “He seeks ision, so we must stay united. He hopes for inaction, so we must take a stand. He believes that we are too corrupted to do the right thing, so we must prove him wrong.

The Prime Minister is expected to scrap all self-isolation, even for people who have the virus, from around Thursday. He is also likely to confirm the date free lateral flow and PCR tests will be axed - although is not expected to actually happen this week. The £ self-isolation payment for low-income workers and legal powers for councils both face being scrapped. And the Mirror understands he was weighing up whether to axe sick pay from day one of Covid isolation, despite fury from unions and Labour. Scroll down for the full guide to the changes - or join the debate in the commentsFor holidaymakers, Passenger Locator Forms could be simplied further, or even scrapped completelyTransport Secretary Grant Shapps gets his way.Travel testing, however, is likely to stay for unvaccinated people entering the UK for the foreseeable future. Mr Johnson is likely to give a statement to Parliament at around .pm on Monday. He could also give a press conference. Facing pressure from Tory MPs over his leadership, the PM has decided Britain has had all the restrictions it can tolerate. Speaking before his announcement on Monday, the Prime Minister said: Today will mark a moment of pride after one of the most dficult periods in our countryaposs history as we begin to learn to live with Covid. It would not be possible without the efforts of so many - the NHS who delivered the le-saving vaccine rollout at phenomenal speed, our world-leading scientists and experts, and the general public for their commitment to protecting themselves and their loved ones. The pandemic is not over but thanks to the incredible vaccine rollout we are now one step closer towards ato normality and finally giving people back their freedoms while continuing to protect ourselves and others.It comes after ministers confirmed all children over five will be able to get the Covid vaccine from April. But charities worry millions of vulnerable or immunocompromised Brits will be thrown to the wolves with little support.And the governmentaposs own scientic advisors have warned ending testing and isolation could trigger a rapid rise in cases. Here’s everything we know about what is likely to be announced.Self-isolation laws scrappedLegal Covid self-isolation is due to be scrapped - evenyou currently have the virus - from as soon as Thursday  February. The decision will end almost exactly two years of legally-enforced isolation for people who test positive. But it raises ethical dilemmas about whether to go to work and put others at risk, especiallyyou can no longer claim a £ isolation payment or sick pay from day one . Despite scrapping legal isolation, No said: “We’re not saying isolation is pointless. We’d expect anyone with an infectious disease to take steps not to spread that disease further - a colleague at work with flu, for example. Currently people who test positive must go into self-isolation for at least five full days in England, a period that has been repeatedly cut from  days and seven days. Fears Statutory Sick Pay will be stripped back Boris Johnson has been weighing up whether to scrap sick pay from day one of Covid illness, the Mirror understands.£.-a-week Statutory Sick Payis usually only available from the fourth day of any illness, after three ‘waiting days’ are complete. This was cut to the first day in  for people isolating due to Covid. Ministers said the move was “vital” to ensure people get help and follow the rules.But the power is contained in the Coronavirus Act, which is currently due to expire on March .That means it could be removed, even though No has advised people who are sick with the virus to stay away from work. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “It’s vital that sick pay remains a day one right and is made available to all. Workers who are laid low by Covid must be able to make ends meet – not pushed into financial hardship.”A date for scrapping free lateral flow testsBoris Johnson’s plan is expected to set a timetable for the end of free lateral flow tests, with people having to pay instead.The government warned last summer it would eventually stop paying for these rapid tests due to the huge cost of the NHS.Sources told the Mirror that claims the tests themselves will end this week are wide of the mark. However, the Living with Covid plan could set a date in the future for when they are cut off. It’s not known how much lateral flow tests will cost, but estimates have put it at £ for a pack of seven. A date for scrapping free PCR tests and Test and TraceIt’s thought the plan may contain a date for ending free ‘gold standard’ PCR tests as England’s Covid infrastructure is wound down. Whitehall sources told thethe Treasury is trying to cut the £bn-a-year cost, which will mean having to phase out free testing and all but ending the contact-tracing system. Scientists have raised the alarm about ending these free tests, with reports suggesting they could cost £ each privately. According to reports, only health and social care workers and .million vulnerable people will continue to get free PCRs. Prof Lawrence Young of Warwick University said: “Living with Covid doesn’t mean letting our guard down”. Covid travel Passenger Locator Form could be simplied or axed Fully-vaccinated people entering the UK do not need to take any Covid tests, under changes that happened on February . But they still need to fill in a Passenger Locator Form - albeit a ‘simplied’ one - and further changes to this are possible in this week’s Covid plan. It’s understood the Department for Transport was pressing to further simply the Passenger Locator Form - or get rid of it completely. It is thought there was only a slim chance of the form being axed altogether, as health officials were still worried about needing to track new iants coming in to the UK. Meanwhile, unvaccinated people still need to take one pre-departure test and one post-arrival test before entering the UK. It’s understood this rule will stay for the foreseeable future and no changes to it are due this week. £ self-isolation payment could be scrappedThe £ self-isolation payment for poor workers with Covid could end as the legal requirement to quarantine is scrapped. The Test and Trace Support Payment was introduced in September  to help low-wage workers afford to self-isolate for up to  days. No final decisions have been announced yet over the future of the £ payment, and its status was being considered by the government last week.  Legal powers for councils will goLegal changes will end remaining powers councils had under the  Coronavirus Act in England to close some venues. However, these powers were barely ever used, because powers for lockdowns flow from a separate law passed in . And the vast majority of Coronavirus Act powers - including on detention, events, gatherings, shops and restaurants and schools - already expired in September . Only a few of the more draconian powers - including the power to suspend port operations - remained in the Act. Vaccines for all children over five All children over five will be able to get vaccinated against Covid- from April. The “non-urgent offer” to the parents of nearly six million - year olds was confirmed by the Government moments after advice issued by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation . Two smaller doses of the Pfizer jab,  weeks apart, will be available to this age group to help control future Covid waves after Covid curbs have been lted. It is understood there are no plans for a major publicity drive to encourage this age group to be vaccinated and it will be left very much up to parents to decide. Itaposs understood a rollout for over-s will be less urgent than previous vaccine drives, due to the very low risk Covid poses to younger kids. The idea is that ordinary NHS care shouldn’t be interrupted to give kids the jab, like it was for adults. All children over  have been able to get the Pfizer Covid jab since September last year. Currently, only the most vulnerable kids aged  to  are eligible. They are offered two jabs but at a lower dose than for adults -  micrograms instead of .

The Prime Minister unveiled a -point financial plan which has been on the drawing board for months as war ed to Europe.London will target all major Russian banks and firms, ban Aeroflot from landing flights in Britain, and target exports and five super-rich oligarchs with links to Putin. A diplomatic source said: “They come to Harrods to shop, they stay in our best hotels when they like, they send their children to our best public schools, and that is whataposs being stopped. “So that these people are essentially persona non grata in every major Western European capital in the world. That really bites.” Boris Johnson also wants to limit the amount Russians can hold in UK bank accounts, and shut them off from SWIFT bank payments. UK officials believe the measures will knock whole percentage points off Russia’s GDP. Vowing “a remorseless mission to squeeze Russia from the global economy”, the PM said Russian stocks are down % or bn and the rouble at record lows against the dollar. Many of today’s measures were agreed by the G, which issued a joint statement blasting Russia’s “serious violation of international law”. Some are immediate with others in the coming days. But despite the PM pledging sanctions “the moment the first Russian toecap crosses further into Ukrainian territory”, not all the measures today are agreed yet. And they come days after Mr Johnson already announced sanctions against five banks and three oligarchs, only for Russia to invade anyway. He admitted: “We’ve learned a bitter lesson about to deal with Vladimir Putin”. The sanctions are enforced with fines and enforcement through the Treasury, Home Office and National Crime Agency. Mr Johnson pledged a new ‘Kleptocracy Cell’ to “target sanctions evasion and corrupt Russian assets hidden in the UK”.  But others raise questions about how often sanctions are enforced. And there are fears within government that wealthy Russians could mount legal challenges. The Henry Jackson Society branded the action regrettably paltry and tantamount to fiddling while Kiev burns. So what has actually been announced  Here is the -point plan in full. - Asset freeze against Russian banksBoris Johnson announced an immediate asset freeze from today against Russia’s second-largest bank VTB, with assets of £bn. He said the measure will “stop them from accessing Sterling and clearing payments through the UK.” However, this will only “match the power the US already has”, the Foreign Office said. Banks subject to this measure will be unable to process any payments through the UK or have access to UK financial markets. The UK’s intention is to impose a similar asset freeze against all major Russian banks, after five were sanctioned earlier this week.  - Targeting Russian media, energy and other firmsLegislation will be introduced on Tuesday banning all major Russian firms from raising finance on UK markets. It is understood eight sectors will be in scope, including media - suggesting Russian broadcaster Russia Today could be hit. It will also prevent major Russian firms raising finance in the UK energy market. Though it was not immediately clear how far the sanctions would, for example, restrict state-owned gas giant Gazprom. Boris Johnson claimed: “These powers will enable us to ban Russian state and private companies from raising funds in the UK, banning dealing with their securities and making loans to them.” This is in addition to banning the Russian state itself from raising funds in the UK, the Foreign Office said.  - Asset freezes on firms and five oligarchsToday’s announcement targets five major defence firms and five new oligarchs with links to Vladimir Putin, on top of three hit earlier this week. The elite iniduals are:Kirill Shamalov, Russia’s youngest billionaire, who was married to Putinaposs second daughter, Katerina Tikhonova, and a former economic adviser to the Kremlin. Petr Fradkov, CEO of Promsvyazbank, and son of the former boss of the FSB. Denis Bortnikov, deputy president of the state-owned VTB Bank. Yury Slyusar, director of United Aircraft Corporation. Elena Aleksandrovna Georgieva, the chairwoman of the board of Novicom bank, which bankrolls Rostec . They do NOT include Cha FC owner Roman Abramovich after Boris Johnson wrongly said he was being targeted.No sanctioned Russian can travel to Britain, no UK inidual or firm can transact with them, and their assets in the UK are frozen. However, their children can still attend UK schools - eventheir parents can’t meet in the holidays - as family members aren’t hit.  More oligarchs will be sanctioned in the coming weeks. Boris Johnson said: “Overall we will be imposing asset freezes on over more  new entities and iniduals on top of the hundreds we’ve already announced. This includes all the major manufacturers that support Putin’s war machine.” Around  of the ‘’ are Rostec, Russia’s biggest defence firm with over million employees and annual arms exports over £bn, and its dozens of subsidiaries. There are four other major defence firms on the list:Tactical Missile Corporation, described as Russia’s leading supplier of air and sea missiles which played a leading role in its build up of forces against Ukraine. Uralvagonzavod, one of the world’s largest tank manufacturers. United Shipbuilding Corporation: The largest shipbuilding company in Russia. It constructed a number of the key Russian warships, including three Ivan Gren-Class Landing Ships that redeployed to the Black Sea earlier in February . United Aircraft Corporation: A holding company that includes all major Russian aircraft manufacturers, including MiG  Sukhoi. It supplies key Russian military aircraft used as part of Russia’s military build-up.  - Russian airlines banned from landing in the UKBoris Johnson announced plans to ban state-owned Russian flag carrier Aeroflot from landing in the UK. Russia’s national airline Aeroflot has also been banned from UK airspace entirely.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps later confirmed: “Iaposve signed restrictions prohibiting all scheduled Russian airlines from entering UK airspace or touching down on British soil.“Putinaposs heinous actions will not be ignored, and we will never tolerate those who put people’s lives in danger.”  - Bans on exports of ‘dual-use items’ to RussiaThe UK will suspend and ban all dual-use export licences to Russia. This includes electrical components that could be used in military computers, or parts that could be used in military trucks. Boris Johnson said they include a “range of high-end and critical technological equipment and components in sectors including electronics, telecommunications, and aerospace.” The trade sanctions were intended to be imminent but Boris Johnson said laws to implement them will be laid “early next week”. - Ban on range of high-tech exports to RussiaSimilarly, within days the UK will publish laws that ban exports in high-tech sectors and minerals, metals, natural gas and oil. These will be aligned closely to the approach taken by the White House. Boris Johnson claimed: “These trade sanctions will constrain Russia’s military-industrial and technological capabilities for years to come.”  - Limit on Russians’ UK bank balances - but it’s not agreed yetThe PM announced: “We will limit the amount of money that Russian nationals will be able to deposit in their UK bank accounts.” But it’s understood officials are only looking at introducing this legislation and a full timescale is not yet pinned down. It will cover all Russians but be aimed at the wealthiest. That is because there’ll be a set limit on how much these people can hold in a UK bank account - but that limit isn’t decided. It’s also not yet knownit will hit dual British-Russian nationals, after headlines about wealthy donors to the Tory party. - Hope to shut off Russia’s access to SWIFT - but world might not agreeBoris Johnson intends to shut off Russian access to the SWIFT system that enables global payments between banks. This would be a huge blow to the Moscow elite’s ability to move their money around the world. But this can only be down with the G and NATO members’ agreement, with No admitting we recognise it is a challenge”. It is also not clearany ban would involve all Russian people and entities or just the most wealthy.  - The same sanctions will be imposed on Belarus“Sanctions will also be applied to Belarus for its role in the assault on Ukraine,” Boris Johnson said. It’s understood the full range of sanctions listed above will be also extended to Belarus. UK officials took the decision based on the country’s integration with the Russian military, and on top of existing Belarus sanctions. - A U-turn on the Economic Crime BillBoris Johnson will finally speed up measures in his long-awaited Economic Crime Bill after months of protest from MPs. It had only been due in the next session of Parliament, but now some measures will be brought forward before the Easter recess. The PM’s official spokesman said: “Before Easter recess we will bring forward legislation previously intended for the Economic Crime Bill to strengthen unexplained wealth orders, to take action against kleptocrats who launder funds in the UK.” Agencies will have “longer to act in targeting iniduals and reduce their exposure to some of the legal costs” of going after these iniduals, he added. Labour had condemned the failure to bring forward the Bill and it was a factor in the resignation of Tory minister ordered Agnew.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonVladimir PutinForeign OfficeHome OfficePoliticsBillionairesRussia Ukraine war\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Labour leader called for an end to the failed approach to dealing with Mr Putinaposs regime - and said the British people must prepare for economic pain.In a sombre televised address, Mr Starmer warned of the horrendous and tragic consequences of war for the Ukraine and said a violent elite had stolen the future of the Russian people. He said no one would choose to live under Mr Putinaposs bandit rule unless they are forced to at the barrel of a gun.His comments came as Boris Johnson condemned Russia for unleashing a tidal wave of violence against Ukraine, with bombs and missiles raining down on innocent civilians.Mr Johnson said a massive package of sanctions had been drawn up to hobble Russia aposs economy - after his previous package was branded not good enough - and vowed to reduce dependance on Russian oil and gas.He is expected to unveil a tougher round of sanctions in a statement to MPs later today.In a televised address, the Labour leader said: We must prepare ourselves for dficulties here.We will see economic pain as we free Europe from dependence on Russian gas and clean our institutions from money stolen from the Russian people. But the British public have always been willing to make sacrice to defend democracy on our continent and we will again. He called for an end to the failed approach towards Mr Putin, which he said fed the belief that the benefits of aggression outweigh the cost. Mr Starmer said the UK needed to help Ukraine defend itself and bolster its NATO allies in eastern Europe - and bring in the toughest possible sanctions against Moscow. He said: It must be isolated, its finances frozen, its ability tocrippled. The UK has for too long been a safe haven for dirty Russian money, he added.  Mr Starmer went on: This must be a turning point in our history. We must look back and say that this terrible day was actually when Putin doomed himself to defeat. He seeks ision, so we must stay united. He hopes for inaction, so we must take a stand. He believes that we are too corrupted to do the right thing, so we must prove him wrong. I believe we can, but onlywe stand together. His comments came as Russian forces mounted a pre-dawn assault on Ukraine from the north, the south and the east, mounting attacks by air, land and sea. Western officials believe Moscow intends to seize and control a very large section of Ukraine - including the capital Kiev - and will need ground troops to do so. They fear this will lead to large numbers of civilian injuries and deaths with fighting in the built-up urban areas. It is unclear whether Mr Putin will seize the whole country - as Russian forces do not appear to be ready yet - or whether he intends to create a puppet regime in Kyiv.

Boris Johnson announced sanctions against three billionaire oligarchs and five banks in retaliation for Kremlin forces launching action in the breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk.The Prime Minister told the Commons: “Any assets they hold in the UK will be frozen, the iniduals concerned will be banned from travelling here, and we will prohibit all UK iniduals and entities from having any dealings with them. “This is the first tranche, the first barrage, of what we are prepared to do.“We will hold further sanctions at readiness, to be deployed alongside the United States and the European Unionthe situation escalates still further.” Critics blasted the move after it emerged the oligarch trio have been on a US sanctions list since  - meaning it is unlikely many UK businesses have dealings with them. Mr Johnson insisted the Government would “be bringing forward further measures to hit Russian iniduals and Russian companies of strategic importance to Russia, stopping Russian companies from raising money on London markets and stopping them even trading in pounds and dollars”. Keir Starmer said: “We have failed to stop the flow of illicit Russian finance into Britain.” Calling for the invasion to be “a turning point”, the Labour leader added: “We need an end to oligarch impunity, we need to draw a line under Companies House providing easy cover for shell companies, we need to ensure that our anti-money-laundering laws are enforced.” Former Treasury Minister Dame Angela Eagle questioned whether the sanctions would “close down the so-called London laundromat which is laundering dirty Russian money straight through the City”. MPs have become increasingly frustrated at the failure to crackdown Russia on cash swirling around the capital. Mega-rich, Kremlin-linked tycoons have bought multi-million-pound mansions in London and country estates in Surrey, sending their children to elite boarding schools. Ministers have repeatedly been accused of turning a blind eye or even encouraging them because of the funds they pump into the UK economy.  MPs on Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee published a damning report in July  accusing successive governments of paving the way for Russian funds to infiltrate Britain. “It would appear that the UK has been viewed as a particularly favourable destination for Russian oligarchs and their money,” the -page study said. “The UK welcomed Russian money, and few questions –any – were asked about the provenance of this considerable wealth.” Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper tonight said Britain had become a “centre for illicit finance that reality discredits us in the eyes of the world”.  She demanded “much stronger action against illicit finance in the City of London, and the way in which - not just Russian money and illegal money, including money from organised crime in other countries - it’s possible to launder that money in the UK because there just aren’t strong enough checks in place”. Former Foreign Office Minister Chris Bryant, who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Russia, fumed: “We have to close the dirty Russian money down.” Exeter University academic Tena Prelec, part of a research team investigating international kleptocracy, said: “Our research shows elite iniduals from post-Soviet states are laundering their wealth and reputations in the UK, knowingly and willingly supported by a network of British professionals.  “The UK remains a safe haven for dirty money, a great deal of which comes from Russia and Eurasia. “Failure to tackle this thriving billion-dollar industry is damaging for the UK’s rule of law and to the UK’s professed role as an opponent of international corruption.” Campaigner Bill Browder, the head of Global Magnitsky Justice campaign, branded the Government’s sanctions “pretty tepid”. He added: “We should be going after the  oligarchs who look after Putin’s money.”  He said: “We don’t have a beef with the Russian people, we have a beef with Vladimir Putin and the oligarchs who support him and the oligarchs who look after his money. “We don’t have to punish the entire Russian population at this stage of the game - we should be going after the  oligarchs who look after Putin’s money. “Putin is one of the richest men in the world, he’s stolen an enormous amount of money over the last  years, and he doesn’t hold that money in his own name, he has other people holding it for him - his oligarch trustees. “It’s pretty straightforward,we were to sanction the  oligarch trustees who hold Putin’s money and their family members in the UK, he wouldn’t invade Ukraine.“We know exactly who they are, Boris Johnson knows who they are, the Foreign Office knows who they are, the Home Office knows who they are, I know who they are. “It’s all just a question of political will - does the Government want to actually stop a war  Or do they just want to seem to be reacting to this ” Royal United Services Institute think-tank financial and security expert Tom Keatinge said of the UK sanctions: Weaposve taken a peashooter to a gunfight. “It doesnapost make any sense to me at all, the whole point of the sanctions has been to deter Putin andat the first chance you get to use these sanctions you only tickle his feet, whataposs the point  “If we ever had the upper hand, weaposve lost it today. Meanwhile, calls mounted for Russia to be stripped of the UEFA Champions League final.St Petersburg is due to host the European club game’s showpiece event in May. But Mr Johnson told MPs it was “inconceivable” Russia could now stage major sporting fixtures. There was “no chance” of holding football tournaments in a Russia that “invades sovereign countries”, he told MPs.

The Tory Chancellor has joined the list of more than  people to receive a questionnaire from the Met Police to explain any involvement in gatherings at Downing Street. It’s understood the Chancellor has received the form, and it will be ed within seven days as requested by Scotland Yard. The Met is looking into  alleged gatherings held across Whitehall and Downing Street during lockdown rules under Operation Hillman.Mr Sunak previously confirmed he was at Boris Johnson ’s birthday do, held by No staff and the PM’s we Carrie on June , .But he insisted he had been present at the Cabinet Room for a routine meeting to discuss Covid.  Earlier this month, he appeared to suggest he was not expecting to receive a form to complete. Asked on Sky News earlier this monthhe expected to receive a form, he replied: No... well, I donapost know. He said at the time he did not believe he had broken any Covid rules. When previously asked about the allegations, Mr Sunak said he went to the Cabinet Room as he had for , , God knows how many other Covid meetings. Boris Johnson has already filled out the same questionnaire and police are considering whether to issue him a fixed penalty notice for breaking lockdown laws. A leaked version of the form revealed this week that the PM was asked basic questions which lawyers believe could easily be batted away.The forms asked respondents to provide a lawful exception or reasonable excuse for their lockdown-busting behaviour. They added those accused can provide a written statement under caution - making Mr Johnson the first Prime Minister to face answering police questions in this way.Labouraposs deputy leader Angela Rayner said: This is an embarrassment that for the first time in UK history we have a PM interviewed under police caution.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CabinetLabour PartyScotland Yardpolitan PoliceBoris JohnsonPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

That means it won’t just affect students, but millions of graduates who face paying back loans almost until they retire. Shadow Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said: The Tories are delivering another stealth tax for new graduates starting out on their working lives which will hit those on low incomes hardest.  “Instead of fixing the broken system these changes simply store up problems for the future. Ministers are kicking the can down the road while seeking to limit young people’s aspirations to study at university.” So what is actually being announced today  We take you through the main features and how they will affect your wallet. Graduates will have to pay back £ a year more University graduates starting their courses from next September will pay off % of what they earn above £,-a-year. That is down from a £, threshold now, meaning more of your earnings get caught by the student loan repayments trap.Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, said: “Everyone who earns above the threshold will repay more each year than under the current scheme, typically by £ year – reducing disposable incomes.”The existing threshold will be maintained for current students until April . But there are not any guarantees it will rise after that. With every year that it’s frozen, the threshold effectively gets lower because wages and costs rise with inflation and you put more of your disposable income to repaying your student loan. Just weeks ago Tory ministers scrapped a plan to raise the threshold by .% in April, leaving students £ worse off per year.  Graduates could be repaying their debts into their s In a further blow, theof time graduates have to pay off their loan will be extended to  years. That means the majority will be repaying their student debt into their s. Outstanding debt is currently written off after  years. But student loans are so high, only % of students ever repay their loan in full before the  years are up. Changes to the plans will mean % of borrowers pay off their loans, according to the Department for Education. Mr Lewis added: “The majority of lower and mid earners will keep paying for many more years, increasing their costs by £,s. “Yet the highest earners who would clear within the current  years won’t be impacted.” Pupils who fail their GCSE Maths and English could be barred from student loans A consultation will be published whether to impose minimum entry requirements of Level  GCSE passes in English and Maths - or two Es at A-Level. This means pupils who fail their Maths and English GCSEs - or get lower A-Level grades - could be barred from getting student loans. Around , people went to university last year who didn’t get these passes in their GCSEs. Another consultation will look at creating a Lelong Loan Entitlement , worth around £, or the equivalent of four years of post- education, to support students to study, train, retrain or upskill at any stage.  Sir Peter Lampl, executive chair of social mobility charity the Sutton Trust, raised concerns about plans to shut out those with lower grades. He said: The introduction of any minimum grade requirement is always going to have the biggest impact on the poorest young people, as they are more likely to have lower grades because of the disadvantages they have faced in their schooling. Demand for maintenance grant quietly ditched The reforms are based on the Augar review of student loan financing in . Some of what the review promised would have helped students. For example, it demanded theof maintenance grants for poorer students, which were axed in . But these have been ignored, despite Tory ministers happily taking some of the less appetising dishes on the Augar menu. Paul Blomfield MP, Chair of the All-Party Group for Students, said: “Future students will be paying more for less. “Philip Augar’s important proposal for the reintroduction of maintenance grants for the poorest students has been quietly dropped and there’s nothing to address rising living costs, which affect those without family support the most.”Tuition fees to remain at £, - despite demand for them to be slashed Tory ministers have announced the tuition fee cap will be frozen at £, for a further two years - up to and including  . This will, at least, mean students don’t pay more for their tuition than they currently do. But the Tories have quietly rejected the Augar reportaposs key call to slash tuition fees to £,-a-year - instead keeping the annual cap at £, until  . Cutting tuition fees was the top line from the Augar report - and the reason suggested extending the repayment window. NUS UK President Larissa Kennedy said: “These changes will cost new graduates on lower and middle incomes tens of thousands of pounds over the course of their careers. “At a time where the cost of living is soaring and grad salaries crashing, for many, these changes could be the dference between heating and eating. “The Minister is saddling young people with unimaginable debt for the next  years of their lives. This is nothing more than an attack on opportunity.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyPaul Blomfield MPEducationSchoolsTuition feesPoliticsGCSEsA-levels\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Its p spaghetti is, like the proleration of food banks in the UK, a treatment of the symptom of poverty.We need to address the cause. The responsibility for the welfare and wellbeing of our most vulnerable citizens should not rest on the shoulders of charities, nor supermarkets. It’s easy to paint the large ­corporations as the villains, but questions need to be asked as to why people need p spaghetti and p pasta to survive in one of the richest economies in the world.  And the answers lie squarely at the well-heeled feet of those who have held the purse strings and policies of the country for the last  long and dismal years. Those years of austerity cuts to social care and health services mean the safety net of a decent and supportive society is less than threadbare. The triple threat of rocketing food prices, unmanageable energy bills, and an underfunded National Health Service is going to cause long-term damage to families, communities, and ­iniduals in almost every ­neighbourhood in the country. Every area now has at least one foodbank we live in a society where people need the ad-hoc macro philanthropy of neighbours and strangers to not starve to death.  Over the last two years of the pandemic, the Chancellor has proven time and again that he can magic up a whole orchard of flourishing and evergreen money trees when it comes to propping up his pet projects. Writing off £.billion of furlough fraud, £.billion “lost” down the back of the Downing Street couch, supposedly spent on PPE nobody has any record of, not even the company that received the payment. That money alone could have paid for TWO YEARS of the continuation of the £ uplt to Universal Credit. Somehow there is always money for crony contracts, Parliamentary p*ss-ups, weaponry and warfare, and DWP cover-ups, because it comes at the expense of social care, school dinners, and starving pensioners. So while I welcome the ­reappearance of budget groceries on the supermarket shelves as an ­immediate-term relief for millions of people struggling to make ends meet, and while I will continue to write recipes for p a head and publish them for free on my website, I’m determined that we work towards building a world where neither of those things are essential any more. As the late, great Archbishop Desmond Tutu once said: “It isn’t enough to simply keep pulling people out of the river.

Labour analysis suggests that tax on iniduals and businesses is going up £. billion a year under the Conservatives.But the Chancellor will say he firmly believes in low taxes in a major speech on Thursday setting out his economic vision. This is despite the Government raising taxes to their highest level since the Second World War and abandoning two flagship manesto pledges on tax and pensions in doing so. Mr Sunak will disappoint Tory right-wingers by dismissing tax cuts where they would leave public spending unfunded. In his Mais lecture at the Bayes Business School, he will say: “I am going to deliver a lower tax economy but I am going to do so in a responsible way, and in a way that tackles our long term challenges”. But the Chancellor, who wants to build up a war-chest to cut taxes before the next election, will add: “I am disheartened when I hear the flippant claim that ‘tax cuts always pay for themselves’. They do not. “Cutting tax sustainably requires hard work, prioritisation, and the willingness to make dficult and often unpopular arguments where.”  Ministers claim the UK has the fastest growing economy in the G but this is only true because they compare  with , the worst year for the economy in a century as a result of the pandemic. The latest data on quarterly GDP growth, referring to Q , has the UK coming in with slower growth at % than .% in Japan, .% in Canada and .% in United States. Keir Starmer will on Thursday commit the next Labour government to turning around the low growth of the last decade.In a speech in Huddersfield, he will blame the Conservativeaposs  years in power for faltering growth for tax rise after tax rise. He will say: “If the Tories had matched Labour’s record on growth, people would have had higher incomes. We could have spent £ billion more on public services without having to raise a single tax. The Chancellor has already introduced  tax rises, increasing taxes more than any other Chancellor in half a century.  The Labour leader will set out six areas where the party would boost long-term growth including driving up productivity and wages. He will wade into controversial waters for his party discussing the role the Government plays as a partner to the private sector. Mr Starmer will also set out Labouraposs own version of aposlevelling upapos - restoring and revitalising the places that once powered Britain. Echoing the words of Labour former PM Harold Wilson - a son of the town - he is expected to say: “Our country and our economy are entirely dferent now, but we too are going through the white heat. We face our own revolutions in technology and industry, and it will fall to the next Labour government to shape that change so it works for all.” He will also stress Labouraposs unequivocal backing for British business as the party tried to bolster its economic credibility.

He said today: “What we see now is a full fledged invasion of Ukraine from many, multiple directions, we see air, land and naval forces taking part…This is extremely serious.”UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson slammed Russia’s tidal wave of violence which he described as an attack on democracyapos, saying the UK will always defend Ukraineaposs rights to sovereignty. Mr Johnson said: Our mission is clear. Diplomatically, politically, economically – and eventually, militarily – this hideous and barbaric venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure.  But there is no suggestion that NATO troops will actually put boots on the ground in Ukraine, despite the invasion. Meanwhile, the unfolding war has prompted fresh questions about the size of the British Army and ongoing cuts to troop numbers. Here are some common questions answered on troop numbers in Britain, Russia and the NATO forward groups.What is the size of the UK Army and Armed Forces As of  October , the “trained strength” of the British Army is , personnel, , in the Royal Navy and Royal Marines, and , in the Royal Air Force. That gives a total of , in the UK Armed Forces.This total will however be cut by around , to achieve a smaller Army as envisaged in ‘Defence in a Competitive Age’ command paper.The target is to cut the Army, which has already been slashed back, by nearly , to ,. The Navy and RAF would increase in size slightly, to , and , respectively. Infantry, the “close combat” troops at the “core of the Army” - some of whom are stationed in Estonia to protect NATO allies, are falling by a fth. Tory ministers admit their numbers will drop from , in  to , in  . Why are British troop numbers being cut Overall Army numbers are being cut as part of a long-term plan by the UK government to ‘modernise’ the military.Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has claimed: “We will have a modernised fleet, it will have a modern soldier and I think it will be really quite exciting.”He added with investments in new technology, including to counter cyber-attacks, the Armed Forces can do “what it says on the side of the tin rather than boasts about having lots of people and actually equipment that is  years out of date”.But General Sir Richard Sherrf, a former deputy supreme commander of NATO Europe, told the BBC : “We in this country must recognise that our security starts not on the White clfs of Dover but it starts in the forest of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania.“That means we must really man the ramparts in Eastern Europe as an alliance. We should mobilise our forces such as we’ve got. I’m afraid the cupboard is pretty bare after the cumulative defence cuts over the last decade plus.” Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey told the Commons: “By the time of the next election we will have the smallest Army in  years.” How many troops does Russia have Russiaaposs army has about , personnel and its combined armed forces total about ,, according to Reuters. Its , battle tanks outnumber Ukraineaposs by more than three to one, according to the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies . A US intelligence assessment in December suggested Russia was amassing a force of up to , troops near Ukraine. UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said on Monday that , Russian combat troops are on the edge of Ukraine, spread between more than  battalion tactical groups. What will Russia do in Ukraine  Western officials believe Russia intends to seize and control a very large section of Ukraine - including the capital Kiev - and will need ground troops to do so. They fear this will lead to large numbers of civilian injuries and deaths with fighting in the built-up urban area. But they are unclear whether that will mean occupying the whole country, for which Russian forces do not yet appear to be ready. Likewise, Western officials are unclear whether Vladimir Putin intends Russia to rule Ukraine directly, or to replace the government in Kiev with a more favourable puppet regime. Western intelligence suggests Russian forces spilled over Ukraine’s border from multiple directions including from Russia to Donbas, from Belarus and from occupied Crimea. There was a cyber-attack on Ukrainian financial institutions last night, and a large number of missile strikes on Mariupol port this morning but no amphibious attack in the opening hours. Not all of the estimated , Russian troops that were amassed near the borders have yet invaded. But Russian special forces are thought to be flooding into Ukraine to soften up resistance, officials believe. How many British troops are near Ukraine The UK contributes troops to NATO battlegroups, which as of last March stationed around , personnel at bases in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland . Britain leads the battlegroup in Estonia and was due soon to have around , troops there, after it promised to double the number of UK forces in the country. As of March  the UK had  troops in Estonia - including one armoured infantry battalion with main battle tanks and armoured fighting vehicles. The UK also had  troops in Poland - a Light Cavalry Squadron from the Royal Dragoon Guards, as part of a US-led force. Latvia’s battlegroup is led by Canada while Lithuania’s is led by Germany. These figures are likely out of date. US president Joe Biden said tonight: “Over the past few weeks I ordered thousands of additional forces to Germany and Poland as part of our commitment to Nato. On Tuesday, in response to Russia’s aggressive action… I authorised the deployment of ground and air forces already stationed in Europe to NATO’s Eastern flank allies - Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania.” He added: “Now I’m authorising additional US force capabilities to deploy to Germany as part of NATO’s response, including US base forces… put on standby weeks ago.” Will NATO defend Ukraine NATO’s ‘forward presence’ troops have been stationed in member countries Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. NATO allies are also co-ordinating financial sanctions against Russia, while the UK and other allies are sending defensive lethal weapons and military support to Ukraine. However, Ukraine is not a NATO member - despite Putin’s claims that the alliance is expanding - and therefore is unlikely to have Western troops on the ground. This is a crucial distinction, because Article  of NATO’s charter - that all  member countries must respond to an attack on one member - only applies to member states. Speaking to the BBC on January , NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg ruled out sending NATO boots on the ground in Ukraine. Again today he said there were no plans to do so.  Asked on January we could see a scenario where NATO troops fight Russian troops in Ukraine, he replied: No. We are focusing on providing support to Ukraine. He added: We have to distinguish between NATO allies and Ukraine. Ukraine is a partner. We provide support. We help them with modernising their defensive security institutions, NATO allies as the United Kingdom, United States, Canada are providing training. Thousands of Ukraine soldiers have been trained. UK Defence Committee member Tobias Ellwood has said NATO forces should have been placed in Ukraine but “we blinked” and failed to do so.

If today, you were constructing the best model for a European trade organisation, would it resemble the bloated, bureaucratic, monolith run by unelected, mediocre, pro-German civil servants called the EU  And more than half the country, predominantly older people staunchly proud of Britain’s history and its ­constitutional monarchy, thought not. Well, I’d like to ask them,they were constructing a model British state today, would they have a Windsor at the head of it  Park this year’s fairy-tale narrative about the past seven decades being one long, glorious reign, and focus on the past few days. The heir to the throne faces a police investigation over claims his advisers fixed a CBE for a Saudi tycoon who had given a fortune to one of his charities. Charles denies any knowledge of a deal but can’t deny secretly meeting the tycoon in Saudi Arabia, welcoming him to Clarence House, and giving him the CBE at Buckingham Palace.  The Queen’s second oldest son has just agreed a reported £million payoff to a woman who claimed he raped her when she was , as a minor under US law, which he denies. In fact he denies ever meeting her. So we’re expected to believe he’s just given £million to a complete stranger. And the royals won’t denysome of his hush money comes from the Queen’s Duchy of Lancaster tax-deductible fund. Which would effectively mean taxpayers crowdfunding the Duke of York’s escape route from a child sex scandal. He still retains that title, despite York MP Rachael Maskell demanding it be removed after a poll claimed % of York citizens don’t want him shaming their city. He will also remain a Queen’s ­Counsellor of State. I can’t wait to hear how he counsels her on legislation about sex trafficking. The views of York’s citizens are deemed irrelevantbecause in our monarchical system, subjects cannot question royals. I would love to hear MPs debate the issues around Charles and Andrew, and how much, and for how long, the Queen knew of her son’s connections to his convicted paedophile friend. And the morality behind Buckingham Palace finally ordering Andrew to settle the allegations against him to save the precious Platinum Jubilee. But our elected representatives cannot mention such issues in the Commons, just as we can’t see how much royals leave in their wills, because as Parliamentary bible Erskine May states: “No question can be put which brings the name of the Sovereign or the ­influence of the Crown directly before Parliament, or which casts reflections upon the ­Sovereign or the Royal Family.” Hence why MPs are forced to take an oath of allegiance to the monarch and all their heirs. What a ludicrous, humiliating stitch-up. All to keep these accidents of birth ruling over us. And to think, most Brits believe the EU is an anti-democratic gravy train which keeps charlatans in clover, while our “democracy” is the envy of the world. I’d love to think this week will convince royalists that this family they idolise is not only not better than theirs, some of its members are far worse. And we should bin the whole feudal farce once the Queen dies. But I’d be kidding myself.

If you sell goods to the EU, or buy goods from the EU and bring them into the UK, you need to be able to prove that they meet the new rules of origin requirements to access preferential tarfs. It’s vital you understand the new rules to keep your business moving. To benefit from the preferential tarfs, you must have proof that any goods you import from the EU originate there, or any goods you export to the EU originate in the UK. Proof of origin can either be a statement of origin completed by the exporter, or evidence of the importer’s knowledge of where products originate. If you cannot prove the origin, you or your EU customer may be liable to pay the full rate of customs duty and could face penalties. Andrew Macleod, founder of London-based restaurant brand Emilia’s Crafted Pasta, explains that imports from the EU are vital to his brand: “We import ingredients directly from Italy, including special cured meats, cheeses, drinks and alcohol. Each of our suppliers is hand-picked.”  Has he had to make any changes to his business now that there are new import rules in place  “Yes – of course we already knew the origin of all the goods we import as we source everything carefully. But we’ve trained two of our managers on the rules around importing, so we know that we have staff in house who are well versed in the process.”  And having successfully navigated the changes, what advice would Andrew offer other businesses that import  “We found using a customs agent really helps the process run smoothly, but it’s equally important that you understand the rules yourself,” he says. “It’s not too late, and the gov.uk site has lots of valuable information.”  You must be able to prove the origin of any product you import You can choose to work with a freight forwarder or courier To benefit from preferential tarfs, you must be able to prove that any goods you import originated in the EU Note:you’re moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, rules of origin work dferently.

It may also help medical research by identying genetic predictors of diseasePrincipal author Dr Yan WongByMark Waghorn:,  Feb |commentsScientists have created the biggest ever family tree – linking around  million people.It goes back tens of thousands of years and sheds new light on the evolution of our species. The British team’s breakthrough is a major step towards mapping the ancestry of every single one of us. It may also help medical research by identying genetic predictors of disease.Principal author Dr Yan Wong said: “We have basically built a huge family tree.“It is a genealogy for all of humanity that models as exactly as we can the history that generated all the genetic iation we find in humans today. [It] allows us to see how every person’s genetic sequence relates to every other.” The Oxford University study, which combines modern and ancient genomes, reveals in unprecedented detail how people across the world are related. Recent decades have generated genomes from hundreds of thousands of people – some from tens of thousands of years ago. Variable quality and limitations in analyses made painting an accurate picture impossible, until now. The new technique, described in journal Science, allows for missing data. Dr Wong said: “This study is laying the groundwork for the next generation of DNA sequencing.” The scientists were able to reconstruct the genomes of our ancestors, with computer algorithms being used to predict when and where they lived. The team trawled eight databases containing , genome sequences. Some samples were , years old. The resulting network contained almost  million ancestors.

As of today, Thursday February , all remaining legal restrictions in England have been replaced with government guidance.Isolation rules, contact tracing and support payments for people who would have previously self-isolated with Covid will all end, with free testing also set to end by April .  Announcing the end of restrictions, the Prime Minister said: Because of the efforts we have made as a country over the past two years, we can now deal with it in a very dferent way. He added that it will be our personal responsibility to protect ourselves from the virus going forward. However, while pretty much all restrictions are being lted, a few will continue to remain in place. Here’s what they are. Will Covid travel rules change   Under the changes, which happened on February , fully vaccinated people entering the UK do not need to take any Covid tests. However, they will still be required to fill in a Passenger Locator Form, and no changes have been announced regarding this yet under the aposliving with Covidapos plan. While the Department for Transport was pressing to simply the Passenger Locator Form or get rid of it completely, this has not happened yet. Boris Johnson confirmed on Monday that passenger locator forms would be reviewed and likely be scrapped before or by Easter. For now, these forms continue to be requirement for all arrivals in the UK, irrespective of vaccination status. What are the rules for unvaccinated passengers  Unvaccinated people will still need to take one pre-departure test and one post-arrival test before entering the UK. While the requirement to self-isolate until the day  test ends today, there has been no other change made to testing for unvaccinated passengers - and itaposs likely this will stay the same for the foreseeable future, as confirmed by the Department of Transport. What happensa new iant emerges   Officials have said the government will continue to maintain domestic surveillance, including the ONS Covid infection survey, to spot any new iants of concern.While Transport Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed the government won’t implement emergency measures in response to new Covid iants unless in extreme circumstances, testing measures in the NHS may be ramped up in the futureneeded.An as-of-yet unannounced toolkit for tackling new threats is reportedly being prepared, and this will be set out in detail before Easter.

One accusation allegedly took place in the accident and emergency department of a hospital. The charges include indecent and sexual assault as well as acting in a lewd and libidinous manner. Among the claims, it is alleged that Singh had women stand on scales before he molested them. He is also accused of kissing females and making inappropriate comments. A stethoscope is said to have been used in a number of the accusations.  Singh denied the allegations at the High Court in Glasgow, back in June . His lawyer Janice Green told the court he pleads not guilty to all  charges. Jurors then were read the charges by judge Lord Armstrong, who advised them it would be a “y” trial that was likely to last around eight weeks. “There are  charges and a woman will speak to each of those charges,” he said.  Agreed evidence - known as a joint minute - was read to the jury by prosecutor Angela Gray. It was stated that Singh obtained his medical degree in Patna, India in  before being registered as a doctor in London in November .

Other work carried out by Singh, included being a police casualty surgeon - working with people in custody as well as alleged victims of crime. The document states that the police investigation began after NHS Lanarkshire received a complaint from one of the alleged victims in February .

Mark Holling, from Edinburgh, was initially frustrated that his family had lost two days of their dream holiday in Madeira and had gotten apostrappedapos in Tenere amid the travel chaos.But this wasn’t the end of the complications. Mark and his family, along with their fellow passengers, wound up being flown back to Edinburgh from Tenere due to “ weather conditions in Funchal” - following more than two days of travel. The family had been due to fly from Edinburgh to Madeira on Monday morning, but an initial delay of one day was placed on his flight, meaning it was rescheduled on Tuesday, Edinburgh Live reported. After arriving at the airport on Tuesday morning for the flight, the passengers onboard were greeted with another issue, as the plane could not land at its destination in Madeira, Portugal, due to weather-related issues.  Instead, the flight landed in Tenere on Tuesday afternoon and passengers are still awaiting instructions and an update on when they will eventually make it to their destination, a day later.Mark took to Twitter to complain about the situation to Jet, saying: Ok itaposs time to take us home.In a second tweet, Mark said: So it’s been two and a half days since we left home and two full days of our seven day holiday spent travelling. Hardly worth trying now! Perhaps we should be given the option of flying back to Edinburgh now! Mark also added a photo of the amount of people on the same flight that were awaiting news. Speaking to Edinburgh Live, he added: On Sunday evening they told us the flight was delayed by one day. That left Tuesday morning but couldnapost land in Madeira due to weather problems. After holding we were erted to Tenere, sat there for two and a half hours then into the airport where we queued to be allocated to hotels To be fair, that was the only time we had unpleasant Jet staff. We left the hotel at am to come to the airport for am flight. Started boarding and some of the groups went through, goodness knows where they are now, then postponed again and awaiting update. Still waiting, quite a few folk are thinking we should give up and be taken home. John is travelling with his we and daughter and they only booked a weekaposs holiday in Madeira, meaning two days have already been consumed by delays and travelling. John also noted that his daughter is due back at university on Tuesday, so any extension to the holiday wouldapost be a viable option. He added: Itaposs more than two days lost, we should have had Monday afternoon, all of yesterday and all of today in Madeira. Evenwe do try again weaposre unlikely to be at our hotel before it gets dark and Iaposm not optimistic that weaposll be able to leave here today. Jet have commented on the issue and given an update, saying that due to reasons that were out of their control, passengers on the flight were eventually flown back to the UK last night, on February . A spokesperson said: Due to adverse weather conditions that have been affecting Funchal and the surrounding area since Monday, flight LS from Edinburgh to Funchal was erted to Tenere Airport. Our teams have been working hard to arrange accommodation and refreshments for customers affected by this unforeseen delay, as well as trying everything possible to get everyone to their intended destination as soon as possible. Unfortunately, as weather conditions in Funchal showed no sign of improving, we made the dficult decision to fly customers back to the UK yesterday evening, and all affected customers will receive a full refund. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused by these extraordinary circumstances, which were completely beyond our control.

She lives on the top floor, she keeps screaming, she’s not stopping. It sounds bloody bad. I’m really sorry but this has been going on for a few weeks.” She continued: “We could hear the woman screaming, as soon as I heard the screaming, I said ‘that’s not normal, call the police’.  I could hear the man shouting at the woman but she was screaming so loudly, it was impossible to hear any words. I could hear her crying and moaning and that was quieter and much more subtle. “We could also hear other noises like banging, not like doors but assomeone was throwing something on the floor. Jurors were shown bodycam footage of two police officers who arrived at the scene, seven minutes after the  call was made.  After pushing open the door, they immediately found Azaria, who was lying unresponsive in a pool of her own blood.

The -year-old had always struggled with his weight, saying when he was a child he comfort ate and in adolescence he began to smoke and did not exercise. Knowing he had to do something, over the years David gradually stopped eating red meat, gorging on sweets and gave up alcohol and also took up swimming.But after not seeing any results his GP referred him to the Low Carb Program, the Liverpool Echo reports.Have your say on this story in the comment section After joining a  Week Bootcamp, David saw remarkable results and was clinically diagnosed as being in type  diabetes remission. When he took on the challenge, David weighed roughly  stone. Just a few months later, he weighed nearer  and a half stone. He said: I began to get into the habit in my twenties of excessive drinking, leaving the pub at night and getting a takeaway, to munch watching the TV before bedtime. As a chubby, friendly type I had lots of friends but no serious girlfriends, as my overweight appearance and attitude led to being not taken too seriously, by myself and others.

After Storm Eunice and Franklin, starfish were seen in their hundreds on a beach in Pembrokeshire, Wales, while there has been other reports of marine le found dead. Jellyfish such as Portuguese man oapos wars were also seen washed up in Swansea. Wildle guides for SeaMor Dolphin Watching Boat Trips were astonished to find two find two octopus wandering on the beach in New Quay.  The curled octopusare not an unusual in seawater but it is surprising to see them on the shore. Wandering down the beach, the creatures were seen on Monday shortly before low tide. Josh Pedley, one of the guides was waiking with fellow guide Fran Fitzpatrick when they saw the unusual sight.Josh told WalesOnline : Itaposs not something you see everyday... rock pool and coastal wildle is fascinating to look at, but itaposs important to remember not to touch or remove the wildle. We ended up escorting one of the octopi back to the sea but that was under an exceptional circumstance. I know in recent storms some octopi have been found washed up dead recently, this was the first time I had ever seen any alive still. The wildle guides said they wanted to encourage more caution from people visiting Welsh coasts. We get so many tourists here who arenapost in tune with the natural world, that had this happened in summer, it probably would have ended up in someoneaposs bucket to no end of prodding and poking.  We want to encourage people to enjoy nature responsibly Fran ended up carrying one of the trapped creatures to safety after discovering it in an exposed spot along the beach. The--year-old said: Josh and I both worry quite a lot about how much wildle and shells get disturbed and removed from the shores. New Quay receives a huge number of tourists each year and many do not follow the aposlook but donapost touchapos rule, she said. We have even had incidents of seal pups being abandoned by mothers when too many people took selfies with them or walked their dogs off lead too close and scared the parents away. It is important to helpan animal needs it, but people need to do so intelligently and not interfere without thinking through the consequences first. Responsible and informed approaches when deciding whether to touch or approach a wild animal are important.

The woman can often be heard shouting for her dog in parks when trying to gain her attention, leaving other owners to question the unusual name.

Sharing their own unusual dog names, one user said: I rarely tell people my dogaposs full name, Finlaggan, because I don’t want questions. The name has deeper meaning to me, but basically sheaposs named after a boat. Another added: My boyfriend has two cats - Gato and Girlfriend. Weird animal names are fun. People always think the name Girlfriend is weird, but he named her that because one day Gato, who used to be a stray, came home with her - and so it was like she was his girlfriend.

I just have girls that live all over and they have kids, so I just feel like this would be easier and less stressful for me to do it this way. Commenters on Reddit were baffled by the brideaposs request, with many of them pointing out it was greedy to ask for money from her bridesmaids for her own gain. One said: Lordy, lordy, lordy. She could also ask her bridal party to give her the money they would have spent on their gowns, hair, and make-up, and just have them sit in a pew like everyone . As another added: This woman is so out of touch she is orbital. I hope no one pays for her vacation. But others sided with the bride, suggesting they would be happy to pitch in for the spa dayit meant they wouldnapost have to attend a party they werenapost interested in. Someone said: Iaposd totally pitch in for thatit cost me  th of what the party would otherwise. And I wouldnapost have to go to a bachelorette party. Sounds amazing. While someone  wrote: I mean do I blame her ... not really. Would I ever ask of that  Nope. Absolutely not.

Basically, by aposintimateapos it includes things like my crushes and relationships, body issues, social media account infoand even things that I would never willingly share like my porn interests and what I like to look for in a partner. As a child my parents would only preach privacy to me and my siblings, looking back at my childhood I can see that they preached this idea way too much, I guess thataposs why in my mind I would never have expected for my privacy to be breached in this way.Recently the man woke up really thirsty in the middle of the night so decided to head downstairs to grab a drink. But when he got downstairs he claims he was absolutely gobsmacked to find his mum, dad and both his siblings sitting reading his diary.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.I was so confused that I couldnapost utter a single word, I just went up snatched my water bottle and my diary and went back to my room, and just stayed there, he continued. The next day in private I grabbed my parents to another room and asked them what the hell I saw yesterday. At first they tried to play it off as an accident - like what the f*** I literally saw all four people around my diary - but after more pressure they admitted that they have constantly been reading my diary with my SIBLINGS and their excuse was aposwe just want to make sure our son is okayapos. He was understandably furious, but mostly he just felt embarrassed, so he called one of his friends who was looking for a roommate and they agreed he would move in. By the end of the week he had completely left his family home. Once at his house I just broke down and I just couldnapost imagine that all my privacy was breached by the people who would preach respecting privacy to me the most, he continued. My parents tried calling but I ignored them and my siblings keep texting saying Iaposm too sensitive and have even insulted my mentioning some of the private stuff they read in my diary, so I blocked them and also changed all my passwords. The man then turned to Reddit to question whether he was justied in moving out and cutting contact with his family or whether they were right in saying he was too sensitive. What they did is a gross violation of privacy. Good for you for moving out, one Reddit user commented, while another added: Iaposm so sorry this happened to you. I hope you keep journaling and don’t let their breach of your privacy and trust keep you from it in the future. A third replied: They are not family, are literal psychopaths. I donapost comment often, but this level of emotional disregard is truly stunning.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Karina Irby took to Instagram to share the messages, which also accused her of profiting over other peopleaposs insecurities, as the Daily Star reports.

Along with a candid selfie, Karina posted some screenshots of the aposabusiveapos comments which include: You’re a proper bush pig that profits off overweight women’s insecurities. Another user had written: Just puked after seeing this atrocious despicable piece of skin. That’s enough to put me off red meat. Sometimes people just should keep those tuckshop cheeks to themselves. And, she was even told by one troll that they wanted to watch her die. They said: I want to unfollow you so bad but I want to watch you get sick and die more.”  Karina then shared a y caption addressing the torment she goes through. She wrote: MY LIFE ON SOCIAL MEDIA…My DM’s are a consistent influx of abusive judgement, made up assumptions and downright bullying. Firstly, I’m not posting this to gain sympathy. I’m fine. However, just last week I heard of yet another person taking their own le due to receiving endless harassment and bullying online. Knowing that people hide behind fake accounts to send comments like this is just gutless and coward like behaviour.  Not only would they never say these things to your face but they won’t even comment from their ‘main’ account. It says a lot more about them than you. As much as I hate to say this…I want to almost normalise receiving this kind of behaviour online. She continued: It shouldn’t happen. But it does, all the time to thousands of people. If you find yourself on the receiving end of someoneaposs online bullying please speak up, reach out and try to not hold onto their words. Sometimes this can be easier said than done. But no matter what you’re never alone and I’m so sorry you’re going through this.  Karina attempted to reach out to her fans to urge them to seek helpthey are going through similar online abuse. She added: You don’t deserve it. I’ll keep naming and shaming these cowards to not only stand up for myself but to hopefully show others you can take the control back. Bullying is NEVER ok. Appalled at the nasty remarks Karina receives, many fans fled to the comments to condemn the trolls and praise the influencer for taking a stand. One person commented: People are mean. But you’re NOT! Love the message you send and I’ll keep following to watch you THRIVE! Another user added: How can anyone ever wish death upon anybody  ! Itaposs sad. We live in a sad, sad world. Whilst a third person voiced: If only more people were like you and used their time to spread positivity instead of hate.

And while things like morning sickness and cravings are well-documented side effects, there are also many that most people are completely unaware of which can take mums-to-be by surprise. One mum on TikTok facing a particularly bizarre pregnancy side-effect is Carla, who has discovered a strange issue with her skin - as she claims it has become so squishy it now resembles aposuncooked doughapos. In a video showing off her unusual condition, Carla got her husband to push his finger into the skin just above her ankle, and the man was left looking completely baffled when he removed his finger to find the dent heaposd made in her skin had stayed in place.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.Carla, who posts under the username @carlaincarolina, captioned the video: Being pregnant is fun.The mumaposs video has been viewed more than  million times - and commenters canapost get enough of her squidgy skin which many have said looks like dough. One person wrote: I heard many things, but the body turning into clay [is new]. As another commented: Just like dough.  She became memory foam, a third joked.While Carlaaposs side effects may look bizarre, it is actually a fairly common condition faced by pregnant women and is known as pitting oedema, which is a iation of swelling caused by oedema. According to the NHS, oedema is a build-up of fluid in areas including the ankles, feet, and legs, and can often be seen in pregnant women as well as those who are overweight, have been standing or sitting in the same position for too long, or have eaten too much salty food.Oedema can also be caused by some medications, an insect bite, a blood clot, or problems with your kidneys, liver or heart. The NHS recommends those with oedema try to raise their legs on a chair or pillows and improve their blood flow with gentle exercise such as walking. Many causes of oedema are not serious, but itaposs recommended that you see your GPyour swelling has not improved after treating it at home for a few days, orthe swelling gets worse.

What do you think of the tattoo  Let us know in the comments... Explaining the horrying experience on TikTok, Lyss, @paciclyss, posted a picture of her daughter Azaleaaposs handprints and some inspiration pictures of how she wanted it to be inked on her body.She said: I paid CAD plus tax per tattooback in .

I like to take Silvio on walks around our neighbourhood with me, she wrote. We were out on one of our walks and it started getting darker, I didnapost really think much about it and started heading towards home.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.  Up ahead I can see a man on the other side of the street walking in the other direction getting closer to us. He gets closer and notices us, but passes us. He circled back around and walked up to us and started telling me what a pretty dog I have and petting him. I didnapost think any danger was happening. People have often stopped to pet him or comment.Then he stepped back and just stood there weirdly. I started to get uncomfortable and turned to walk away. As soon as the woman tried to remove herself from the situation, she said the man pulled out a pocket kne ashe was able to attack her.She added: I didnapost have time to think about what was happening before Silvio immediately sensed the danger and got in front of me as close as he could get. He planted himself in what I recognised as the stance he takes when he sees another dog. He was ready to attack. He growled for the first time Iaposve ever heard in his le. He barked, which is another thing he rarely does, and started to lunge at this dude.  After seeing the dogaposs reaction, the man quickly stepped back and ran away in the opposite direction from what she was walking. Still guarding his owner, Silvio stayed firmly in front of the woman until her husband arrived - constantly looking up at her to see whether she was OK. When we got back home, I was obviously still a bit shaken up, and Silvio just rested his big old head in my lap giving me the sweetest look ever and calming me down, she added. He got so many treats and hugs and big kisses. I just canapost even thank him enough. I knew he is protective of me but way closer and more protective of my husband, but I never really thought much about what he would dowe were legit in danger. He usually loves everyone and demands to be petted by any person he meets, which is probably why he let that man pet him since I didnapost sense any danger at first. I assume the guy was doing this to test outSilvio was dangerous or not. The womanaposs husband took Silvio home from a friendaposs house when he was just one year old. The dog was super skinny and covered in ticks when he rescued him. She said:The friend lived close to the lake, and Silvio showed up with a frayed rope around his neck and a huge scar on his neck. He thought it looked like someone slit his throat and dumped him at the lake, or tied something heavy to the rope and dumped him and Silvio was able to get free. Theyaposve been best friends ever since. I will love and protect that dog like heaposs my child. Despite being illegal in the UK without exemption, experts say pitbulls can make great pets when raised with care and compassion.Animal welfare charities including Dogs Trust, the RSPCA and The Kennel Club have issued calls for the law on banned breeds to be changed, saying the government should instead impose new measures that would put more responsibility on owners of dogs who show aggressive behaviours.Do you have a dog story to sell  Email paige.freshwater@reachplc.

He says parallels between Vladimir Putin and Adolf Hitler are uncannyRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion of Ukraine Image: POOL AFP via Getty ImagesByDr Robert Lyman:,  Feb |comments The parallels between today and September , when Hitler’s German legions smashed into Poland to ignite Europe in the Second World War, are uncanny.It certainly makes  the most dangerous year in Europe since the end of that terrible, bloody war in .What the West does now will have dramatic consequences for the future of the world as we know it. If the world allows Putin to get away with his latest land-grab Ukraine and helping so-called ‘separatists’ take over the Donbas region in  there’s a very good chance he’ll take this as carte blanche to do it again, where.The targets  The Baltic Stateswill be first on his hit list, even though they are members of NATO. As I explained in my book The Rise of the Third Reich, this is what Hitler did after  take little nibbles at bits of Europe that weren’t his andpeople didn’t make too much of a fuss, keep on nibbling.  The invasion of Poland in  took place because Hitler believed he would get away with it, and that the West wouldn’t or couldn’t retaliate. So what do we do  We need to put Putin back in his box without initiating the Third World War.This will be hard, as it’s what he has calculated, with his threats today. He believes the world will be too scared to do anything, as he’s got his fingers on Russia ’s nuclear triggers.So we have to look at other ways to demonstrate to Russia that attacking and invading another sovereign country without due course is illegal, morally wrong and will end up failing. Whatever  happens from this, the wages of aggression must be seen by Putin to be miserable and not worth the effort. So, what are the parallels with    First, like Hitler, Putin has a distorted view of history, one seen through the lens of ethno-nationalism. He believes that everyone of Russian origin shares the same blood, language and culture, and therefore must be united within the same borders. Hitler called his concept of a racially pure Germany, all within the same border ‘Grosse Deutschland’. Putin has a quasi-religious view of the origins of the ‘Rus’ people and Ukraine sits at the heart of this twisted vision of a racially-united Russian people. Hitler took his racial nationalism to a further degree, taking his fight to the Untermensch by murdering millions. At least Putin doesn’t seem to want to exterminate his racial enemies, but that’s a very small plus point. Uniting people because of ‘blood’ is the sort of bizarre feature of ‘olden times’ that we historians expect to study from the past, not to watch on our TV screens in a supposedly more enlightened, age.  Second, like Hitler, Putin has blamed his war on us. In his twisted logic, the West in generaland NATO in particular, has been responsible for turning Ukraine slowly but steadily since  from its birth right into another Western puppet. As Hitler blamed both the Jews and the Versailles settlement in  for Germany’s misfortunes , so too Putin blames the West for the fact that on the whole Ukraine wants to look West, rather than East. Like the jilted lover in Fatal Attraction, an out-of-control Putin is now determined to boil Ukraine’s bunny. Third, it’s clear that, like Hitler, Putin has been planning this for a long time, certainly since . His invasions of Georgia and Crimea clearly demonstrate his intent. Like Hitler, his real problem has been trying to persuade the world that his intentions have always been benign. It’s no surprise to me that the invasion has come just after the closing ceremony for the Winter Olympics. He has been meeting Western leaders almost on a daily basis for weeks now, all of them believing that they could, like Neville Chamberlain at Munich in , deter Russia from war by means of their personal advocacy. That ridiculously long table at which Putin met President Macron last week would have been comical were it not the perfect symbolism for the scale of the ide between the liberal West and Putin’s Russia. Indeed, outrageously, Putin even met with the President of Pakistanon the very day of the invasion. Fourth, like Hitler in the s, Putin has been building up his armed forces substantially over the past decade. While we in the West have been shamedly scaling down our forces, Russia’s have been growing steadily in size, quality and technical sophistication.  Fth, the mental ide between how we see the world and how Putin sees it has been steadily growing. Chamberlain’s mistake, which he realised too late, was that Hitler simply did not see the world as we did. Today in the West, just like the s, we just don’t see the world as Putin does. He is a gangster who has secured power in Russia what he wants now is to ensure that those states that border Russia are at least acquiescent,not in his pocket. Just as Hitler hated the idea of a free Czechoslovakia and Polandso too does Putin hate the idea of a free, successful and democratic Ukraine. This, in a nutshell, is why Russia has invaded. In Russia the ability of ordinary Russians to make their voices heard has been massively curtailed in recent years, just as it was in Hitler’s Germany.  This slide into totalitarianism should have been a wake up call for us years ago but, just like the frog slowly boiling in the pan, we’ve grown to accept Russian political illiberalism as just another strange feature of a country than has never seemed to want to join the supposed nirvana that is the liberal West. Now that the dissenters have been all locked up, the anti-Putin voice in Russia has all but disappeared. Whether Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is successful, in either the short or long term, remains to be seen. It took the world six years and millions of lives to defeat Hitler. Putin will be gambling that the world doesn’t have the stomach for a fight. He’s probably right.

Ukraine was part of the Russian Empire back then, but so were countries like Poland, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Azerbaijan and Georgina. And perhaps most chillingly, not long before, so was Russia ’s northwestern-most territory Alaska until it was sold to the USA in .Ms Ghervas, author of Conquering Peace: From the Enlightenment to the European Union, says Putin’s wish to turn back the clock could bring unprecedented danger to the world.She says: “To understand the motivations behind Putin’s move, we have to go back over a century. “Today’s Russian Federation, established in , is, to all intents and purposes, the heir of the Soviet Union, itself established on the rubble of the Russian Empire after the October Revolution in .  “Unsurprisingly, the borders of the Russian Empire in  remain a point of reference for the Kremlin up to our day. And that’s despite all the ‘isms’ that have intervened, notably Bolshevism, Stalinism, and capitalism. “Putin is using yet another ‘ism’ to justy the recent Russian military entry into two self-proclaimed rebel republics of Donetsk and Luhansk - irredentism. “The word means the ‘longing for unredeemed lands’, and it was invented by Italian nationalists before World War One. As far as Putin is concerned, those lands have been ‘redeemed’ for greater Russia - despite Ukraine’s sovereignty and independence.  “One of Putin’s main arguments is that there are Russians in Donetsk and Luhansk who need protection, and that what is now Ukraine was a historic part of Russia. “Yet there is a glaring omission - the Russian colonisation in the region, mostly in the late th and th century, was the result of Russia’s imperial drive toward the South, in which earlier inhabitantswere forcibly assimilated, killed or deported. So whether those populations were ethnically Russian or Ukrainian is actually open to debate. “It is military expansionism, not ethnic considerations, that have brought about the present demography of the region. Using more force to ‘right the wrong’ will inevitably make things worse. There may be a risk for the Baltic countries, but they are probably not primary targets, since they are members of both the EU and NATO.On the other hand, the Russia has had armies occupying pieces of its neighbouring countries around the Black Sea, Moldova and Georgia, since the s, as well as Crimea since .From the Dniestr river in Moldova to the EU border with Romania it would be three hours drive for armoured vehicles. There are officially around  regular Russian soldiers illegally stationed in in Moldova, but in view of the illegal weapon stockpiles in that region, who knows how many paramilitary could be mobilised overnight for such an operation. So far, the Kremlin was not showing signs of decisively pressing its advantage. That is, up to today: right now, it is not wholly impossible that what the Kremlin had been planning all along a Blitzkrieg to landlock Ukraine in a very short period of time.I certainly do not have a crystal bowl: butthat really was the scenario, Romanian guards at the border of the Prut River could wake up, one fine morning, with Russian soldiers in front of them.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON European UnionNewcastle UniversityRussian Revolution of Vladimir PutinDaily Mirror,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Theyaposve also noticed a signicant drop in donations - making it harder to take every stray and injured animal in. The Pet Food Bank is for people who donapost have the money to feed their animals.

Now, the Pet Food Bank will be their biggest project to date. We will need a large number of volunteers and financial support to make it work, Alexandra explained. The family currently houses  animals - exceeding their  limit at the shelter - meaning they cannot take in any more pets, but they can help feed them.

Unless on a round of Corbetts # there are five here that make a fine challenge # it is easier to approach the Corbett via its gentler slopes from Tyndrum. This also gives the opportunity to explore the adit # access tunnel # and old lead mine on its higher slopes where the mineral vein continuation from Sron nan Colan is exposed. The Beinn Odhar lead mining venture appears to have been a short one but the views once the summit is reached are tremendous.Leaving the car park, cross the A and head left passing the Tyndrum Inn, the Green Welly Stop and cross the bridge.Turn right immediately after crossing the bridge to join the West Highland Waynorthwards, passing the KeyStore.You will need to stay on the WHW for the next .km as it slowly climbs out of Tyndrum with the A on your left and the Crom Allton your right until you reach the bridges over the burn and railway.Cross the bridges and go through the gate at the north end. You will be heading up on to the open hillside to your right.You now have a choice. Either head straight up in a north easterly direction picking your own route on the grassy slopes or veer slightly right back to the Crom Allt to pick up a faint path. If you use the latter, ensure you head upwards at around NN. Either way you will tend to end up on sections of the old mining path as it zigs zags upwards by default due to the natural line of the slope.Once you reach m # after approximately .km depending on how direct your route was # the ground becomes stonier. The adit and mine are higher to your left, northwest, on the crest of the ridgeline, whereas the faint path runs just under this soyou want to explore them it is worth scrabbling up the rocks to have a look. The bottom of the adit starts at around ms.Heading up from the adit and mine # or path # the route flattens out, passing a lochan and the county boundary to your left.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a veg plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is key to successful growing and means you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and veg beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing direct into the ground at this time of year there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option. Not only does it provide a warm environment for germination, but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests. If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, that#s even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost filled seed trays then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost. If the seeds are big enough to handle, you can sow them inidually into cm pots. The quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds between five and  seeds per pot. For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can be planted outside, tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill. You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and # handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots # gently tease them apart. Drop inidual seedlings into a five-centimetre compost filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level. Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own veg, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes. These can be planted from mid-March, however planting times will y across the country according to temperature and risk of frost. Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags. You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, approximately cms deep and cms apart.Once stems are about cms tall, they will need earthing up by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered. Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt # good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle # nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh and Maris Bard # white flesh with good #new potato# flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks. It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden.Top three jobs in March:PICS:Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. no_aGardening_March"},{"url":null,"title":"tourism drive builds urban and rural links","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more #

I came here in good faith. It is of no relevance at all whether I owe anyone money.”Earlier, Mr McKay had said he only wanted to help Mr Sala get home, and claimed Cardf City had “abandoned” him.Askedthere was anything he wanted to tell the inquest, he said: “Myself, Jack and Mark tried to help Emi to get home – publicity wise what we went through is hell.”The inquest has heard Mr Sala was overcome by toxic levels of carbon monoxide poisoning prior to dying from severe head and chest injuries consistent with a plane crash.On Wednesday, the jury were told that Mr Ibbotson had been barred from flying the Piper Malibu by its owner after receiving two notices of airspace infringements from the CAA.

did Nicola Sturgeon say today Free PCR testing to continue in ScotlandNicola Sturgeon expressed frustration over Boris Johnsons approach to Covid testing that he outlined on Monday.The Scottish Government is \"determined to retain\" free Covid testing, in contrast to England.Nicola Sturgeon criticised the decision by Boris Johnson to end universally free testing and said that the Scottish Government was looking for clarity on funding for the testing programme for devolved countries.Ms Sturgeon said: “Current funding arrangements mean that though taxpayers in all four UK nations contribute to the costs, it is decisions taken for England that determine the resources available to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for testing and other Covid measures.“As of now, we have no clarity on how much of the Covid testing infrastructure the UK government intends to retain no clarity on how much investment will support it in future and no clarity on whether the Treasury will provide additional resources to pay for it or demand instead that funding is taken from where in the healthbudget.“I hope we get this clarity soon so that we can out in more detail our longer-term approach to testing.“However, and I will say more later, I want to give an assurance that the Scottish Government is determined to retain a robust testing system capable of providing Scotland with strong resilience against future Covid threats, and firmly aligned with public health advice and the principles underpinning our National Health Service.”.remove: Nicola Sturgeon update LIVE as Covid roadmap published: Covid Scotland: Vaccine passports scrapped and changes to face mask rulesNew Covid Strategic FrameworkThis weeks announcement coincides with the publication of the Scottish Governments Covid strategic framework.Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish Government’s strategy was now to “manage Covid effectively, primarily through adaptations and health measures that strengthen our resilience and recovery”.In her statement to MSPs, the First Minister said: “Widespread vaccination coverage and better treatments have reduced the direct harms of the virus.“As a result, using restrictions to suppress infection is no longer as necessary as it once was.“And, given the wider harms caused by protective measures, it is no longer as justiable either.“The strategic framework therefore makes clear that in future we will rely less on legally imposed measures to control the virus – and more on vaccines, treatments, and sensible adaptations and good public health behaviours.”The framework sets out three broad levels on how the Government may respond to potential iants that could see restrictions reimposed, Nicola Sturgeon had said.Setting out the contingency strategy for low, medium and high risks, the First Minister told MSPs: “If a new iant emerged that was more transmissible and more severe, perhaps with the ability to evade vaccine or natural immunity, this would likely be classied as high risk.\"In those circumstances, we might advise people to limit social contacts for a period and to work from home where possible and we may introduce some temporary protections for high-risk settings.“If a new iant was either more transmissible or more severe, but not both, as is the case with Omicron, the initial threat assessment would likely be medium.\"In these circumstances, there may be a legal requirement to wear face coverings in some settings and we might issue guidance for businesses and service providers on reasonable measures to reduce the spread of Covid on their premises.“Lastly, in the absence of a new iant, ora new iant was neither more transmissible nor more severe, andvaccines continue to be effective, the threat classication would likely remain low. Obviously, this is the level we hope to reach and stay at on a sustainable basis.“In these circumstances, there would be no legally imposed protective measures. Instead, we would continue to advise iniduals and organisations to adopt sensible public health behaviours.”Covid isolation to continuePeople who test positive for Covid- should continue to isolate in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed.The legal requirement for infected people to self-isolate in England will be lted from Thursday, Boris Johnson announced on Monday.Although there has never been a legal requirement in Scotland, Ms Sturgeon said the guidance to isolate would remain.In her update to the Scottish Parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: “This new approach will see us resort much less, hopefully not at all, to legally imposed protective measures.“Instead, we will rely predominantly on vaccines, treatments and sensible public health behaviours and adaptations.“However much as we might wish it was not the case, Covid is still a public health risk here and globally and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future so we must also remain vigilant and prepared.”Vaccination updateVaccination appointments for the vulnerable - age group will begin in mid-March.--year-olds with an underlying health condition or who lives with those who with underlying conditions should come forward for their vaccine.Eligible children are being invited for their vaccination by NHS Scotland via letter or phone call.These appointments will be concentrated for evenings and weekends so that parents and s can attend.Visit the NHS Inform websitefor more information.Vaccine Passport SchemeThe First Minister has been under pressure from hospitality bosses to scrap Scotlands vaccine passport scheme for late-night bars and clubs.Leaders in the hospitality industry have been demanding an end to the legal requirement for customers and staff to wear face masks in licensed premises.In her update today, Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that the vaccine passport scheme will end on February .Face covering restrictions to end on March The face-covering legal requirement in shops and on public transportwill end on March , Nicola Sturgeon has announced.Ms Sturgeon said: “As of March , assuming no signicant adverse developments in the course of the virus, we expect that the legal requirement to wear face coverings in certain indoor settings and on public transport will be converted to guidance.“However, we will continue to strongly recommend the wearing of face coverings in shops and other indoor public places, and on public transport.”She added: “Even though certain measures, for example face coverings, may not be legal requirements in future, we will still recommend voluntary compliance as part of the range of behaviours that will help keep us safe as we manage Covid in a more sustainable and less restrictive way.”Latest Covid casesToday, , more people have tested positive for #coronavirus, people were in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before.Sadly  more people who tested positive have died Latest update ➡️ https:t.co YnREdCegvpic WCZTIZVjw— Scottish GovernmentFebruary , The First Minister also updated MSPs on the latest Covid figures., more people have tested positive for Coronavirus today, Nicola Sturgeon said.There were , people in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before and  people were in intensive care yesterday with recently confirmed COVID-.more people who tested positive have sadly died which brings the total to , in total.Looking towards vaccination, ,, people have received their first dose of a COVID- vaccination, ,, have received their second dose, and ,, have received a third dose or booster.For more information, visit the Scottish Government website."},{"url":null,"title":"calvin-harris-announces-mystery-scottish-gig---get-tickets","story":"Gigs in Scotland has today released the newsthat Calvin Harris will be coming to Scotland.The musician will be coming to Scotland in summer , but as of yet the location has been kept secret.Those interested in attending can sign up for an exclusive pre-sale on the Ticketmaster website.Harris has not given any hint to the performance on his own social media.The show is part of a number of gigs he will be performing this year, including  exclusive shows in Ibiza.,  px px  rgbamargin: pxmax-width: pxmin-width: pxpadding: width: .%width: -webkit-calcwidth: calc\"\" fill\"#\"View this post on InstagramtranslateY\"translateX translateYwidth: .pxflex-grow: margin-right: pxmargin-left: px\"translateY\"translateY rotate\"\"\"translateX\"A post shared by Gigs in Scotland The DJ and producer will also be ing to Creamfields this summer.

He then spoke to me of affairs of the county.To my delight, he displayed a wide and intimate knowledge of Argyll, a county for which he said he had a deep affection.He was keenly interested in all I told him.After about  minutes# conversation, I asked permission to withdraw but His Majesty said, #Do wait a little longer, please.#I came away with the feeling that I had left a gracious King, a great gentleman and, above all, a good and sincere man. His consideration, courtesy and kindliness, combined with his deep interest in the welfare of his people in Argyll impressed me to the full and are an indelible memory.Campbeltown Town Council resolved into a special public session during the committee meetings on Monday night to offer their respectful sympathy, devotion and loyalty to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, The Queen Mother and members of the Royal Family.Provost R Wallace Greenlees, who presided, rose to remind members of the Town Council of #the sorrowful time# through which the nation was passing and to ask them to approve of the following resolution:The resolution was unanimously carried.These addresses were duly sealed with the Common Seal of the Royal Burgh of Campbeltown and signed in name and on behalf of the Provost, Magistrates and Councillors by Provost R Wallace Greenlees and by Mr A I B Stewart, Town Clerk.Among the messages of condolence sent to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth were:The Lord Lieutenant has received the following acknowledgement from Her Majesty the Queen: #Am sincerely grateful for your message.

in line with a declining population, but previously demolished buildings in adjacent areas – Saddell Street and Queen Street – are now unsightly gap-sites.Local opinion is important, given what has happened in the wake of recent housing demolition. There is concern, often heard in local conversation and frequently discussed on Facebook, of what might happen in the latest round of town planning.To be fair, plans are afoot to replace the same with modern housing – probably less stock to suit the demands that exist in the town at the moment – however, it is really important any proposed build be sensitive in design to suit this prime parkland location, an area fronting onto Kinloch Park and town#s seafront Esplanade.I share this concern, given the results of previous

grappling with a cost of living crisis.On Thursday, Ofgem announced that from April the energy price cap would rise  per cent to £, – that is an extra £ households will have to find just to keep their homes warm and the lights on.Forthcoming increases to the interest rate and rises in National Insurance payments will exacerbate the situation.It is heart-breaking. I have had food bank helpers in tears saying we can#t wait another year for the Right to Food to kick in. People need help now.Food bank volunteers need assurance that the invaluable support they provide in their communities will end one day, when wages and benefits are adequate enough for proud families to be able to stop using the food banks.New statistics show rising homelessness across Scotland.

Avoid plantingthe ground is frozen or extremely waterlogged.Your planting hole should be no deeper than the roots, but at least three times the diameter of the root ball.It#s a good idea to soak bare-rooted trees for about  minutes before planting.Place the tree in the planting hole so the first flare of roots on the stem are level with the soil surface. If you plant the tree too deep, it can result in rot and disease.You may need to insert a stake for top heavy or larger trees. Refill the planting hole, firm gently and water in.Drought stress is common in newly-planted trees so make sure you keep watering throughout the growing season. The quantity required will y with soil type, but  to  litres per square metre – four to six watering cans – each week in dry weather will do the trick.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow lettuce seeds – both under cover and outside.If you start now, it will give you a continuous supply that can be harvested throughout the year.Sow in modules or fibre pots under cover to have lettuces ready to plant outside in four to six weeks.

including Victorian Trout Conspiracy and racecar.However, with live performances shelved due to the Covid- pandemic, it allowed him time to put pen to paper and start piecing together his own album, Panopticon.He said: “I have always been a songwriter.“The bands I perform bass for, I tend to write songs for the bands.“That was always, I suppose, specic to the band and their genre or style and what they do.“It was time for me to do something that was much more up my own alley musically.“I had done solo stuff but never taken it too seriously or had enough time, either side of doing performing and being involved in bands, to pursue it properly.“It was really during the pandemic and being in lockdown that gave me time and space to put some energy into doing my own stuff.“There was definitely a silver lining to the pandemic.“[Usually] you are choc-a-bloc playing gigs and don’t have much time for creative endeavour, especially for your own thing.“It was nice to have a little bit of time to work on that.”The former Knox Academy pupil’s love of music was established when he was a teenager.He attended the Bridge Centre’s Music Project and started playing bass, going on to form punk funk band Edelweiss Pirates with friends.Growing up on Haddington’s Burnside, Calum would then go on to study music at Edinburgh Napier University.The  tracks on his new album were recorded at Venice of the North Studios in Glasgow.Now, after writing, arranging and recording the songs for his debut album, he is waiting on the finished product arriving at his home in the Capital.Calum told the Courier: “I guess I would describe the music as alternative rock with a hint of folk music, as well as traditional music.“I guess I was influenced by a bunch of bands when I was younger and this has carried on through.“I was interested in the Seattle grunge scene and all the alternative rock that came out of that like Nirvana and Pearl Jam, and then I started enjoying Queens Of The Stone Age, Foo Fighters, Radiohead and bands like that.“In terms of songwriters, I am a really big fan of Nick Cave, Tom Waits and the Scottish songwriter John Martyn as well.”As lockdown restrictions ease, the -year-old is hopeful of putting a band together and performing Panopticon, which is released on March , live.He said: “Of course, that’s the actual plan.“In this day and age, you don’t know what is going to happen but that is on the cards!”"},{"url":null,"title":"jackie-bird-visits-newhailes-house-musselburgh-new-podcast-series","story":"Jackie Bird hosted an episode of the series, which tells

decided to highlight five of their favourites that definitely cheer them up!PrimrosesFor a quick splash of colour, you can’t go wrong with primroses.There’s a vast selection available at this time of year and, with an almost infinite palette of colour, it can be dficult to choose your favourites.These low-growing plants are very robust and tolerant of the typically challenging weather we get at this time of year.Although mainly sold for immediate colour, it’s entirely possible that you’ll be able to enjoy their flowers again next year.Their close relative, the polyanthus, is also very striking at this time of year, with a main stem bearing its flowers a few inches off the ground and,you need some height, these could be the answer.HelleboresSometimes known as the Christmas rose, these native woodland perennial plants are ideal for shady corners and under trees.Depending on the iety, they’ll flower from November to February and come back bigger and better year after year.They’re available in a wide range of colours, from the original white to the more modern deep purples and speckled flowers that are so popular today.As always, the key to getting the best from your plant is to consider its native conditions and replicate that where possible. As hellebores are native to woodland, they’ll enjoy plenty of organic matter, so make sure you add some when planting and add mulch from time to time to help retain the moisture in the soil. If you’re planting under trees, they will have to compete for water so you may need to provide water until it is well established. Once it’s well-rooted, the organic matter in the soil, the mulch and its broad leaves will generally maintain adequate moisture levels, although you may need to water occasionallythere’s a particularly dry spell.The real bonus with the hellebore is that, as a perennial, it will continue to grow bigger over time and after a few years you’ll be able to ide it into several plants – and all gardeners just love free plants!Garrya ellipticaSometimes known as the ‘silk tassel’ bush, this medium-sized evergreen shrub is native to coastal areas of America and so it’s quite happy in East Lothian gardens, where salty winds from the North Sea can be testing for our plants.This easy-to-grow shrub is a great addition to the garden, providing a backdrop to the vibrant colours in the summer garden. However, it really comes into its own in the winter garden, when the glossy green leaves provide welcome foliage and an abundance of beautul silk-like tassels at this time of year.Jasminum nudlorumMore commonly known as the winter-flowering jasmine, this deciduous shrub is unusual in that it flowers before producing its foliage.A robust, medium-sized shrub, it’s often trained against a wall or used as ground cover. It is happy in coastal areas and so ideal for our East Lothian gardens.The bright yellow flowers give a wonderful show at this time of year and are a sure sign that spring is on its way! It’s very easy to grow and tolerant of a wide range of conditions.CamelliaSometimes called the Japanese rose, camellias have been cultivated in Chinese and Japanese gardens for many centuries. When the tea trade expanded in the late s, Camellias were imported by the British East India Company for the wealthy British owners and by the s they were considered to be the luxury flower and the height of fashion.With its glossy green leaves and stunning flowers, the evergreen camellia is one of the first shrubs to flower each year.One of our most popular garden plants, it can be grown as a shrub or small tree, and comes in a huge range of dferent shapes, sizes and flower colours. It grows well in both containers and borders, but don’t forget that they prefer acidic soil. If your soil isn’t naturally acidic, add plenty of ericaceous compost around the roots when planting and maintain the pH level by feeding with fertiliser for acid-loving plants.Just one interesting fact – did you know that the most widely grown camellia on earth is the commercial crop, Camellia sinensis  Grown for its leaves, Camellia sinensis is none other than the tea plant, whose leaves are harvested for tea drinkers around the world!Hopefully we’ve given you some ideas that’ll help you add interest to your garden in February. If you’d like more information, please do call in and have a chat with our knowledgeable and experienced plant team – we just love to talk gardening!"},{"url":null,"title":"m-s-pancake-day-2022-range-including-percy-pig-frying-pan-mixes-sauces-spreads","story":"The Percy Pig Pancake Pan is £ and comes with a pancake batter squeezy bottle for precise batter application.MS is also selling a Pancake Party Gt Bag for £ which includes two pancake mixes, maple syrup and recipe cards.In the offer you will get: class\"instagram-media\"data-instgrm-captioneddata-instgrm-permalink\"https:www.instagram p CaFpVBuqJbd  utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading\"data-instgrm-version\"\"style\"background: #fffborder: border-radius: pxbox-shadow:   px  rgba,  px px  rgbamargin: pxmax-width: pxmin-width: pxpadding: width: .%width: -webkit-calcwidth: calc\"href\"https:www.instagram p CaFpVBuqJbd  utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading\"style\"background: #ffffffline-height: padding:  text-align: centertext-decoration: nonewidth: %\"target\"_blank\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: %flex-grow: height: pxmargin-right: pxwidth: px\"style\"display: flexflex-direction: columnflex-grow: justy-content: center\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: pxflex-grow: height: pxmargin-bottom: pxwidth: px\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: pxflex-grow: height: pxwidth: px\"style\"display: block height: px margin:  auto px width: px\"width\"px\"\"px\"viewBox\"   \"version\".\"xmlns\"https:www.w.org  svg\"xmlns:xlink\"https:www.w.org  xlink\"\" fill\"#\"d\"M.,.

Stephen is passionate about pet nutrition.He said: “Traditional syrup-filled human pancakes would not be suitable for dogs as they contain salts, sugars and carbohydrates.“A dog can’t break down the fats and carbs like a human does. If eaten regularly, the result would generally be rapid weight gain which of course can lead to chronic conditions such as diabetes.“Also, more immediate issues may be seen in dogs with allergies, intolerances and particularly sensitive stomachs.”This year pancake day falls on March . Otherwise known as Shrove Tuesday, it is the day before the start of Lent fasting practiced by Christians in the run up to the Easter festival.Pancakes are supposed to use up things like eggs, milk and sugar before the fasting begins.Stephen has designed a recipe especially for dogs to enjoy this Pancake Day, replacing common allergens like wheat flour and cow’s milk with dog-appropriate alternatives.The recipe can be found on the Ocado website, where you can also purchase the necessary ingredients.Ingredients:Step Sieve the flour into a mixing bowl. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the egg and ml of lukewarm water before whisking until the ingredients are fully combined.Step Heat a non-stick frying pan to a medium temperature then add a ladle of the pancake mixture to the pan.Step Cook the pancakes for  seconds on each side before removing from the heat and leaving to cool fully. Add your dog’s favourite toppings and serve.If you’re going to celebrate Pancake Day with your dog, Stephen has three more top tips to ensure you’re prioritising your dog’s

month.However, the transfer has now been put back and is unlikely to happen before April.A council spokesperson said: “We are working very closely with Cruden Homes, who are developing the first -unit phase of new council housing on the Blindwells site.“We are aware of delays in the construction of these homes due to ious material supply and labour issues caused by a combination of Covid-, the impact of Brexit and the Suez Canal blockage crisis.“However, we currently expect handover of the first  units in April.”The Suez Canal is a vital waterway connecting the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea to provide the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe.  It was blocked for six days last March after sea vessel the Ever Given became wedged across it.Hundreds of container vessels and ships were caught up in the logjam created by the blockage, which put the canal – which sees about  per cent of global trade pass through it each day – out of action.The construction industry across Scotland has also been hit by worldwide material shortages, as well as staffing issues caused by the pandemic.The new Blindwells settlement, which sits between Prestonpans, Tranent and Longniddry, is expected to have , homes in total, with further land expected to be expanded into in the future.Under East Lothian Council’s planning policy,  per cent of new housing built by any developer must be affordable.At a virtual meeting of the council this week, it was revealed that the local authority had been expecting to deliver  new council houses in this financial year but delays at Blindwells were likely to have an effect on that final figure.In addition, the council had added  registered social landlordhousing units and  mid-market retail properties.Head of housing Wendy McGuire said

address Boris Johnsons Living with Covid policy and the scrapping of all Coronavirus restrictions in England as of Thursday.This week, Nicola Sturgeon announced her Covid strategic framework also known as a roadmap out of Coronavirus restrictions.Heres what Ms Sturgeon said during her Covid briefing today.Today First Minister @NicolaSturgeon will give an update to @ScotParl on #coronavirus.Watch live ➡️ https:t.co zWDxpMyAe from :pm. pic LKTccbDImNicola Sturgeon expressed frustration over Boris Johnsons approach to Covid testing that he outlined on Monday.The Scottish Government is \"determined to retain\" free Covid testing, in contrast to England.Nicola Sturgeon criticised the decision by Boris Johnson to end universally free testing and said that the Scottish Government was looking for clarity on funding for the testing programme for devolved countries.Ms Sturgeon said: “Current funding arrangements mean that though taxpayers in all four UK nations contribute to the costs, it is decisions taken for England that determine the resources available to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for testing and other Covid measures.“As of now, we have no clarity on how much of the Covid testing infrastructure the UK government intends to retain no clarity on how much investment will support it in future and no clarity on whether the Treasury will provide additional resources to pay for it or demand instead that funding is taken from where in the health budget.“I hope we get this clarity soon so that we can out in more detail our longer-term approach to testing.“However, and I will say more later, I want to give an assurance that the Scottish Government is determined to retain a robust testing system capable of providing Scotland with strong resilience against future Covid threats, and firmly aligned with public health advice and the principles underpinning our National Health Service.”                                                                                                              : Nicola Sturgeon update LIVE as Covid roadmap published: Covid Scotland: Vaccine passports scrapped and changes to face mask rules                                                                                                              This weeks announcement coincides with the publication of the Scottish Governments Covid strategic framework.Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish Government’s strategy was now to “manage Covid effectively, primarily through adaptations and health measures that strengthen our resilience and recovery”.In her statement to MSPs, the First Minister said: “Widespread vaccination coverage and better treatments have reduced the direct harms of the virus.“As a result, using restrictions to suppress infection is no longer as necessary as it once was.“And, given the wider harms caused by protective measures, it is no longer as justiable either.“The strategic framework therefore makes clear that in future we will rely less on legally imposed measures to control the virus – and more on vaccines, treatments, and sensible adaptations and good public health behaviours.”The framework sets out three broad levels on how the Government may respond to potential iants that could see restrictions reimposed, Nicola Sturgeon had said.Setting out the contingency strategy for low, medium and high risks, the First Minister told MSPs: “If a new iant emerged that was more transmissible and more severe, perhaps with the ability to evade vaccine or natural immunity, this would likely be classied as high risk.\"In those circumstances, we might advise people to limit social contacts for a period and to work from home where possible and we may introduce some temporary protections for high-risk settings.“If a new iant was either more transmissible or more severe, but not both, as is the case with Omicron, the initial threat assessment would likely be medium.\"In these circumstances, there may be a legal requirement to wear face coverings in some settings and we might issue guidance for businesses and service providers on reasonable measures to reduce the spread of Covid on their premises.“Lastly, in the absence of a new iant, ora new iant was neither more transmissible nor more severe, andvaccines continue to be effective, the threat classication would likely remain low. Obviously, this is the level we hope to reach and stay at on a sustainable basis.“In these circumstances, there would be no legally imposed protective measures. Instead, we would continue to advise iniduals and organisations to adopt sensible public health behaviours.”People who test positive for Covid- should continue to isolate in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed.The legal requirement for infected people to self-isolate in England will be lted from Thursday, Boris Johnson announced on Monday.Although there has never been a legal requirement in Scotland, Ms Sturgeon said the guidance to isolate would remain.In her update to the Scottish Parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: “This new approach will see us resort much less, hopefully not at all, to legally imposed protective measures.“Instead, we will rely predominantly on vaccines, treatments and sensible public health behaviours and adaptations.“However much as we might wish it was not the case, Covid is still a public health risk here and globally and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future so we must also remain vigilant and prepared.”Vaccination appointments for the vulnerable -

With no formal education his innovative ideas and shrewd business sense he has created a name for himself as the brains behind the iconic luxury Edinburgh Cashmere brand, as well as Edinburgh Lambswool and DC Milan.Not only that, but for the past five years, he has been focusing his attention on the development of healthy fast food, with an exciting new ‘DC Tasty’ franchise in the making and expected to launch in the near future.Another of DC’s latest business ventures has seen him expand into the technology sector, working hard behind the scenes to create a mobile taxi app which will see taxi drivers making more money and customers making huge savings as well as being environmentally friendly. It’s an exciting new project set to launch imminently, and could well turn out to be DC’s most lucrative yet. Set to be the first of many new app-related products, he’s remaining tight-lipped about what  we can expect in that respect - but no doubt, all will be revealed before long.Working with multinational businesses and investors and providing companies and brands with advice on how to develop their businesses to a higher level, so experienced is DC in the entrepreneurial space that he is now using his know-how to help others to see success. But he didn’t arrive at this privileged point in le overnight, and it has taken over fourteen years of hard work, trial and error, and risk-taking to get to where he is today.It all began back in  when, whilst working as a sales assistant, DC was the first person to recognise that Edinburgh had the largest number of cashmere shops in the world. It was this that sparked his inspiration to create the brand Edinburgh Cashmere, and he wasted no time in bringing his brainwave to fruition.It took hour upon hour of relentless research and endless time and attention to achieve his goal of becoming one of the top designers, manufacturers and wholesalers of pure cashmere and pure lambswool in the UK and Europe - and only recently, DC has gone on to successfully launch Edinburgh Cashmere in The United Arab Emirates and also soon to launch in the USA. One of his major accomplishments was to be the first person in the world to produce  dferent clan cashmere scarves - something of which he is understandably very proud.DC oversees every aspect of his production, from designing through to completion, in his own factory, as well as dealing directly with sustainable cashmere and lambswool farms, ensuring luxury quality and value goes into each and every product. His speciality is his up-to-the-minute designs in Monogram and Jacquard, featuring his DC monogram logo - which have become instantly recognisable to fans of his work, and immensely popular, too.He also created what he describes as one of the worlds most famous designs - the DC Classic Check. His new  collection of scarves, stoles and capes is set to make waves in the fashion industry over the coming months, and with a quick glance at what is in store, it’s easy to see why.DC’s passion for quality has allowed him to collaborate with multi-millionaire Italian and French fashion brand companies on a iety of high-profile projects, having recently branched out into supplying premier football clubs with merchandise.As we said, he certainly isn’t one to rest on his laurels, and when it comes to business, it seems his inspired ideas just keep on coming. He has also gone on to successfully create and launch men’s fashion brand DC Milan menswear, which specialises in jeans, sweatshirts and jackets - and each and every piece is designed and manufactured from scratch by DC himself. Each garment is painstakingly embellished with original, hand finished embroidery, one of which is the iconic Celtic Horse design symbolising winning and victory - something that ensures his work always stands out from the crowd.DC’s passion for quality and design has, in his words, allowed him to take his companies and brands to international levels in a short time. His business acumen and celebrity status have even seen himself and his company’s brands appearing in the likes of prestigious media titles like GQ, Tatler, Grazia and both the UK and USA editions of Vogue.DC’s hard work and dogged determination have certainly merited him to call himself \"the proud owner of his many prosperous businesses’’. Every business he has created is a massive success. And it seems that as far as his business endeavours are concerned, he still has many more, DC’s original and inspirational ideas are endless.With an exciting year ahead as he continues to branch out from the fashion world into building, food and technology, his track record means we can expect nothing less than to see big things from DC. And with his new taxi app and healthy fast food franchise likely to be only the tip of the iceberg, we can’t wait to see what he comes up with next.This article was brought to you by DC Singhwww.edinburghcashmere  www.edinburghlambswool  www.dcmilan  www.dcsingh Instagram https:www.instagram dcsingh_  Facebook  https:www.facebook dcsinghd Twitter  https:twitter dcsingh_ s"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12967295.jpg?type=article-full","title":"edinburgh-landlords-turning-backs-airbnb-short-term-lets-clampdown","story":"It came after Edinburgh City Council’s planning committee on Wednesday unanimously voted to bring in new measures to designate the entire city a Short Term Letcontrol zone.Malcolm Pickard, of property management firm Tay Letting, says the new rules,approved, mark a ‘tipping point’ for STL landlords, many of whom have already struggled through the Covid- pandemic, with tighter control of the loosely regulated sector meaning running costs are almost certain to rise to impractical levels.Read more: Glasgow suspends its twinning links with Russian city after Ukraine invasionMr Pickard said Tay Letting has seen a sharp rise in enquiries from STL landlords since the start of the year, with many concerned about the impact of the proposed regulations voted through on Wednesday.The proposals, which are still to be approved by the Scottish Government, mean landlords wishing to list properties that are not their usual home would need to apply for a ‘change of use’ through the city council’s planning department.Edinburgh City Council’s planning committee on Wednesday unanimously voted to bring in new measures to designate the entire city a Short Term Let Although it is yet to be confirmed how this will be implemented, Mr Pickard believes it is likely to mean property owners will have to adhere to much tighter rules in order for properties to be let out legally.Mr Pickard, Director at Tay Letting, which manages more than , properties in the Private Rental Sectoracross Edinburgh, Dundee and Glasgow, said: “We have already seen an exodus from the short term let market into the private rental sector since the Covid- pandemic began when the market was virtually wiped out. Those who have toughed it out or ed to the STL market were probably hopeful of recovery, butapproved by the Scottish Government, this move from the city council will prove the tipping point for most.“Since the start of the year we’ve seen dozens of landlords come to us to inquire about switching from short term lets to private rentals. One property owner, who lets out two of their three city centre properties on Airbnb, plans to move them all to private rental as it’s no longer worth it. Others have seen this move coming and decided STL is no longer for them.“The gross income from short term lets is the big attraction for owners, but these new regulations are likely to mean tighter control around things such as gas and electrical safety certicates short-term rental registration water safety certicates furniture and appliance checks and more, and that all brings with it additional costs many will not be prepared to swallow.“Short term lets were once something that could be run personally, but in recent years we’ve seen more people using agencies to manage properties. With added regulation, those fees plus the cost of compliance with what could be very tight regulation will likely prove too costly. Landlords can already get this in the PRS with far less risk, hassle and time commitment, not to mention the added wear and tear on property associated with short term lets.\"Read more: Rare dolls house sells for more than £,He said they had heard horror stories of buildings containing seven short term lets, and it can be a nightmare for longer-term residents. Mr Pickard added there was heightened concern too around vulnerable residents when there is a high level of transient footfall.“There will be a few winners from the change – most notably landlords with front-door entry properties that meet the likely requirements for short-term let licences, but those with properties in shared closes etc will be very likely to look for alternative means of making money from their property,\" he added.A ‘short term let control zone’ could be created across the capital“There’s no doubt action was needed, and it will be interesting to see how things play out – particularly around what is required to obtain a short term let licence.”He added: “A continuation in the flow of traffic from short term lets to the private rental sector – which of course increases the supply of properties – is likely to have a plateauing effect on rents, which will be good for renters in the short term. We did, however, see this during and after the pandemic, but rental prices began to rise again as demand inevitably increased and I’d expect to see the same happen again.“Ultimately it’s too early to call what the long-term impact of this will be, but Edinburgh is not the only city in Scotland with a shortage of property for rent, and I fully expect other councils to be watching the progress of the short term let control zone closely.”Malcolm Pickard of Tay Letting A consultation on the plans found % of respondents are in favour of the control zone covering the whole Edinburgh City Council area.The City of Edinburgh Councils planning committee unanimously backed the plans to require a change of use application on Wednesday, an outcome convener Neil Gardiner hailed as \"great news for people across the city\".The Scottish Government will now need to agree with the city council, which said the new rules would not block people from renting out rooms or their whole house while on holiday.Mr Gardiner said: \"If approved by Government, these new powers for Edinburgh will provide the clarity we need where planning permission is required for a change of use.\"Just now,its reported to us that a property has changed its use without planning permission, our enforcement team has to look at each case inidually.\"This is a very y and time-consuming process.\""},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

I don’t want to hear any more of this, I came here to say what actually happened.”He denied ever meeting Mr Ibbotson, despite a text message he had allegedly sent him telling him to come to his house and collect £ in cash.Ms McGahey said: “These are unofficial grey flights and you knew they were.”“I never knew anything about David Henderson’s business,” Mr McKay replied.Mr McKay had to be repeatedly interrupted by Coroner Rachael Grfin when he became angry about lines of questioning.At one point she was forced to remind him that contempt of court is an offence that can carry a sentence of imprisonment.Matthew Reeve, for Mr Sala’s family, asked why Mr McKay had not offered his family’s own plane, a King Air , to transport the player.Mr McKay said it was because the plane was getting its propellers serviced, but Mr Reeve suggested the company servicing the plane were refusing to release it until the McKay family paid its bill.The agent replied: “This is to discredit me. I came here in good faith. It is of no relevance at all whether I owe anyone money.”Earlier, Mr McKay had said he only wanted to help Mr Sala get home, and claimed Cardf City had “abandoned” him.Askedthere was anything he wanted to tell the inquest, he said: “Myself, Jack and Mark tried to help Emi to get home – publicity wise what we went through is hell.”The inquest has heard Mr Sala was overcome by toxic levels of carbon monoxide poisoning prior to dying from severe head and chest injuries consistent with a plane crash.On Wednesday, the jury were told that Mr Ibbotson had been barred from flying the Piper Malibu by its owner after receiving two notices of airspace infringements from the CAA. He had continued to fly the plane without her knowledge.The inquest is due to last around a month.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

When he speaks they listen, he leads by example.“We’re really pleased with the job Tom Curry did. He did an outstanding job as a young captain and he’s going to be an outstanding leadership prospect in the future.”Ben Youngs can become England’s most-capped player on Saturday, surpassing Jason Leonard’s landmark of , but the achievement must be reached as a replacement for Harry Randall.Randall impressed in the five-try rout of Italy in round two to the point that, for now at least, he has been elevated above Youngs in the scrum-half pecking order. vw,vw,px, px\"Joe Marchant has been called up “We want to put some pace in the game early. We feel like there will be opportunities against Wales early in the game and Harry each week has been in increasingly better form,” Jones said.“He’s sharp around the ruck, gives us that instinctiveness with his ability to take quick taps and run quickly. And then we have Ben Youngs to finish the game.“These games go to the wire, it’s like a built-in narrative, and imagine having a half-back with  caps in the best form of his career coming on to manage that last  minutes.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?1645089617000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220217news1 700 people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland.

Mr Roddy said he is an advocate of an all-island soccer league which would bring people from dferent communities together.“I believe that an all-island league would encourage young people to visit all the stadiums throughout the country,” the Derry man added.That proposal was backed by an audience member who argued that clubs from Northern Ireland could bring thousands of fans across the border and vice versa which would be a boost for local economies. He asserted that opposition to proposals are nonsensical. Another audience member spoke of the need to include minority ethnic communities, such as the large Polish community, who have made Ireland their home.He referenced the many Ukranian people who will now been displaced, a portion of whom will come to Ireland.Panel members said that conversation is moving at pace but meaningful progress towards inclusivity will take time.Minister for Sport Jack Chambers TD concluded: “Sport is an important source of civic pride, but is so much more than that.It improves our health, helps us meet new and erse people and is the foundation for communities right across this island.“We have a long and vibrant tradition of collaboration in sport across the island.Many of our sporting bodies are organised at an all-island level our international teams in sports as erse as rugby, cricket and hockey draw on the talent of people from all parts of this island for their success and, our Olympic heroes come from all backgrounds, cultures and traditions, representing the full ersity of communities and traditions on the island of Ireland.”Most ReadDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson ‘was in discussions’ to quit the partySnow arrives in Northern Ireland: Transport disrupted and schools closed as Met Office issue further ice warningSchools# Cup hockey semi-finals: Methody to face Armagh Royal in final after tight victories at Comber RoadShow respect for stage performers, says comic John Linehan, after Lyric Theatre show halted due to audience behaviourSuzanne BreenOpinionHe may never admit it, but Sir Jeffrey Donaldson may rue the day he didn’t say ‘I do’ to Doug BeattieTop VideosPlayBelfast wakes up to a blanket of snowPlayResident of eastern Ukraine city films shellingPlayVideo: Heavily armed police storm Bow Street Mall after reports of man with gun and kneLatest Northern IrelandDonaldson says he makes no apologies for engaging with other unionistsDUP and Sinn Fein in war of words over critical state of Northern Ireland’s health serviceSnow and ice are set to hit parts of the countryNorthern Ireland’s driest day in spring  predictedCancers services in Northern Ireland facing ‘massive perfect storm’, MLAs warnedLatestHarry and Meghan to be recognised for social justice work at NAACP Image AwardsJames Maddison nets twice at Randers as Leicester ease into last Labour MPs withdraw from anti-Nato statement after threat to lose whipDonaldson says he makes no apologies for engaging with other unionistsPeter Gabriel leads celebrity reaction to unfolding Ukraine crisis,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

So large was the crowd wishing to attend, that the doors had to be closed and hundreds were unable to attend, a report reads.By this time the club was renamed the Victoria Amateur Swimming Club and Le-Saving Society and, in , the Victoria-Ormeau Ladies Club amalgamated with the club, as mixed bathing was becoming the norm.The Belfastmet up with club members June McKee, who is in her early s, Brigid Blackand Dorcas Peshkin who — despite being  years young — only retired from being a swimming instructor at the onset of the pandemic.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Brigid#s mother, Mary Cummings, who passed away in , was the club#s treasurer for many years, while Dorcas and June served tenures as secretaries.I first started with the club in , when I was knee-high to a daisy, with my brother, who would have been friends with Dorcas, June said.Dorcas and the older ladies were great swimmers and I was a bit of a fill-in, I tortured them! Over the years the numbers of members went down. Kids these days aren#t as interesting in swimming, it#s all football, football, football. I think swimming is better for kids — football is not going to save their le.My fondest memories of the club are back in the s with Dorcas and my brother and everyone, going to galas every weekend. It was such a great time. It#s a shame we couldn#t keep it going, because so many people like us were raised through the club.Dorcas joined the club with her brothers in the s and says she loved training and the competitive era of the club.I made le-long friends and a lot of champions came out of Victoria. I was a breast stroke and butterfly swimmer and swam in the Irish Championships and was an Ulster Champion — I always seemed to come second in the Irish! she said.I was club secretary for ten years and you do make great friendships in swimming. Although I don#t come much these days, I have other interests, Dorcas said with a smile, It is the end of an era.There was so much of a social le to it. We would go to Dublin or Cork or wherever for the championships and there were always dances afterwards — or we would run the championships over again in the sea for packets of crisps. The one thing about swimming clubs was they were always very mixed.”The club later moved to the old Grove Baths on the Shore Road, which was later demolished to make way for the current Grove Wellbeing Centre.In recent years, however, logistical problems and dwindling numbers has resulted in Victoria Swimming Club making the sad decision to disband.Brigid’s family ran a grocery and bakery on the Antrim Road and her mother first heard about the club from a customer.It was very turbulent times on the Antrim Road so we loved coming down to the Grove.”Most ReadDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson ‘was in discussions’ to quit the partySnow arrives in Northern Ireland: Transport disrupted and schools closed as Met Office issue further ice warningSuzanne BreenOpinionHe may never admit it, but Sir Jeffrey Donaldson may rue the day he didn’t say ‘I do’ to Doug BeattieWhat Russian attack on Ukraine could mean for Northern IrelandShow respect for stage performers, says comic John Linehan, after Lyric Theatre show halted due to audience behaviourTop VideosPlayBelfast wakes up to a blanket of snowPlayResident of eastern Ukraine city films shellingPlayVideo: Heavily armed police storm Bow Street Mall after reports of man with gun and kneLatest Northern IrelandDonaldson says he makes no apologies for engaging with other unionists following claims he contemplated rejoining UUPDUP and Sinn Fein in war of words over critical state of Northern Ireland’s health serviceSnow and ice are set to hit parts of the countryNorthern Ireland’s driest day in spring  predictedCancers services in Northern Ireland facing ‘massive perfect storm’, MLAs warnedLatestEngland centre Manu Tuilagi ruled out of Wales clash through injuryBiden hits Russia with new sanctions and says Putin ‘chose’ warFootball agent denies knowingly organising ‘grey’ flight for Emiliano SalaIreland will back ‘strongest possible’ sanctions against RussiaHarry and Meghan to be recognised for social justice work at NAACP Image Awards,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I don’t want to hear any more of this, I came here to say what actually happenedWillie McKay when questioned about Mr Sala#s flightCathryn McGahey QC, representing Cardf City FC, said: “We have heard the term ‘grey flights’ meaning flights by private planes that are not allowed to carry paying passengers that do carry paying passengers – because that’s what Mr Henderson was offering.“He had no commercial licence to carry paying passengers.”Willie McKay replied: “I never knew anything about his business, all I knew is that we’d phone him and ask him to take us somewhere.”The agent was read a statement from Mr Henderson alleging he had told Mr McKay the flights were private, and that he had no licence to act as an air taxi or run charter flights.Mr McKay said he had never heard this, and claimed he could not rememberhe paid Mr Henderson in cash despite taking  flights with him over the previous  years.In an angry outburst, Mr McKay said: “This is a character assassination. I don’t want to hear any more of this, I came here to say what actually happened.”He denied ever meeting Mr Ibbotson, despite a text message he had allegedly sent him telling him to come to his house and collect £ in cash.Ms McGahey said: “These are unofficial grey flights and you knew they were.”“I never knew anything about David Henderson’s business,” Mr McKay replied.Myself, Jack and Mark tried to help Emi to get home - publicity wise what we went through is hellWillie McKayMr McKay had to be repeatedly interrupted by Coroner Rachael Grfin when he became angry about lines of questioning.At one point she was forced to remind him that contempt of court is an offence that can carry a sentence of imprisonment.Matthew Reeve, for Mr Sala’s family, asked why Mr McKay had not offered his family’s own plane, a King Air , to transport the player.Mr McKay said it was because the plane was getting its propellers serviced, but Mr Reeve suggested the company servicing the plane were refusing to release it until the McKay family paid its bill.The agent replied: “This is to discredit me. I came here in good faith. It is of no relevance at all whether I owe anyone money.”Earlier, Mr McKay had said he only wanted to help Mr Sala get home, and claimed Cardf City had “abandoned” him.Askedthere was anything he wanted to tell the inquest, he said: “Myself, Jack and Mark tried to help Emi to get home – publicity wise what we went through is hell.”The inquest has heard Mr Sala was overcome by toxic levels of carbon monoxide poisoning prior to dying from severe head and chest injuries consistent with a plane crash.On Wednesday, the jury were told that Mr Ibbotson had been barred from flying the Piper Malibu by its owner after receiving two notices of airspace infringements from the CAA.

Craig Harkness, Ross Connolly and Darren Cassells on the wings were making super tackles when required, while Andrew Mullholand kept the opposition outside the circle.Bangor won a short corner, but Ballynahinch kept the ball out and go on the attack. Leslie Harrison found Alex Millar and he passed the ball to Hugo Melville who attacked up the right hand side before being stopped in his tracks.Before the end of the first quarter Bangor ed to the lsquoHinch circle and took the lead with a tap-in at the back post.With both sides now settled in, the second quarter was full of end to end action. Matthew Martin made a break through the Bangor defence and passed the ball to forward Jason Campbell who won a short corner. Bangor were able to stop the Hinch drag flick from the top of the circle.With Bangor on the front foot and looking to increase their lead they applied the pressure on lsquoHinch. They moved the ball around looking for an opening and went further in front with a shot which came off the back board.lsquoHinch kept the heads and created chances, but they couldnrsquot stop Bangor going - in front.In the third quarter Ballynahinch kept trying to get on the score sheet with Ashley Brown, Andrew Mulholland, Leslie Harrison and Alex Millar all working hard.Hinch started to creep up the pitch and Matthew Martin created a channel for the ball to be fired up to Jason Campbell, whose attempted pass to Michael Carney was unfortunately intercepted.Bangor were able to create several chances in the Hinch circle, only to be stopped by keeper Aaron Donnell, Ashley Brown and Andrew Mulholland.

This was a warning sign of things to come as just moments later McCoubrey managed to put the ball into the net courtesy of the outside of his right boot after a scramble in the box.Again, Carryduff showed their resilience and still relied on their counterattacks, the latest coming from captain Conway, although his misjudged pass denied team-mate David Quigley a chance at goal.The pressure would continue to mount on the Carryduff back line and soon it was - as McCoubrey registered his second of the match mdash albeit through an unorthodox but neat finish.Celtic defender Blaine Connolly saw his effort fantastically thwarted by Carryduff lsquokeeper Leggett, who pounced to the bottom right corner of his net with a strong outstretched arm to deny further punishment.The weather began to give its input into the game as temperatures ped bitterly and the wind began to blow harshly at intervals.Although this cannot be cited as the determining factor in this contest by any stretch of the imagination, it certainly played its part when Carryduffrsquos Emmet Curran saw his through ball carried beyond its intended target.Carryduff did manufacture a rare breakaway and it looked asstriker Jonathan Wilkinson would open the away sidersquos account when a pass from midfield left him with just lsquokeeper Curran to beat.However, an impressive last-ditch tackle from defender Gary Carberry allowed the Celtic number five to hook the ball to safety, thus further frustrating the opposition.Celticrsquos Shaun Megahey saw his left-footed effort saved before Carryduffrsquos Joseph McBrien swept up the loose ball and in the last notable action of the half, Conway witnessed his lowly struck effort palmed away from danger by the Hoopsrsquo number one.As the second half kicked off, the home side showed no signs of relenting as they pushed for more goals.Conaill Kerr saw his point-blank effort superbly saved from six yards by lsquokeeper Leggett, who, despite the score line, made numerous contributions to prevent his side conceding into double figures.This over-eagerness from the hosts would cost them as they were caught short at the back, leaving Raymond Grant unmarked  yards from goal.The striker quickly picked his spot and unleashed a lovely curled effort into the top right hand corner to get his side off the mark.Unfortunately for Carryduff, this was as good as it got as Celtic replied almost immediately with McMahon grabbing his second of the matchafter rounding the lsquokeeper for an easy tap in.Things went from bad to worse for the away team when Stephen Galbraith slipped a pass into the path of team-mate Conaill Kerr, who made no mistake with his finish in the one-on-one scenario.At this point Carryduff were aiming for damage limitation but Celtic smelt blood. McMahon completed his hat-trick with an eye-catching acrobatic effort before McCoubrey, tapped in his third of the day.Hoops defender Carberry picked up a yellow card after some unsavoury words with the official and captain Michael Rice was left red-faced after midfielder Curran knocked the ball between his legs, but the home outfit didnrsquot let that deter them from their onslaught.Carberry atoned for his booking in the form of a late header from a Galbraith corner delivery to round off the scoring at -.After the match, hat-trick hero Sean McMahon gave his thoughts on his sidersquos resounding victory.ldquoIt was a good performance, he said. ldquoWe knew they only had  players so we had a good chance of winning but you have to play the  minutes and make sure you get the victory at the end of the day.ldquoWersquove put pressure on the league leaders, itrsquos good to score three goals but the main thing is to get the three points.He added: ldquoI donrsquot usually score headers so thatrsquos my pick of the goals for me.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, B Connolly, R Fitzpatrick, G Carberry, M Rice , B Treacy, C McCartan, S McMahon, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.

Improved disabled access is also part of the investment plan which will result in a number of paths being widened.Council officials say the planned improvements are essential for local people who are increasingly using the trails as part of their daily routine and commute.Since the start of the Covid pandemic, there has been a major increase in the number of people walking along the banks of the Quoile with this set to increase over the spring and summer.Council chairwoman Cathy Mason and Downpatrick councillors Oonagh Hanlon and Gareth Sharvin are delighted with the master plan and the benefit that it will provide for the town, its residents and visitors.Cllr Mason said due to Covid- restrictions, many areas across the district have experienced an increased use of outdoor spaces.ldquoThis has been so important for the health and wellbeing of residents and visitors to our area, she continued.ldquoThe Quoile in particular has been extremely busy with families and friends using the location for running, walking, cycling or simply meeting up with each other. The need for good quality outdoor space has never been as important.Cllr Hanlon said she was ldquoexcited to see the first phase of the local authorityrsquos Covid recovery scheme being rolled out.ldquoI am pleased the work will include enhancing boardwalks and paths at Jane Shore with improved disability access in particular at the gates which will be of particular interest to local anglers who have lobbied for better access, she said.ldquoThis work is vital in enhancing the tourist and heritage offerings we have locally and create better linkages to the town centre.Cllr Sharvin said the joint local authority and government department investment will signicantly improve access along the Janes Shore area and help disabled anglers in particular who have highlighted with him the challenges they face of accessing the walkway.ldquoThe planned improvements will enable everyone to enjoy the uniqueness of the Quoile area as a recreational and tourism asset, he said.Cllr Sharvin said work to resurface the footpath, replace wooden fencing and walking boards, in tandem with the provision of new accessibility gates and cutting back trees and hedging will make a major dference.He said the foliage will be cut back next month and when that is completed, it is hoped that work on the other planned improvements will get underway.The Quoile Angling Club is holding its annual meeting in Murphyrsquos bar, Downpatrick, on March  at pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Preservation order put on hold pending planning application  ","story":"A DECISION to make a preservation order to protect trees at the centre of the Exploris Ropebridge car park project in Portaferry has been put on hold.The Department of Infrastructureconfirmed this week that it will wait for the outcome of a planning application before it decides what to do with the trees that local people are campaigning to save.Ards and North Down Borough Council lodged a planning application with its own planning department last December  to gain permission to build an extended car and coach on its own land near the popular visitor venue.The project has been controversial since local conservationists discovered last year that in order to build the car-park, nine mature protected trees would need to be removed.It was later confirmed that the council did not have the authority to remove the trees under a permitted development and needed to apply for planning permission for the car-park which should have been competed by next month.The Portaferry Stop The Trees campaign gathered more than , names in opposition to the trees cull and even offered the council an alternative design which would have saved the trees but resulted in less parking spaces. The design was rejected by the council.The campaign started last May when contractors turned up with equipment and portacabins and marked the trees for felling.Local resident Lily Devlin noticed the development and started the campaign, first rallying support via her Facebook page, and then starting an online petition.Speaking on behalf of the Save the Trees Campaign group, Cathie McKimm said: ldquoThe council got this wrong from the beginning.ldquoWe now have a situation where the council are applying for planning permission for a project they have already appointed contractors for and the project has increased by almost % in cost.ldquoIn bringing in experts to late at a huge cost to the ratepayer to fix the many mistakes theyrsquove made, including failing to include a drainage system in a flood risk area, the council are now having to contribute more than pound, to this scheme and growing, whereas before they were only contributing approximately pound, for the same scheme. ldquoGiven all the conflicts of interest that the council now have we do not believe they can assess this planning application objectively, and believe that the Department of Infrastructure needs to call it in and conduct a full investigation about how this has been handled.A council spokesman confirmed that a planning application for the project would follow regulations which apply to all councils throughout Northern Ireland in making its decision.He said: ldquoThe council will let matters follow due process, mindful of the procedures put in place by the Department for such planning applications.He also confirmed that the project, which was planned as a local tourism boost, had increased in costs.ldquoThe council has applied for and obtained funding of pound, towards the project. At the start of the regeneration scheme, the proposed costs were circa pound,, he said.ldquoHowever, with the passage of time, increased construction costs and refinement of the scheme , the costs were last estimated at circa pound, which was agreed by council in October .A DfI spokesperson confirmed it had initially considered making a preservation order on the trees.He added: ldquoHowever, on January  , the council confirmed that it had instead opted to submit a planning application. This was lodged on December  to the Planning Service of the council. The necessity of whether it is expedient to complete the process of making a TPO is on hold pending the outcome of the planning application..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Smell wind of change as lambs leap around fields  ","story":"IT is spring again in Lecale and new le abounds in the fields. Daffodils are peaking out of the ground, the weather is softening, and the feast of St Brigidrsquos Day , February , has passed.This can mean only one thing ndash lambs! In fact, lambs have been born in our practice since before Christmas. But the majority will be coming to a field near you over the next few weeks.Now, modern flocks have a lot of sheep in them. Indeed, there are about five million sheep in Ireland overall. Thatrsquos one for every man, woman and child.Our domestic sheepis descended from a primitive European ancestor, today found mainly in Corsica. In the past it was common for sheep to havejust one lamb. But today, thanks to better feeding, shelter and shepherding, it is possible for sheep to have twins, triplets and even quads!This abundance can come with problems though. Whata sheep doesnrsquot have enough milk to feed this many lambs  Well, farmers have come up with a number of solutions.The first is lsquopet lambsrsquo. These lambs are hand reared. They are fed with a bottle using condensed milk from commercial suppliers. Or the milk can be taken from another ewe who is producing a lot.As anyone with a baby will tell you, this solution is labour intensive and will keep the shepherd working around the clock. But they are dedicated, and they do it! It is not always sustainable in the long run. Another solution is fostering.Lamb fostering is where a ewe adopts the lamb from another ewe. The reasons for fostering can be manold. A lack of milk is one of the major reasons. The ewe may not want to take on another lamb, not recognising it as her own, but shepherds have adapted one of naturersquos many wonders to encourage it to happen.They use a technique called olfactory imprinting. Have you ever wondered how a ewe can recognise her own lamb in a flock of hundreds  One reason is that, just after birth, the ewe learns the smell of her newborn. This is what olfactory imprinting means.Shepherds can take advantage of this amazing process by rubbing some of the birthing fluid of the newborn lamb into the wool of the lamb to be fostered. The ewe will then accept the lamb as one of her own, and feed and care for it. The lives of many lambs are saved in this way.So when you next look at the fields of Lecale, check out the sheep and seeyou can tell them apart. Evenyou canrsquot, their mums can!.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ulster Aviation Society left ‘dismayed’ over council at Festival of Flight decision  ","story":"THE decision by Newry, Mourne and Down Council to cancel this summerrsquos international Festival of Flight in Newcastle was taken without consulting one of its key partners, it has emerged.Last weekrsquos decision to pull the plug on the event mdash which was last held in  mdash was taken in secret during a meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Tourist and Regeneration Committee.It is understood that no contact was made with the Ulster Aviation Society which has played a major role since the inaugural festival and described its disappointment at the cancellation decision.Regularly attracting in the region of , people to the resort in the summer, the flagship tourist event has been a major success for over a decade.Council officials say that due to the challenges in planning such a major festival, securing commitments from participants and with the uncertainty caused to date by the pandemic, organising this yearrsquos event would not be possible.Some councillors believe that given the local authorityrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parades in Downpatrick and Newry are set to go ahead next month and with the further easing of Covid regulations, some form of airshow could have been organised for Newcastle this summer.This week, Slieve Croob councillor Alan Lewis urging the council to confirm that next yearrsquos festival will go ahead.The Ulster Aviation Society said it was ldquodisappointed and dismayed about the cancellation of the airshow and the fact that the organisation had not been consulted.Society chairman Ray Burrows said it was ldquoastonishing that the event had been ldquoshot down in secret, with no reasonable explanation.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke has urged the local council to ldquograsp the opportunity and organise an alternative event, suggesting a large scale festival that incorporates and builds on the most popular elements of the Festival of Flight.He is keen to see an event showcasing the regionrsquos ldquooutstanding food and drink offering with Newcastle a designated venue for arts, culture and music events to create opportunities showcasing the entrepreneurial spirit and pioneering innovation of the district.Mr Burrows said while these were ldquoall excellent suggestions, he said as elements in addition to, or within, the Festival of Flight, surely not as a replacement for it.He continued: ldquoThat said, we would be pleased indeed to meet with the council or the mayor to discuss the matter. We want to help Newcastle demonstrate in a powerful, popular way how important our aviation future and heritage are to Northern Ireland.ldquoThatrsquos exactly what did in recent years, before Covid.ldquoWe [the UAS] had probably the most popular exhibition within the ground-based event and thousands of parents have brought their children for photographs in our Spitfire and our Alouette helicopter, at no charge.Mr Burrows suggested that unless the councilrsquos decision is reversed, or at least re-assessed, he expects there will be tremendous disappointment from the public.The international festival was cancelled in  because of bad weather and in  and last year because of the Covid- pandemic it was also grounded.Urging the local authority to confirm that it will be chocks away for next summerrsquos Festival of Flight, Cllr Lewis said that for the past two years, the organisation has been unable to deliver a tourism events programme due to the impact of Covid-.ldquoAlthough the possible impact of future Covid iants is dficult to predict, it is hoped that larger scale events can resume this summer. This will be a welcome boost to residents and the local trade and hospitality sectors, he continued.ldquoCouncil research indicates that almost poundm was generated in  for the district as a direct result of tourism events. Therefore, it is bitterly disappointing that this yearrsquos Festival of Flight will not be going ahead.Cllr Lewis said the income that it would have generated would be a welcome boost to traders in the town and benefit the collective tourism industry across South Down.He continued: ldquoWe must not underestimate the huge draw of this annual festival. I note that council officers have said that throughout this past  months they had continued to engage with key stakeholders including the RAF.ldquoIt was advised that due to challenges planning the festival, securing air assets and the uncertainty of the pandemic that it has not been possible to host the festival of flight this year.Cllr Lewis revealed that he has been contacted by many aviation enthusiasts who are bitterly disappointed that the festival wonrsquot go ahead.He added: ldquoI fail to see how the event couldnrsquot have at least been planned for later in the year, now that we know the majority of restrictions are to be lted. I am asking the council to alleviate fears by confirming that the Festival of Flight hasnrsquot be shelved.

Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.The NASA joint effort with the European Space Agency and Canadian Space Agency sets out its aim as being to explore every phase of cosmic history.Marina Koren, a staff writer with The Atlantic, has commented that “the project, at its core, represents some of our purest intentions in space exploration”, adding: “Scientists want to understand the arc of our strange universe, how it led to a story of le on Earth, and whether that narrative has unfolded anywhere .”I have never seen science and religion as in competition with each other. A churchman for whom I have especially high regard is the Church of England’s late Archbishop of York, John Habgood, who died in  and who had an earlier background in science.Having studied natural sciences at King’s College, Cambridge, he obtained a double first and went on to hold a scientic post at the university while carrying out research in physiology.He had not been particularly interested in religion until he came in touch with the Christian Union at Cambridge University.Dr Habgood chaired meetings that I used to attend in England and he struck me as not only an intellectual giant but also as an unfailingly courteous and strikingly calm and quiet man. His  book, Making Sense, considered the issue of the Bible and scientic discovery, including the question of creation.Dr Habgood held that God works through natural laws, writing: “The biblical story sets out the inner meaning of the scientic story by revealing the dependence of all existence on God, and the ultimate meaning of it as finding its fulfilment in God.”Science is about establishing facts and applying that knowledge while religion is about the practice of faith and the interpretation of facts in light of that faith.Science and religion are therefore dferent and while there are facts that are part of religious history and religious testimony, faith is essentially what comes beyond facts.Religious people ‘know’ of God by conviction rather than as the result of scientic analysis.What has been termed ‘metaphysics’ is a branch of philosophy which attempts to understand reality itself. The term literally means ‘beyond physics’.No doubt the James Webb space telescope will help our understanding of how things have come to be as they are, but it will not inform us further about whether or not God exists or about the nature and being of God.It will not be able to tell us that, no, God does not exist, and nor will it be able to tell us that God has been scientically discovered.The existence of God and questions about God’s nature are ultimately matters of faith.Atheists raise many dferent objections to religious faith but they are unable to refute it absolutely They can point to contradictions in religious world-views, they can present a reasonable alternative, they can even ridicule faith, but they cannot show that faith is unarguably mistaken.Nonetheless, apart from revelation itself, there have been ious philosophical arguments in favour of God’s existence, one of which has been the argument from design.Basically, this suggests that the world we know is so marvellously complex that it is wholly implausible to assert that we could be here simply by chance, or that the universe with all its laws of nature just happened to come into being because of a massive explosion, the cause of which is unknown.This is classically illustrated in what is known as the watchmaker analogy.William Paley, in an  book on natural theology, wrote thatone stumbled upon a pocket watch lying on a heath it would be reasonable to deduce that someone had either dropped it there or had left it in that place for some unknown reason, and that it had been made by at least one watchmaker rather than having come about by natural forces.In Northern Ireland, the magnicent Giant’s Causeway is an illustration of a remarkable stone formation as a result of natural forces, butit were a huge timepiece such a conclusion would certainly be a stretch too far.While a Big Bang cause of the universe coming into its present state is generally asserted, it is still quite possible that such an explosion may have itself been designed as part of a ine, creative plan.It all depends on what one believes.Canon Ian Ellis is a former editor of The Church of Ireland GazetteMore letters and opinion:Click here – Ruth Dudley Edwards: Christopher Stalford showed us that kindness mattersClick here – Before talk of hourly train service to Dublin, Irish Rail service needs improved Click here – Even the mildest Russian territorial goal now is totally unacceptable——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Picture: WSPThe first option would see a segregated cycle and pedestrian path through an old railway line, from Cosmeston Drive in Sully to Railway Walk in Penarth. This would involve clearing out a lot of overgrown vegetation on the railway line, and could be an expensive option.The second option would see the existing pavement on Lavernock Road widened, for shared use between pedestrians and cyclists. The speed limit would be reduced from mph to mph along this part of Lavernock Road. This option would be the cheapest.The third option would combine parts of the first two. It would use the old railway line halfway, from Cosmeston Drive to St Mary’s Well Bay Road, before then crossing Lavernock Road and continuing on the pavement until Sully.The consultation website said: “There is a growing need to reform the way people travel between destinations using private vehicles. Providing good quality active travel infrastructure is an important component in negating the need for people to own vehicles.“Active travel infrastructure may also be used as a tool to improve physical and mental well being and mitigate the impact of private vehicles on the environment.“By providing one of these proposed route options, we can facilitate a modal sht from the private car to active modes for short distances to either Sully, Cosmeston and Penarth.”.removePeople interested in responding to the consultation have until March  to do so, by visiting the website: sullyactivetravelmonplace.is Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityA dog is seen by many as another member of the family but it’s important to remember they do require a dferent diet to humans and some ingredients in pancakes could lead to tummy troubles of even health problems like diabetes.Not wanting pups to miss out, Ocado have partnered with an expert in pet nutrition to create a recipe which is safe for dogs – even those with particularly sensitive tums.Stephen Ward is the Founder of Heights Farm Premium Pet Foods – a high-quality, independent pet food manufacturer designed for animals with allergies and intolerances. Stephen is passionate about pet nutritionHe said: “Traditional syrup-filled human pancakes would not be suitable for dogs as they contain salts, sugars and carbohydrates.“A dog can’t break down the fats and carbs like a human does. If eaten regularly, the result would generally be rapid weight gain which of course can lead to chronic conditions such as diabetes.“Also, more immediate issues may be seen in dogs with allergies, intolerances and particularly sensitive stomachs.”When is Pancake day This year pancake day falls on March . Otherwise known as Shrove Tuesday, it is the day before the start of Lent fasting practiced by Christians in the run up to the Easter festival.Pancakes are supposed to use up things like eggs, milk and sugar before the fasting begins.Dog-friendly pancake recipeStephen has designed a recipe especially for dogs to enjoy this Pancake Day, replacing common allergens like wheat flour and cow’s milk with dog-appropriate alternatives.The recipe can be found on the Ocado website, where you can also purchase the necessary ingredients.Ingredients:Step Sieve the flour into a mixing bowl. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the egg and ml of lukewarm water before whisking until the ingredients are fully combined.Step Heat a non-stick frying pan to a medium temperature then add a ladle of the pancake mixture to the pan.Step Cook the pancakes for  seconds on each side before removing from the heat and leaving to cool fully. Add your dog’s favourite toppings and serve.Tips for a healthy pancake day with your dogIf you’re going to celebrate Pancake Day with your dog, Stephen has three more top tips to ensure you’re prioritising your dog’s health:As always, make sure your dog has access to plenty of fresh clean drinking water.Adjust your dog’s daily feeds to account for the extra calorie intake.As with all treats, remember to serve these pancakes in moderation. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I don’t want to hear any more of this, I came here to say what actually happened.”He denied ever meeting Mr Ibbotson, despite a text message he had allegedly sent him telling him to come to his house and collect £ in cash.Ms McGahey said: “These are unofficial grey flights and you knew they were.”“I never knew anything about David Henderson’s business,” Mr McKay replied.Mr McKay had to be repeatedly interrupted by Coroner Rachael Grfin when he became angry about lines of questioning.At one point she was forced to remind him that contempt of court is an offence that can carry a sentence of imprisonment.Matthew Reeve, for Mr Sala’s family, asked why Mr McKay had not offered his family’s own plane, a King Air , to transport the player.Mr McKay said it was because the plane was getting its propellers serviced, but Mr Reeve suggested the company servicing the plane were refusing to release it until the McKay family paid its bill.The agent replied: “This is to discredit me. I came here in good faith. It is of no relevance at all whether I owe anyone money.”Earlier, Mr McKay had said he only wanted to help Mr Sala get home, and claimed Cardf City had “abandoned” him.Askedthere was anything he wanted to tell the inquest, he said: “Myself, Jack and Mark tried to help Emi to get home – publicity wise what we went through is hell.”The inquest has heard Mr Sala was overcome by toxic levels of carbon monoxide poisoning prior to dying from severe head and chest injuries consistent with a plane crash.On Wednesday, the jury were told that Mr Ibbotson had been barred from flying the Piper Malibu by its owner after receiving two notices of airspace infringements from the CAA.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_edfaecffad   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dcdbcfbbfadc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?164508961700","title":"  people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line ","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland. The campaign promoted the unique nature of le onboard, with % time-off providing the perfect work-le balance for people wanting to live and work onboard for either a one or two-week sht and then spend equal time off. The positions available are part of the Onboard Sales and Servicesteam, with vacancies for service assistants and chefs. With January being the traditional time of the year when many people look for a new career, Stena Line had hoped for a favourable response but even the most optimistic of predictions could not have expected it to be so over-subscribed. Stena Line has now undertaken the initial stage of the selection process and, for the first-time, is hosting two Open Days for prospective candidates on Monday th February, where they will get a chance to meet members of Stena Line’s crews. The Open Days are taking place in Belfast and Birkenhead with the latter being held onboard one of Stena Line’s newest ferries, Stena Edda, giving candidates a chance to get a first-hand taste of le onboard on the Irish Sea. Stephen Bryden, Stena Line’s Head of Onboard Sales and Services, commented on the success of the campaign: “I am astonished by the public’s response to the A Le Less Ordinary recruitment campaign.
