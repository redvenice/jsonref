But where?          King Edward VII is pictured with Queen Alexandra at York Cottage in 1899           Prince Henry of Wales, the Duke of Gloucester is pictured at York Cottage in September 1902George, like Harry, was the second son, not expecting to inherit the throne. But then his older brother Prince Eddy, Duke of Clarence, died suddenly aged 28.It was on his marriage that George was given what was then called the Bachelors\u0027 Cottage — built as an overspill for Sandringham\u0027s unmarried shooting guests. A man of simple tastes, he wanted nothing grander. The house had been designed by a Colonel Edis, an old friend of Edward VII, but according to biographer James Pope-Hennessy: \u0027The main drawback was that he was not an architect at all.\u0027From Edis\u0027s sketch-pad came a maze of twisting passages, narrow stairs and bedrooms the size of a housemaid\u0027s cupboard.The nursery could barely contain a small rocking-horse.

Even when he was king after his father died, George remained there while his widowed mother Queen Alexandra stayed in the big house at Sandringham.To accommodate George V and his growing family, York Cottage was extended twice — making it \u0027even odder\u0027 according to Pope-Hennessy.           Prince Albert is pictured in 1864 Queen Mary thought it was ugly, and hated it for every one of the 33 years she was forced to live there. So too did the royal children —among them our present Queen\u0027s father, George VI, and another Prince Harry — the future Duke of Gloucester.They couldn\u0027t wait to get away, but none the less were forced to spend six months of every year at York Cottage during their growing up years.There was no privacy — the place was overrun. George and Mary and their six children came first, but then there were equerries, ladies-in-waiting, private secretaries, four pages, a chef, valet, footmen, wine butlers, nurses, nursemaids, housemaids and cooks.There was nowhere for staff to sleep — \u0027the King said he supposed they roosted in the trees,\u0027 wrote biographer Kenneth Rose.And his majesty\u0027s private secretary — effectively the CEO of House of Windsor — had to use his tiny bedroom as his office, with his visitors perching on a chair in the corridor until he could greet them.No wonder, then, that with such lack of space each Christmas turned into \u0027a feast of acrimony\u0027. \u0027An atmosphere of restriction, killjoy pompousness, mystery, artificiality, and the most complete and utter boredom,\u0027 wrote David, later Edward VIII.          Inside the drawing room at York Cottage at Sandringham pictured in October 1897 \u0027And that doesn\u0027t even begin to describe how ghastly it is.\u0027There was worse. York Cottage was pervaded by the ghost of King George\u0027s elder brother Prince Eddy, who\u0027d borne the title Duke of Clarence and was expected to inherit the throne until his early death.Even today\u0027s most ardent royalists agree Prince Eddy was the worst king we never had.Recklessly promiscuous in his sex life, he suffered constantly from gonorrhea and was utterly brainless.In the army, he could not be guaranteed to turn the right way on the parade ground and forgot the orders he was supposed to issue to his men.He was embroiled in the Cleveland Street scandal, where telegraph clerks from the General Post Office were used as rent-boys in London by the titled and rich — and was urgently dispatched on a tour of India when the ringleaders were put on trial at the Old Bailey.          York Cottage at Sandringham in Norfolk is pictured from behind with its private lake But he liked women too, with his fellow officers encouraging him to try new experiences in order to ingratiate themselves.He was even suspected, then finally cleared, of being Jack The Ripper.Eddy was said to have secretly married at the age of 20 to an artist\u0027s model called Annie Crook, and later he was ensnared for his sexual high-jinks by a notorious blackmailer, Maude Richardson.He was named as the lover of a chorus girl, Lydia Miller, who committed suicide by swallowing carbolic acid.He was nothing short of a walking disaster for the Royal Family.There was a concerted effort to get Eddy married off, in the hope it would put an end to his wild ways, but finding a suitable bride proved impossible — his reputation as a brainless philanderer went before him.          Harry and Meghan are pictured attending a reception for the Commonwealth Youth Forum in London In the end Princess May of Teck, a distant cousin, agreed to the job — but just at that moment Eddy, weakened by gonorrhea, died of influenza.Weirdly, within weeks, May accepted the proposal of marriage from Eddy\u0027s younger brother George, and so became Queen Mary. Both she, and her husband,lived intimately with Eddy\u0027s ghost at Sandringham.\u0027All is left just as it was,\u0027 wrote Empress Frederick of Prussia, their cousin.\u0027His dressing-table with his watch, his brushes and combs and everything. His bed covered with a Union Jack in silk, and his photos and clothes in a glass cupboard.\u0027George\u0027s children grew up with this ghost, and couldn\u0027t wait to get away.Bertie — the present Queen\u0027s father — was on the lookout for a bride from his teens on, the only means of escape being marriage and a home of his own.His sister Princess Mary, equally desperate, accepted the hand of the Earl of Harewood, who at 40 was 16 years her senior (Harewood\u0027s reputedly proposed to her for a wager).The future Edward VIII, according to his biographer Philip Ziegler, hated York Cottage — \u0027as he grew older it came more and more to symbolise all that he disliked about family life\u0027.So nobody enjoyed the redbrick, suburban, glum and gloomy house — apart from King George. \u0027Very nice to be in this dear wee house again,\u0027 he wrote unknowingly in his diary.But no royal ever lived in it again. In 1925 he and Queen Mary moved up to the big house after the death of his mother Queen Alexandra, and the place was eventually turned into what it is today — staff offices, with a few flats tacked on.York Cottage\u0027s convenience for Meghan and Harry is that it\u0027s near to William and Kate at Anmer Hall, and should babies come along, their cousins will provide handy playmates.But a joyful place for their future family home?As Meghan has yet to learn, there are a few heavy prices you have to pay when you become a princess."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/03/07/4BCB952700000578-0-image-m-15_1525327815445.jpg","title":"Chris Evans pays tribute mother Minnie returns air","story":"\u0027Mum was incredible, she needed to be at peace\u0027: Listeners...Share this article    Chris Evans, pictured with his mother Minnie at London\u0027s Chelsea Flower Show in 2000\u0027My mum was only supposed to last a month or two, but five months after this, seven months in all, she was still there.

He said he believes it was the same nerve agent type used to poison ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal (left) and his daughter Yulia (left)According to RT, Aleksey Pushkov said in a Twitter post: \u0027Novichok was produced and stored in the Czech territory in some small quantities. This fact is a crushing blow to London\u0027s theory that is already falling apart at the seams. \u0027London is confused: Its whole construct is crumbling.\u0027 Poisoned Russian spy Skripal and his daughter may have got...Fresh heartache for family of Sergei Skripal who say they...Russian pulls out of buying Margaret Thatcher\u0027s armoured...Share this articleRussian officials have previously suggested the nerve agent used for the attack may have originated in the Czech Republic, Sweden and Slovakia. Acting Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis called that claim a lie and the Czechs expelled three Russian diplomats in solidarity with Britain.Neither the Czech agencies mentioned by Zeman nor the government have commented on the president\u0027s claims.          Czech Republic president Milos Zeman (pictured) is known for his pro-Kremlin viewsMeanwhile, the head of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has said up to 100 grams of liquid nerve agent were used in the attack on Skripal and his daughter Yulia.Ahmet Uzumcu told the New York Times the amount of Novichok used - around half a cup of liquid - suggests it was created for use as a weapon rather than for research purposes.Mr Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter Yulia were left fighting for their lives in hospital after being found unconscious on a park bench in Salisbury on March 4.The inquiry into the nerve agent attack in the Wiltshire city has involved 250 detectives who have gone through more than 5,000 hours of CCTV and interviewed more than 500 witnesses.Mr Uzumcu told the paper the Novichok could have been applied as a liquid or aerosol.He said: \u0027For research activities or protection you would need, for instance, five to 10 grams or so, but even in Salisbury it looks like they may have used more than that, without knowing the exact quantity, I am told it may be 50, 100 grams or so, which goes beyond research activities for protection.\u0027It\u0027s not affected by weather conditions. That explains, actually, that they were able to identify it after a considerable time lapse.\u0027He added the samples collected suggested the nerve agent was of \u0027high purity\u0027.          Moscow has denied accusations it was responsible for the poisoning of the Skripals in Salisbury but the incident plunged diplomatic relations between Russia and the West into the deep freeze. Army officers are pictured removing the bench where the Skripals collapsedMoscow has denied accusations it was responsible for the poisoning of the Skripals but the incident plunged diplomatic relations between Russia and the West into the deep freeze.The Russian ambassador to the UK Alexander Yakovenko previously suggested that Sergei and Yulia Skripal may have been injected by British authorities with nerve agent produced at Porton Down.However the UK has previously stated its conviction that only Russia had the means and motive to target the former spy.Karen Pierce, the UK\u0027s representative to the United Nations, told a meeting last month there was \u0027no plausible alternative explanation than Russian State responsibility for what happened in Salisbury\u0027, suggesting Russia had the ability, operation experience and motive to carry out the attack.          The UK has previously stated its conviction that only Russia had the means and motive to target the former spy. Pictured: Police at Sergei Skripal\u0027s homeShe said: \u0027Russia has a proven record of conducting state-sponsored assassinations including on the territory of the United Kingdom.\u0027The independent inquiry into the death of Alexander Litvinenko concluded in January 2016 that he was deliberately poisoned with polonium that the FSB had directed the operation and that President Putin probably approved it.\u0027On the technical means of creating Novichok, she said: \u0027No terrorist group or non-state actor would be able to produce this agent in the purity described by the OPCW testing and this is something Russia has acknowledged.\u0027The Russian State has previously produced Novichoks and would still be capable of doing so today.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"How change Twitter password","story":"Marvel character searches on Pornhub surged before Avengers: Infinity War releaseJennifer Aniston joins Brad Pitt and others in objecting to The Weinstein Company saleGrey\u0027s Anatomy preview hints at Sarah Drew and Jessica Capshaw\u0027s leavingCinco de Mayo: How to celebrate in style Who is Matthew Lawrence?

It has taken four generations of hard-working ancestors saving until there was enough money spare for my late father to put a deposit on a house.\u0027Mrs Gabriel, who also attended court, said that her son had been \u0027crucified\u0027 by the strain of the court battle.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/04/13/4BB4F23700000578-5691219-image-a-71_1525436953731.jpg","title":"Who Candace Owens Kanyes favorite free thinker","story":"    After being praised on Twitter, Candace Owens and her boss Charlie Kirk secured a meeting with Kanye West and the trio met in CaliforniaReturning to the social media platform after a breakdown in 2016, Kanye tweeted: ‘I love the way Candace Owens thinks,’ and followed up this tweet with one reading ‘Only free thinkers.’Frank Ocean parodied this tweet by posting: ‘I love the way Michelle Wolf thinks.’ But who is Candace Owens?Who is Candace Owens?Born in Stamford, Connecticut, Candace is an American writer and conservative commentator.While she was in high school, she received a number of racist phone calls that were later traced to a car in which the son of Governor Dannel Malloy was present.Candace’s family sued the Stamford Board of Education and won a $37,500 settlement.

But what is Martin Lewis’s net worth?Who is Martin Lewis?Born Martin Steven Lewis on May 9, 1972 in Withington, Manchester, he is an English financial journalist and founder of the website MoneySavingExpert.com.He lost his mother in a car accident at a young age and later in life, went on to become a patron of the children’s bereavement charity Grief Encounter as well as an advocate for life insurance.Martin studied government and law at the London School of Economics and went on to complete a postgraduate course in broadcast journalism in Cardiff.His first job was at a financial communications consultancy, the Brunswick Group in London and later, became a producer for the BBC Business Unit working on BBC Radio Five Live business programmes.Martin was also an editor of BBC Radio 4’s Today programme and then moved to Sky’s Simply Money where he formed his Money Saving Expert persona.After the collapse of Simply Money, he wrote for the Deal of the Week column in the Sunday Express and was then granted slots on Channel 5’s Open House with Gloria Hunniford.Martin returned to BBC for a short while before presenting a daytime television series on ITV in 2005 called Make Me Rich as well as Channel Five show It Pays to Watch.He then presented money saving programmes on Good Morning Britain and Lorraine and now appears on This Morning, The Wright Stuff and began presenting The Martin Lewis Money Show.Martin Lewis is married to former 5 News weather presenter Lara Lewington in May 31, 2009 and the couple had a daughter in November 2012.          Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis pictured with his Order of the British Empire (OBE) medal alongside his wife Lara Lewington at an Investiture ceremony in February 2015 at Buckingham PalaceMartin Lewis on Question TimeMoney Saving Expert Martin Lewis was applauded by Question Time viewers after he slammed Labour Party MP Chi Onwurah over student finance claims.He accused politicians of dissuading young people from attending university by referring to the fee payments as student ‘debt’ and said that an entire generation had been ‘mis-educated’.He said: \u0027It is an abomination, you should all hold your heads in shame... It\u0027s an increased form of taxation when you leave but is not framed as a debt, it shouldn\u0027t be called a debt, it\u0027s a graduate contribution system so don\u0027t even go there.\u0027Martin explained that the price of attending university was irrelevant and the repayments are based on salary, which means that those who earn a lot after completing their studies, will naturally have to pay back more.Ms Onwurah, MP for Newcastle upon Tyne Central said: \u0027If somebody, and particularly somebody from a working class background, if somebody has 57,000 in debt,\u0027 but Martin interrupted her to say: ‘Don\u0027t tell them! Politicians do this all the time. You can\u0027t make political points.\u0027You put off young people from underprivileged backgrounds from going to university with a fear of debt by framing it as a debt when you know it doesn\u0027t work like that.\u0027Politicians need to take responsibility. Your political football that you and all the parties have used student finance to be has mis-educated a generation about how student finance works and it is an abomination, you should all hold your heads in shame because there are people from poor backgrounds on television - I saw a programme two weeks ago - saying I can\u0027t afford to go to university.\u0027Well, you know what, it is expensive, it\u0027s an increased form of taxation when you leave but is not framed as a debt, it shouldn\u0027t be called a debt, it\u0027s a graduate contribution system so don\u0027t even go there.\u0027Ms Onwurah responded: \u0027It is really, really important to recognise that tuition fees are an obstacle for students going into university. It\u0027s psychological but a lot of the world is psychological. How things are perceived is what informs people\u0027s choice.\u0027You can argue to re-educate, or you can argue, as we have done, to abolish tuition fees.\u0027Martin Lewis suing FacebookIn April 2018, Money Saving Expert founder Martin Lewis revealed that he is in the process of suing Facebook for publishing dozens of adverts using his image to promote scams.He said that the social media platform had used his name to ‘rip off vulnerable people’. He continued: \u0027I feel sick each time I hear of another victim being conned because of trust they wrongly thought they were placing in me.‘I believe politicians have totally missed the impact of social media companies on real people and their pockets. It is about time they took this seriously.’Martin went on to say that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg ‘pretends to be an honest and campaigning man but his company is a facilitator of criminal scammers … They have known about these scam adverts for years, and they are still happy to roll around in their dirty money.’Facebook has been accused of publishing more than 50 fake Martin Lewis adverts, with the majority promoting schemes trading in Bitcoin, which Martin claimed were actually binary trading firms.Binary trading is a risky form of gambling on the stock market that sees most investors lose money.The Financial Conduct Authority has said almost 100 firms are illegally offering such investments to UK consumers and warned of online firms that take money, place no bets for customers then break contact.Martin has asked Facebook to remove the adverts multiple times but they are left up for days or weeks before being taken down and then reappear days later.A Facebook spokesman said: ‘We do not allow adverts which are misleading or false on Facebook and have explained to Martin Lewis he should report any adverts that infringe his rights and they will be removed.’Martin Lewis net worthMartin Lewis’s net worth has accumulated to approximately £73 million, according to Wealtholino.In 2012, BBC News reported that Martin sold MoneySavingExpert.com for up to £87 million.Marvel character searches on Pornhub surged before Avengers: Infinity War releaseJennifer Aniston joins Brad Pitt and others in objecting to The Weinstein Company saleGrey\u0027s Anatomy preview hints at Sarah Drew and Jessica Capshaw\u0027s leavingCinco de Mayo: How to celebrate in style Who is Matthew Lawrence?

But scientists warned more vents would likely form and disgorge more lava.Hawaii Volcanoes National Park evacuated all visitors and non-emergency staff. The quakes triggered rock slides on park trails and crater walls. Narrow fissures appeared on the ground at a building overlooking the crater at Kilauea\u0027s summit.The University of Hawaii at Hilo and Hawaii Community College both closed campuses and a long stretch of Highway 130, one of the main arteries through Puna, was closed because of the threat of sulfuric gas.Leilani Estates, where lava was pushing through cracks in the earth, has about 1,700 residents and 770 homes.

The lava lake at Kilauea\u0027s summit crater dropped significantly, suggesting the magma was moving eastward toward PunaKilauea has been continuously erupting since 1983 and is one of five volcanoes that make up the Big Island. Activity picked up earlier this week, indicating a possible new lava outbreak.The crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers. The collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles  downslope toward the populated southeast coastline.Residents have faced lava threats before.In 2014, lava burned a house and destroyed a cemetery near the town of Pahoa. Residents were worried it would cover the town\u0027s main road and cut off the community from the rest of the island, but the molten rock stalled.From 1990 through 1991, lava slowly overtook the town of Kalapana, burning homes and covering roads and gardens.Kilauea hasn\u0027t been the kind of volcano that shoots lava from its summit into the sky, causing widespread destruction. It tends to ooze lava from fissures in its sides, which often gives residents at least a few hours\u0027 warning before it reaches their property.In the uncertainty, however, some residents found comfort in the abiding beauty of the Big Island.

US Geological Survey seismologist Jana Pursley told CNN there had been 119 earthquakes on the Big Island since Thursday afternoon.Before the quake, Hawaii County Civil Defense said a new vent opened near an intersection. There has been no activity at a geothermal power plant, which had been taken offline.Hawaii National Guard spokesman Maj. Jeff Hickman added that the Hilo airport and highways didn\u0027t sustain any damage from Friday\u0027s magnitude-6.9 quake.Hawaii County spokeswoman Janet Snyder also said  the county has yet to conduct a full damage assessment.Four to five landslides occurred along the Hamakau Coast on the Big Island, according to the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency. Shocking moment man is mauled to death in vicious bear attackPlane seen flying as low as 2,000ft in Bristol neighbourhoodCarnival cruise ship crew scramble to stop ship from floodingMan who \u0027stole and crashed van\u0027 on London Bridge swimming in ThamesLorry with tanker carrying oxygen goes up in flames on M62Paddy McGuinness stuck on M62 following tanker explosionPaddy McGuinness and other drivers make a U-turn on the M62Take a look inside Somerset MP Jacob Rees-Mogg\u0027s kitchen    People take photos of lava as steam rises from a fissure in Leilani Estates subision          Hawaii National Guard spokesman Maj.

At least 100 people were staying in shelters Friday, with many more evacuees believed to be with relatives and friends.The Hawaii governor activated the National Guard to help with evacuations and provide security for properties that were abandoned when residents fled to safety.Kilauea has erupted periodically for decades, and scientists said they have no way of predicting how long the eruption will continue.A key factor will be whether a magma reservoir at the summit starts to drain in response to the eruption, which has not happened yet, said Asta Miklius, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey\u0027s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory.  Authorities also ordered an evacuation of Lanipuna Gardens, a smaller, more rural subision directly to the east   In this photo released by U.S. Geological Survey, ash plume rises above the Puu Oo crater, on Hawaii\u0027s Kilaueaa Volcano Thursday, May 3, 2018 in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park\u0027There is quite a bit of magma in the system. It won\u0027t be just an hours-long eruption probably, but how long it will last will depend on whether the summit magma reservoir gets involved. And so we are watching that very, very closely,\u0027 Miklius said.After a week of earthquakes, authorities had warned residents to be prepared to evacuate because an eruption would give little warning.Henry Calio said the first sign that something might be wrong happened when cracks emerged in the driveway of his home in Leilani Estates. His wife, Stella, then received a call from an official who told them to get out immediately. They feared they might lose the house.\u0027This is our retirement dream,\u0027 Henry Calio said.  Kilauea\u0027s Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering the earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers. The collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) downslope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island Kilauea\u0027s Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering the earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers. The collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) downslope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island.The magma later crossed under Highway 130, which leads to a popular volcano access point. Authorities closed the area to visitors and ordered private tour companies to stop taking people into the region.Over the decades, most of Kilauea\u0027s activity has been nonexplosive, but a 1924 eruption spewed ash and 10-ton (9-metric ton) rocks into the sky and killed one person.A 1983 eruption resulted in lava fountains soaring over 1,500 feet (457 meters) into the sky. Since then, the lava flow has buried dozens of square miles of land and destroyed many homes.

The change might be due to lack of social mobility and housing, or soaring stamp duty rather than not wanting to leave the location of your first kiss, but as someone who has moved house 14 times, that can only be a good thing.Like millions of baby-boomers I was seduced by TV shows such as Location, Location, Location (I actually hired Phil Spencer to find my farm in Somerset) and Grand Designs, and like many ambitious Londoners I thought moving to the country would be a breeze: just like staying in Babington House, but with no checkout time.But moving away from not just friends but the familiar – the florist that did your wedding and your mum’s funeral, the local art-house cinema where you snogged your future husband, even the basement kitchen where you found out he was cheating – is scary.Your past, like a tent caught in a gale, is ripped from its moorings, and disappears. Like many people, I moved house thinking, Ooh, once I’m there, in that dreamy location – I study new houses on Rightmove for hours, Google Earthing them, taking imaginary walks from the door and working out where my furniture will go – I will be happy.It never happens, because you take yourself with you.The most sorted person I know is my best friend.

Her mum still lives round the corner, and she sees her every day.Last time I stayed with her, we reminisced about seeing the first Star Wars when it opened on Leicester Square in 1977.I told her daughter, now 21, that her mum hasn’t changed a bit. Her hair is the same. Her mannerisms. Her face. But, most importantly, her house."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/06/01/4BD7D11400000578-5695503-Outside_London_the_picture_was_worse_with_disastrous_performance-m-4_1525567421425.jpg","title":"Now no doubt Corbyn got prayer says LORD BLUNKETT","story":"      Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party missed an opportunity to seize key Conservative-held London boroughsCertainly they will never have a better opportunity. The internal Tory civil war over Brexit, the Windrush scandal and the breast-screening fiasco all resonate deeply in the capital. But even in London – now, more than ever, a Labour city – the Corbyn revolution is the dog that refused to bark.The party I have worked for all my life catastrophically failed to win targets such as Barnet, where voters, at least in part, turned away from Labour in droves because of the anti-Semitism furore. Outside London the picture was worse, with disastrous performances in Dudley, Derby and elsewhere. Election expert Professor Sir John Curtice pointed out there had actually been a swing to the Conservatives from Labour.Yet according to the leadership’s advance publicity, this was an election in which the Corbyn-supporting Momentum group was supposed to deliver grassroots campaigning and a seismic political breakthrough. How telling that one of Labour’s few success stories, in Plymouth, happened precisely because local activists insisted on running their own campaign and told Momentum to stay away.The lesson to be learned is simple and obvious: Corbyn’s project is leading the party away from victory.            Outside London the picture was worse, with disastrous performances in Dudley, Derby and elsewhereLabour moderates have remained dutifully silent since he unexpectedly won more than 40 per cent of the vote in last year’s General Election. But it’s becoming clear that Theresa May was denied the mandate she sought for a whole host of reasons, not because Corbyn is some sort of modern prophet.Last June some voted for Labour safe in the belief that Corbyn would not be Prime Minister, others because they believed it was their best chance of avoiding a hard Brexit. There were, certainly, some true believers. But it has become increasingly clear that Jeremy’s leadership is going nowhere.Where, for example, is his vision? He could have cauterised the damaging anti-Semitism scandal by exposing it for what it was: the loathsome views of a very small group of far-Left fanatics who joined the party only after he became leader, and expelling those responsible. Instead he has fudged and prevaricated.His policy on the most pressing matter of the day, Brexit, is so vague that even the Shadow Ministers press-ganged to explain it on television and radio tie themselves in knots.And the parliamentary successes Labour has enjoyed in recent months have come because of the hard work and political nous of politicians the Corbynistas hatefully profess to despise as ‘Red Tories’ – backbencher David Lammy shaming the Government over Windrush Margaret Hodge forcing the Government into a U-turn on Commonwealth tax havens Yvette Cooper holding Amber Rudd’s feet to the fire over the ‘hostile environment’ for immigrants, which resulted in her resignation. Keir Starmer and his team are the only reason Labour’s Brexit balancing act has lasted so long.We currently stand at a crossroads in British history, where if Tory hard-Brexit free marketeers have their way, workers’ protections could be shredded, countless jobs lost.This is precisely the moment where the Labour Party should be leading the national debate about our future, but all Corbyn and his acolyte John McDonnell have to offer are ideas that were promoted and rejected in the 1970s and 1980s. I’m not opposed to their ideas of social ownership of water and joint partnerships in rail. But these are not the policies of tomorrow. What does Corbyn’s Labour say to the millions who stand to lose their livelihoods to automation and outsourcing? How will it rejuvenate hollowed-out towns where shops are boarded up? What will it do about our deteriorating public spaces, where shared events and experiences should be enriching all our lives?What, after all, is the point of Labour as a party of principle if it doesn’t make a stand for the people it is elected to represent rather than peddle outmoded political dogma?I was part of a Labour ‘project’ that won three General Elections by appealing to people’s aspirations for a better future, not a return to the past. The lesson then, as now, is Labour can only be politically successful if it creates a clear agenda based on a positive alternative, rather than defining ourselves as being ‘anti’ everybody and everything.The parliamentary party – backbenchers, committee members and Select Committee chairmen – must pick up the cudgel and begin formulating ideas and policies. From among them, a leadership group must be formed from which a genuine alternative can emerge.It won’t be easy. I’ve seen the personal vitriol local activists endure from some Corbyn supporters. I’ve seen the threats of deselection from the likes of Unite’s Len McCluskey. I’ve seen how good Labour MPs are traduced and insulted, and admired the bravery of those who have been vilified for standing up to anti-Semitism.But it’s clear from the council election results that Corbynism is doomed to failure. Rebuilding a new, positive, Labour from the ground up is the only way forward. It’ll take time, which means there’s no time to lose.Whatever your views on Labour, our country and our democracy needs a proper, credible and electable alternative to challenge the Government. A renewed form of moderate New Labour needs to return.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/04/10/4BD76C3B00000578-0-image-a-3_1525424671393.jpg","title":"Chef James Martin puts seven bedroom Hampshire mansion market","story":"    Saturday Morning host James Martin has put his seven bedroom country mansion, which comes with a huge kitchen on the market          The property, which is seven miles from Winchester in a tiny hamlet called Stoke Charity, has a huge kitchen          The property, where Mr Martin has lived for the last nine years, has seven bedrooms          The living room, which has an open fire, set into a limestone fireplace, and is open-plan with a large glass orangery overlooking the gardens  The host of Saturday Morning on ITV, (left and right) has lived at the property for the last nine years and has now put it on the market          Doors leading out into the gardens, which has a \u0027mulberry lined\u0027 garden path, vegetable gardens, a heated greenhouse, and a hot tub          The home is decorated throughout with Ralph Lauren wallpaper and Farrow and Ball paint          The reception hall is part of the original house, which has 17th century doors that have been reclaimed from a French Chateau          Mr Martin posing with his dog in one of his garages in the property which he uses to house his collection of motorbikes and cars\u0027Whilst the current owner designed it for his particular requirements, the accommodation remains enormously flexible to suit the needs of any future owner.\u0027Mr Martin, 45, has decorated his house throughout with Ralph Lauren Wallpaper and Farrow \u0026amp Ball paint, The Sun reports. The listing says the bespoke handmade kitchen is fitted wine coolers, an inbuilt deep fat fryer, a \u0027wealth\u0027 of cupboard storage and an oak floor. It has a \u0027triple garage\u0027 and a cinema and games room, which has a three metre by three metre remote controlled cinema screen, \u0027which when activated, triggers window blinds and mood lighting.\u0027  It says there is also a bar, built in PlayStations. The first floor has four double bedrooms and three bathrooms, and the master suite is said to have \u0027a wealth of fitted wardrobes\u0027 There is a gym on the second floor, and another two bedrooms.

For more than 40 days, with her boat crippled, equipment smashed and heart broken, 23-year-old Tami somehow endured the elements threatening to annihilate her and then conquered them – and she did so thanks to the guiding spirit of her dead fiancé, whose insistent voice, day by day, had urged her on to a seemingly impossible survival.That voice, she says, brought her back from the brink, helping her navigate with just a sextant and the stars above her head.Now her ordeal and the extraordinary memoir that followed have been made into a big-budget Hollywood film, Adrift, set for release in June, and featuring British actor Sam Claflin as Richard and Shailene Woodley as Tami.Both are rising stars – Sam appeared in the film adaptation of Jojo Moyes’ novel Me Before You, while US actress Shailene played a teenage cancer patient in The Fault In Our Stars – and Adrift looks set to be this summer’s cinematic hit.Yet even the big-screen treatment could hardly be more dramatic than the true 1,500-mile solo epic that Tami describes in Red Sky In Mourning: A True Story of Love, Loss And Survival At Sea, which will be re-published next month as Adrift.It was September 1983 when the two young sailors embarked on what they imagined to be a routine delivery for the Hazana’s British owners, Peter and Christine Compton.At 34, Richard was more than a decade older than his young American lover, but with his his lapis lazuli eyes, golden hair and ‘exotic’ English accent, he meant everything to her. They had already spent a year and a half together on the Pacific, delivering and mending boats.True, the distance involved in this new mission was vast, yet the pair had few concerns, as Tami later recalled in a series of moving interviews: ‘I’d been sailing blue water for four years. Together we had 50,000 miles of ocean-sailing under our belts. We hugged, laughed, made love and relaxed into 20 days of paradise.’          The couple set off on the 4,000 mile trip on board the Hazana across the Pacific OceanA disastrous reality was less than two weeks away, in the shape of tropical storm Raymond, which ‘tore out of the blue’, hit hurricane force then held its peak intensity for two catastrophic days.It was Richard who spotted a monster wave approaching the Hazana and ordered Tami below deck while he secured himself with a safety harness and tried to keep the vessel afloat.Moments later she heard him scream ‘Oh my God!’ and her world was thrust into darkness.Tossed like a cork on the raging ocean, the yacht had flipped end over end. It was 27 hours before she regained consciousness to an eerie silence and utter devastation. The cabin was half-filled with water, everything inside it smashed or scattered on the floor.Scrambling out onto the deck she looked desperately for Richard but found only wreckage. The boat was all-but destroyed: masts were broken off and the waterlogged sails floated uselessly in the water.Richard’s safety line dangled ominously off the boat. Tami shouted his name over and over again, but found only empty ocean. Richard was nowhere to be seen.

But scientists warned more vents would likely form and disgorge more lava.Hawaii Volcanoes National Park evacuated all visitors and non-emergency staff. The quakes triggered rock slides on park trails and crater walls. Narrow fissures appeared on the ground at a building overlooking the crater at Kilauea\u0027s summit.The University of Hawaii at Hilo and Hawaii Community College both closed campuses and a long stretch of Highway 130, one of the main arteries through Puna, was closed because of the threat of sulfuric gas.Leilani Estates, where lava was pushing through cracks in the earth, has about 1,700 residents and 770 homes.

Activity picked up earlier this week, indicating a possible new lava outbreak.The crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers. The collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles  downslope toward the populated southeast coastline.Residents have faced lava threats before.In 2014, lava burned a house and destroyed a cemetery near the town of Pahoa. Residents were worried it would cover the town\u0027s main road and cut off the community from the rest of the island, but the molten rock stalled.From 1990 through 1991, lava slowly overtook the town of Kalapana, burning homes and covering roads and gardens.Kilauea hasn\u0027t been the kind of volcano that shoots lava from its summit into the sky, causing widespread destruction. It tends to ooze lava from fissures in its sides, which often gives residents at least a few hours\u0027 warning before it reaches their property.In the uncertainty, however, some residents found comfort in the abiding beauty of the Big Island.

But even in London – now, more than ever, a Labour city – the Corbyn revolution is the dog that refused to bark.The party I have worked for all my life catastrophically failed to win targets such as Barnet, where voters, at least in part, turned away from Labour in droves because of the anti-Semitism furore. Outside London the picture was worse, with disastrous performances in Dudley, Derby and elsewhere. Election expert Professor Sir John Curtice pointed out there had actually been a swing to the Conservatives from Labour.Yet according to the leadership’s advance publicity, this was an election in which the Corbyn-supporting Momentum group was supposed to deliver grassroots campaigning and a seismic political breakthrough. How telling that one of Labour’s few success stories, in Plymouth, happened precisely because local activists insisted on running their own campaign and told Momentum to stay away.The lesson to be learned is simple and obvious: Corbyn’s project is leading the party away from victory.            Outside London the picture was worse, with disastrous performances in Dudley, Derby and elsewhereLabour moderates have remained dutifully silent since he unexpectedly won more than 40 per cent of the vote in last year’s General Election. But it’s becoming clear that Theresa May was denied the mandate she sought for a whole host of reasons, not because Corbyn is some sort of modern prophet.Last June some voted for Labour safe in the belief that Corbyn would not be Prime Minister, others because they believed it was their best chance of avoiding a hard Brexit. There were, certainly, some true believers. But it has become increasingly clear that Jeremy’s leadership is going nowhere.Where, for example, is his vision? He could have cauterised the damaging anti-Semitism scandal by exposing it for what it was: the loathsome views of a very small group of far-Left fanatics who joined the party only after he became leader, and expelling those responsible. Instead he has fudged and prevaricated.His policy on the most pressing matter of the day, Brexit, is so vague that even the Shadow Ministers press-ganged to explain it on television and radio tie themselves in knots.And the parliamentary successes Labour has enjoyed in recent months have come because of the hard work and political nous of politicians the Corbynistas hatefully profess to despise as ‘Red Tories’ – backbencher David Lammy shaming the Government over Windrush Margaret Hodge forcing the Government into a U-turn on Commonwealth tax havens Yvette Cooper holding Amber Rudd’s feet to the fire over the ‘hostile environment’ for immigrants, which resulted in her resignation. Keir Starmer and his team are the only reason Labour’s Brexit balancing act has lasted so long.We currently stand at a crossroads in British history, where if Tory hard-Brexit free marketeers have their way, workers’ protections could be shredded, countless jobs lost.This is precisely the moment where the Labour Party should be leading the national debate about our future, but all Corbyn and his acolyte John McDonnell have to offer are ideas that were promoted and rejected in the 1970s and 1980s. I’m not opposed to their ideas of social ownership of water and joint partnerships in rail. But these are not the policies of tomorrow. What does Corbyn’s Labour say to the millions who stand to lose their livelihoods to automation and outsourcing? How will it rejuvenate hollowed-out towns where shops are boarded up? What will it do about our deteriorating public spaces, where shared events and experiences should be enriching all our lives?What, after all, is the point of Labour as a party of principle if it doesn’t make a stand for the people it is elected to represent rather than peddle outmoded political dogma?I was part of a Labour ‘project’ that won three General Elections by appealing to people’s aspirations for a better future, not a return to the past. The lesson then, as now, is Labour can only be politically successful if it creates a clear agenda based on a positive alternative, rather than defining ourselves as being ‘anti’ everybody and everything.The parliamentary party – backbenchers, committee members and Select Committee chairmen – must pick up the cudgel and begin formulating ideas and policies. From among them, a leadership group must be formed from which a genuine alternative can emerge.It won’t be easy. I’ve seen the personal vitriol local activists endure from some Corbyn supporters. I’ve seen the threats of deselection from the likes of Unite’s Len McCluskey. I’ve seen how good Labour MPs are traduced and insulted, and admired the bravery of those who have been vilified for standing up to anti-Semitism.But it’s clear from the council election results that Corbynism is doomed to failure. Rebuilding a new, positive, Labour from the ground up is the only way forward. It’ll take time, which means there’s no time to lose.Whatever your views on Labour, our country and our democracy needs a proper, credible and electable alternative to challenge the Government. A renewed form of moderate New Labour needs to return.  "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/301a443718a18089c75a084481cf38ecbc026def/0_295_5246_3147/master/5246.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57516a35103483a7f53c31b08dd02091","title":"windrush portrait generation photo exhibition","story":"For a year, photographer Jim Grover immersed himself in the world of south London’s Windrush generation – at home, in church and at the domino club• See a gallery of Jim Grover’s photographs of the Windrush generationAmid the furore surrounding the mistreatment of Caribbean-born British citizens by the Home Office appears an exhibition, Windrush: Portrait of a Generation, to be shown in central London, just across the water from Westminster.Jim Grover, a documentary photographer, set out to capture the daily lives and customs of the Windrush generation in the heart of the south London community where he lives. The project began in June 2017 in Grover’s church, where a parishioner invited him to see the clubs where he played “bones” or dominoes. “It was a revelation to me,” says Grover. “I had no idea that Caribbean migrants met three times a week for dominoes in Clapham, where I’ve lived for 30 years.”Intrigued, he began to visit domino clubhouses in Clapham, Croydon and Wandsworth. At first, people were wary of the stranger with a camera, but soon Grover was welcomed into homes, community centres, places of worship and even funerals.Grover discovered a much more important story waiting to be told: “I wanted to capture a Caribbean way of life that most likely won’t be around for ever.” He adds: “I feel so privileged to have been able to photograph the distinctive lives of this lovely community.”Timed to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the arrival of Empire Windrush at Tilbury in June 1948, the exhibition incorporates a number of interviews Grover conducted with Caribbean-born UK residents. “I knew I had to track down at least one surviving ‘Windrusher’ if I were to do justice to this story,” he says.His research took him to 92-year-old Alford Gardner in Leeds, who served in the RAF during the war as a motor mechanic. Having paid the standard £28 to cross the Atlantic on the Windrush, Gardner found work in Leeds with commercial engineers. Inevitably, as a Caribbean “room-seeker” back then he experienced racism (“Room to Let: Regret No Kolored”, ran the typical advert). Usually, though, there was no violence, as any aggressors fled once challenged. “I’ve lived a brilliant life here,” he told Grover. “It was supposed to be tough, but I never really had tough times.”In migrating here, the Windrush citizens believed they were exercising their birthright. “UK – Right of Abode” was stamped in their Commonwealth-issue passports. Teachers, lawyers, writers, artists and field labourers came in response to a recruitment drive and because they hoped for a better life. Not all of the Windrushers had intended to remain “in foreign”, but gradually it dawned on them that the dream of return was just that: they were here to stay. Curated by Katy Barron, the exhibition combines personal stories from first- and second-generation Caribbeans with a series of 12 themed photo-stories that, together, seek to describe the “totality” of their lives today. It explores the community, faith, love, death and friendship it looks at the lives of metalworkers, engineers, churchgoers and former NHS nurses.With his genial manner, Grover was granted access to photograph a Jamaican funeral and its Nine Night mortuary custom, where friends and relatives gather at the deceased’s house for food and drink. The tradition is fast disappearing among the young, but there is life in it yet. (As they say in Jamaica: “No call a man dead til you bury him.”)“Jamaican spirituality is such a beautiful thing,” says Grover, who wanted to capture Caribbean religious respect for a life well lived.His previous photographic exhibitions have documented a year in the life of a Clapham vicar, called Of Things Unseen, and the busy life of a neighbourhood, in last year’s 48 Hours on Clapham High Street. He shoots with a wide-angle lens: “That means getting in really close. At the Jamaican funeral I was literally standing at the grave’s edge. It required a good deal of trust.”For this project, Grover took photographs on 70 occasions. “In order to capture a dominoes match and its after-party, I sometimes had my camera out for long stretches – seven or eight hours. At other times, I just sat and listened to stories and watched life unfold in front of me.”The photographs are poignant and intimate. We see calypso-mento dancers in their “felts” (fedora hats) and domino hotshots banging down tiles. At crowded festive dance parties, or “bashments”, he photographed the elderly moving and flexing to jazz-tinged ska, rock-steady and reggae. The dapper Bockie, a regular at the Cosmo club in Wandsworth, told him: “Our generation… we’re rocking our bodies in our chairs.”Between 1948 and 1969, the formative years of the NHS, an estimated 5,000 Jamaican women came to the UK to work as nurses, while many others worked in different NHS roles. Monica Blair, one of Grover’s 12 photo subjects, arrived from Jamaica in 1964, aged 21, to marry Soney and worked as a cleaner at St Thomas’ hospital near Westminster, before becoming a seamstress. With her deep religious faith, Monica attends the same Anglican church in Clapham as Grover. In his photographs, she ministers communion wine and pores over a well-thumbed Bible, a gift to her as a teenager in Jamaica.By his own admission a “perfectionist” as a photographer, Grover scoured the south London streets in search of one of the famed “front rooms” and found one in Brixton. Once a part of every Jamaican home, front rooms typically contained framed family photographs, a picture of Jesus walking on water, sofas covered in protective plastic, leopardskin rugs and bouquets of artificial flowers. Often, a gold, plastic model of Big Ben or some other shooting-gallery prize graced a giant cocktail cabinet with a Formica top. The rooms are nearly all gone now. “They speak of a bygone era,” says Grover. “Sadly, to the second- and third-generations they’re just clutter.” Towards the end of his project, Grover was invited to photograph a Friday “open house” typical of Caribbean life. In the Brixton home of Hermine Grocia, as many as four generations gather each week for food, chat, a quiz or a game of Scrabble. “I wasn’t even sure I had space for it in the exhibition,” he says, “but I am so pleased to have spent the evening with Hermine and 21 of her family. It was so moving to see this wonderful family be so loving, relaxed and connected… they get together every Friday. It was the last thing I shot, and it ended the project for me on such a high.”Hermine met her future husband, Lester, on the Kingston wharf in 1959, just as they were about to sail for “Missus Queen’s” country. Like most of the Windrush generation, she had come to the UK determined to work. Grover’s moving and often beautiful photographs show the other side of the current Windrush scandal: they celebrate a community and a generation that contributed immeasurably to our cultural life.“The more I immersed myself in this project,” Grover says, “the more I realised that I was capturing living history. As this generation passes away, and the successive generations pursue their own lives here, some of these traditions will inevitably weaken. It felt imperative to document this way of life and to record these stories before it becomes too late.”Windrush: Portrait of a Generation is at gallery@Oxo, Oxo Tower Wharf, London SE1, 23 May-10 June.

The journey of the Saltwater people of the Gold Coast as documented by photographer David Kelly and narrated by Ben Allmon by Ben Allmon and David KellySeventy kilometres, three days, two canoes, one unforgettable adventure. The journey of the Saltwater people of the Gold Coast as documented by photographer David Kelly and narrated by Ben Allmon by Ben Allmon and David Kelly“A land bridge connected Minjerribah (Stradbroke Island) to Kombumerri country (Southport) and Goories also came in canoes to Minjerribah trading bunya for eugarie, amongst other things.” – History Life and Times of Robert Anderson, Gheebelum, Ngugi, MulgumpinReading this four years ago, I realised I knew nothing of the Indigenous history of my home on the Gold Coast – the land of the Saltwater people. I felt a responsibility to my young son to learn the story of the place we live, so that when he grew up I could teach it to him.But who was going to teach me? So I embarked on a voyage of discovery that carried me further than I ever expected, into a cultural story that is rarely offered to outsiders. What started as an attempt to educate myself became something far bigger – The Saltwater Story.Anderson’s account gave me an idea – why not make canoes and re-establish these ancient routes of connection? The Bundjalung, Yugambeh and Quandamooka were accomplished seafarers with complex maritime routes plied by bark and dugout canoe (gundal) – the former for short trips, the latter for longer voyages like the one described in Anderson’s book. The bark canoe in particular illustrates how to sustainably take what you need from your environment – the bark is removed but the tree remains alive and over time new bark grows. Very few still possess this knowledge – thanks to veteran paddler Mark Matthews I met Bundjalung canoemaker Kyle Slabb, who does. We quickly realised that this was more than just an opportunity for a whitefella to engage and educate himself – it was a chance to ensure cultural continuity in the next generation of Saltwater people. We decided to document the experience in a film, a book and an exhibit of David’s amazing photographs. As it happens, there was a suitable bark canoe tree in my backyard but the year was too dry to make a viable gundal. Nevertheless, Kyle’s demonstration of the crafting techniques to the younger generation was invaluable. We then made dugouts from hoop pine and paulownia the latter wood repels seawater, which prevents it from becoming waterlogged. Even when the temperature rose to 45 degrees, the young mob were interested in chipping in with (and away at) the canoe.We departed from the middle of Surfers Paradise on Australia Day weekend, surrounded by huge modern vessels and glittering towers. Maori, Dragonboaters and the general boating community joined us on the first leg in a wonderful flotilla – a celebration of all maritime histories in this country.Over the next three days and 70km through shark-infested waters we watched the young men grow into their roles, assume the mantle of leadership for the voyage. When we reached Dunwich (Goompi), a lot of the Quandamooka welcomed us. It was an emotional experience for many, especially as Robert Anderson himself, 88, was the elder who welcomed the paddlers … and with whom we exchanged bunya for eugarie. It had been 150 years since this journey had been made. There is talk now all along the Sea Eagle songline of canoe making, of connecting through the canoe over the saltwater again.So what will I tell my son? A story of connection – between the Saltwater people, between generations, between black and white, between land, sea and sky. A story of collaboration – whether it is made from bark or dugout, no one makes a canoe alone.A story of co-operation – paddlers working together to get to their destination, through rough seas and shark-infested waters.A story of continuance – of ancient knowledge held by just a few, of ensuring that tomorrow’s elders are brought along for the journey today. That is the Saltwater stories"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/446013b2d2bbf76ae9a2a5a09551c502369b63b6/0_0_4163_2498/master/4163.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba933f6e47e93b4d9a2a7ee42517d4a6","title":"against such a shambolic government labour should be doing better than this","story":"Stalemate is a result which a prime minister at midterm can live with. Tories have been left feeling more cheerful than they deserve to beOne way of assessing who has done best at a midterm election is by computing vote shares and measuring swings. If we do politics by calculator, then the local elections were pretty much a dead heat. Both Labour and the Tories enjoyed gains they could trumpet both suffered losses they’d prefer not to talk about. Like First World War armies, they have fired their shot and shell, only to end up in a trench warfare stalemate. Labour can pray in aid the projections that this result, translated into a general election, would make the party the largest in a hung parliament. Tories can retort that that’s worse than Ed Miliband managed when these council seats were contested in 2014. The projection then had him in Downing Street with a majority. So much for projections.If you want to know how the parties really feel about how they performed, forget the swings, the shares and the misleading extrapolations. Get out of the psephologists’ playground and use your ears to measure the frequency and quality of the excuses coming out of the spinners and spokespeople. In that regard, Labour has been on the back foot since the polls closed it is Jeremy Corbyn’s team that talks like the deflated party.In the early hours of Friday morning, at a time when all but political nerds have put themselves to bed, I watched Dawn Butler, a member of the shadow cabinet, trying to put a brave face on disappointment by saying: “We always knew it was going to be a difficult election.” This is normally the alibi you hear rolled out by a government minister explaining why midterm elections nearly always go badly for whoever is in power at Westminster. You do not anticipate hearing the defensive “always knew it was going to be a difficult election” excuse from a senior spokesperson for the principal party of opposition.Still less do you expect to hear it from the main challenger to the government, when the incumbents have fouled up so atrociously in the run-up to polling day and have been in office for a long and torrid stretch. The Conservatives are entering their ninth year in power. Economic growth is anaemic and many people are still not seeing real increases in their wages. Public services, especially many local services, have been pinched by the protracted grip of austerity. Mrs May has just lost another cabinet minister, the fourth forced departure from her top table in six months. From the national picture to the local one, from the shameful Windrush scandal to the record number of potholes breaking wheels and bones on the roads, the Tories went into these elections facing strong headwinds. They thought that they’d be the ones having to scrabble\u0026nbsparound for the excuses on election night. The Tories were on the ropes and flinching before an expected thumping by Labour that didn’t materialise. Some say that Labour has got the rough end of the stick in the post-election assessments because the party was poor at playing “the expectations game”. Anticipation of what could be achieved became overblown, with the consequence that a reasonable result would then be interpreted as failure.There may be some truth to this when we examine what happened in London. Labour had a result there that confirms its dominance in the capital, but it was not quite powerful enough to knock the Tories out of control in Kensington \u0026amp Chelsea, Wandsworth or Westminster. You can say that Labour lost the expectations game or you can be a bit less polite and observe that the party’s leadership and its admirers have been guilty of hubris. They went on about seizing the “Tory crown jewels” in the capital because they really thought there was a chance this was going to happen. They have so taken it for granted that Britain is inexorably embracing Corbynism that it has come as a bit of a shock to find that many voters still have the gravest reservations about giving their support to Labour even when the main alternative is Mrs May’s party.In some places, Labour was punished for specifics. The failure to deal with antisemitism in the party’s ranks clearly hurt the party and badly in Barnet, where it failed to win a part of north London it should have taken. Jeremy Corbyn’s broader problem is the same one he had at the election last year. Under him, the party does extremely well in large urban conurbations. One of Labour’s advances was to deprive the Tories of control in Trafford in Greater Manchester.Labour also has increased support by historic standards among more affluent professionals. It is one of life’s ironies that Mr Corbyn has made Labour a more middle-class party than Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson managed to do. We also know that Labour is popular among younger generations. It may be that Labour’s performance at the locals was somewhat suppressed compared with a general election because younger voters are less likely to turn out for council elections. Where Labour made insufficient progress at the general election, and continues to struggle, is beyond the big cities and university towns. The party is doing particularly badly among older and less affluent voters in provincial England. It underperformed in areas such as Basildon, Bolton, Derby, Dudley, Nuneaton, Swindon and Walsall. These are places with key parliamentary constituencies where the opposition has to be winning well at this stage of the electoral cycle to look credible as a government-in-waiting.One Labour alibi for this is to blame the implosion of Ukip, which has become the “Black Death” party in the estimation of its own general secretary. For every three former Ukip voters, two went to the Conservatives and just one to Labour. It seems to me that Labour has been a bit too ready to accept this as inevitable, rather than to ask itself why it can’t appeal to more of these voters. That boosted the Conservatives as they enjoyed the bigger helping from the carrion of Ukip. But this feast contains a poison pill. Because a large chunk of Tory support was provided by Leave voters, the hard Brexiters have been emboldened to clamour for more concessions to their demands. The price of catering to that constituency is that it will further alienate the Tories from the younger and more liberal voters that they will need to attract if they are ever to assemble a decent parliamentary majority.Forward-thinking Tories will also be worried that the Lib Dems are flickering back to life. The gains made by Vince Cable’s party will lift morale and encourage them to think they can rebuild the traditional base in local government that was devastated during the coalition years. As importantly, the evisceration of Ukip re-establishes the Lib Dems as the third party in England, which ought to give a boost to their presence in the media. They will be helped by voters being reminded of their existence more regularly. Experience suggests that a Lib-Dem revival will hurt the Conservatives in parliamentary contests more than it damages Labour. That is for the future. Theresa May, a prime minister who measures success by whether she gets to the end of the week, is simply glad that she avoided a Tory meltdown. For her, survival is a kind of triumph.Local elections are a highly imperfect guide to general election success or failure, the more so when the next national contest could be as much as four years away. That said, we should not make the opposite mistake of pronouncing that they are entirely meaningless. The voters are always telling us something about the present and a bit about the future when they cast a ballot. On these results, there is no clear path to a parliamentary majority for either of the big parties. The Labour MP Jess Phillips got it right when she drolly observed: “I see everyone is claiming failure as victory.”Failure is always relative in politics. Stalemate is a result that a government at midterm can live with. Tories have been left feeling more cheerful than they deserve to be and more optimistic about their prospects than they have been for a while. A draw is not good enough for the main opposition party. “We should have romped home,” remarks one senior Labour MP. More of them would be saying that publicly if they did not feel intimidated into silence. Against a shambolic and ided government presiding over a weak economy, Labour has not put in the level of performance necessary to make it look like an opposition party striding confidently towards national victory.Deep down, at least some of Labour’s leadership know this. Just listen to the excuses."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b6bcd2e1d83535d0974c1560e36f3bcd6371997/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6cf4433fd69131d2a60cbb46c86d1d9b","title":"even when the likes of macron foul up multilingual politicians get it right","story":"The French president, Emmanuel Macron, never ceases to surprise his audience, especially when he speaks in English.

The rewards are manifold and it is even thought to prevent Alzheimer’s disease.The smartest leaders either know many languages or understand the power of words enough to play with them to their advantage. Perhaps Macron used the word “delicious” on\u0026nbsppurpose perhaps, even, the secret behind the strangely warm rapport between Macron, Trump and their wives is built on such deliciously faux amis?The fact is that multilinguists rule the world. That Angela Merkel is trilingual (she speaks German, Russian and English) should be no surprise. If David Cameron had not been a monoglot, maybe Britain would not have found itself in a Brexit nightmare. Just a thought.I will always remember when Yasser Arafat, the leader of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, on a visit to Paris in 1989 declared in French on French television that the PLO’s charter was “caduque!” What a stroke of genius. The world reached for their French dictionaries and discovered Arafat had just buried the 1964 Palestinian charter (since “caduque” means out of date), which had so far insisted that armed struggle was the only possible way to win back the homeland. This tiny word paved the way to the Oslo accords of 1993 and the famous handshake between Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin in Washington.In 1940, Parisians owed a big favour to Louisa Gross née Horwitz, the mother of the then American ambassador to Paris, William Christian Bullitt Jr. A German Jew, she made sure that her son was perfectly trilingual, as fluent in German and French as in American English. When the French government fled Paris, in effect making Bullitt the provisional governor of the city, there were only a few hours left to save the city from the fate shared by Rotterdam and Warsaw. Bullitt managed to persuade two French officials to meet their German counterparts at Écouen, 12 miles north of Paris, to settle terms for the handover. With the document signed, the German Field Marshal Georg von Küchler called off the bombardment of Paris.In everyday life, multilingualism and potential linguistic gaffes don’t carry such catastrophic potency, and faux amis leading to faux pas are part of the learning process. When I first arrived in Britain, aged 22, I found out that, more often than not, French words in the English language don’t actually mean a thing. I recall an awkward evening when an Englishman whispered some slightly salacious things to me. He winked and apologised for the “double entendre”. Double entendre? It took me some time to realise he meant “sous-entendre” – meaning implication.It is, however, always better to make small mistakes like Macron did in Australia than to rely on poor translators. The writer Oliver Kamm, the son of one of the greatest living British translators Anthea Bell, reminded me this week that in 1977, the translator Steven Seymour, accompanying Jimmy Carter on an official state visit to Poland, had to be fired after a disastrous first evening. President Carter had begun his speech saying: “I have come to learn your opinions and understand your desires for the future.” His translator told the Poles, in Polish: “I\u0026nbsphave a carnal desire for Poland.”• Agnès Poirier is the author of Left Bank, Arts, Passion and the Rebirth of Paris 1940-1950"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4ce6079918f7de1e10e53e2a615275fba3eda17/0_150_5076_3045/master/5076.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ebcffdd09c5d6fb4f7f22b7797b3168","title":"observer view on local elections ukip toxic influence on tory party","story":"The Conservative party mopped up stray voters from the right, not the leftIn an election first, the general secretary of Ukip drew on the bubonic plague to explain the near-total collapse in its vote in last week’s local elections. “Think of the Black Death,” Paul Oakley said. “It causes disruption and then it goes dormant. And that’s exactly what we’re going to do. Our time isn’t finished.”The Observer is the world\u0027s oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791. It is published by  News \u0026amp Media and is editorially independent.It’s easy to laugh at the inelegant metaphor. Oakley’s prognosis, however, cannot be so jovially dismissed. It’s true that Ukip’s electoral implosion was one of the few clear stories to emerge from a set of local elections that produced a stalemate for the two main parties. However, it would be premature to celebrate the demise of rightwing populism in Britain.Ukip has undoubtedly had a profound impact on our politics. Without its resurgence five years ago, it is unlikely that David Cameron, worried about leaching votes to his right, would have committed to a European referendum. Even as the party descended into chaos in its wake, farcically cycling through five leaders in just 18 months, it has continued to exert a pull.It should not be a surprise that the Conservatives have gained the most from Ukip’s collapse. Populism has not withered after the referendum, it has simply migrated. As Ukip has declined, Theresa May’s strategy to ape its populist rhetoric has come into sharper focus. It was not a Conservative party winning over swing voters from Labour that acted as a firewall against Labour success outside London last week – it was one mopping up on its right flank.On Europe, it has become clear that there is nothing May fears more than cries of betrayal from the right of her party, which could resonate with those who voted to leave, tempting some over to a successor to Ukip. And so she continues to carve out a Brexit policy, such that it is, in the interests of her party rather than the country. The government maintains the pretence that there are no tough choices to make between maintaining access to the single market and having the freedom to erge from its rules between taking more control over our borders and avoiding an economic hit. We can have our cake and eat it May remains wedded to a hard Brexit outside the single market and customs union, regardless of the costs.This is straight out of the populist playbook. A government devoid of vision, with no solutions to the long-term economic shifts that helped sow the seeds for Brexit, is instead laying the blame at the feet of immigrants and people living in poverty. And it is misleading the public about the risks of Brexit. If it is accompanied by significant medium-term economic pain – with forecasts suggesting that areas most affected by deindustrialisation will suffer the most – this risks creating the fertile territory for a far-right nationalist party to capitalise on the justified anger of those living in places where austerity and Brexit have combined to make things worse since the financial crisis.Dog-whistle populism hasn’t died with Ukip – it has made itself comfortable in the Tory party. In choosing to fuel a “them and us” ision, rather than uniting the country, May is jeopardising more than the long-term fortunes of her party – she is putting at stake the tolerant country Britain is today."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a35926c08e4137460045c2f3d6345f19d5ba781/0_15_2835_1702/master/2835.jpg?w=465\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=35607ab2ae5955e226c045f897c93720 930w","title":"get the lowdown on ottawa a local reveals all","story":"Queen Victoria may have picked Ottawa out of obscurity to name it the capital of Canada but the city has grown into a modern metropolis packed with award-winning restaurants, stunning architecture and a local population that loves to embrace the outdoorsWhen Queen Victoria picked Ottawa to be the capital of Canada it was an unimposing frontier town: the city has since grown into a modern metropolis packed with award-winning restaurants, stunning architecture and a local population that’s all about the outdoors.Whatever the weather, Ottawites embrace all four seasons. On lazy, hazy summer Sundays, stretches of the Sir John A Macdonald Parkway are closed to traffic and become a pedestrian haven. Why not join the dog walkers and bicyclists, in-line skaters and joggers alongside the beaches and rapids of the Ottawa river? You can paddle the rivers that frame the city – the Ottawa, Gatineau or Rideau – or enjoy the wildlife in urban parks or the much-loved Greenbelt, around 20,000 hectares (around 49,500 acres) of farms, forests and wetlands that surrounds the capital. In May, admire the rich colours of the Canadian Tulip Festival it’s the world’s largest, with over a million orange, red and yellow flowers.In winter, locals descend en masse to skate on Ottawa’s central Rideau canal. The world’s largest naturally frozen ice-skating route is home to a hardy crowd who chow down on Beavertails (that’s a pastry, not an animal’s tail), pull on cosy clothes and toques (wool hats), and glide along for nearly 5 miles (around 7.8 km). For three weekends in February, the Winterlude festival brings ice sculptures, foodie events and a children’s Snowflake Kingdom.Thanks to it’s historical significance, Ottawa is not short of imposing buildings. Admire the vaulting neo-gothic spires of Parliament Hill, the crystal tower of the National Gallery of Canada and, just across the river in the twin city of Gatineau, the Canadian Museum of History, the design of which is inspired by Canada’s topography.The Hill is also the centre point for Canada Day, Canada’s birthday celebrations every 1 July. Expect to find a stage showcasing Canadian musicians, followed by fireworks at night. Watch from the Hill or behind the Fairmont Château Laurier, the historic “castle”, opened as a grand hotel in 1912. Parliament’s central Peace Tower is perfect for a bird’s-eye panorama of the city visit on Wednesdays at noon in summer for free yoga sessions in front of parliament on the lawn. Keep your eyes peeled: you might just see prime minister Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie Grégoire Trudeau joining in.There’s a vibrant restaurant scene in Ottowa. Explore the eclectic cuisine of Canadian Culinary Champion Marc Lepine, the only chef to win the Gold Medal Plates competition twice, at his restaurant Atelier or the innovative Middle Eastern fare of Walid El-Tawel at Fairouz.City neighbourhoods are equally exciting and eminently walkable. ByWard Market is arguably the most vibrant, with more than 120 places to eat and drink in a four-block-by-four-block patch that’s also home to a great selection of shops. Also try Westboro and the Glebe, where you’ll find Lansdowne, a complex with a year-round farmers’ market and a new stadium where you can catch sports events downtown. Ottawa’s museum and gallery scene reflects Canadians’ past and future hopes. Gatineau’s Canadian Museum of History’s Grand Hall with its towering totem poles captures the lasting presence of indigenous cultures, while the museum’s new Canadian History Hall presents the largest and most comprehensive exhibition about Canadian history ever created. In contrast, quirky Bytown Museum reveals the history of Ottawa . Here you can discover the military raison d’être of the Rideau canal – a Unesco world heritage site – as you learn about its construction after the British colony’s war of 1812 with the US.

He sounded, as is his wont, unfussed about this and, in turn, those listening at the press conference could understandably have dismissed the boast as a hollow one.Isn’t Cannes more or less the same every year, after all? The roster of high-minded films from brand-name auteurs mixed in with the annual concession to blockbuster celebrity-bait takes a similar shape from one edition to the next.The parties and premiere photos are all but interchangeable across the years. The controversies, too, are more or less fixed in place: every year you can count on headlines about gratuitous provocations on screen, press conference gaffes, booing in the aisles, the paucity of female film-makers in the programme, and the sartorial sexism of the rigid red-carpet dress code. Journalists covering the festivals are constantly checking they haven’t reused last year’s bon mots a four-year cycle, at least, seems more or less reasonable.Yet once Frémaux had unveiled his 2018 selection, eyebrows remained largely raised. European Twitter wags gleefully declared a “Frémauxcalypse” many Americans were left bewildered. “Seriously?” shrieked the reactionary Hollywood blogger Jeffrey Wells, swiftly declaring the lineup, sight unseen, the worst in memory. “I get the overwhelming feeling we’re being punished for something,” half-joked New York Magazine’s Emily Yoshida.Over in London, Mike Leigh, a former Palme d’Or winner, might have wondered something similar. His forthcoming historical epic, Peterloo, widely seen as a sure bet for the Cannes competition, had been passed over – the most surprising of several high-profile auteur omissions whose films had been seen and assessed by Frémaux’s selection committee. Italy’s Paolo Sorrentino, whose last six films all competed at Cannes, was frozen out with his Berlusconi biopic, Loro. Japan’s Naomi Kawase, a mainstay of the festival since winning the Camera d’Or for her 1997 debut, Suzaku, was left off the list too, despite the Cannes-friendly presence of Juliette Binoche in her latest, Vision. Meanwhile, Claire Denis, a critics’ darling who somehow hasn’t been in competition at Cannes since 1988, was widely expected to break the hex with High Life, a sci-fi film starring Robert Pattinson. Frémaux had other ideas.The bloodbath was compounded by the immediate fallout from the festival’s much-publicised dispute with the content streaming monolith Netflix, the distributor behind several big-name attractions that had been expected to premiere on the Croisette, including Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma, Paul Greengrass’s Norway and the eagerly awaited completion of Orson Welles’s The Other Side of the Wind, which had been decades in the making.Netflix famously opts to release its films immediately online. French exhibitors, resistant to this new model, require a window of cinema exclusivity. Failure to broker a compromise between the two resulted in Netflix withdrawing its films altogether. Bar an unlikely softening in stance on either side, last year’s Netflix-backed competition entries Okja and The Meyerowitz Stories will remain anomalies for the foreseeable future.In place of the predicted big shots are several names that have casual observers scratching their heads: Eva Husson (Girls of the Sun), Ryusuke Hamaguchi (Asako I \u0026amp II), Kirill Serebrennikov (Leto), Sergei Dvortsevoy (My Little One), Nadine Labaki (Capernaum) and Abu Bakr Shawky (Yomeddine).Apart from the Egyptian newcomer Shawky – granted a competition slot for his debut feature, an irregular occurrence at Cannes – these directors are not unknown quantities to critics and industry folk schooled in the contemporary festival circuit. But they are the sort of up-and-comers, mostly hailed for previous, promising but modestly exposed works, that Cannes tends to reserve for its secondary Un Certain Regard section: a lively strand dominated by rising stars, mixed in with the occasional competition regular serving some sort of demotion sentence. This year’s relegated major is Ukraine’s Sergei Loznitsa, whose impressive but grindingly difficult A Gentle Creature was in competition last year, and proved sufficiently alienating to earn his latest, Donbass, an opportunity as this year’s Un Certain Regard opener.While the odd talented upstart is occasionally fast-tracked to competition status – Andrea Arnold made the grade with her 2006 debut Red Road, and has competed twice since – the festival tends to take a cautious, conservative approach to programming its top tier. An old boys’ club (with emphasis, regrettably, on “boys”) predominates: veterans like Michael Haneke, Ken Loach, Pedro Almodóvar and the Dardenne brothers make the cut for almost every film they make, major or minor, competing principally against others who have been to the rodeo before.This year’s competition lineup isn’t a complete rejection of the old guard, with contenders including the former Palme d’Or winner Nuri Bilge Ceylan (The Wild Pear Tree), the 87-year-old New Wave luminary Jean-Luc Godard (The Image Book), and revived American firebrand Spike Lee – though referring to Lee, returning on agitated form with the timely racial drama BlacKkKlansman, as any kind of elder statesman suggests the festival is experiencing some form of generational shift. But of the 21 films in the lineup, 10 come from Cannes newcomers – a far higher number than in other years under Frémaux’s rule and an exciting indication that Cannes is ready to refresh its auteur pantheon.Not all the newcomers are, well, newcomers: fresh from his Oscar win for Ida, Pawel Pawlikowski makes his Cannes debut with the similarly-styled Cold War, while Jafar Panahi, an embattled political prisoner in his native Iran, is seeking to complete the European festival triple crown (after winning Berlin’s Golden Bear and Venice’s Golden Lion) with his first competition entry, Three Faces. Hamaguchi is comparatively new on the block, but his last film, the five-hour female friendship saga Happy Hour, was an international festival hit minted at the more left-field Locarno showcase. Such selections are an encouraging sign that Cannes selectors, rather than focusing merely on the festival’s own hierarchy, are wising up and catching on to success stories outside their realm.There are still blind spots here, of course. Only three female directors in a lineup of 21 films remains an embarrassing statistic, one not masked by a female majority on this year’s Cate Blanchett-headed jury. One hopes that Blanchett, never shy about addressing gender imbalance in the industry, gives Frémaux some pointed feedback.And in a festival touted as the pre-eminent showcase of world cinema, it’s always galling when entire continents go awol from the lineup: the flip side of Asian cinema pleasingly having its best Cannes showing in years is the much-protested absence of South America. (Hopes had been high for the Colombian sensation Ciro Guerra to make the grade for his eagerly awaited Embrace of the Serpent follow-up, Birds of Passage he had to settle instead for opening the independently programmed directors’ fortnight strand.)It’s the unusually low profile of that continent’s northern neighbour in this year’s competition, however, that remains its biggest, most bracing surprise. Lee apart, the only sprinkling of Hollywood stardust comes with David Robert Mitchell’s noir Under the Silver Lake, starring Andrew Garfield. He is the kind of ascending indie director who wouldn’t usually be admitted to the Cannes golden circle so early.Yet there he is, in a slot that former competition bad boy Lars von Trier would dearly love to have. Seven years after earning persona non grata status with his infamous “I understand Hitler” blunder, the Dane has been only half-welcomed back, landing an out-of-competition spot for his serial-killer drama, The House That Jack Built, that smacks of continuing rebuke. Pushed to the fringes in favour of fresher, less offending names, he could well feel piqued enough to say something similarly crass at his comeback press conference. Not everything at this year’s gratifyingly unpredictable festival has to change, after all.David Robert Mitchell Under the Silver LakeThe American director, 44,made his debut in 2010 with The Myth of the American Sleepover, a wistful coming-of-age film that played in Cannes’ low-profile critics’ week section, before sharpening his teeth on the rattling indie horror film, It Follows (2014). Now, with his gonzo 140-minute, Under the Silver Lake, he makes an ambitious play for Lynchian status.Eva Husson Girls of the SunOne of the wildest cards in this lineup, Husson, 41, split the critics with her stylish, sexually explicit teenage dream Bang Gang (A Modern Love Story) in 2015 and now moves on to very different terrain with Girls of the Sun, a study of a Kurdish female battalion reclaiming their its town from extremists.Snagging a Cannes competition slot for your directorial debut remains a rare feat, so critics will be curious to find out what the selection committee saw in Shawky, an Egyptian-Austrian film-maker by way of New York University film school, and his comedy, Yomeddine, about two lepers leaving their colony in search of their estranged families.Ryusuke Hamaguchi Asako I \u0026amp IIThe Japanese writer-director, 39, has made a number of features since his 2007 debut, but found international acclaim in 2015 with his five-hour intimate epic, Happy Hour, a bittersweet study of female friendship that won awards at Locarno. His follow-up, the romantic drama Asako I \u0026amp II, runs a mere two hours.A late addition to the line-up, Gonzalez – a Frenchman and a former member of the dreamy electronica band M83 – made a splashy debut in 2013 with his queer erotic drama, You and the Night, and appears to be bringing similarly neon-hued energy to the competition with his second film, Knife + Heart, a thriller starring Vanessa Paradis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1cdb9b79a1c875dfcfbf2e9334b69c6e7161ad2/423_1872_3097_1858/master/3097.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9052ecebcfae5870d22524cd7cf72e9","title":"sean penn some of my best laughs have come out of the worst reviews","story":"The actor turned author speaks his mind about critics, ‘arrogant’ aid work, the ‘mania-led’ #MeToo movement, and why Madonna finds him boring. By Emma BrockesSean Penn walks into a low-key restaurant not far from his house and slides undetected into a seat at the back. It is a misty day in Malibu, 15 miles north of LA, and the actor appears in familiar, I-don’t-care guise: beat-up leather jacket, brushfire hair (which, in light of the views he will air about female vanity in Hollywood, I feel bound to report may be more vibrant than nature intended), with the jittery energy of a man who has stood for too long next to very loud speakers. The 57-year-old greets me affably, to my surprise: while Penn may be long admired for his acting, he is denigrated for almost everything else. He is known to be pugnacious, short-tempered, long-winded, a man who yells at photographers and smokes on TV. And now he has written a lunatic novel. “It’s the most fun I’ve had professionally,” he croaks and leans back in his chair.A few days before our meeting, Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff was the subject of a full-page newspaper ad in which the publishers, rather cleverly, ran lines from the book’s worst reviews and asked readers to make up their own minds. The novel, which follows the adventures of its eponymous hero as he goes around selling septic tanks and murdering old people, is a satire of American consumer culture and the cult of image, and for weeks its excesses have been gleefully documented. Penn writes as if every word has been put through a thesaurus: for “face”, read “dermal mask” for “quiet”, “lingering symphony of silence” a man with good hearing has “extraordinary auditory augmentation efficiency”. So it goes on, until we reach: “Effervescence lived in her every cellular expression, and she had spizzerinctum to spare.”Was he edited?“He wasn’t looking to change anything,” Penn says cheerfully. “But he did send me great notes which said, ‘I don’t understand this. Do you want me to?’” (In most cases Penn replied “yes” in some, “not so much”.) The suggestion he was indulged because of his celebrity is one he finds baffling. “No, because I wouldn’t have done it any other way. When people listen to the advice they get, it usually robs the soul of the piece. In the movies, they’re not thinking about whether it has impact on them they’re thinking about whether it will impact the box office.”This rather quaint view of publishing – as an industry devoid of commercial principles and certainly not the kind of business that might judge a book by a famous actor to have greater value as a car crash than as something more credible – is the main source of Penn’s enthusiasm for novel writing, which he sees as a less mediated form of expression than acting. But why would he trade in something he is indisputably world class at – Penn has won two Oscars, for Milk and Mystic River – for something he is indisputably not? The answer is burnout, what he calls “my great source of alienation from my peers, actors who would rather sell a movie than make one”. Where these actors are “brands”, and where even a movie he loves “is the sum of compromises at its best”, Bob Honey, by contrast, is “all mine. It’s been said you never complete a film, you abandon it, and I didn’t abandon this. I stand by every line exactly how I wrote it.”Has he seen the worst reviews? “I have a sense of them. It’s keep-your-day-job shit. A bunch of children, schadenfreude, whatever. And in the end, some of the best laughs I’ve got have been the one-liners that have come out of the worst reviews.”Through long espousal of leftwing politics, including vocal protests against the Iraq war and support of Hugo Chávez and Raúl Castro, Penn is used to being unpopular. Does it hurt to be mocked? “Well, mocked means the person’s an idiot.” Penn smiles crookedly and shutters his lids. “I’m not vulnerable at all.”There are two images of Sean Penn that rival the memory of his greatest screen roles. Up there with Carlito’s Way, or Dead Man Walking, or his role as Harvey Milk – the 2008 biopic of California’s first gay elected official and a performance for which one could almost forgive Penn any amount of bad behaviour off-screen – there is the shot of him in a boat rescuing survivors of Hurricane Katrina, and the one of his handshake with Mexican drug lord El Chapo.The gung-ho activism is more complicated and, on closer inspection, much more admirable than the caricature suggests. If there is precedent for Penn wading into a job about which he knows nothing and nailing it through sheer bloody-mindedness, it is here, in his experiences with aid.In 2010, Penn went to Haiti in the wake of the devastating earthquake and set up the JP Haitian Relief Organization, an agency that has, by all accounts, been enormously successful and helped thousands of Haitians find shelter and medical relief. In a piece in the New York Times in 2011, by which time Penn had been in Haiti for almost a year, veteran aid workers lined up to praise him. The question of what he was doing in Haiti in the first place has roots in his inability to find equilibrium at home. The most persuasive passages in Bob Honey are those in which Penn writes of his character’s insomnia. When I ask if this comes from experience, he takes a big breath. “So this goes back as far as I, or my mother, can remember. I was born at 3.45am and I generally fall asleep at 3.45am. I’ve been to Zen centres, done sleep studies, everything. I could never get myself to go to sleep. I’d get up, sometimes, with no sleep at all. And I was getting older, so I wasn’t able to push through this thing mentally.” Eventually a doctor prescribed Ambien: “But it doesn’t work like it used to. It doesn’t keep me asleep, but I get to sleep and at least get three hours. Then you’re watching the clock for the time you have to get up, and it’s getting closer and closer.”Some of Penn’s wilder behaviour makes more sense, perhaps, when looked at in the context of a man who has never had more than three unbroken hours’ sleep.“Yuh. Judgment issues,” he says, raising his eyebrows in what is almost certainly a reference to the time, in 2009, when a court made him attend anger management classes after an altercation with a photographer.It probably didn’t improve your temper, I suggest.“No. Nor the thoughts that lead to a temperamental response.”One result of this is that Penn often feels himself to operate best in crisis mode. He quotes a line from Cutter’s Way, a movie from 1981 starring Jeff Bridges and John Heard in which a woman kills herself to get away from her alcoholic husband, and the final line of which is: “You know, the routine grind drives me to drink. Tragedy, I take straight.”“There’s been a lot of that in my life,” Penn says and he relates it, obliquely, to how he is able to function effectively in a destabilised environment such as Haiti after the earthquake. “I think tragedy can also be urgency. I find myself going calm, and being demanding. I can bring an American arrogance to anywhere in the world.” He smiles. “Look, in the movie business you tell your crew: ‘I need this set done yesterday.’ When I got to Haiti and I saw how NGOs worked, it would be like: ‘This patient needs this, now, and this is the person to get in touch with.’ Then I had six other people asking me six other things. When I circled back half an hour later to the first one and said, ‘Did you get it?’ they said, ‘We’re waiting for a response, we sent an email.’ I said, ‘You sent an email? Give me your phone, I’m going to call.’ And it drove me fucking mad.”Pretty quickly, Penn’s outfit became known as an agency that got things done quicker than the NGOs and he calls it “the easiest kind of work to do in an emergency, because it’s emergency related”. It was triage. He nods. “It’s the easiest, commonsense work. There’s a kid in the street, a truck’s going to hit it, do you know that the sidewalk is clear of paedophiles? No. I’ll make my apologies later.”It is fascinating that the self-important urgency of a Hollywood movie set can be translated to a disaster zone, but think about it, Penn says: “It’s the same business, the stakes are higher.” There’s even overlap with the sanitation logistics of shooting a movie. “You’ve gotta get porta potties for people.”Was he surprised when allegations were made last year that aid workers, including Roland Van Hauwermeiren, the head of Oxfam in Haiti, used sex workers? “I don’t know why it wasn’t a bigger scandal earlier. I was reading about it in the Haitian press when I was in Haiti in the beginning. Roland Van Hauwermeiren was probably the best country director of an organisation there. Of course, you’re not the best anything if you’re looking the other way on that stuff. Or, worse yet, if you’re participating.”In his own organisation, Penn had a policy of “no tolerance” right down to the rule that “if you smoke one joint, you’re fired”. In fact he ended up relaxing the drugs rule for his indigenous workers, because “how am I controlling that when my local workers went back to their homes at night? I stopped being an idiot with that.” For the imports, mostly Americans or Brits, however, “You don’t come to this country to break its laws.”And when someone in his organisation did break a rule? Well, Penn says, “There’s no organisation, including my own, where you don’t have something happen. And you deal with it you certainly want to take it transparent.” The cover-up, he says, is the biggest problem. “I’ve known of situations where big organisations discovered something and did an investigation, and fired somebody – and because they didn’t want a lawsuit from that person, another organisation would hire them it’s like passing on priests. In our organisation, I’d get on the phone to whoever the violator was and say, ‘If I hear you are ever trying to get a job in one of these organisations, I’m coming to your home town, and I’m going to rent out the movie theatre and show a documentary about you and make sure your parents are there.’”Why does he think an aid worker, who presumably starts out with good intentions, gets to the point of exploiting desperate women this way? “I can have theories,” Penn says, “but they’re the same theories one would apply to someone who abuses their children. How do you do that?”In light of these life-or-death stakes, Penn is unsympathetic to what he seems to regard as more trivial abuses closer to home, particularly those involving celebrity exposure. A week before we meet, he appeared in the gossip columns for dining with Charlie Rose, the disgraced former TV host fired from PBS and CBS for inappropriate behaviour around female staff. Penn is not, it is safe to say, on board with #MeToo, which he describes as “not intellectually honest”, “a movement led by mania” and full of “self-aggrandisement and venting”. At the end of Bob Honey, he writes a poem defending Charlie Rose and appearing to lament the demise of Louis CK.Clearly, I say, Penn thinks his friend was mistreated.“He says one thing happened other people said another thing happened. I wasn’t there. What I do think is we maybe should be very careful for example, are we now going to say we will never celebrate Thomas Jefferson again: slave holder, that’s all you are? Charlie Rose provided one of the only sophisticated dialogue programmes, and I don’t know what the percentages are, but I know that there are some lies that have been told publicly about people I know of some serious omissions. I’m talking about women towards men.” This is a personal issue for Penn, who in 2016 won a court-appointed apology from the director Lee Daniels, who erroneously implied the actor was guilty of domestic violence.Romantic relationships don’t seem to be Penn’s strong point. The worst bits of Bob Honey are those involving the character’s ex-wife, a harridan called Helen, about whom he is so vicious, I had wondered whether Penn’s own ex-wife might have commented on it. Penn gives me a dry look. “Which ex-wife?” he says.Oh. I had momentarily forgotten about Madonna, to whom Penn was married from 1985 to 1989. “The mother of your kids,” I say. (Penn and Robin Wright, who were married for 14 years, have Dylan and Hopper, both in their 20s.)“No these characters are amalgamations of a lot of things and she’s not a character in the book.” Penn pauses. “I don’t think the book would be either one of my ex-wives’ cup of tea. They both thought that I talked too much in ways that were too complicated.” He laughs. “I don’t have a lot of conversations with my most recent ex, but my first ex, we have a close friendship.”What does he think Madonna would say about the book? “I think if she was reading it, she’d say, ugh, I’ll read this some other time.”Anyway, Penn says, returning to the subject of #MeToo, “I don’t ever want to be in a movement. I don’t trust any movement. The anti-war movement did not sustain. We’re back in wars.”There is a libertarian streak in Penn that is impossible to miss. I repeat a wince-making line from Bob Honey, which Penn almost certainly considers to be a liberal statement: “Getting older in America is tough on a woman seeing what she’ll do to avoid it is tough on a man.” I assume Penn approved of Frances McDormand’s unadorned style at the Oscars this year?He takes a big breath: “When my kids were growing up, there was a thing called the surgery channel and I would watch this thing and get into hysterical laughter. One slice and you’re a human body! We’re the fucking same! But where I really became a giggling 12-year-old girl was volunteering for cosmetic surgery: you have someone who’s anaesthetised, and they’re doing the most vile things to them, and I would get so hysterical. You bring up Frances McDormand. What do you do to be more beautiful than that? That fucking woman walks into a room and you don’t know if you want to kiss her, eat her farts or bite her toes off, you just want to be around that energy.” As opposed, he says, to “the vanity that errs on the side of violence against oneself, physical violence. It’s crazy.”Does he understand why his countrymen voted for Trump?“I have a pretty good idea. We became celebritised,” he says. “I don’t buy People magazine. But when people complain that someone took a picture of them or that their privacy is being invaded, I’m like, yeah? Fuck you. I just spent my entire adult life with you telling me that because I want to express myself as an actor, that that comes with the territory. Well, it comes with the territory for you, now, and you bought those fucking People magazines. You made that happen.” He is jabbing his finger at me across the table. “When I go like this, I’m not at my best,” he says. “So two sides that are not at their best, it gets very shallow.” Penn has a disdain for the idea of the personal brand. “Branding is being! Branding is being! The algorithm of modern binary existentialism,” he writes in Bob Honey, a line I read out to him now.“Yeah,” says Penn, lowering his eyes and looking sage.What does “the algorithm of modern binary existentialism” mean? He snaps his eyes open. “Well. Binary – two components. When you’re taking an algorithm that’s going to identify the two components, and, there are, I think I talk about in the book also… it’s America today.” There follows a long story about how easy it is to buy components for a bomb in the US.“I’ve just gone off on the word binary. But I think it’s self-explanatory, in there. Huh.”Anyway, he says, the reason people voted for Trump is “because I think there’s a mental health problem in this country. It’s rage over reason. There’s a lot going on that was going on in Nazi Germany we’re finding scapegoats, groups to hate, whether it be of a race, or so-called lefty Hollywood, so that’s part of why I want to write something – I only have my sense of humour to offer. I didn’t want to just be angry all the time.”And he isn’t. There is an underlying humour to Penn’s rants that is often lost in translation and while I find much of what he says preposterous, arrogant and occasionally delusional, to my surprise, I also find him likable and funny – a genuine American eccentric.As we get up to leave, I can’t help laughing. “Sorry. I keep thinking about the fact that Madonna thought you were boring.”“I love her,” Penn says, and laughs. Is she a good egg? “Such a good egg.”We go outside to his pick-up truck and he introduces me to Flyboy, his six-month-old golden retriever. After Penn has gone, I call a friend with a degree in philosophy. “Does ‘the algorithm of modern binary existentialism’ mean anything?” I ask. After the laughter has died down, he says, “I think he means… in modern life everything is black and white. But existentialism refers to a specific tradition in philosophy he surely just means existence.” No matter Penn has a lot more to say. Before leaving he told me: he is hard at work on Bob Honey, the sequel. • Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff by Sean Penn is published by Simon \u0026amp Schuster at £14.99.

The manager, due to give birth to twins this month, said her side’s superiority meant it was the “most relaxed I’ve felt in a final in my entire career” and joked it was a “bonus” given her condition.A Ramona Bachmann double and a goal from Kirby gave Chelsea their first silverware of the season and exorcised the ghosts of two years ago. This was a rematch of the 2016 final, for which Hayes said the Blues “didn’t turn up”, when a curling Danielle Carter strike won Arsenal the trophy. This time Chelsea did show up and a goal from Vivianne Miedema to reduce the deficit to 2-1 after Bachmann’s double was not enough to turn the game for Arsenal.Joe Montemurro was full of praise for the forward line his team were up against. “We’re obviously disappointed but they’re a powerful team,” the Arsenal manager said. “There were a couple of structural things we need to work on but I don’t want to take away from them and what they are able to do to teams with the power they have up front.”The opening chances fell to the Gunners. Three minutes in Beth Mead was able to break free on the left but her teasing ball into the box was poked clear before it could reach a red shirt. Seconds later, Jordan Nobbs played an almost identical ball in, this time from the right, but Maren Mjelde got herself in front of a waiting Miedema.Both sides were nursing hangovers but neither seemed to be letting that get to them. Arsenal had suffered their first defeat in 14 games when they crumbled at Birmingham last Sunday – Ellen White’s hat-trick breaking a back line that had conceded only five goals since Montemurro took charge in October. Meanwhile Chelsea, still unbeaten in the league but having slipped behind Manchester City on goal difference, missed out on a first Champions League final after a 5-1 aggregate loss to Wolfsburg.The Blues’ first chances came through Kirby, the Professional Footballers’ Association and Football Writers’ Association player of the year. Twice in quick succession the England striker picked up the ball on the left and danced past three tight Arsenal players but her square passes were crowded out.Shortly after that Bachmann and Ji So-yun played a one-two on the edge of the box, the Swiss forward spinning beautifully but shooting wide of the far post. The chances did not stop for the Gunners, though, and the best of the half came as a delightful ball over the top put Mead in on goal with just Hedvig Lindahl to beat but a sprinting Mjelde chased her down before she could get a shot away.As the clock ticked towards half-time Chelsea began to ramp up the pressure and Ji and Bachmann continued to combine well on the right. Chelsea began the second period as they ended the first and it did not take long for them to break the deadlock. Bachmann and Ji linked up again, this time getting Kirby involved, who fed the ball back to Bachmann and the forward blasted high into Van Veenendaal’s net.Arsenal were undeterred by falling behind, Lindahl was forced to palm the ball away from Mead. Five minutes later the Gunners captain, Kim Little, who has won the cup three times with her club, played a pinpoint pass to Miedema, who perhaps should have shot first time but turned and gave the Blues time to rush back.The Gunners’ wastefulness in front of goal was then punished by Bachmann again. Her shot from the right looped in off the 21-year-old defender Leah Williamson to extend Chelsea’s lead.From then the game began to slow, Chelsea happy to sit back and Arsenal searching for a way to break through a defence that had not conceded in the competition. But the pressure eventually paid off, Mead’s cross into the box finding Miedema and this time the Euro 2017 winner did not wait, sweeping the ball past Lindahl to halve the deficit.But just three minutes later Kirby picked up the ball on the edge of the Arsenal area, stepped past Louise Quinn and fired home to deal a hammer-blow to the Gunners. It was her sixth FA Cup goal this season and it keeps Chelsea in the hunt for the double."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/634b7105cc55f09cdfade43729354030f0a89e9c/0_20_2245_1346/master/2245.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59d61d397945bb6dc64d143315af578e","title":"good time girl memories of a super groupie","story":"Pamela Des Barres had the giants of rock’n’roll in the palm of her hand, as her candid memoir revealsBarely 30 seconds in and Pamela Des Barres has not so much name-dropped as chucked her diary on the table. I compliment the author of I’m With the Band – one of the all-time classic rock’n’roll memoirs – on her ornate necklace, and she says it used to belong to Psycho actor Janet Leigh. When I ask if she still has the jewellery gifted to her by Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page, she replies, bereft: “No, it was stolen, by a kleptomaniac married to one of the Beach Boys.”Then, as we scan the menu in the rapidly busying Friday night dining room of an in-crowd Hollywood hotel, I idly enquire as to her dietary habits. “I haven’t eaten red meat for 45 years. I went with Don Johnson, one of my dudes,” she says of the then-future star of Miami Vice, “to the first vegetarian restaurant in LA. And I saw on the back of the menu how we get the red meat. And I was so appalled that I stopped that day.”I’m With the Band, the classic confessional of Des Barres’s sexual and romantic escapades with a cacophony of rock stars, is republished in a 30th anniversary edition this month. In bracing detail, the woman born Pamela Miller in Reseda, California, details her high jinks on the Sunset Strip of late-60s and early-70s Los Angeles.Led Zep, the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, Buffalo Springfield, the Byrds, Captain Beefheart, Frank Zappa, the Kinks, the Who… These were many of the greatest acts of the cultural revolution, and Pamela – who turned 20 in 1968 – knew them all. She alchemised adolescent Beatles fandom into a new type of ardour: that of the groupie.“A groupie is someone who loves the music so much she wants to be around the people who make it,” she explains. “A fan is content with an autograph or a look from the stage, or a selfie. A groupie takes the next step. And that takes a lot of courage. But they do so totally willingly, sometimes hoping for a romance, or a one-night stand – or sometimes hoping to marry them,” Des Barres hoots.If groupie behaviour was judged then – the loose morals of silly girls, exploited by lascivious rock stars – it can appear even less savoury today. But before we get into that – and the still-no-holds-barred Des Barres, now 69, will happily get into that – let’s view a highlights reel.As depicted in the book, the gateway crush for the teenager who Robert Plant and Mick Jagger would come to call “Miss Pamela” was the singer with San Diego band Iron Butterfly. But her relationship with Who drummer Keith Moon was considerably more important, even though she was simultaneously seeing renegade country singer Waylon Jennings. “I was Keith’s LA girl, and there was no doubt about it. I knew that whenever he came to town he’d call no one but me,” Des Barres recalls, wistful even now for the tragic Moon the Loon, who died in 1978 aged 32.“I was the muse,” she adds, “and I don’t care what people say about that. Groupies enhanced these people’s lives in a huge way. And if it weren’t for us, they would not be who they are.” Page was more meaningful still. “I was in love with Jimmy and I was gonna be true to him. At this point I had only slept with four people people think I was this wild insane maniac!” But then along came Jagger, whom she’d lusted after since her school days. “Mick was number five. He convinced me that Jimmy wasn’t being true to me on the road. So I decided, ‘OK, I’ve wanted this guy forever, I might as well do it.’ And we had this long-term fling that was really awesome.”Her love of English rock stars eventually propelled Des Barres to Chelsea, in the heart of Swinging London. When two American tourists mistook her for Jagger’s girlfriend she thought she’d attained some kind of nirvana. “Fucking Mick on his pillows in the middle of his living room, listening to Dylan,” Des Barres sighs now, wistful once more. “There was nothing better on earth.”What was Jagger’s reaction when I’m With The Band was originally published? “He was asked once in Rolling Stone what he thought of the book. He said: ‘I was there.’ It made me feel good. He had no problem with it, in other words. No one has.” So no one tried to sue her? “Absolutely not. Because I was telling the truth, in a sweet way. I was telling my truth.”Of course, there’s truth then, and there’s perception now. We discuss her friend and fellow groupie Lori Maddox. She’s been dragged into social media “debates” in the #MeToo era from those who decry her losing her virginity to David Bowie at the age of 15. “I’m very proud of Lori for the way she’s handled this whole thing. She’s very proud of her history. She has no regrets at all. A lot of people have come after her and she just doesn’t rise to it.”Do they come after her because, as she was 15 she was, by definition, abused? “She was not abused,” is Des Barres’s firm conviction. “Because that’s what she wanted. Yeah, she was young. And nowadays 15 is not what it used to be. And prior to that era, 15 was not what it became. It was just a period in time when things like that happened and it was OK! It was a short period in time. But it was our reality, and everyone was OK with it.”In 1977, Pamela married English rock star Michael Des Barres. He was a raging cocaine addict so she vowed, on the spot, to give up drugs. They had a son together, but orced in 1991. She’s had a few relationships since then, but is currently single. Today she finds strength in her faith, something that has deepened over the years. As to how she squares her sexual escapades with Christian morality, she acknowledges that, “I fought with it. Until I finally realised that the orgasm – la petite mort – is godly. The orgasm is when you actually forget everything else but that. So you are actually one with all that is. And when the orgasms continued, I came to realise that sex is so good, so important, so connecting with the ine.”Putting her CV where her soul is, she’s also an ordained minister. Pamela Des Barres can officiate your wedding and throw in, too, eye-popping anecdotes about Jim Morrison getting her off gorilla anaesthetic Trimar, and why she only went to third base with the Kinks’ Ray Davies.These days, Des Barres still lives for the music. She throws gigs in her backyard, and hosts rock’n’roll tours of “her” LA for tourists. “I’ve become this historical person,” she smiles, “which is so weird.”But don’t go mistaking that for sadness, an elegy for an era whose time’s up, for a youth wasted. Pamela Des Barres was her own woman then and she’s her own woman now.“I miss a lot of people who didn’t make it,” she says quietly, “but there are plenty people who did. So, no, I have no sadness about it at all.” I’m With The Band: Confessions of a Groupie by Pamela Des Barres is published by Omnibus Press at £14.99.

From then until 2011, I hadn’t set foot in the other side of the park. There are an awful lot of stories like\u0026nbspthat.”The three-metre fence, one of scores of so-called “peace walls” that still ide loyalist and nationalist communities in Northern Ireland, was erected in 1994. Yet thanks to work by cross-community workers such as Shannon, and after a lengthy consultation exercise, the gate was added in 2011.“We were having people coming from all over the world to look at our gate,” he says. “It was the symbolism. People started moving freely through it. Gradually we opened it later and later. Now we’re in the position where it’s open all day, every day.”Twenty years on from the Good Friday Agreement, similar cross-community projects are under way with the aim of taking down peace walls across the city. The fact that so many remain in place is evidence of the often glacial pace of progress. As the painstaking work continues, however, it is not lost on those labouring to bring down physical and sectarian barriers that the vote for Brexit has led to the threat of new ones being erected.The British and Irish governments and the European Union have all said that they do not want the return of any border infrastructure on the island of Ireland. Yet London’s determination to leave both the EU’s customs union and the single market has created a policy problem that is proving perhaps the most challenging aspect of the Brexit fallout.When Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, visited border communities and businesses last week, he was told in no uncertain terms about the strength of feeling involved in even the most innocuous border equipment.“I’m 60 years old, I’ve lived right along the border all my life,” says Declan Fearon, a kitchen maker who is part of a border group that met Barnier. He used to be able to see a border watchtower from his house near Jonesborough. “I remember the days when some people who came to mass on a Sunday used to have to park at the barriers and walk to the chapel. The last watchtower to be taken away was the one right behind my home.“I’ve lived through all of that and I really fear the return of any of that for my grandkids and the psychological impact on a community here that lived with it for so many years. It’s reopening a wound. It is quite clear that no one wants a return to the border, but are the British government being genuine on proposing how to do that? No, they’re not. There was palpable anger felt here when Boris Johnson compared this issue to the London congestion charge. Come along and meet the people who are worried about this.”One official who has been working on cross-border trade since the Good Friday Agreement recalls that, at the start of the process, he had to attend all meetings with the text of the legislation piled on the table, because there were inevitable arguments about interpreting the level of cooperation it stipulated.Now the meetings have become reassuringly boring, focused on how to help economies both north and south. “When we started, we were looking at barriers,” the official explains. “Now we look at opportunities. With Brexit, there’s the potential that you could be going back to dealing with barriers, and I think everyone is agreed that that isn’t what we want.”In Belfast, as with so many issues, many fear that Brexit and the border issue is already adding another sectarian strut to community politics. In Tigers Bay, the loyalist community on one side of Alexandra Park, a new mural appeared during the referendum campaign that reads “Vote Leave EU” and is accompanied by a reference to a biblical verse: Revelation chapter 18 verse 4.The verse states: “And I heard another voice from the heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye not be partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.” Rab McCallum, a former republican prisoner who now works to remove peace walls through the North Belfast Interface Network, is among those with concerns. He is sitting in a coffee shop in the Houben Centre, north Belfast, another cross-community project. It has an entrance on either side of the building, in effect connecting the loyalist and nationalist parts of what he describes as “one of the most notorious interfaces in all of the Troubles”.“There have been more people killed here than all other areas, so it has been hugely impacted by the conflict,” he says. “We had the success of taking down the first peace wall in 30 years, just across the road, at a time when there were problems. Despite the lack of political progress, the people on the ground seemed to be in front of the political process.The everyday impact of the border dilemma is being missed in the Westminster debate, warns Deirdre Heenan, professor of social policy at Ulster University, who is also from a border community near Newry.“I was in London last week and there was discussion about the trade and the economy and the customs union and the single market, but absolutely no discussion of the psychological and social impact of a border – whatever it may look like,” she says.“Most people believe that the British government don’t understand the problem. It’s not only that they haven’t come up with a solution, it’s that they can’t come up with a solution to a problem they don’t understand.“Clearly in the referendum, the fact that we would be the only land border to the EU wasn’t thought about. We were an afterthought. Yes, we have a peace, but it is a fragile peace. It is a journey we are on and we haven’t reached the final destination.“Sometimes it sounds like overstatement, but borders have an emotional meaning and they are symbols of difference. That just seems to be dismissed, but it is hugely significant for people here.”Of the Irish officials and ministers the Observer consulted last week, all said that the British government had failed to provide any confidence that it had a solution to resolve its promise of a frictionless border. As a result, all pointed to the so-called “backstop” agreement signed by Theresa May last year, which dictates that, should the UK government fail to provide a solution, Northern Ireland would remain in a “common regulatory area” with the EU.“The UK government signed off on a backstop arrangement,” says Michael Creed, the Irish agriculture minister. “That’s the fail-safe. For reasons that transcend economics, there can be no resiling from that commitment. If the UK comes up with a better arrangement, obviously the Barnier taskforce and the Irish government are quite open to seeing the colour of that and how it would effectively operate. There can be no resiling from that backstop arrangement.”For all the concerns, however, supporters of Brexit warn that the issues around the border and the impact on the peace process are being inflated as a negotiating tactic\u0026nbspby both Ireland and the EU. Refusing to give any ground could ultimately force the UK to remain inside the bloc’s customs union and single market.“The border is perfectly solvable,” says Lee Reynolds, the DUP director of policy and former Vote Leave coordinator in Northern Ireland. “Things that were presented as insurmountable have already been surmounted. The EU is offering a no-tariff deal already. There are a lot of things that were part of Project Fear that have been dealt with and resolved. They were legitimate things to raise, but it doesn’t mean they were impossible.“The border has got wrapped up in much bigger negotiating politics. It isn’t true that there is no solution. It’s that some people would prefer there not to be one. The best thing that ever happened for Vote Leave was when Tony Blair and John Major came over to threaten the peace process. That’s when unionists drifting to Leave became like snow off a ditch.”He adds that, far from undoing cross-community work, Brexit could be an opportunity for more. “Brexit is not an event, it’s what we do with it,” he says. “We can rethink regional policy and try to do better things. There will be potential for more resource – we have money coming back to us. People are talking about keeping existing money, when they should be asking if there is any scope for more. A new round of peace funding has also been secured.”This sunny optimism cuts little ice with people such as Fearon. He believes that feeling on the issue is so strong, and the determination not to return to the bad old days so deep-rooted, that people might take matters into their own hands should any border infrastructure pop up.Leading Brexiters argue that new technology can be used to find ways of allowing frictionless trade across the Irish border - and the technology would not have to be placed on the border itself. However, details have been thin on the ground and many warn that no such solution currently exists.A special dealThe European Union would allow Northern Ireland to stay in the customs union and the single market, but that would mean checks between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain - an outcome fiercely opposed by unionists. It would also lead to demands for a similar deal for Scotland, putting Scottish Tory MPs at loggerheads with the leadership.A customs partnershipThe UK would collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf, easing the need for border checks. Problems remain, however. The idea is opposed by Brexiter cabinet ministers and dismissed by the EU. A partnership would also have to be accompanied by a degree of alignment with the EU’s single market to eliminate checks completely.Soft BrexitOpting to keep the entire UK fully inside the EU’s customs union and single market would provide a solution to the Irish border, but would also require Theresa May to rip up her red lines of leaving both. It would also mean Britain could not strike its own trade deals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5856f4e08293a52c6f59ed5bcab026615425099b/312_995_5624_3374/master/5624.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=472400abf7495f26ec498aa7cbb35b3a","title":"african express how bright textiles brought one london home to life","story":"Eva Sonaike’s Nigerian heritage inspires the vibrant colours and patterns at her family houseEva Sonaike’s journey to becoming a textile designer began when she realised she could no longer stand the bland character of the small flat she and her husband used to share. “I was on maternity leave and I felt the need to make it warm, welcoming and more ‘us’,” she says. Eva headed to London’s Petticoat Lane market and bought bolts of bright African wax fabrics to make into cushion covers, throws and curtains.“As a quick fix, it worked,” she says. “Of course, I now know that those materials aren’t right for upholstery – too flimsy, not colourfast and so on. But it made me see very clearly how vibrant fabrics can bring joy into a space.”Ten years later, Eva has moved on – both career-wise and to a new home. She’s designing full time, working from a studio in the garden of her 1930s house in north London, where she lives with her husband Kola Sonaike, a barrister, their son Lolu, aged 10, and daughter Lola, eight.“When we bought this house it was a typical semi and the downstairs rooms were fairly dark,” says Eva. The couple knocked through the ground floor rooms and extended it to create one large split-level space. “My wish list was simple: white walls, dark floors and lots of light,” says Eva. “I knew I was going to add colour and pattern. And I think that works best with a light, clean backdrop.”Inspiration for her fabric designs comes from the regular trips she has made to west Africa since she was a child. While Eva was born in Germany and lived there until moving to London in her 20s to work as a fashion editor, her heritage is Nigerian. “I grew up knowing that fabrics were held in high esteem in Yoruba culture,” she says. “Thickly woven aso oke cloth was once a form of currency and is still given as a special gift. Or the embroidery on clothing could hold meaning – it might ward off evil, bring wealth or attract a spouse. Fabrics were never just pieces of cloth . They always told some kind of story.”Eva still travels to Africa each year with her own family, trips that now provide the stories for her own designs. “When I’m there, I’m like a sponge,” she says. “I soak up visual stimuli, the scents and the atmosphere. I see patterns in everything, from architecture to nature.”The motifs she sketches are later scanned into Photoshop, where she refines them and adds colours. Eva points to her Ijoba cushion, featuring lush leaves arranged in a stylised 50s-feel pattern. “This one came about after a trip to Ghana for a wedding. Afterwards we took the children up into the mountains to visit an old botanical gardens,” she says. “Everyone said: ‘Don’t bother, it’s so run-down’ – but that just made me want to go even more. When we arrived, the place was shrouded in mist and it felt as if nature had been left to run wild. The gardens were teeming with life – plants unfurling and exploding into flower.”Another design, Ojo, was inspired by the tropical modernism-style walls and balconies of Lagos, reimagined by Eva into an elegant grid of golds and reds. “That post-colonial architecture is an everyday feature of Lagos life,” she says. “I wanted to bring out its beauty.” Other prints feature zebra stripes recast in neon shades, a softened version of batik and shapes inspired by Yoruba embroidery.In her home, Eva’s patterns are complemented by African artefacts that have been in her family since the 1960s and 1970s. “My father was an art historian, so he had a very good eye,” she says. Eva and Kola have added carved figures bought more recently in Lagos’s craft markets. “Look beyond rows of statues darkened with shoe polish and sanded to ‘age’ them and you’ll always find beautifully crafted objects,” she says.Other pieces in Eva’s home include German antiques, a table from north Africa (by way of a Fulham dealer) and high street buys from Habitat and Ikea. Eva also confesses to a bit of a HomeSense habit for vases and lamp bases. “My daughter used to do a gym class near a branch, which was fatal. Luckily, she’s just switched to a ballet class further away.”Back in the dining room, a painting by Damola Adepoju from Nike Art Gallery in Lagos reminds the couple of trips to the city, with its streets rammed with yellow buses. And in the living room, above the cushions depicting her own African-inspired designs, Eva has hung a photograph of a Sudanese girl by Eliot Elisofon. It was taken in 1947 for Life magazine. “It dates from a very different era,” she says. “But as a celebration of African culture and beauty, it still feels very relevant today.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ada502ecfd457c94c387a8168718871a58ae0d65/45_0_4636_2782/master/4636.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0d1a4e5db6199acc8cc7da2e47ad9c3","title":"boardman hyb 88 womens hybrid preview verasatile bike","story":"Chris Boardman has just presented 28 new bikes in his 8 Series range. This hybrid is versatile, light and rewardingChris Boardman – Olympic gold medallist and former holder of the world hour record on three occasions – is often jokingly referred to as ‘The Professor’ because of his forensic attention to detail. The single-minded focus he harnessed during his riding days is now applied to his eponymous bike brand. This month he’s introduced 28 new models and also opened the UK’s first custom-built wind tunnel, designed specifically for cyclists. It’s based in Evesham and riders of all levels can use the facility to achieve optimum aerodynamics, physiology and biomechanics. He’s a man with a plan.With all this to think about, it’s hard to choose just one of the new 8-Series bikes to review… In the end I opted for the 8.8 Hybrid. Like all the range it has clean lines and a modern design. It’s also terrific value – something Boardman has always prided himself on.The bike has hydraulic disc brakes and carbon forks for a safe and comfortable ride, and features just one chain ring at the front. It gives quicker, smoother and more reliable gear shifting. It also means you have a huge range 11-42 tooth cassette at the rear. This means less weight, less to go wrong or maintain, the same overall spread of gears as with a 2 chainring set up and happily less chance of choosing the wrong gear. This technology has been used in mountain biking for a few years now, and the simplicity and lower maintenance suit a hybrid bike perfectly, too. A full carbon fork and Shimano hydraulic disc brakes ensure that control and comfort are even better, and with mounts for mudguards and a pannier rack – what more reason do you need to explore new possibilities?Bike shoes don’t have to look like plastic toys. These DZRs are street smart and ready to ride. Named in honour of the grand, gritty alley of Minna St where DZR’s showroom is based, and featuring graphics designed by their favoured local artist and DJ, Jeremiah Bal, the DZR Minna Shoes represent a fresh homage to an original.Made with a rich mix of leather and canvas, the Minna comes with DZR’s latest sole, and of course, their performance mapped flex, giving you great power transfer on the bike and a comfortable walking footbed.

Stuart Heritage lets go of the GPS to learn the art of natural navigation from pioneer Tristan GooleyHowever, this time is different. Gooley, often known as the Natural Navigator, has got me lost on purpose. He’s covered my eyes and led me by the arm through the backstreets of central London, taking time to spin me around every now and again for maximum disorientation. And now, right in the middle of nowhere, he’s asked me to take him to one specific Oxford Street branch of Wasabi.“Remember what I said,” he tells me. I look up. The sun is directly in front of me, throwing all manner of shadows in my direction. It’s lunchtime, so that means I must be facing south. The clouds, too, are lazily drifting from west to east, just as they were last time my eyes were open. I tentatively make my way towards the sun and, miraculously, I find myself on Oxford Street. Then I follow the clouds eastwards and, bingo, I’ve got to where I need to be.Weirder still, it wasn’t even that hard. This is the message of Gooley’s new book Wild Signs and Star Paths. It’s a beautifully written almanac of tricks and tips that we’ve lost along the way, with the intention of helping us regain what he calls the “sixth sense”: our innate ability to scan the landscape and anticipate what might happen next.Gooley’s motto is “Nothing is random.” He’s parsed the world in minuscule detail and located the pattern holding it all together. He’s part Spider-Man and part Neo from The Matrix, albeit much more affable and with a niftier taste in hats. He argues that he’s just managed to hone abilities we all latently possess. “My tuppence-worth is, I think, humanity consistently makes progress and then throws the baby out with the bathwater,” he says. “We had thousands of years of wanting to get from A to B in the most expedient way possible. But now we can get between places incredibly efficiently, and people have realised that they go from A to B to C to D to E to F to G to retirement to death, without actually noticing what they’re doing at those points at all.”If nothing else, his ideology is an antidote to that. It’s reminiscent of mindfulness in that sense by slowing down and concentrating on every tiny sensation that the present offers you – the feeling of wind on your face, little noises you’d otherwise tune out – you can start to uncover new layers of understanding. However, there is a caveat. “I never made the argument that this way of thinking of the world is expedient,” he says. “There are very few situations where natural navigation is the fastest option.”Walking around London with Tristan Gooley is a copper-bottomed reinforcement of this notion. Every few paces he’ll halt to enthuse about some aspect of the landscape that has somehow passed the modern masses by. In Seven Dials he stops me to point at a tree, marvelling at what he calls “the tick” – the shape caused by its subtle lean southwards. In Soho Square he takes me through a blow-by-blow deconstruction of a holly tree, showing how the lower leaves are spikier than those higher up, and that its north-facing leaves are slightly but significantly larger than those to the south. He simultaneously explains the enormous difference in meaning between one and two pigeons taking off from a lawn at the same time. It’s mind-blowing stuff – granule by granule he’s constructed an intricate jigsaw puzzle of information that perpetually lets him know where he is and what’s going on – but if you need to get somewhere sharpish, it probably isn’t for you.“Navigation was the only thing that held my interest for more than a couple of years,” Gooley explains over tea in a Covent Garden café midway through our jaunt. As he gained more experience, it led him to bigger goals. He’s led expeditions around the world, travelling to far-flung corners to study the methods of the Tuareg, Bedouin and Dayak. He is also the only living person to have both flown solo and sailed single-handed across the Atlantic, a feat that helped remind him of his mortality. “You know you’re at the edge of sensible endeavours when more than half the people you’ve talked to have died,” he says. “I went to seven people for advice on the aviation part and, by the time I took off, three of them were dead in light aircraft crashes.” He pauses. “I think a fourth died subsequently.”But it wasn’t until that escapade was over that Gooley felt the bite of natural navigation. “It was really weird,” he says. “I’d have this major experience of climbing into a boat and sailing through gales and all sorts of challenges, and then a week later I’d be trying to cross a tiny patch of English woodland – maybe only one mile or so – and going: ‘Actually, this is more like how I felt when I was 10.’”Wild Signs and Star Paths is rammed with Gooley’s knowledge. There’s “the tick”, but there’s also “the celebration” (the burst of wildflowers on a forest floor that tells you where light falls) and “the shear” (the tilt of a cloud that indicates wind direction) and “the invisible handrail” (the use of a prominent landscape feature to help you retain your bearings). In one chapter Gooley suggests he can pinpoint the location of a bonfire, even years after it went out, based on foliage alone.The book makes much of the differentiation between what he calls fast and slow thinking – basically between instinct and analysis. The more you painstakingly study the sky for navigational pointers, he says, the more the brain will learn to automate the process. It’s the same difference between sounding out a series of letters on a page and seeing a fully formed word.Eventually Tristan and I reach Regent’s Park, and it’s suddenly as if he’s been plugged into the mainframe. In the middle of an entirely unrelated conversation he stops dead in his tracks and slaps me on the arm.“Did you hear that?” he whispers. I do not hear anything, but say yes anyway. “That’s the cacophony!” he hisses, pointing to a bush full of birds making what I’d assumed were normal bird noises. “Those were alarm calls, between wrens and tits! There’s something in there the birds aren’t happy with.” Gingerly, we make our way over to investigate, but Tristan stops dead again, even more excited than before. He’s seen a squirrel standing on its hind legs. “Look at it go!” he whispers. “We’ve got a cacophony, the birds aren’t happy and the squirrels have picked up. It’s unlikely they would have gone on hyper-alert because of us.”This has now become a mystery that demands resolution, and fortunately one presents itself. A breeze blows through a row of trees, and Gooley has his answer. “Trees picking up, lot of different cloud types, some shear there,” he notes, running through his process aloud for me. “I think this must be a weather warning. There’s the sixth-sense feel. There was something going on that the birds weren’t happy with, and I could sense it without thinking.”Had we been in the jungle, this intuitiveness could have saved our lives. The birds might have spotted a jaguar, for instance, and their cries would have served as our cue to leave before we became dinner. But we weren’t in the jungle. We were in the middle of Regent’s Park, and the birds were just being vague about inclement weather.“Is this sixth-sense stuff even all that applicable here?” I asked myself. On the way home from the station, I’m caught in an unexpected downpour. Fine, the birds had a point and natural navigation has plenty of real-world uses. Long story short, I now trust Tristan Gooley with my life.Look for satellite dishes. They all point towards the equator. In London, that is roughly south-southeast.Find an ‘invisible handrail’ and use it to remember your bearings. In the countryside, this might be a river. In a city, it could be a main road. Look at a tree. Do the branches point a certain way? That’s probably south. Are the leaves on those branches smaller than the leaves on the opposite side? That’s definitely south.Use the sun. It rises in the east, sets in the west and moves through the southern sky, giving you a very basic compass.Need to get home? Head against the flow of people at the start of the day or with the flow at the end and you are pretty much guaranteed to find a station.Wild Signs and Star Paths: The Keys to Our Lost Sixth Sense by Tristan Gooley is published on 17 May by Sceptre at £20 "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfa7bf134a67379711161761ca416a60da37470f/0_207_6209_3725/master/6209.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbe2a8986850cc77d3ddf007acb10d16","title":"fatbergs are the true time capsules of all wed like to forget","story":"They are every sin we’ve ever committed, shoved into a small hole and covered with hot grease. We get the celebrities we deserve and we have truly earned the fatbergWhen we weren’t concentrating, Britain’s fatbergs became international celebrities. And that’s on us, that’s something we’re going to have to deal with – we created our own Kardashian clan, and a special house for them in the sewer under KFC Aldgate East. We Frankensteined this thing, this beast, out of sanitary towels and chip fat, and then some condoms, and then the guilt that came with the condom night, that oily shame, and then some small plastic pens, of the sort you get in betting shops. Every sin we’ve ever committed, shoved into a small hole and covered with hot grease. The fatberg is the portrait Britain hides in its attic, a true representation of everything we really are, all the things that come out of us. And while we went on working, flirting, dousing ourselves in duty free Chanel and glitter gel to look pretty for the builders, down there, in our private parts beneath the pavement, the bits we wanted to hide were growing.I lived in Whitechapel in east London for 10 years, above the notorious “Whitechapel monster”, a fatberg the weight of 11 double-decker buses. It makes sense that after years of blockages across the world, it was this one, under a site so associated with nightmarish murders and Victorian ruin, that pushed its way into our imaginations and on to the A-list. And while I am certain I never flushed moisturising toilet wipes down the loo, there is surely a part of me and my awfulness compressed in that pumice-like mass, a beast that inspires as many metaphors as it does reflexive gags. I am fatberg.While whole thinktanks had been set up to document the state of the UK, collecting the erse ephemera of our time to bury in time capsules beneath churchyards, nobody guessed that the UK was already hard at work on its own. A time capsule containing everything we wanted to forget – the time capsule behind the time capsule. No delightful drawings by four-year-olds, no bottles of wine or photographs of smiling teams shaking hands – instead, the night-time nappies of those four-year-olds, the sticky vomit induced by wine, the hand sanitising wipes used by the smiling team after they realised Pippa had the norovirus.Nappies! Some of us have been throwing nappies down the toilet! Which, Lord, would take some serious effort, no? These people must have really wanted to get those nappies down those toilets, must have got the toilet brush out of its little germ bath and really shoved it down there, flushing, flushing as they pushed. “Back to your family, sweet child, go home,” flush. But good. It’s good they flushed nappies down the loo. Because it’s exposed the real face of Britain – the mucky dum-dum plonker behind our mask of grown-up serenity has been revealed.What did we think toilets were? Private shredders? Ceramic mouths ready to chew up anything we wanted to forget? Plumbed-in pervert Cookie Monsters? Not so. It turns out toilets are artists that have been filing away all our disasters in order to create a portrait that reveals more about British people than any census, any referendum. One of those photographic mosaics that at first glance appears to be a picture of us, all of us, grinning and weary, but on closer inspection is a montage of hundreds and thousands of images of the things we’ve flushed away.In 2005, it was decided that adults couldn’t wipe their bums properly, so “moistened adult wipes” arrived (“flushable”, in that anything you can fit down a toilet is flushable) becoming a £12.4bn business. And while we could have guessed that these would be down there – the packaging practically begs us to toss them down the loo there are theses to be written about the word “disposable” – the most surprising thing we’ve learned about ourselves by dissecting the fatberg is the breadth of our vanity. Twenty years ago perhaps, the powder we’d have predicted to have found washing through our sewers might have been cocaine. But that moneyed hedonism has dissolved to make way for a more complicated kind of ambition, an aimless body building that leads some to illegal muscle-enhancing drugs, gallons of which now wash through Britain’s pipes. The disappointment of finding out not just that we’re disgusting, but that we’re arrogant, too.We get the celebrities we deserve and we have truly earned the fatberg, today’s antihero, profiled across the globe with glowing write-ups in the New Yorker along with its own Made in Chelsea-style reality show on Channel 4. Those of us still searching for meaning, still on a mission to find ourselves, could do worse than look down, then peel through the candle-like mass for the real me’s inside, the maggots, the chicken grease, the needles, the Lion Bar wrappers, the plate scrapings and oil, the rat king of wet wipes, the condoms, the paracetamol, the mangled plastic cups, yellow cotton buds and fat.

Brexit, the popularity of online delivery services, freakish weather and concerns about the pollution caused by plastic are all putting pressure on the nation’s 10,500 fish and chip shops.“I’ve had to hold price increases back so I’m taking quite a hit on things because rival shops are undercutting,” said Andrew Crook, president of the National Federation of Fish Friers. At the moment, a cod and chips at Crook’s chippy in Lancashire costs £5.90, but he intends to put his prices up in the summer.“I think summer’s a good time to put prices up. People go on holiday, buy fish and chips and see that some areas are more expensive than back home so that does help.”Six months ago a kilo of haddock or cod frozen at sea cost around £4 and £5.20 respectively. Today haddock costs about £5.60 a kilo and cod almost £5.80. There is little respite closer to home. Costs of cooking oil, rent and rates and labour are rising.Now there is a growing fear that potato prices could soon go the same way. The wet start to the year has delayed the potato planting season. According to Rob Clayton, strategy director for potatoes at the Agriculture \u0026amp Horticulture Development Board, farmers are between two and four weeks behind where they should be. This could bode ill for the future if the summer turns out to be a damp squib like the spring.“The holy grail for potato growers is to get the maximum possible leaf cover by the longest day of the year,” Clayton said. “If we were to get a couple of months of warm and sunny weather the problem would go away. If what we end up with is something that’s dull and cool over the next few months then that would retard the development. That is the scenario when you would start to worry about the volume of the crop.” The good news is that there are considerable supplies of potatoes in storage – but these cannot last for ever. “Once you get into August, September that is where those stocks will have run out and the new crop won’t necessarily be as speedy as we thought it was going to be,” Clayton said. “If you’re going to Blackpool in August that’s when you might be expecting a bit of a pinch around chip shop prices.”Another issue is packaging. Crook said there was pressure on the industry to do away with its polystyrene cartons, which cost around 2p each, and introduce compostable alternatives, made in China, that cost five times as much.“We don’t think it’s a solution,” Crook said. “It’s been dictated by Blue Planet and the government’s reaction to it. As an industry we try to do the right thing but people don’t know what the right thing is.”In the 1920s, there were about 35,000 fish and chip shops in Britain. But the number has fallen by two thirds as a huge variety of new cuisines has arrived on the high street. “We’ve been worried for the last 30 years because we’ve had McDonald’s come in and lots of ethnic cuisines and I think people have been scared to put up their prices,” Crook said.Now the popularity of online delivery services like Deliveroo and Just Eat poses another conundrum. “It’s naive to think deliveries aren’t the way to go,” Crook conceded. “But I don’t think the perfect packaging is there for it right now. With fish and chips you’ve got to keep it crisp. You can’t do five deliveries and come back to base. You’ve got to do each one inidually and the margins are not there for that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ebea6650a93cdd76c7cb9d7d9b6f3a06a3a12a5/495_511_4625_2775/master/4625.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d70ae44cdfa44e546b135441abd78bb","title":"is is weird to write to say sorry to my ex three years on","story":"Do it! Says Mariella. Keep it simple, keep it brief, write it from the heartThe dilemma Three years ago, I split up with my girlfriend of seven years. I felt very unhappy and put it down to the relationship. She was devastated and wanted to resolve things. But by that stage I’d made my mind up. I’ve lived a quiet, celibate life since, which has given me time to reflect. It struck me that I’d been very selfish – after an initial romantic period where I pulled all manner of stunts to impress her, my effort as a boyfriend tapered down to the bare minimum. Secondly, I realised they had been the best days of my life. We went on amazing adventures which we probably wouldn’t have done otherwise, and had very different skills sets, which complemented each other. After we split up, I made little effort to maintain our friendship, maybe because I felt guilty. Now I’m ashamed of how I treated her and can’t forgive myself. I want to write and apologise, but it sounds weird and inappropriate. It’s hard to write without it sounding like a rapprochement, which it isn’t. Is writing such a letter an appropriate thing to do?Mariella replies Hell, yes! We should all be writing letters to our lovers, ex or otherwise whether it’s just to say hello, to expand on our feelings, because our behaviour has been less than exemplary, or perhaps, as in your case, to say thanks for a union that may be long over but in hindsight appears so much more precious than you realised at the time. There are few things more soul enhancing than knowing that you’ve had a positive impact on another person’s life, that you were appreciated and that whatever may have led to your parting, a residue of love remains scattered over the debris of the relationship.I’d argue we should be writing more missives of the tangible and non-electronic variety. Otherwise when we’re old and grey how will we know that anyone cared for us at all, or remember the names of those who have long since slipped from our lives, emotionally, geographically or permanently? Searching your inbox just isn’t the same as dragging a box from the loft and having your life leap out to meet you. I recently found a folder full of a jumble of past correspondence, covering old love letters and fractious disputes, baffling postcards of some importance at the time and notes from luminaries whose attention I briefly captured for one reason or another – and it proved an emotional couple of hours sifting through those faded but still legible scraps.A message to my hotel room in Morocco in the 1990s read like a title for a novel: “Mr Miss You from Rabat” had called, hurling me back to memories of Robert, the gentleman caller, who’d obviously challenged the translating abilities of the Mamounia operator with his note. On another sliver of near-translucent paper was the marriage proposal I received three decades ago via a switchboard operator at the Parker Meridien in New York who’d hastily typed it up and slipped it under my door with a squashed red rose! There were sexy letters from a lover that made me blush, extolling my “eyes as green as Eastleach water meadows” and a letter from my mother with her overview on the chronology of my peripatetic childhood. There was huge pleasure in revisiting those moments, the words belying the heft of the emotions they bore while the paper carried sensory messages from a past age.Communication today is functional, and deleted within seconds of receipt. Like the photographs that linger in devices that become obsolete faster than we can learn to use them, it seems that the next generation will have to trawl Facebook to take their trips down memory lane. It certainly lacks the romance of a battered box, but since Facebook seems to know more about us than we do ourselves it may nonetheless prove a riveting archive. What a sad loss though to be unable to sniff the leaf, puzzle over the smudges or feel your heart leap at the loop of familiar handwriting decades after it was last viewed. As a regular performer for the brilliantly conceived Letters Live project, I’ve had the pleasure of exposure to some of the finest letters ever written and whether they’re slapping you down, or building you up, they’re a much undervalued art form.So, your heart is in the right place and your compulsion a good one. I’m wondering if your reluctance to write and let her know it wasn’t her fault is because what you are secretly after is a rapprochement. If that’s the case I’m not in a position to judge whether it’s right or wrong, but it does slightly temper my enthusiasm. The greatest gift in the world is a letter that wants nothing but offers a loving thought, or apology, or simply a hello.Keep it simple is my advice don’t try to channel Shelley. If all you want is tell her you regret your behaviour and think of that period with fondness, do just that. Keep it brief, don’t overload the memories, write it from the heart and don’t go into detail about your current state of mind. This letter, if your description is an accurate one, is not about you. So don’t dally another moment, put pen to paper and get your sense of gratitude off your chest and into her heart.

You’ve had Windrush, you’ve had Grenfell, you’ve had the Brexit negotiations going from bad to worse, you’ve had the National Health Service under more pressure than it’s been for a long, long time, serial incompetence day after day after day, yet the public do not seem in nearly sufficient numbers remotely interested in supporting the Labour party.”Campbell, who backs a referendum on the terms of the Brexit deal, said Labour should not be seen as supporting Theresa May’s plans for leaving the EU.Referencing a Blair-era soundbite, Campbell said Labour should be “tough on Brexit, tough on the causes of Brexit”, fighting against the UK’s departure from the EU while addressing the concerns of those who voted to leave.He said that if Labour’s Brexit tests were to mean anything the party could not support May’s strategy. “If they do, then though the Tories will be seen as Brexit’s architect, Labour will be its bricklayer, and history is harsh when the house comes tumbling down,” he said.“My Labour tribalism is being pushed to the limit by the return of militant-style nastiness in local politics, by my revulsion that any antisemitism has been allowed to fester, by the feeling that some in the leadership and their supporters feel much greater animus against other Labour supporters than against Tories.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f28de778168e3273ae15696d6faeb9e20498fac/0_218_4310_2586/master/4310.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8bb7e6d6e80c76420ab81bd716e3bb0","title":"thousands scottish independence supporters march through glasgow","story":"March was organised by All Under One Banner coalition, which aims to run regular events until ‘Scotland is free’Tens of thousands of independence supporters marched through the streets of Glasgow, aiming to bring Scotland’s largest city to a standstill.Marchers draped in Saltires waved flags and played bagpipes and drums as they walked from Kelvingrove to Glasgow Green on Saturday. The event is one of a series being held across Scotland by All Under One Banner. The pro-independence organisation aims to march at regular intervals “until Scotland is free”.“Glasgow city centre will be brought to a standstill as our independence march traverses through en route to George Square,” one member of the organisation said on a fundraising page before the event.The march achieved a high turnout. Police Scotland estimated that 35,000 people joined the procession, which ended with speeches and music on the green.A small number of pro-union campaigners met the procession to counter its message. Stuart McMillan, a MSP for the Scottish National party, wrote on Twitter that he had received abuse including “a azi salute and the middle finger” from pro-union campaigners. Amanda McGinley took part in the march with her daughter Ellie Casson, with both women sporting Saltire bows in their hair. “We’re just basically fighting for the cause. We’re serial marchers,” she said.Lesley Crawford said she had come to show support. “There is still a lot of people who are still campaigning for a vote for independence, and we’re not going away,” she said.He said that level of support for Scotland leaving the UK was “a good place to start from” and that backing for independence was edging up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1067a6d6281e4e3acdf12107212f8f9da21affcf/0_112_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08484566774f54d1a13a832f9b05fbd8","title":"absolute determination may vows to deliver brexit without customs union","story":"PM promises new relationship with EU outside single market but continues to grapple with pro-leave MPs who oppose hybrid ‘customs partnership’Theresa May has insisted she has the “determination to deliver Brexit” as she comes under pressure from both wings of the Tory party to change course.Eurosceptics have urged the prime minister to drop the proposal for a hybrid “customs partnership” which they fear would tie the UK too closely to Brussels. But pro-EU Tories are pushing for May to keep the UK in the single market, claiming she would have cross-party support for such a move.Writing in the Sun On Sunday, May said she had an “absolute determination to make a success of Brexit, by leaving the single market and customs union and building a new relationship with EU partners that takes back control of our borders, our laws and our money”.She said the UK was “making good progress towards that goal and we will carry on doing so with resolution in the months ahead”.A decision on the government’s preferred customs option has been postponed after May’s Brexit “war cabinet” failed to reach agreement.The Sunday  quoted a cabinet source saying it would be “unimaginable for the prime minister to press on with the hybrid model after it has been torn apart by members of her own Brexit committee”.But pro-EU Tories, seeking to capitalise on lack of agreement in the cabinet and a Lords victory on the customs union, are pushing for May to abandon her Brexit strategy and instead commit to a Norway-style approach within the European Economic Area and European Free Trade Association. Such a move would be unacceptable to many Brexit supporters because it would leave the UK expected to accept free movement, although advocates claim May would have some ability to impose conditions. The former Conservative minister Stephen Hammond told the Independent: “If you look at the EEA terms of reference, it is clear there is more leeway to impose restrictions on freedom of movement.”Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, meanwhile, risked unrest within his party over its position on Brexit before a Lords vote.A Lords amendment which would require the government to negotiate continued membership of the EEA could be put to a vote on Tuesday, but Labour peers have reportedly been told to abstain. Labour’s Lord Alli, one of the amendment’s sponsors, accused the party leadership of being “paralysed by indecision”. “This is complete cowardice. There is no point in being in politics to abstain. If you stand in the middle of the road someone is going to knock you over,” he told the Observer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f696f7b1d46a45b26fc0a4473c94bc2c385a1a75/0_565_4037_2423/master/4037.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21824d57c2bad6fda679a61aad8a4d7f","title":"nasa launches insight spacecraft mars","story":"A robotic geologist armed with a hammer and quake monitor rocketed toward Mars on Saturday, aiming to land on the red planet and explore its mysterious insides.In a twist, Nasa launched the Mars InSight lander from California rather than Florida’s Cape Canaveral. It was the first interplanetary mission ever to depart from the west coast, drawing pre-dawn crowds to Vandenberg Air Force Base and rocket watchers down the California coast into Baja. The spacecraft will take more than six months to get to Mars and start its unprecedented geologic excavations, traveling 300 million miles to get there. InSight will dig deeper into Mars than ever before – nearly 16ft – to take the planet’s temperature. It will also attempt to make the first measurements of marsquakes, using a high-tech seismometer placed directly on the Martian surface. The Atlas V rocket also carried a pair of mini satellites, or CubeSats, meant to trail InSight all the way to Mars in a first-of-its-kind technology demonstration. The $1bn mission involves scientists from the US, France, Germany and elsewhere in Europe. “I can’t describe to you in words how very excited I am … to go off to Mars,” said project manager Tom Hoffman from Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. “It’s going to be awesome.”If all goes well, the three-legged InSight will descend by parachute and engine firings onto a flat equatorial region of Mars – believed to be free of big, potentially dangerous rocks – on 26 November. Once down, it will stay put, using a mechanical arm to place the science instruments on the surface. “This mission will probe the interior of another terrestrial planet, giving us an idea of the size of the core, the mantle, the crust and our ability then to compare that with the Earth,” said Nasa chief scientist Jim Green. “This is of fundamental importance to understand the origin of our solar system and how it became the way it is today.” InSight’s chief scientist, Bruce Banerdt of JPL, said Mars was ideal for learning how the rocky planets of our solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago. Unlike our active Earth, Mars has not been transformed by plate tectonics and other processes, he noted. Over the course of two Earth years – or one Martian year – scientists expect InSight’s three main experiments to provide a true 3-D image of Mars. The lander is equipped with a seismometer for measuring marsquakes, a self-hammering probe for burrowing beneath the surface, and a radio system for tracking the spacecraft’s position and planet’s wobbly rotation, thereby revealing the size and composition of Mars’ core. “InSight, for seismologists, will really be a piece of history, a new page of history,” said the Paris Institute of Earth Physics’ Philippe Lognonne, lead scientist of the InSight seismometer. Problems with the French-supplied seismometer kept InSight from launching two years ago. California was always part of the plan. Nasa normally launches from Cape Canaveral, but decided to switch to California for InSight to take advantage of a shorter flight backlog. This was the first US interplanetary mission to launch from somewhere other than Cape Canaveral."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b164d589b44928c85df060a102e4185cb9f3f1e8/0_17_3641_2186/master/3641.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=136286abaf2cac95a1996b8ad4984444","title":"sale leicester premiership match report","story":"This was a bizarre frolic to end the season for two sides with Europe on their minds. Despite the unbroken sunshine the floodlights were switched on 20 minutes into the game and the warm, dry conditions nurtured a rash of handling errors rather than continuity. Leicester had spent the previous two weeks in a daze and struggled here with blurred vision initially before George Ford gave them clarity.Sale needed to win with a bonus point to snare a Champions Cup place and they could have all but secured it by the interval. They made seven line breaks in the opening half but, if the final pass went to hand, it tended to be knocked on. The last one, when Jono Ross surged to the Leicester 22 and found AJ MacGinty, ended when what would have been a scoring pass to his half-back partner Faf de Klerk was intercepted by Jonah Holmes.Leicester had taken an early lead through Holmes after Manu Tuilagi’s thrust prompted a blindside move. Ford, standing flat, was twice involved but it was a rare example of the Tigers swiftly securing the ball at the breakdown where Tom Curry was quick to get back on his feet. The visitors’ advantage was up front, Sale’s scrum, like the ball when they attacked, tending to end on the floor.Sale, prompted by de Klerk, were quick witted, scenting space around the fringes and instantly switching on after a turnover. The Sharks had not enjoyed a week that public relations consultants dream of, forced to deny any interest in signing the shamed former Ulster players Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding after spluttering from commercial partners.Not that fly-half is a position of particular concern with MacGinty scheming cleverly initially before Leicester – after a half-time rejoinder that instead of indulging Sale in a bun fight they should treat them to some raw beef and let Ford do the slicing – muscled up. The Tigers were too loose and haphazard in the opening half, unable to sustain pressure, but the change of approach brought an instant reward.Ben Youngs attacked round the fringes and linked with Ford – both his first-half penalties struck a post – who had a free run to the line. Leicester stayed direct and forced Sale to infringe. Two MacGinty penalties had restricted Leicester’s interval lead to a point but a pair of kicks from Ford in 10 minutes after his try put the Tigers 20-6 ahead and comfortably in control.The Leicester sides of old would have carried on in the same manner, not only until the game had been won but right to the end. Here they invited Sale back in when Telusa Veainu weaved his way out of his 22 and left three defenders trailing. He got to halfway after outpacing de Klerk but a risky pass to Sione Kalamafoni went to ground and Ben Curry picked up to commit what passed for a defence and free Marland Yarde.A near-capacity crowd celebrated the resurrection of hope. Sale had won their last two home matches against Leicester who in the previous two rounds had flopped at home to Northampton before blowing a 10-point lead late on to Newcastle, but Ford ensured that this time their grip was not broken. He continued to operate flat and in traffic and 15 minutes from time committed defenders to send May through a gap for the wing to find Mike Williams and restore the Tigers’ 14-point advantage.Sale were finally spent, Ford’s late drop goal and Holmes’s second try decorating the victory. Champions Cup qualification used to be the minimum requirement at the start of the season for Leicester but, as the salary cap has had a levelling effect, they have gone from being winners to beaten finalists to top-four finishers to top-six, a decline that has started to gather momentum. They cannot recruit A-list players in the numbers of old but Ford playing as he did here and a referee not tolerating collapsed scrums make a significant difference.The Premiership has reached the point where, with spending broadly similar, reputation counts for little. “The margins are tight,” said Leicester’s director of rugby, Matt O’Connor. “The standard has improved dramatically. I am not happy merely to be in the Champions Cup because at the start of the season our goal was to win the competition and it really hurts not being in the play-offs. We’ll be the better for this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28e8f6a58a86a60dace9dcfd3ef93b7b7c0bc21f/368_0_3103_1862/master/3103.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2f9968a51cae0c175abadc8cf16bed2","title":"tony bellew david haye","story":"There will be no more false dawns, no more bragging or bruises, no victory speeches either, for David Haye. Knocked down and out of boxing in five rounds by Tony Bellew, the former world champion at cruiser and heavyweight can leave now at 37 knowing, on balance, he has taken as much from the fight game as he has\u0026nbspgiven.“Take nothing away from David Haye,” the winner said in the ring. “He just got into a slug-fest tonight. The speed and timing go with age. I’ve done it, that’s all. Style makes fights, I’ve always said it.”As he had conceded in their first fight, Haye said: “He was the better boxer tonight, a great champion.” Bellew did not signal the definitive end to Haye’s career, but there is diminishing hunger to watch someone who was once one of the biggest and most exciting hitters in the ision.The whistles and boos that greeted his entrance for this rematch were replaced by predictable if subdued rumbles of sympathy and maybe appreciation of his bravery at the end. Down three times in all, he probably would have carried on had there been no referee – or paying customers. The fighters’ antipathy was genuine, although it melded into mutual respect afterwards.Bellew was a brutally magnificent finisher, biding his time, taking the odd hard head shot and pouncing like a cat when the openings came as Haye’s legs slowed.Haye admitted in his dressing room beforehand he needed to be “a lot better” than he was here 14 months ago, when his achilles snapped in round six and he did well to reach the 11th, his corner throwing in the towel as he struggled to right himself from a tangle on the ring apron.It is not quite right that a former world champion should be booed by sections of a 20,000 crowd just a few miles from where he was born but Haye feeds off any sort of energy, good or dark, and ignored the crowd in a lively opening.Bellew looked to land his chopping right over Haye’s jab but his opponent was similarly disposed as they shared the second.Haye’s jab, once his spear of choice, was cocked more than delivered in the third and Bellew seized the moment with a cracking right that sent him to the floor, followed by another that had him over again and up on wobbly legs. This time there was no injury to blame – just his own intemperance, as well as the weight of the years that had gone before.The fourth descended into a thrash but Bellew was in total control, stalking and firing bombs. Haye, hurt and disoriented but still there to have the argument, looked as if he could go at any moment, his head a dart-board now.Haye needed to make a statement even to get past halfway but the narrative was out of his hands. Bellew, so emotional outside the ring, had turned into a cold-eyed predator, wary of his wounded foe but ready to strike again. There was a lull in the fifth, then another teeth-rattling left hook to put Haye down in the centre of the ring. As proud as any British fighter of recent years, the Bermondsey man knew the end was near but he did not want it, surely, to be at the intervention of the referee while he was still standing with his back to the ropes.Then again, very few boxers get to choose the manner and time of their leaving. This had to be Haye’s.The Olympic silver-medallist Joe Joyce, who is in Haye’s stable and shares his new Cuban trainer, Ismael Salas, stepped up a few levels in just his fourth professional bout earlier to win the Commonwealth heavyweight title by stopping the seasoned but bewildered Jamaican champion, Lenroy Thomas in two rounds. Joyce, still learning his trade at 32, had the champion down three times and was landing at will. A left hook to the jaw finished the job. He will harder nights than this from now on.Rio bronze medal light-heavy Joshua Buatsi – one of the few pros with a university degree - racked up his sixth paid win, stopping the Frenchman Stephane Cuevas in the fifth of six.There was woe for the fancied Martin J Ward, who was beaten and stopped for the first time in his 22-bout career, when he found the heavy hands of the Belfast super-feather James Tennyson too much to cope with in the fifth round of their Commonwealth, European and WBA International title fight. He had Tennyson on the floor in the second but was drawn into a brawl and sank to the ropes twice at the end, dazed and hurt.Paul Butler, who lost a challenge for the world super-fly title three years ago, overshot the bantamweight limit by more than 3lbs on Friday, and had nothing to fight for but a pay cheque and pride. The latter was dented in the first round when the unbeaten Puerto Rican, Emmanuel Rodríguez, felled him with a wicked left. Butler, 29, regrouped and had his moments but not enough to dominate a round and the visitor was a convincing winner of the vacant IBF title, by two cards of 120-106 and one of 118-108."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/305548d1386925cabbd6b19db509d585827fff85/0_272_3897_2339/master/3897.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acd87e8deb3806455965573715ce3660","title":"justify kentucky derby mendelssohn","story":"Mendelssohn’s ambitious attempt to become the first European-trained winner of the Kentucky Derby floundered on a sloppy, rain-drenched track here on Saturday as Bob Baffert’s Justify laid another long-standing hoodoo with victory in the 144th running of the race.Leading up to this year’s contest, much was made – as it always is – of the fact that no horse since 1882 had won without racing as a juvenile. Justify, though, made light of the difficult conditions and his relative inexperience as he took up the running towards the end of the back stretch. He led from there to the line under Mike Smith to become the sixth consecutive favourite to win the race.Ryan Moore was slow to stride from stall 14 aboard Mendelssohn and appeared to take a bump as his jockey went inside to try to find a position that gave him a chance to travel and attack. He ended up buried in midfield, however, and while Moore did his best to work his way towards the leaders, he accepted three furlongs from home that it was not going to be his day. The track had started the day riding fast, as it was in Dubai when Mendelssohn took the UAE Derby by nearly 19 lengths, but a combination of the torrential rain and his slow start meant he never got a chance to show what he could do.Justify, though, was ideally positioned just behind a strong pace by his 52-year-old rider Smith, who is nicknamed “Big Money Mike” for his prowess in America’s major events. He cruised into the lead with more than a quarter of a mile to run and never looked likely to be reeled in from there. Good Magic, last year’s Breeders’ Cup Juvenile winner, was second with another well-fancied runner, Audible, in third.Baffert, who saddled American Pharoah to become the first triple crown winner for 37 years in 2015, now has a live contender for another on his hands. It was his fifth win in the race in all and Justify is also unbeaten after four starts, prompting some to reminisce after the race about Seattle Slew, the only triple crown winner to retire undefeated.“I just feel blasted lucky to have a horse like this,” Baffert said. “This horse came around, the first time we worked him I thought we had something really special. After his maiden win I thought the timer was wrong, I really didn’t think he ran that fast.“He’s a specimen of a horse, he’s just special. He has that presence about him. Everybody at Santa Anita says: ‘Who’s that?’ and it’s the only one that I know who it is.”Smith, the second-oldest jockey to win, said that the race had gone very much to plan. “My main concern was getting him out of the gate,” he said. “He’s so talented, it’s unbelievable. I knew if I could get him out of there, he could go fast because that’s how good he is. Once we jumped well, I basically stepped out of the way and kept a leg on each side and my mind out of the way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/368a19c2ae4d9d7eba4463f27e1c35aade035ac5/0_60_2673_1603/master/2673.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=952002c5b5259f7d9feaea774217b64b","title":"david haye v tony bellew heavyweight boxing live","story":"Tony Bellew scored a comprehensive victory in this rematch, knocking down David Haye three times before the fight was stopped in the fifth roundDavid Haye speaks: “Tony boxed a great fight, he did some really clever stuff in there. He boxed good, and I didn’t, it’s that simple.”“I thought I was fit enough to beat him, it turns out I wasn’t, but he’s a great champion. Is this the end? It didn’t feel great in there tonight, but I don’t know. I lost to the better man, so congratulations to Tony.”“I lost my brother-in-law in August – his dad’s here tonight, and I swear he was with me too. Ashley, I love you, mate. He’s been on my mind the whole time, I miss him so much. I’m broke, la. I’m just broke.”“David Haye is an amazing fighter, we just got into a slugfest. Age is a factor with his style. He goes down as a better fighter than me. But I won, against all the odds. I was willing to be finished off in this ring tonight, I’m struggling bad but I’ve done it, and that’s all that matters.”Well, well. Tony Bellew is in tears, with David Haye quick to offer his congratulations. It’s not particularly nice to see a once-great fighter go out in the manner Haye surely has, but full credit to Bellew, who was by far the quicker, smarter fighter and was ruthless in getting the job done.Round 5 of 12: After two minutes of cagey shadow boxing, Bellew picks his moment and puts Haye down a third time! It’s a heavy, awkward fall for Haye in the centre of the ring. The referee lets the fight go on, but not for long – Bellew stops Haye in the fifth!Round 4 of 12: It looks like Haye may have damaged his ankle again – he’s off balance, totally unable to repel Bellew’s quickfire combinations. This is a little sad to see from a former world champion, but he’s clinging on and hoping for one last Hayemaker. He digs deep and momentarily halts Bellew’s charge, but he still looks in big trouble.Unofficial scorecard: Haye 37-38 BellewRound 3 of 12: Haye has nicked the first two rounds, but Bellew looks fresher – can he get one on the board? He keeps Haye moving and working hard, and almost connects with a jab. Haye launches a late offensive, swings and misses, and Bellew’s one-two on the counter puts Haye down against the ropes! He gets up, but another combination sends him down again! He’s saved by the bell...Unofficial scorecard: Haye 27-28 BellewRound 2 of 12: Haye looks a little cumbersome in the middle of the ring, but lands a sloppy combination and a body shot. Haye then lands a decent right, with Bellew throwing his gloves up, asking if that’s all he’s got. Haye takes the round, but is leaning heavily on his front foot – he won’t want this to go the distance. unofficial scorecard: Haye 20-18 BellewRound 1 of 12: There’s a weird Brexit vibe to the two fighters’ trunks, with Haye sporting a Union Jack and Bellew in EU blue with yellow stars. Bellew finds some joy with his jabs but loses balance, while Haye struggles to find any rhythm in a patchy first round, but lands the bigger blows, including a big right at the bell. unofficial scorecard: Haye 10-9 BellewAfter both fighters are given a hearty booing by the crowd, they touch gloves and it’s officially on.We’re moments away. This will be Haye’s 32nd fight – he has a 28-3 record. It’s Bellew’s 33rd – he’s won 29, lost two and drawn one. Let’s get ready to rumble, then.Here comes Tony Bellew, cutting a moodier figure with the hood up on his robe as Haye waits in the ring wearing headphones. They’re certainly going big on the theatrics.David Haye is striding out to this slice of disco magnificence, grinning from ear to ear...Michael Buffer’s in the ring, ‘Sweet Caroline’ is blaring out – it can only mean one thing... ring walks are imminent.Predictions? AJ says Haye is the more talented fighter, but “you can’t deny Bellew’s heart”. Personally, I think Haye is battling his own body as much as his tenacious opponent – but if he can hold himself together, revenge should be his.While you’re here, why not sign up for The Recap, our weekly round-up of our best sporting coverage?Campbell gets the job done against an outmatched opponent, and says he is now lining up a rematch with Yvan Mendy, the only other man to defeat him. Eddie Hearn, never knowingly absent from ringside for these PPV occasions, confirms they’re set to fight a title eliminator, with the winner facing Mikey Garcia.In fine MBM tradition, you’re lining up to have a dig at tonight’s gladiators. “I don’t really mind who wins between Haye and Bellew, but every time I see a clip of Haye doing something he’s got the worst music on,” says David Jerome. “For that reason alone, I hope Bellew wins.”Nathan Fisher comes armed with heavy sarcasm: “I’m just wondering if you can shed any light on the rumours that Bellew has a wife and kids? He’s a pretty coy interviewee and I’d like to know a little more about that aspect of his life.”John ‘The Gorilla’ Ryder has stopped Jamie Cox in the second round, and is now targeting a super-middleweight world title shot. 2012 gold medallist Luke Campbell, who lost his WBA lightweight title bout to the exceptional Jorge Linares last year, is now in action against Troy James.There was a surprise earlier on at the O2 Arena, as Belfast’s James Tennyson inflicted a first ever defeat on Martin Joseph Ward in their super-featherweight bout. Olympic silver medallist Joe Joyce defeated Lenroy Thomas by second-round KO in his fourth professional fight, and Emmanuel Rodríguez became IBF world bantamweight champion after beating Paul Butler on points.Haye has tweeted – or possibly his PR, seeing as his hands have been wrapped. He’s trying his best to look relaxed:Anthony Joshua is ringside as a Sky pundit, and thinks Bellew has a chance of a repeat win tonight. On Bellew’s pre-fight aggro, he says “I do believe mind games are a big part of the build-up. They are listening – you’ve got to keep poking away.”Very few sequels live up to the original. For every Empire Strikes Back, there are several hundred Speed 2: Cruise Controls. Tonight’s sophomore meeting between David Haye and Tony Bellew has the potential to join that select club.After a long, drawn-out build-up packed with bluster and bile, Haye v Bellew I proved to be an absurd if absorbing experience. A promising contest fell apart when Haye snapped his Achilles in the sixth round. Barely able to throw a punch, Haye was at the mercy of his underpowered opponent, who laboured to a late knockout win. It was a case of the stoppable force against the unmoving object.Haye’s career seemed finished on that miserable night but he returns 14 months later cutting a very different figure. There is less swagger in his step this time, only a quiet confidence that a new coach has revived his pugilistic power. It’s been left to the abrasive, outspoken Bellew to supply the necessary pre-fight needle, with Haye swerving the verbal blows.Whether the former world heavyweight champion is waiting patiently until his fists can do the talking, or is still bruised from that first encounter, only time will tell.

The daughter of an Irish mother and Ghanian father, she spent the first couple of years of her life with her extended family in Ghana before growing up in south-east London and holidaying in Ireland to visit her maternal grandmother. Food – heaps of food from cooks who wouldn’t tolerate anyone leaving the dinner table hungry – features strongly in childhood memories of long summer days in Bantry Bay, County Cork. “Some of my earliest memories are very specifically about the smell of food cooking in Ireland – cabbage, black pudding frying. My aunt had a butcher’s shop so I was used to seeing a pig’s head on the counter and cows’ tongues hanging on hooks. We ate lots of offal, but we also used to go to the beach to hunt for crabs, to the river for salmon, and to the mountain to dig out peat for the fire – that smell always unlocks memories of my mum and her family. Peat, the smell of the sea, the morning dew – that landscape had its own special smell, a smell of freshness.”Food from a very different landscape was how, as a keen home cook, Adjonyoh later discovered and explored her Ghanian identity. The mysterious ingredients her father brought home to cook with were the same ones she would use to create dishes for her pop-up supper club in Brixton and her debut cookbook, Zoe’s Ghana Kitchen, published to great acclaim last year. These staples of Ghanian cookery were, she says, her sensory “access points” to finding out about her African heritage.“My father would be cooking with things I’d never heard of I didn’t know what they were,” she recalls. “Before I could taste them, I’d be aware of their unfamiliar smell and that’s a really strong memory of him in the kitchen – I’d want to eat something just from the aroma while it cooked.” After travelling to Ghana as an adult, and experimenting with traditional dishes back at home in her Hackney Wick kitchen, she started cooking updated versions of the recipes for friends. She sourced produce from Dalston’s Ridley Road market, getting to know the Ghanian women who sold from kiosks. “Shopping there, for me, was like being transported to another world,” she recalls. “They would help me identify ingredients and tell me how to cook them. The smells, flavours and colours were just amazing.”Some of the smells when she visited Ghana were a little too amazing. At a market with her aunt, Adjonyoh asked what a particularly pungent smell was. “What smell?” said her aunt, and carried on shopping. It turned out to be some cowhide drying in the sun, ready for eating later. Laughing, she recalls her aunt’s brief explanation: “‘Oh that’s wele,’ and I said: ‘What the hell is wele?’” The flavour wasn’t as strong as the smell, once she plucked up the courage to try it. “I was a bit wary of it, to be honest.”While her father’s cooking was hearty and traditional, it was a case of “there you are, get stuck in, don’t bother with cutlery”, she explains.Adjonyoh adapted recipes to make them visually appealing (gloopy okra was transformed into okra fries) because of the adage about people eating with their eyes. But it was the smell of her peanut butter stew – based on her father’s legendary groundnut soup – that drew people to come and buy food from an impromptu stall at her flat. “The dish has an amazing smell profile from the blend of spices,” she says. “People were asking what the smell was, how the dish was made. It was very much the smell that brought people to my door.”A career in food wasn’t the plan, but the clamour for her African cooking paid her way through an MA in creative writing: “It was just the demand. I loved the cooking and so did all the people who tried it.” The supper club, with just six tables and housed in a shipping container, was born, and for three years celebrated the variety, richness and abundance of Ghanian food. Now it’s time for a new adventure, with Adjonyoh travelling across Kenya and Uganda for a month to meet female chefs, cooks and food bloggers: “I want to understand each country’s relationship with food, the history of that, their distinctive produce and why it is that their food industry is largely dominated by women.” The journey will once again unite her passions for cooking, writing and travel. “I can’t wait to soak up the sights and sounds of two new food cultures,” she says. “When you’re travelling, all your senses are heightened. The first thing that always draws me in is food smells. No doubt I’ll be led by my nose again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c9b849339c540cff86666967b0e509405713f3b/0_67_3280_1968/master/3280.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82a79216d32ec4f760008be0eddd6eb0","title":"may i have a word about issues jonathan bouquet","story":"Euphemism and evasion are all around us what was wrong with good old-fashioned problems?Why do we seem to be a nation so happy to hide behind euphemism? What happened to those good old days of straight talking, with not a bush in sight to be beaten around? When we happily called a spade a spade? Where once we used the term “secondhand”, it now seems obligatory to say “previously owned” or, even worse, “pre-loved”. And what of the “hire purchase” of yore? No such thing any more – it’s now “rent to own”.Nowhere is this evasion more plain and irksome than with problems. Remember them – straightforward, often boring, sometimes painful, often inconvenient – but problems nonetheless. But not now. They are “issues”. When it rains cats and dogs, we now have “surface water issues” (thanks to Channel 5 for that – I’ll be sure to break out my wellies). Kanye West, whose ludicrous outburst about slavery was rightly derided, is said to have “brain chemistry issues” by Roots star LeVar Burton. In the world of sportswear, the “Nike brand hasn’t suffered despite coverage of culture issues”.Transport in all its forms is not immune: “More than 600 heavy vehicle certifications revoked amid towbar issues”, while pity poor old Elon Musk: “Model 3 production issues are burning through Tesla’s cash.” It could be that his boasts about the number of cars that he promised to produce were simply pie in the sky, back-of-a-fag-packet marketing speak, or maybe he hadn’t factored in “production line issues”, ie not enough workers to fulfil his boasts.

Stretching for more than 2,300km along the Queensland coast and covering 35m hectares, it features brilliantly coloured corals living beneath aquamarine waters, a profusion of tropical islands and a wealth of marine creatures and birdlife.Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are the traditional owners of the Great Barrier Reef region, and there are significant cultural sites on many of its islands. The strong ongoing links between the traditional owners and their sea country was recognised in the Great Barrier Reef’s world heritage listing and contributes to its outstanding universal value.The cultural and ecological knowledge of the traditional owners will be essential to delivering the Reef 2050 Plan, which is the blueprint for protecting and managing the reef and designed to be implemented in a collaborative partnership.

Rising majestically above the red-sand plains, they dominate the landscape and are shrouded in myth and mystery.For the local people, Uluru and Kata Tjuta are far more than just rock formations. They make up a living cultural landscape that is sacred to the Yankunytjatjara and Pitjantjatjara Anangu people. On 26 October 1985, Uluru and Kata Tjuta were handed back to the Anangu people, the traditional owners of the land, in what remains one of the most significant moments in Australia’s Aboriginal land rights movement.Uluru is a site of ceremonial significance for many Aboriginal groups of central Australia, including the Pitjantjatjara and Yankuntjatjara Anangu people, who have lived in the region for at least 10,000 years. There are more than 40 sacred Aboriginal sites in the area where ancestral spirits still reside, making the land deeply important to the cultural identity of the Anangu. The Pitjantjatjara and Yankuntjatjara people still abide by ancient laws and traditions, referred to as Tjukurpa, which provide the foundation to their unique culture. Before the arrival of Europeans, the Indigenous people moved around this land, which varied from mulga flats and sand dunes to rocky hills and pockets of vegetation around the base of rocks such as Uluru. Each of these environments was used at different times of the year, depending on the food and water available. Water was present in claypans, rock holes, soaks and springs. Around the base of Uluru are rock shelters and caves, decorated with hundreds of rock paintings – some executed as late as the 1940s. But the ravages of weather and over-visitation by tourists in the past have resulted in severe deterioration. The art sites at Kata Tjuta, where there are more engravings than paintings, are better preserved. Today, Aboriginal people of central Australia call themselves Anangu, and some of the most important cultural areas in the park are out of bounds to non-Indigenous people.Uluru itself is a scared site. The Anangu people ask all visitors to respect their cultural and spiritual beliefs and refrain from climbing the rock. From 26 October 2019, coinciding with the 34th year of the return of Uluru to its Traditional Owners, climbing the rock will be banned.Where: The park is 440km south-west of Alice Springs. The drive to Uluru–Kata Tjuta from Alice Springs takes roughly five hours via the Stuart and Lasseter highways. The highways are sealed roads, so a 4WD is not required. Jetstar, Virgin Airlines and Qantas fly to Uluru.Permits: A park-use fee is charged per person. This is valid for three days annual tickets are also available. All tickets are payable at the park entry station.Best time to visit: May to October, when the average daytime temperatures range from 23–31C, and night temperatures range from 7–13C.For more information, visit Parks Australia Uluru and Kata TjutaWorld heritage-listed Kakadu national park is a landscape of unsurpassed beauty, with world-renowned wetlands attracting extraordinary numbers of birds, thundering waterfalls that plunge from towering escarpments into natural rock pools and open woodlands that offer a refuge for a wide range of native animals.Kakadu is a landscape of living culture. Rock art of the region indicates Aboriginal people have occupied Kakadu for between 40,000 and 60,000 years, the longest record of continual human occupation of any area on Earth. The rock-art galleries show that early Indigenous groups had a strong culture based on deep spiritual beliefs. This spiritual connection to the land is recognised globally in the world heritage status of Kakadu. The name Kakadu comes from an Aboriginal language, Gagudju, spoken in the north of the park at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1978 the Gagudju people were granted title of their land, which they then leased for use as a national park. Kakadu is jointly managed by the BininjMungguy people and Parks Australia. Although Gagudju is no longer spoken by Aboriginal people in the area, surviving dialects include Kunwinjku (in the north), Gundjeihmi (in the centre) and Jawoyn (in the south). Aboriginal people of the region know themselves as Bininj (pronounced Bin-ning). Languages, kinship, ceremonies and caring for country have been passed on through the generations from the time of creation when important ancestral beings crossed the landscape and created the plants, animals, landforms and the people who live there today.A major creator acknowledged in the region is the Rainbow Serpent, which is known Australia-wide by various Aboriginal groups. As the Rainbow Serpent moved through the land she formed the features of the landscape in Kakadu, such as waterways, waterholes and hills. Her role in creating the cultural obligations of the BininjMungguy people is very important, as is her creation of the plant and animal life cycles and the seasonal changes.Don’t miss … Burrungkuy area: In this area is the picturesque Anbangbang billabong and the renowned Burrungkuy rock, a vast, ancient rock-art gallery and an inspirational place that projects a sense of how Indigenous people once lived.Where: It is 235km east of Darwin to the Bowali visitor centre, one entrance of the park. Drive from Darwin via Stuart Highway, then Arnhem Highway from Pine Creek via Stuart Highway then Kakadu Highway.Best time to visit: During the drier months from May to September the whole park is generally open. During the wet season, some of the park is inaccessible due to the water. While the weather can be very hot and humid during this season, it is an incredible opportunity to see waterfalls turn into gushing torrents and watch thunderstorms roll in over the park. Tips for visitors: Saltwater crocodiles populate the rivers and coastal areas of Kakadu. Visitors are warned to stay out of the water, unless there is clear advice to the contrary. The only places likely to be free of these dangerous reptiles are located up in the escarpment country.For more information visit Kakadu national park  The Laura dance festival is a celebration of Aboriginal culture held in western Yalanji country in north Queensland. It is also a vibrant and unique way for tourists to experience this ancient and ongoing culture through powerful performances of the songs and dances of many Indigenous nations from the Cape York region. This biennial festival, which runs over the weekend that marks the end of June and start of July, is one of Queensland’s largest cultural gatherings. It has attracted crowds of visitors from Australia and around the world for the last 25 years.Where: Held 15km south of Laura, at the Ang-Gnarra festival grounds, or meeting grounds, of Cape York.When: The next festival will be in June 2019. Bookings are essential.Cost: Approximately $100 per person additional charges for camping.For more information, visit the Laura dance festivalPurnululu national park lies deep in the rugged east Kimberley region, protecting one of the world’s natural wonders, the Bungle Bungle Range. The remarkable tiger-striped, beehive-shaped rock domes have become, somewhat belatedly, one of the iconic images of the Australian outback, and are appreciated worldwide for their exceptional beauty. The region also holds sacred Aboriginal Dreaming stories and a rich culture that has maintained connections to this land for at least 20,000 years. Today, the local Aboriginal people maintain a strong connection and association to the ancient landscape, which holds the stories of their Dreaming. In the Kija Aboriginal language, purnululu means “sandstone”.Aboriginal cultural heritage: The area is traditionally the land of the Kija people of the eastern Kimberley region, and their neighbours the Jaru, a group belonging to the desert region. The Kija people put up fierce resistance to the pastoralists. They killed the cattle (livestock numbers on the Ord river grasslands had reached 50,000 by 1902) and in retaliation there were brutal massacres of local Aboriginal people and punitive police raids. At the height of the violence, many of the Kija took refuge in the Bungle Bungles.They used notched tree trunks to scale the cliffs and pulled these makeshift ladders up afterwards to prevent pursuit. To try to stop the livestock killing, the government provided some refuges and food, but did not stop the land and cultural dispossession, which continued into the 1970s. Today, descendants of the park’s traditional owners live in population centres such as Halls Creek and Warmun. The people of Warmun have worked extensively on language and literacy programs for schools and have produced a large amount of teaching material. Some help manage the national park, with a number of Aboriginal people employed as rangers and guides.Where: 300km south of Kununurra. The road into the park from the main highway is the very rough Spring Creek track and is accessible by 4WD only. Kununurra to the ranger station takes 5 hours travelling time from Halls Creek allow 4 hours. When: The park is only open between April and the end of December (weather permitting).For more information, visit Purnululu national parkDreamtime at the G is held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) during the Indigenous round of the Australian Football League (AFL) season. Typically held in round 10, in the last week of May, the Indigenous round commemorates all the Indigenous players who have contributed to the hugely popular sport of football. It is a way for all Australians to respect and pay tribute to the Indigenous presence within football and sport.The round itself is named in honour of Sir Doug Nicholls, an inspiring person and former football player who represented the spirit of reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. While there are many games played in the Indigenous round, the match between Richmond and Essendon football clubs is the most highly anticipated. The day starts with the customary “Long Walk” where attendees of the match walk from Federation Square along Birrarung Marr to the MCG. The atmosphere is that of unity and excitement when Australians from all backgrounds take part in the Long Walk in commemoration of former Aboriginal Essendon football player, Michael Long, who walked to Canberra to call for the human rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia. The game itself is opened with traditional dancing and a smoking ceremony conducted by local Wurundjeri elders.When: Usually held in the last week of May For more information, visit the MCGGreat Sandy national park comprises two parts. Cooloola is on the coast between Rainbow beach in the north and Noosa Heads in the south. K’gari (Fraser Island) takes in nearly all of the world’s largest sand island, north of Rainbow beach. The famous coloured sands, pristine blue water, plentiful marine life and lush rainforests are some of the features visitors will find at Great Sandy national park, one of Queensland’s largest national parks.Aboriginal cultural heritage: Aboriginal people have lived in the Great Sandy area for at least 5,000 years, according to archaeological evidence, but they may have been there far longer. The Butchulla people lived on K’gari (Fraser Island) and the nearby mainland. Their heritage sites of spiritual, social and archaeological significance are found on the island, as well as their middens, artefacts, scarred trees and campsites. The Butchulla led a complex, self-sufficient way of life intrinsically connected to the seasons, the land, and life on it and in the surrounding ocean. Soon after European settlement of the area in the 1840s the Indigenous people were forced off their land, and by the late 1800s their lifestyle had been destroyed and the Aboriginal people from around the region were relocated to a mission on Fraser Island. Today, descendants of these people who live in the area are working to protect and share their culture and way of life, which is so closely tied to this beautiful and bountiful natural environment.Where: Cooloola lies between Noosa Heads and Rainbow Beach. Noosa Heads is about 155km (about a three-hour drive) and Rainbow Beach is about 240km (about a three-hour drive) north of Brisbane. Fraser Island is about 300km north of Brisbane and 15km off the coast of Hervey Bay and Maryborough.Cost: Driving on the beaches and some inland sand tracks requires a vehicle access permit (VAP). The cost of the VAP depends on the area of the Great Sandy national park. Camping fees also apply.For more information, visit Great Sandy national park "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89bc12f0d4b16c14a7fe50e27188721e0bc626a2/673_0_5325_3196/master/5325.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c20b7a3505956f4093e4b7c9f78ebae7","title":"japanese art of forest bathing comes to england holidays","story":"The Japanese art of forest bathing has arrived in Britain’s woodlands. Now we can all dip a toe in, writes Joanne O’Connor, who tries it out in NorfolkOne pine tree looks very much like another. This is my first thought as I wander into the forest looking for a tree to “connect with”. When I find this special tree, I’ve been instructed to greet it like an old friend, to share what’s on my mind, maybe even give it a hug. I’m hoping to find a gnarly old oak, a mournful willow perhaps, but this is a plantation forest, the arboreal equivalent of “Pines R Us”. Oh well. This one will do. Self-consciously, I wrap my arms around a spindly sapling. We both know it’s not right, but the clock is ticking. And then I spot it, glowing in the bosky gloom – a ghostly silver birch. I make my excuses – “Sorry, I’ve just seen a better tree over there” – and make my way over to the birch. As I get closer I notice that its papery bark is covered in some kind of green fungus. I look around. I’ve lost sight of the rest of the group and my allocated 10 minutes are up. It occurs to me that this is some kind of clunky metaphor for my life: I’ve spent so long looking for the perfect tree that I’ve run out of time.When I eventually rejoin the rest of the group, our guide invites us to share any insights gained from our tree encounter while passing around a pine cone. One of the women describes feeling a profound sense of peace. I decide not to share that none of the trees were good enough for me.Forest bathing is the latest health and wellbeing craze to hit the UK. An import from Japan, it’s been greeted with equal parts enthusiasm and scepticism, much like sushi when it first arrived on British shores. No swimming is involved the bathing part simply means using all of your senses to soak up the special atmosphere of the forest. And it’s big. From self-help books to Center Parcs (which has incorporated forest-bathing principles into its new Sherwood Forest spa), the healing power of trees is suddenly everywhere. The Forestry Commission, which manages almost 1m hectares of woodland in England, plans to launch a nationwide forest-bathing programme next year. And even city dwellers can get their tree fix with guided forest-bathing “experiences” popping up in parks from London to New York.But isn’t this just a marketing ploy to repackage the simple notion of going for a walk in the woods as a new alternative therapy? Apparently not. Japan is the most densely populated country on earth, with correspondingly high stress levels. It’s also one of the most heavily forested. In the 1980s the Japanese government carried out extensive scientific research which found that a two-hour forest-bathing session could reduce blood pressure, lower cortisol levels and improve concentration and memory. Their findings went beyond the usual correlations between fresh air, exercise and wellbeing. They found that the chemicals released by trees, known as phytoncides, could have an anti-microbial effect on our bodies, boosting the immune system. As a result of this research, forest bathing, or shinrin-yoku, was introduced as a national health programme.The first designated forest-bathing location was the beautiful Akasawa forest in Nagano prefecture on the old Samurai Trail, where groves of Japanese cypress trees tower 35m high. I’m trying it out in Thorpe Forest in Norfolk, just a few miles from Thetford, on the Dad’s Army trail (the TV series was famously filmed in and around the town). Forest Holidays, which offers accommodation in luxury woodland cabins at 10 locations around the UK, was among the first in the UK to spot the trend’s potential. Alongside more conventional ranger-led woodland activities, guests and day visitors to its Norfolk and Hampshire sites can now book a three-hour guided forest-bathing experience.“This is not a hike, it’s not exercise, it’s not a nature walk,” explains our ranger Charlie, who attended an eight-day residential course in France to qualify as a forest-therapy guide. “It’s much closer to mindfulness.” She leads our small group to a large clearing in the forest and invites us to close our eyes and awaken our senses, feeling the ground beneath our feet, inhaling the scent of pine and listening to the wind in the trees. It’s the first of a series of “invitations”, or gentle guided meditations, which are designed to quieten the mind and deepen our connection with our surroundings.Charlie calls the next exercise “What’s in motion?” This involves walking very slowly and attentively through the forest and noting the things that are growing or moving around us. It proves surprisingly difficult. My preferred way of being outdoors is to go for a long, strenuous walk. To creep along at a snail’s pace, noticing every leaf that quivers, is a challenge and I find my mind strays and my pace involuntarily picks up. But eventually the stillness of the forest on this cold spring day starts to work its magic. I slow down. I stare at the hypnotic swaying of the pines. Charlie spots a muntjac disappearing into the undergrowth. The spell is unceremoniously broken by a blast of Snow Patrol from the portable speakers of a group of teenagers marching past on some kind of adventure training exercise. Then it’s time for our “meet a tree” bonding session (enlightening) and Charlie asks us to finish by getting into pairs and swapping stories about trees that have meant something to us. The session ends with a Japanese tea ceremony – the tea infused with foraged nettles, pine needles or blackberries depending on the time of year – the first cup being offered to the forest as a way of giving thanks.The day finishes with my own interpretation of forest bathing – a long twilight soak in the hot tub on my cabin deck with a glass of wine, staring up at the trees above. After a long winter – most of which was spent huddled in front of a computer screen, or scurrying, head down, between the school run, train station and office – it feels like the first time in months that I’ve actually taken a deep breath, allowed my shoulders to drop and just enjoyed the feeling of being outside. Call it shinrin-yoku, forest bathing, a walk in the woods, call it whatever you like, but it feels good.A three-night stay in a Forest Holidays Silver Birch cabin with hot tub, sleeping four, costs from £610.

In its centre, Ahmed al-Masery sits in an empty coffee shop watching highlights on a tiny, wall-hung TV of his old friend playing for Liverpool against Roma. “I used to play football games on PlayStation with him back in the day,” says the 35-year-old, gesturing at the screen.Back then, Salah would pick Liverpool to play video games with his friend. Now the player is the Merseyside club’s favourite adopted son, a striker whose goals have inspired his team into the Champions League final later this month. Fans are devoted to their “Egyptian king” – one song includes the line “if he scores another few, I’ll be Muslim too”.For the people of Nagrig, a small farming community two buses and a train-ride north of Cairo, Salah’s rise is scarcely believable. The 25-year-old comes back to the village about once a year, al-Masery says, but he’s been totally unspoilt by fame. “He doesn’t even drive when he comes here,” he says. “He walks around the streets like everyone else, speaking to anyone who wants to talk to him.”Much has been made in the Egyptian press of Salah’s charity work. It’s been widely reported that he regularly helps newlyweds furnish their new homes with everything they need for marriage, although the recipients of these gifts have never come out publicly. Newspaper columnists and talk-show hosts delight in sharing examples like these of Salah’s good nature, but al-Masery is one of many Nagrig residents who are sceptical. “Most of these stories are just hearsay,” he says. One particularly popular Salah story came after LE 30,000 (£1,250) was stolen from Salah’s father. The thief was caught and in act of forgiveness, Salah’s family did not press charges. Retellings of the story in the press, however, have Salah intervening personally to help the man find work. One version even has Salah giving the man a wad of cash.“The media just wants to talk about Salah, Salah, Salah,” al-Masery says. “He’s a nice guy, and very respectful, but not everything written about him is true.”Not everybody shares al-Masery’s scepticism about the Salah story. In Cairo, where 200 punters crammed onto the pavement at an outdoor coffee shop to watch Liverpool secure their place in the Champion’s League final, 29-year-old football fan Omar Salem says he “doesn’t care” if certain details about the striker are false. “People want to believe these things about him,” he says. “At this point he’s so loved that nobody would ever deny them.”Before last July, you’d be hard pressed to find anyone here supporting the Merseyside club. That’s all changed this season, though, with football fans regularly turning out in force, for every Liverpool game. “It would just be amazing to have an Egyptian player win the Champion’s League,” Salem says.Salem says it was Egypt’s match against Congo in October that marked the beginning of his status as a national icon. Salah’s penalty, four minutes into injury time, put Egypt ahead at the 11th hour, securing the team a place in its first World Cup in 28 years. “When he celebrated that goal,” says Salem, “that’s the image people will remember from that match.”Salem calls Salah the first big Egyptian player “that people can actually relate to”. “We don’t even know what car he drives,” says Salem. Instead, Salah’s story is that of a humble teenager, who through sheer grit and determination earned the chance to represent his country in the big leagues of Europe.For the kids of Nagrig, at least, the legend of Mohamed Salah is very real. His former school was renamed in his honour, and to talk to pupils here, you’d think his story was part of the curriculum. One such pupil, 13-year-old Osama Eid, tells the story of Salah’s rise to fame as if reciting his 12-times-tables. “He’s very respectful and kind,” he says, “and well-mannered and does a lot of work to help the poor.” According to Eid’s friends, he’s the best footballer of their gang. When asked if he’d like to be like Salah one day, he doesn’t skip a beat: “Inshallah.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5325058944c25af852069a5acc8c75f527c375c9/0_43_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0895e1345e570bb0fc1cc556db4c851a","title":"qatar blockade unexpected new vision isolation","story":"Enforced isolation has given the emirate confidence to pursue a political and cultural rebootFor most of the past year the city-state of Qatar, the wealthiest peninsula on the planet, has been exploring the law of unintended consequences. The trigger for that came last June, when Qatar’s closest neighbours, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the UAE, escalated a simmering disquiet about the Gulf state’s role in the region to implement a full land and air blockade.Overnight, planes and cargo ships heading for Qatar were erted, all diplomatic links were cut and Qatar’s sole land border, with Saudi Arabia, was closed. Even camels were not spared the politics – 12,000 Qatari animals were forcibly repatriated.The stated aim for the blockade – which came with a 10-day ultimatum of 13 unlikely demands – was a protest against what was seen as Qatar’s singular role in “funding terrorism” (the Saudi line that Donald Trump swallowed and retweeted whole). Politically, it seemed rather an attempt to humiliate the sheikhdom and call it to heel. In the event, something like the opposite of that expectation has unfolded.Far from destabilising Qatar’s ruling al-Thani family, resistance to the ultimatum has lent it an “us against the world” authority. Among the 313,000 native Qataris (in a population of 2.6 million) a cult of personality has grown around the youthful emir, Sheikh Tamim, whose idealised portrait now gazes across the Gulf from the steel and glass skyscrapers of Doha, and is almost ubiquitous in the back window of the 4x4s that cruise the capital’s six-lane corniche.Isolation has also, it seems, acted as a catalyst to Qatar’s long-term vision for itself. One of the inbuilt ironies of the richest per capita state on earth was that, ever since it discovered and exploited its vast natural gas reserves, there has been little native necessity to drive invention. The al-Thanis’ stated goal has been to create a erse knowledge economy that lasts beyond the gas reserves. As Sheikha Hind, younger sister of the emir, explained to me in Doha last week in a rare interview, money – and the incentive of capital projects such as the 2022 World Cup – solves only some of those skills shortages.“It is not a secret that we are a wealthy society and that maybe nobody even needs to work,” she said. “But knowing that you can contribute in developing your country, and allow it to become even more prominent, is something everyone feels pride in. If anything, the blockade helped that. We see a big opportunity to be self-sustainable.”Qatar’s modern nation-building aspirations were first expressed by Sheikha Hind’s parents. While her father developed the partnership with Iran that could exploit the natural gas fields, her mother, Sheikha Moza, established the multibillion-dollar Qatar Foundation in order to transform education, particularly for women. Sheikha Hind, 34, a mother of five herself, was one of the first beneficiaries of “Education City” and has for the past three years been chief executive of the Qatar Foundation.From the balcony of its offices you can see the glass and marble evidence of that ambition in the futuristic campuses of a dozen “partner universities” that radiate outward. Each was persuaded here for its particular expertise in building capacity that Qataris need: Georgetown for its programme in government, Texas A\u0026ampM for engineering, and so on.The newest addition to Education City is the stunning Qatari National Library, designed by the Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas: a huge, welcoming building in which book stacks rise all around a central area that includes an open theatre and cafe, like terraces on backlit hillsides. There has been no library tradition in the Gulf, so Koolhaas’s idea was to create a space that is immediately understandable. Fifty-one thousand Qataris have already taken membership and the children’s library has proved particularly successful. In the few months since opening, every one of the 150,000 books on its shelves has been borrowed at least once.Along with those silver terraces of books, at subterranean level, in what look like excavated catacombs made of Iranian marble, the library houses an expensively acquired collection of rare manuscripts and calligraphy relating to the Arab world. This collection has been assembled in the same acquisitive spirit in which the al-Thani billions have filled its IM Pei-designed Museum of Islamic Art: to establish Doha as the modern intellectual capital of the Arab world. Later this year a new National Museum, shaped as a series of giant intersecting discs, designed by Jean Nouvel, will add another dimension to that claim.There is a blatant “look at us” attitude in some of this, but also the message that the territory that Qatar aims to colonise is as much cultural as economic. The al-Thanis have made headlines buying blingy stakes in such global landmarks as the Empire State Building, Harrods and the Shard – and splashing out ostentatiously on the world’s most expensive paintings ($250m for Cezanne’s The Card Players) and footballers ($262m to bring superstar Neymar to Qatari-owned Paris St Germain). But they have also long realised that it is whoever controls the story who generally wields power.That principle was first tested 22 years ago when the then emir established and funded the Arab broadcaster al-Jazeera. The harsh journalistic light the television station has shone on the internal politics of other Arab nations (and the relatively soft focus it gives to Qatar) is at the heart of the current enmity and blockade. One of the 13 ultimatum demands of the blockaders was that the broadcaster be shut down.The Saudi-led outrage at al-Jazeera’s reporting and editorial stance deepened during the Arab spring, when the station (and Doha’s ruling family) threw its support behind the popular uprising, rather than the established ruling powers. This stance was seen as part of a wider pattern in which Qatar seeks to build power at home while fomenting dissent abroad, aiming to be all things to all people: keeping trade and diplomatic channels open to Israel while openly funding Hamas hosting the major American air base, al-Udeid, while giving support to the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood offering to broker peace talks on Syria while giving refuge to known al-Qaida affiliates.The dean, Everette E Dennis, a distinguished observer of the fourth estate’s role in extending civil society in the former eastern bloc as well as in the US, had expected a fight over censorship when he came to Doha. He has found, he says, that “there has never been a single intrusion into what we teach and how we teach it – the full range of social issues that would be part of the conversation on an American campus are freely discussed here”.Initially, he found some unwillingness to challenge authority among the students,who come from across the region and beyond, but that quickly dissipated. He suggests that the gains of regular press freedoms have begun to be appreciated in Qatar (despite the fact that, since 2016, the authorities have blocked Doha News, an online outlet that offered more critical reporting of their actions).There has been learning on both sides, he suggests. The university has established the first system of press accreditation, for example, and lobbying from graduates of the programme has coincided with the establishment of a properly functioning government information office. That spirit of critical enquiry, he suggests, has also prompted the ruling family and its government to address international concerns, in particular over the shameful treatment of migrant labour in Qatar on capital projects for the World Cup. They have responded to concerns with a minimum wage and new policy over housing programmes and healthcare that have been given a qualified welcome by the International Labour Organisation of the UN.In the dean’s view the blockade has again accelerated this transparency. At the same time as it has become illegal in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE for citizens to question or criticise even the idea of the blockade, Qatar is lifting visa restrictions and attempting to brand itself as a home of greater free speech. While Saudi Arabia congratulates itself on finally allowing women to drive, Sheikha Hind can point to a majority of female undergraduates across all departments, including engineering, at Education City.In that sense, I wonder if the Qatari ruling family is secretly grateful for the blockade in sharpening a perceived cultural ide between itself and its Wahhabi neighbours. Has it proved more an opportunity than a crisis?“I won’t lie to you and tell you we are OK with the blockade,” Sheikha Hind says, “absolutely not. We have had students here who are terribly affected by it – whole families have been torn apart. It is a sad situation we are in.” She hopes, along with every other Qatari I speak to, that there is a resolution to the conflict soon. Still, she says, “if anything, the push we always had here for self-sustainability is just exploding now.” The goal has not changed, she suggests, “but now we are running rather than walking”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3475796.1524775142!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"skylarks stunned me just like the poets the bird has hoisted into verse","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe lark ascending: the skylark has hoisted countless poets into verse. Illustration: Michael VineyMy first encounter with a singing skylark, a few decades ago, put me flat on my back on the moss of the dunes – a proper posture for awe.The bird had sprung, as larks do, almost from under my feet and spiralled up to hang as a speck in the clear air, pouring out a ceaseless flow of whistlings and trillings that seemed to stun the whole hillside into listening. They certainly stunned me, just like the countless poets the skylark has hoisted into verse.One could look to science (flight up to 100m, wings fluttering at 10 to 12 beats a second, sonagram with up-and-down pitch pattern between 2kHz and 5.5kHz over about six seconds, average song up to two or three minutes but can go on for six). Or could simply settle for Shelley: “Higher still and higher  From the earth thou springest . . . And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.”A lot more is assembled online by a sensitive American blogger, who didn’t, one gathers, vote for Trump. There are further from Cecil Day-Lewis (“Be strong your fervent soaring, your skyward air!  Tremble there, a nerve of song!”) and a typically ecstatic tongue-twister from Gerard Manley Hopkins (“Left hand, off land, I hear the lark ascend,  His rash-fresh re-winded new skeinèd score  In crisps of curl off wild winch whirl, and pour  And pelt music, till none’s to spill or spend”).Ted Hughes, whose skylark may have soared in Connemara, is predictably darker: “The lark begins to go up  Like a warning  As if the globe were uneasy . . .  You stop to rest, far up, you teeter  Over the drop . . .  Then up and up and up  Like a mouse with drowning fur  Bobbing and bobbing at the well-wall”.The globe is indeed uneasy, as one in eight of its bird species is threatened with extinction. As farming intensifies, Europe’s skylarks are down by almost half, and in Ireland by 30 per cent, since 1970.It is no longer breeding in many parts of the south and east, its nesting retreating to the uplands and coastal margins and islands. On the grassy machair behind the dunes, below me, Michael Longley has pictured the spring tide “seeping after sun and moon  To pour cupfuls into the larks’ nests”.An English skylark researcher, Eric Simms, a sound recordist as well as ornithologist, began all this more than half a century ago. He organised the synchronised recording, in early June 1951, of the spread of the dawn chorus across the UK.Skylarks anticipated the rise in light as it rolled across these islands from northeast to southwest. Their first song was recorded at 01.30 GMT in Scotland’s Cairngorms, 01.51 in Northumberland, 02.20 in Kent, 02.27 in Staffordshire, 02.28 in Co Antrim, 02.33 in Lancashire (a bit late in industrial haze) and 02.36 in south Wales.At RTÉ Derek Mooney and his Mooney Goes Wild team of experts pioneered the broadcasting of the Irish dawn chorus some two decades ago, then extended live transmission across Europe through links with other presenters as far as Russia.In 2016 this triumphant capture of the exquisite avian sound, with human commentary in a murmur of national accents, won the programme the Rose d’Or award for the European radio event of the year. Tomorrow’s dawn chorus will track the songs of myriad species, from the tropics to the tundra, in their first welcome to the day.For some of Ireland’s skylarks, meanwhile, there is promise of a better future. In the Bride Valley of east Cork – where, I’m told, the bird is “just hanging on in pockets here and there” – a five-year pilot project has been launched to reward tillage and dairy farmers for actions encouraging wildlife.In the logo of the new Bride Project (“Farming with Nature”) a skylark is poised above bands of green and gold, denoting the grass and cornfields that comprise its ideal habitat. Farm management plans will offer the birds patches of ungrazed pasture to nest in, and unsprayed stubble fields for winter feed.A Scottish skylark researcher, Diane Hendry, wrote an anxious poem about her job: “I worry that skylarks have been expelled,  become dissident birds.  I try to pretend they are simply out  of fashion, like Shelley  but secretly I am afraid  they have been hushed up”.In Bride Valley, let’s hope, they’ll soon be back in full number, and “soaring ever singest”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Michael McCarrick, an ESB employee who lived at Belleek, lost his life on FridayPro-choice group launches new campaign as referendum approachesDaughter of Ann Lovett\u0026rsquos boyfriend says \u0026lsquosilence an enormous burden for so many\u0026rsquoAssociation of Catholic Priests says unmarried, childless men should not be \u0026lsquodogmatic\u0026rsquoIncreasing pessimism in Dublin over prospects for Brexit talksDublin Fire Brigade made discovery after responding to house fire in MarinoPolice in Northern Ireland are appealing for witnesses to Ballyrashane Road crashTeenager questioned after 38-year-old left with \u0026lsquoextremely grave\u0026rsquo head injurySimon Harris said he would review consent for HSE director general if conflict of interestStrength of support for repeal noticeable across all age groups but apathy is the enemyMultimillion euro agreement follows \u0026lsquohorrific week\u0026rsquo for women in IrelandBusinesses on O\u0026rsquoConnell Street using high-pitched \u0026lsquomosquito alarms\u0026rsquo to combat loiteringFamily who lost two daughters at the hospital brought the case due to delay in reportUS campaigners in favour of retaining Eighth Amendment have faced \u0026lsquohateful\u0026rsquo commentsBody of 29-year-old was discovered at a house in Balbriggan at 8.30pm on FridayPolitical support drains away from HSE director general Tony O\u0026rsquoBrienMan (33) arrested for attack on member of Armed Regional Support Unit in GalwayBusinesses and householders find persistent difficulties with cover in spite of major worksEvents include Ed Sheeran gigs in Cork and Temple Bar celebration of Baltic Day"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3485811.1525537135!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"i struggled with knowing who ann s baby s father might be","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAnn Lovett: died after giving birth at the age of 15, in 1984.

I was overwhelmed with guilt, sadness and a profound shame.”Ms Langan said the more she researched Ann’s death, “the more I became convinced of some manner of a cover-up”. “I struggled with the weight of knowing who Ann’s baby’s father might be but was paralysed by it. I was unable to process or suppress the contemplation of the senseless loss of Ann’s life, the tragic, lonely stillbirth of what might have been my half-brother, the suffocating atmosphere of the town closing ranks, the silence.”On April 22nd, 1984, less than three months after Ann died, her sister Patricia, aged 14, died by suicide. “The silence surrounding this horrific tragedy has been an enormous burden on so many people,” Ms Langan said. “Three lives ended in a state of unthinkable desperation, and the trauma that stayed with those who cared about Ann and Patricia fuelled endless cycles of depression, alcoholism, self-harm, violence, self-destructive behaviour and sadly, suicides.“Remains and after-effects of this trauma have embedded themselves into the generation that followed Ann’s and my father’s. I have not yet begun to find a way to rid myself of this unshakeable sadness, this internal rage in all directions.“I am sure there are other young people my age connected to those in Granard who feel the same.”“I want to thank Rosita Boland for her important reporting on this story and for her kindness and sensitivity over the past few weeks.

Photograph: David Sleator Bertie Ahern’s haunts are mostly still the same: Croke Park, Parnell Park – the home of Dublin GAA – and some pubs around the north side of Dublin where he toured throughout his political career.Yet some slight differences have emerged in the habits of the former taoiseach since he stood down from office a decade ago.Despite occasional appearances in Fagan’s – the Drumcondra pub which has framed pictures and newspaper clippings of Ahern and Bill Clinton toasting each other on its walls – he is said to no longer be a regular, but may occasionally make an appearance.“The lads behind the bar say it: ‘Never comes in anymore’,” said a local source. “He was last spotted there on All-Ireland final day.”A hostile atmosphere during the worst years of the recession perhaps encouraged Ahern to be cautious in where he socialises. He is now said to favour the discreet bar in the soccer club Home Farm. “The place would be empty – seven or eight people – but the Bert will be in there,” said another local. “I think he uses it for privacy.”The Goose Tavern and the Beaumont House still count on his regular custom, usually with old friends who have remained “100 per cent” loyal, according to those who know them.But – after years in which Bertie Ahern was viewed as something of a pariah – those around north Dublin detect a renewed confidence in Ahern as his reputation has improved. “When you see him coming out of Parnell Park now, there is a pep in his step even compared to two years ago. His head is held up high, he has a bit of the swagger back.”His interventions on Northern Ireland issues and Brexit have helped to rehabilitate him, although a recent interview with German television – which he walked out of when questions turned to the Mahon tribunal and his stewardship of the economy – served as a reminder that the most contentious issues of his past have not gone away.Speaking to The , Ahern himself says most criticism of him by members of the public in the years after his retirement mostly centred on the economy. “In the heat of the recession in 2009 and 2010, people would say: ‘If you had have done this or that’.” Issues around the tribunal, he says, are raised with him “very, very rarely”.Friends say a “bit of pride” meant Ahern was reluctant to discuss how his reputation had been damaged. “Even during the height of the recession, and at the peak of when he was getting stick, if you asked him about that, he’d never really admit it,” said one.But one particular memory from his days at the tribunal in Dublin Castle lingers around north Dublin, and will not be easily forgotten.The intricacies of his personal finances – aside from an easily mocked claim that he won significant sums betting on horses – have largely passed beyond common memory, but the treatment of Gráinne Carruth has not.Carruth, Ahern’s former constituency secretary who broke down while giving evidence about lodging thousands of pounds in sterling for her former boss, now lives with her family in a renovated St Luke’s, the former taoiseach’s Drumcondra base which she bought in 2015.“Even when people see him talking about Brexit and the Good Friday Agreement you’d still hear: ‘What about Gráinne Carruth and what he did to her?’” said a local.Ahern still keeps an office in Drumcondra, in modest rooms in a small business park. Most meetings are held across the road in the lobby or bar of the Skylon Hotel.He has been busy since leaving office. He briefly took to the after-dinner-speaking circuit and was on the boards of a few private sector companies but has largely focused on the area of conflict resolution, where his achievements are beyond dispute.Such pro bono work includes: spells with the World Economic Forum’s advisory group on conflict resolution the Clinton Global Initiative as a facilitator with Crisis Management Initiative, which saw him taking part in peace talks in Ukraine the Inter Mediate group established by Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair’s former chief adviser and a period as co-chair of the InterAction Council of former world leaders.Ahern has also formed associations with various academic institutions including receiving an honorary professorship from NUI Maynooth. This week, he was in the Basque Country to mark the end of Eta, another step in a peace process to which he, along with others such as Gerry Adams, contributed.Recently, he has also been asked by the United Nations to chair Bougainville’s referendum commission ahead of a vote next year on whether the region should be independent of Papau New Guinea. Back home, he has helped settle disputes between the GAA and organisations in north Dublin.But Ahern’s standing within Fianna Fáil – he resigned his membership in 2012 in advance of a move to expel him because of the findings of the Mahon tribunal – remains a pebble in his shoe.His possible re-entry into the party was raised as recently as last Wednesday night at a Dublin Central Comhairle Dáil Ceantair meeting. According to sources, an elderly delegate said that in order to secure a Dáil seat for Mary Fitzpatrick, the current Dublin Central candidate who clashed with Ahern on numerous occasions, the party should recruit all the help it could get, including allowing Ahern back.Ahern was sounded out about the prospect but cautioned against opening up such a contentious issue at this point. Micheál Martin shot down a similar proposal in November 2016, but many in the party would take Ahern back in a heartbeat.Last month, at a meeting of the Fianna Fáil national executive, talk turned to the prospect of the party standing a candidate in the presidential election – if there is to be one – later this year.Der Walsh, the delegate for Martin’s own Cork South Central constituency, told his leader that if the party is serious about standing for the presidency, it should send for Ahern. Unsurprisingly, Martin didn’t address the question.The current Fianna Fáil leader has a strained relationship with Ahern, who in turn finds it difficult to mask his dislike for the man he first appointed to Cabinet in 1997.Ahern’s occasional flirtations with a run for the presidency may be designed to cause trouble for Martin, or are a way of keeping his name connected with the Phoenix Park, in the off-chance that events turn his way.But friends insist he just wants his views on politics respected within the party he gave 40 years to. “I think he’d like to do the same around the party as he does with Brexit and the North,” says a friend, “to give advice”.“I don’t think he wants to run for office again. He was 40-odd years a member of the party. Most of his friends and most of his life has been around the party. I think he’d love to be of help. He doesn’t want to be on the frontline.”Ahern himself says: “If I was still in Fianna Fáil, the only thing I’d be doing would be in the local cumann.”To those around Ahern, the recent celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the Belfast Agreement offered the perfect opportunity for Martin to make a generous gesture of rapprochement.While Martin praised Ahern’s contributions to the peace process, it was felt that Fianna Fáil was attempting to claim credit for its achievements while continuing to disown one of its chief architects.“I have heard people in Fianna Fáil say: ‘We are the party of the Good Friday Agreement.’ You know Yeats’s famous line, how do you separate the dancer from the dance? Well, they are trying to do that.”As to when Ahern could return to Fianna Fáil fold, one supporter is blunt: “As soon as your man from Cork is gone.”All who encounter Ahern testify to his ongoing, intense interest in politics, from constituency level upwards.While he “f***ing hates Micheál Martin”, said one in regular contact with him, he is said to have a regard for Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. “He sees Leo as the same style of politician as himself.”“Bert still has the glint in his eye, the word for all the auld ones: ‘How yis doin girls? That type of thing.’ He still has a great grá for the day job.

Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3485857.1525588124!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"lebanon votes in first general election in nine years","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA man casts his vote at a polling station in Sidon, Lebanon. Photograph: REUTERSAli HashishoLebanese began voting on Sunday in their first general election for nine years. The poll is seen as unlikely to upend the country’s basic contours of power but is important for economic stability.Lebanon has mostly weathered the regional storm caused by seven years of war in neighbouring Syria that has drawn in regional powers and unleashed a wave of refugees, but it has gone through several internal crises since the last election.Television broadcasts showed voters queuing at polling stations across the tiny Mediterranean country to cast their ballots under new voting rules that still preserve the country’s sectarian power-sharing system.Voting is scheduled to last from 7am until 7pm, with unofficial results expected to start coming in overnight and a formal tally announced in the coming days.Election law makes it illegal to publish forecasts of how the parties will perform. Whatever the result, another coalition government including most of the major parties, like that which has governed since 2016, is likely to be formed after the election, analysts have said.Analysts are closely watching the performance of Sunni Muslim prime minister Saad al-Hariri’s Future Movement party and that of the Iran-backed, ShiaHizbullah group and its allies.The country has periodically been an arena for the intense regional competition between Iran and Saudi Arabia.

which is already under fire for failing to remove terrorist material from its platform - is now accused of actively connecting jihadists around the world, allowing them to develop fresh terror networks and even recruit new members to their cause.Researchers, who analysed the Facebook activities of a thousand Isil supporters in 96 countries, discovered users with radical Islamist sympathies were routinely introduced to one another through the popular \u0027suggested friends\u0027 feature.Using sophisticated algorithms, Facebook is designed to connect people who share common interests.The site automatically collects a vast amount of personal information about its users, which is then used to target advertisements and also direct people towards others on the network they might wish to connect with.But without effective checks on what information is being shared, terrorists are able to exploit the site to contact and communicate with sympathisers and supporters.Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has used social media for propaganda purposesThe extent to which the ‘suggested friend’ feature is helping Isil members on Facebook is highlighted in a new study, the findings of which will be published later this month in an extensive report by the Counter Extremism Project a non profit that has called on tech companies to do more to remove known extremist and terrorist material online.Gregory Waters, one of the authors of the report, described how he was bombarded by suggestions for pro-Isil friends, after making contact with one active extremist on the site.Even more concerning was the response his fellow researcher, Robert Postings, got when he clicked on several non-extremist news pages about an Islamist uprising in the Philippines.Within hours he had been inundated with friend suggestions for dozens of extremists based in that region.Mr Postings said: Facebook, in their desire to connect as many people as possible have inadvertently created a system which helps connect extremists and terrorists.”Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has vowed to tackle terrorist material on the siteOnce initial introductions are made the failure of Facebook to tackle extremist content on the site means Jihadists can quickly radicalise susceptible targets.In one example uncovered by the researchers, an Indonesian Isil supporter sent a friend request to a non-Muslim user in New York in March 2017.During the initial exchange the American user explained that he was not religious , but had an interest in Islam.Over the following weeks and months the Indonesian user began sending increasingly radical messages and links including pro-Isil propaganda, all of which were liked by his target.The study also examined the extent to which Facebook was failing to tackle terrorist material on its site.Of the 1,000 Isil supporting profiles examined by researchers, less than half of the accounts had been suspended by Facebook six months later.Facebook has said there is no place for terrorists on its siteMr Posting said: Removing profiles that disseminate IS propaganda, calls for attacks and otherwise support the group is important...the fact that the majority of pro-IS profiles in this database have gone unremoved by Facebook is exceptionally concerning.Even when terrorist material was identified and the offending posts removed, the user was often allowed to remain on the site.There have also been numerous examples of pro-Isil accounts being reinstated after the user complained to moderators about their suspension.In one case a British terror suspect had his Facebook account reinstated nine times after complaining, despite being accused of having posted sick Isil propaganda videos.Mr Waters said: This project has laid bare Facebook\u0027s inability or unwillingness to efficiently address extremist content on their site.The failure to effectively police its platform has allowed Facebook to become a place where extensive IS supporting networks exist, propaganda is disseminated people are radicalised and new supporters are recruited.Islamic State supporters have been introduced to one another on FacebookMr Postings added: “Even when profiles or content is removed, it is not always done fast enough, allowing Isil content to be to be widely share and viewed before getting removed.”Mr Waters said: “The fact that Facebook\u0027s own recommended friends algorithm is directly facilitating the spread of this terrorist group on its site is beyond unacceptable.Simon Hart, a Conservative MP who sits on Culture Media and Sport Select Committee, said: The idea that Facebook is inadvertently providing an introduction service for terrorists is quite extraordinary. It is another terrifying example of the unintended consequences of this sort of technology.If you design a system for one thing and it becomes another it is hard to police.Nobody will have set out to provide a network for terrorists to connect, but the important thing is how Facebook responds now this matter has been raised with them.A spokesman for Facebook  said: There is no place for terrorists on Facebook. We work aggressively to ensure that we do not have terrorists or terror groups using the site, and we also remove any content that praises or supports terrorism.Our approach is working – 99 per cent of ISIS and Al Qaeda-related content we remove is found by our automated systems. But there is no easy technical fix to fight online extremism.We have and will continue to invest millions of pounds in both people and technology to identify and remove terrorist content.North Korea says US ruining detente atmosphere ahead of Trump summit with \u0026#39misleading\u0026#39 claimsComment: Teachers fat-shaming our children is the natural result of a free NHSEnd of \u0026#39hell for leather training\u0026#39 as Army gets new fitness regime Comment: Arlott and Swanton were the last of the gentleman broadcastersLiz Hurley \u0026#39left very upset by burglary at mansion after dinner party\u0026#39Boris Johnson travelling to Washington in bid to save Iran dealDrill attack on woman may have been homophobic attack, police sayPrince Louis photo: A kiss for Royal baby brother from sister CharlotteSocial media is fuelling a surge in rail graffitiUniversities struggle to recruit top students as schools \u0026#39mercilessly push\u0026#39 Russell Group to pupilsComment: The Iran nuclear deal was based on lies and is untenableMinisters urged to demand answers from Qatar over its alleged support for terrorismJeremy Corbyn warned he could keep Labour out of office for another decade if he fails on BrexitComment: Parliament should reject Brexit game-playing and accept the country’s decisionBritain must wake up to \u0026#39folly\u0026#39 of trusting Iran over nuclear deal – Israeli ambassador Tory MPs threaten to \u0026#39throw the kitchen sink\u0026#39 at John Bercow Britain’s Got Talent episode 4: have we met the hipster Michael Bublé?Passengers compare scene inside Caribbean cruise ship to the Titanic after 50 rooms were flooded US condemns China for \u0026#39Orwellian nonsense\u0026#39 after Beijing writes to 36 airlines over Taiwan references\u0026#39Drunk\u0026#39 United Airlines stewardess disrupts flight with foul-mouthed rantWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/05/TELEMMGLPICT000162187133_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"social media fuelling surge graffiti","story":"Graffiti on trains has hit an eight year highSocial media is fuelling a resurgence in graffiti as artists compete for recognition and fame by posting photographs of their work online often without worrying that the original will be destroyed or painted over.New “high-tech graffiti artists” are using picture websites like Instagram to gain global recognition, as well as technology such as drones that serve as lookouts to try to prevent police catching them.Graffiti on trains has hit an eight-year high in the UK, with many images then being posted on social media. In the first quarter of 2018 there were 399 graffiti attacks on trains, the highest quarterly figure since the first quarter of 2010, according to figures obtained from the British Transport Police using Freedom of information laws.The surge in graffiti on the railway networks has forced the British Transport Police to reintroduce a dedicated CID team to specifically investigate graffiti crime.Trains operated by Southeastern Rail have been among those most frequently targeted by graffiti artists.Social media is allegedly fuelling the rise in graffitiWe’ve seen a more-than-doubling in the number of large mural-type graffiti attacks on our trains over the last three months, and that this is something that other train operators are experiencing too,” a spokesman for the company said in a statement.“We’re working closely with the British Transport Police to tackle the issues.“They’ve stepped up patrols and recently reintroduced a dedicated investigation team to identify the perpetrators and take appropriate criminal action.“Network Rail are also bringing in extra security to patrol and secure the network.”Experts say that the trend is being driven by new technology and the rise of social media, with artists using remote-controlled drones to avoid detection and attempting to outdo each other in daring videos that document their crimes and are posted online.“Instagram has completely changed the game,” says Darren Cullen, a former graffiti writer who is now owner and director of Graffiti Kings, a company that runs spray can art workshops for young people.“Now graffiti artists aren’t discouraged by the fact that their work might be painted over as soon as it is finished.“Even if no one ever sees it in real life - you can still take photos and reach a huge audience instantly through social media.”Graffiti cases are soaring across the UKSeveral UK graffiti Instagram accounts have thousands of followers and allow graffiti writers to compete for recognition by showing proof of the quality of their art as well as their increasing appetite for risk.The independent graffiti magazine UKFrontline has more than 16,800 followers on Instagram and the images it posts, which mainly document graffiti on trains around Britain, regularly get thousands of views from around the world.Some of the videos posted on Instagram and on YouTube show freshly painted artworks, while others show groups of graffiti writers, with their faces covered, in action as they paint on train carriages.Painting murals illegally on trains has been the goal since modern graffiti culture was forged in New York in the 1980s, but large multi-colour artworks have rarely been seen on UK trains following a crackdown on prolific graffiti artists in the 90s, according to Joe Epstein, an author and photographer who has documented graffiti and street art in London since 2006.“Over the last few years it has started to become a regular occurrence,” he said. “It’s quite extraordinary because five years ago people would always talk about what was done on trains in the 90s and say it is pretty much unachievable these days.”One factor that has tipped the balance in favour of graffiti writers are cuts to police budgets, something that has reduced resources available for investigating criminal damage incidents.Graffiti artists are using drones to chose targetsGraffiti writers have also embraced modern technology to avoid capture, including drones fitted with video cameras, which are used to monitor train yards before the vandals break in and paint a train.“Drones are being used a lot,” said one graffiti writer who spoke on condition of anonymity.“It’s not uncommon to visit spots regularly for months, watching the trains to see where they stop and for how long – timing them so you know how long you’ve got.”There were 800 graffiti crimes that targeted trains over the whole of 2017, an increase of 49 per cent compared to a low of 537 in 2013.If the trend continues British Transport Police will record more graffiti incidents on trains in the UK this year than any other year since 2008.Graffiti artists are posting their work onlineAnnual graffiti attacks on associated infrastructure, such as train lines and stations, has also steadily increased, nearly doubling since 2013.The biggest increases in graffiti on trains have been recorded in the regions patrolled by British Transport Police’s South East of England subision and its Transport for London subision.In 2017 the number of graffiti crimes on trains in the South East of England was 78 per cent higher than in 2013, while the number of crimes targeting Transport for London trains were up by 51 per cent.Efforts by Southeastern Rail to quickly clean graffiti off trains has been hampered by a £5 million improvement programme, which is taking place over the next 6-9 months.“In the short-term we’re taking the approach that passengers would prefer a train in service with graffiti on it, than one cancelled,” a spokesman said.A spokesperson for Transport for London said that its ability to combat graffiti had not been impacted by cuts and any increase in the visibility of graffiti on its trains is due to the rise in activity by graffiti writers that target its trains.No one from Instagram was available for comment.North Korea says US ruining detente atmosphere ahead

That gets us absolutely nowhere\u0027Damian Hinds should “stop choking” schools and threatening them with Ofsted inspections, shadow education secretary Angela Rayner has said.Speaking to headteachers in Liverpool, Ms Rayner called on the education secretary to stop “beating schools over the head” with the current inspection regime, and instead to take a collaborative approach. It comes after Mr Hinds announced plans to overhaul measures used to hold schools to account. But schools will still be forced to become academies if they are judged to be inadequate by Ofsted, he said. Cost pressures on schools have been ‘challenging’, minister admitsAt the annual conference of National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) in Liverpool, Ms Rayner said the current accountability system in schools was unfit for purpose. The Labour MP questioned the climate in which 10- and 11-year-olds are told they have failed Sats exams, which are supposed to only be used to hold schools to account rather than the children themselves. “At a time when they are supposed to be excited about going into secondary school they are being told they are not good enough. We are putting them on a constant cycle of testing,” she said. Her comments come after The Independent revealed that thousands of parents are expected to withdraw their children from the Sats exams as they say accountability data is being put before children’s wellbeing. Ms Rayner said: “I have got a message for Damian in government – you really do need to stop choking schools and threatening them with the inspection regime at the moment.”She added: “You need to be supporting and helping them... It is not just about beating schools over the head and threatening them. That gets us absolutely nowhere.”A motion calling on the NAHT to support school leaders in challenging Ofsted when they investigate complaints from parents against headteachers and senior staff was passed at the conference on Saturday. “School leaders are vulnerable and easy to attack. We are an easy target for an ever-increasing dissatisfaction in the public realm.”He added: “It is humbling and heartbreaking to watch professionals shake and cry. To go from being infectiously optimistic to a state of anxiety, paranoia, lack of self-esteem and suffer stress related illness. “A significant contributory factor that cannot be underestimated is the complaints culture that has been developed over the last three years.”The shadow education secretary, who received two standing ovations from headteachers for her speech, added: “I really am concerned about the testing regime in primary and in early years. Actually we know through international standards and through the evidence that that actually is not always the best way forward.“The current system isn’t fit for purpose, it isn’t delivering what we want for our young people. So we need to change that. I want a focus and an emphasis in the early years to make sure we look at child development and look at building children to be resilient.”UK news in picturesUK news in picturesAnti-independence supporters wave Union Jack flags as thousands of demonstrators march in support of Scottish independence through the streets of Glasgow.Prime Minister Theresa May with her supporters during a visit to Wandsworth Town Hall, where the Conservative Party retained control of Wandsworth Council in the local elections.Jeremy Corbyn outside a polling station in Islington after voting in the local elections.A memorial to George Michael outside his house in Highgate, north London.

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that.

However, animals were not the only threat. Kenya was at the time a British colony.During the Mau Mau uprising of the 1950s, white families were fair game to the rebels thanks in no small part to the brutal nature of colonial rule. (In 2011 William Hague expressed “sincere regret” for the thousands who had been detained and tortured.) When Sheldrick was nine months pregnant she survived an ambush by Mau Mau fighters.Chained and tortured: The horror inflicted on India’s elephantsSo when a wild elephant she had mistaken for one of her hand-reared orphans turned on her in 1994, she took it in her stride.“I opened my eyes. I could feel the elephant gently insert her tusks between my body and the rocks,” she wrote in her autobiography, Love, Life and Elephants: An African Love Story, in 2012.“Rather than a desire to kill, I realised that the elephant was actually trying to help me,” she added. “I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to Kenya.”Born Daphne Marjorie Jenkins, Sheldrick came from a family of settlers who left rural Scotland for Africa in the mid-1820s. Her great-uncle Will, a successful farmer in South Africa, began the family’s connection with Kenya after meeting governor Sir Charles Eliot. Eliot was offering free land to families prepared to move to his new colony. Among the families that subsequently boarded the boat to Mombasa were Daphne Sheldrick’s great-grandparents.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)The settlers arrived to an uncertain future in a country with none of the comforts of home. They could not move their livestock inland without first swathing them in cloth to foil the tsetse fly. The new railway was notorious for the number of workers eaten by lions during its construction. And the 5,000 acres of virgin bush gifted by the British government were in fact already home to the Masai. After an arduous four-month journey to get there, Sheldrick’s family had to move on again.I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to KenyaBy the time Sheldrick was born, third of Bryan and Marjorie Jenkin’s four children, the family was established on a farm in Gilgil in the Great Rift Valley. Marjorie Jenkins was determined to instil in her children a love for the natural world. Family walks included not just the farm dogs but an impala, a waterbuck and Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, a brown-furred dwarf mongoose. At the age of four, Sheldrick was given responsibility for the care of an orphaned infant bushbuck.It was an idyllic upbringing but it was hard to run a European farm among African predators such as lions and leopards. At the same time, the global picture was changing rapidly. With the Second World War reaching Ethiopia, the British government looked to Kenya to feed the troops. Bryan Jenkins was tasked with shooting thousands of wildebeest and zebra in the Southern Game Reserve. He set up a portable biltong factory, assisted by two Italian prisoners of war. It was while camping nearby that six-year-old Sheldrick was woken by lions. Attracted by the smell of meat, they stayed to lick salt from the tarpaulins.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)As soon as she was old enough, Sheldrick, who could speak Swahili, was sent to boarding school. She was a keen student, graduating eighth in her year and winning a university bursary. However, she was already in love with Bill Woodley, a student from her brother’s school, and chose instead to leave full-time education to be with him.Khurshid Drabu: Britain’s first Muslim judgeRemembering Avicii, Swedish superstar of electronic dance musicLeila Abashidze: Georgian actress who became a star of Soviet cinemaJanka Nabay: Musician who brought Sierra Leone’s bubu to the worldIsao Takahata: Japanese animation master who co-founded Studio GhibliAt around the same time, a state of emergency was declared in Kenya after Mau Mau guerrilla fighters, drawn from the Kikuyu, Meru, Embu, Kamba and Masai people, rose up against white colonial rule. The insurgency was put down with shocking brutality by British colonial officials and Kenyan “home guards”. Thousands of civilians were rounded up in mass detention camps and subjected to beatings, sexual assault and even castration, allegedly sanctioned at the highest level. (Finally, in 2013, after a long legal campaign, the British government apologised.)Mau Mau retaliation was equally bloody and Sheldrick’s family did not escape the violence. During a Mau Mau raid on her great-aunt’s farm, five people, including three children, were burned alive. Sheldrick’s grandparents were beaten and left for dead in an alleged Mau Mau robbery. Meanwhile, a worker on the Jenkins’ farm wasted away and died, convinced he was cursed after refusing to kill his employers at the Mau Mau’s behest.The David Sheldrick Trust has been reintroducing orphans back into the wild at Tsavo National Park since 1987 (Rex)In the midst of this unrest, Sheldrick married Woodley, visiting the United Kingdom for the first time on their honeymoon. After their marriage they moved to Tsavo National Park, where they worked as wardens. In January 1955, Bill took the now heavily pregnant Sheldrick back to visit her family in Gilgil. Returning in darkness, they were ambushed. “A terrifyingly loud sound erupted and in the arc of the headlamps we could see crazed, menacing figures, clad in skins, coming towards us in a great swirl of anger and noise. Some were wielding pangas, some were hurling enormous boulders and others were firing at us from point blank range.”Sheldrick continued working into later life (Rex)Bill Woodley saved his wife and unborn daughter, Jill, by driving straight through the Mau Mau attackers. A year later, the capture of Mau Mau leader Dedan Kimathi marked the official end of the “Emergency”, but the rebellion continued underground for almost a decade.The Woodleys survived the ambush but soon after their marriage foundered. Sheldrick, still Mrs Woodley as she then was, had fallen hopelessly in love with her husband’s boss with whom she had much in common. David Sheldrick was a keen naturalist dedicated to ending poaching. During his anti-poaching campaign, more than 25,700lbs of ivory was recovered and in 1959 and he was duly awarded an MBE. Meanwhile, Bill Woodley’s passion for hunting, so much at odds with his role as warden, was beginning to grate. Sheldrick left him for his high-minded superior.Sheldrick married David in 1960. Their family quickly expanded to encompass a variety of furry and feathered orphans, such as Gregory Peck, a buffalo weaver-bird, and Old Spice, a civet cat with a passion for the aftershave that bore his name. Soon after came a human daughter, Angela.We had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world warsDavid Sheldrick had already raised two orphaned elephants, Samson and Fatuma. His observations of the pair formed some of the first studies on elephant diet and migration. Daphne Sheldrick took charge of further orphans including one she named Aisha. In an interview, Sheldrick explained: “She came to us as one of the smallest elephants I had ever seen, with soft fuzz and ears as soft and pink as petals. When she arrived, my heart plummeted as we had never been able to save an elephant this young.”The Sheldricks had already discovered that elephants do not thrive on traditional baby formula and after a few days on glucose and watered down cow’s milk, Aisha was wasting away. As a last resort, Sheldrick tried coconut oil. It worked. Aisha began to thrive on Sheldrick’s recipe and the future of many more orphaned elephants was assured.Sheldrick leaves two daughters, four grandchildren, and a huge family of elephants, rhinos and many more (DSWT)By the early Sixties, the Mau Mau Uprising may have been over but the “winds of change”, as referenced in Harold Macmillan’s 1960 speech in South Africa, were blowing across the continent. When it came to Kenya, the British government decided that continuing colonial rule required more force than they were prepared to expend and Kenya was granted independence in 1963. The Duke of Edinburgh presided over the handover to Jomo Kenyatta.They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate thatThe change of rule caused much anguish for the white settler families, who, as Sheldrick described, “had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world wars. Britain began to turn its back on those people – even the daily BBC programme previously announced as ‘Home News from Britain’ became ‘News From Britain’, a subtle change that did not go unnoticed.”Sheldrick’s husband was among those who struggled to renew his British passport at the time. David Sheldrick put the situation succinctly: “There was no question about me not being British when the Second World War broke out and I was called up to fight for your bloody country.”In 2016 Sheldrick warned that if the ivory trade continued, the African forest elephant could be extinct by 2025 (Rex)The Sheldricks worried that the transition to independence would adversely affect Kenya’s national parks but it was their success in making the park a safe haven for elephants that caused the next problem. The elephant numbers at Tsavo had grown dramatically – from an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 – and the increased competition for food led to the devastation of much of the forest landscape. However, David Sheldrick firmly resisted the idea of an artificial cull and, in time, the more open grasslands created by the elephants’ indiscriminate browsing attracted new species, including antelope and buffalo. The Tsavo lions thrived.Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn tradeIn 1976, the parks were finally brought under government control, merging with the Government Game Department. Sheldrick explained that for the park’s “wild inhabitants, especially rhinos and elephants, who became instant targets, it was the death knell”. Shortly afterwards, David Sheldrick was offered a desk job in Nairobi and the family left Tsavo to an uncertain fate.David Sheldrick died that same year. After his death, devastated Sheldrick began to raise funds in his memory to continue the work that meant so much to him.‘Born to be Wild’, narrated by Morgan Freeman, shone a spotlight on the rehabilitation efforts in Kenya (Getty)The first official fundraiser was a film by former warden Simon Trevor. Somali gangs, armed with AK47s, had been gunning down entire Tsavo elephant herds, turning the park into a no-go zone. Trevor’s film on the crisis, Bloody Ivory, came to the attention of President Arap Moi, who agreed to attend the premiere. Alas, Moi was a no-show, but a few months later the Vatican proposed a papal visit to Kenya, during which the pope wished to bless an elephant and a rhino calf. Sheldrick obliged. The logistics were difficult but the publicity was priceless.Sheldrick was named one of the most significant conservationists ever (DSWT)In 1987, the David Sheldrick Memorial appeal became The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT), with a mission statement declaring it “embraces all measures that compliment the conservation, preservation and protection of wildlife”. Over the next 30 years the trust expanded to three sites: the elephant nursery at Sheldrick’s home in Nairobi, and two centres in Tsavo where the orphans were reintroduced into the wild.There was no shortage of infant elephants to be reared. Though President Moi tried to signal an end to the ivory trade by publicly burning Kenya’s stockpile in 1989, the international appetite for ivory remained undiminished. Between 2003 and 2013, the DSWT saw a 500 per cent increase in the number of orphans rescued, driven by demand for ivory from China. In an interview in 2016, Sheldrick lamented that elephants were being killed at a rate of 50 a day, telling Bohotraveller: “Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn trade.”UK ivory trade ban a positive step but what next for Africa’s elephantConservationists warn its too early to celebrate elephants\u0027 safetyEurope must choose: elephants or ivoryYoung Kenyans care for nature but are detached from conservation Wildlife conservancy grows cattle feed to fend off droughtFamily of elephant conservation pioneer pledge her legacy will live onSheldrick spread the word about the crisis facing the elephants with numerous television appearances. She published four books, including her autobiography. Meanwhile, her work was recognised all over the world. In 1989, she was appointed MBE. She was awarded an honorary doctorate in veterinary medicine by Glasgow University. In 2001, the Kenyan government awarded her the Moran of the Burning Spear and in 2006 Sheldrick became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, “for services to the conservation of wildlife, especially elephants, and to the local community in Kenya”. Her knighthood was the first to be awarded in Kenya since the country’s independence in 1963, something that Sheldrick said “left me dumbfounded but nevertheless extremely proud”. At the time of Sheldrick’s death in April 2018, the DSWT hand-reared more than 200 orphaned elephants, more than 100 of whom were successfully released into the wild. As the trust approached its 40th anniversary last year, Sheldrick told Eluxe magazine: “I have always turned to the elephants for inspiration in the face of adversity. They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate that.”As Sheldrick wrote in her autobiography: “Elephants are, indeed, just like us, and in many ways better.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He lived his last years exiled in London, where he authored the Communist Manifesto, his best-known work.All the ways in which Marx was unexpectedly right“Karl Marx was a philosopher, who thought into the future had creative aspirations, and today he stands for things, which is he not responsible for and which he didn\u0027t cause, because many of the things he wrote down were redrafted into the opposite,” Mr Juncker said in a speech at a church in Trier.“One has to understand Karl Marx from the context of his time and not have prejudices based on the review, these judgements shouldn\u0027t exist. Karl Marx was lucky in life as he was born in Trier. He grew up in the city, actually the shortest period of his vita.”Drawing on the philosopher’s legacy, Mr Juncker said the European Union’s instability could be addressed by focusing more on social welfare, which he said had been a neglected part of European integration so far.“It will be a task of our time to create a lively reality out of the social rights we set up for Europe, for the ones who live today and often are sad or blackmailed by life and won\u0027t have enough social rights and the ones, who will be born tomorrow,” he said.Marx\u0027s birthday is being celebrated across the world(AP)“The European Union is not a flawed, but an unstable construction. Unstable also because Europe\u0027s social dimension until today remains the poor relation of the European integration. We have to change this.”A former student of the philosopher Hegel, Marx developed the theory of historical materialism which he argued explained the development of human society and the development of social classes. His work argues that capitalism’s creation of a mass of workers who owned no property will be its downfall. He argued for the establishment of a “dictatorship of the proletariat” through which workers would become the dominant class.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

These trials have been shown up to be the chaotic, undemocratic mess many predicted.“These findings are exactly what many feared: that this draconian measure would result in blameless iniduals being disenfranchised. It is vital moving forward that these draconian trials are not a fait accompli for a national rollout.”The figures did not take into account whether voters came back with the correct ID having initially been turned away. It is also impossible to know how many people were put off from entering a polling station altogether because of the new ID requirements.Democracy Volunteers, the UK’s largest election observer group, collated the figures while carrying out extensive observations of the ID checks in 243 polling stations across the five areas the scheme was being piloted.John Ault, director of the organisation, told The Independent 10 voters had been turned away within a 45-minute period at one polling station in Swindon, and that the issue appeared to disproportionately affect ethnic minority voters.British voters furious at being denied right to cast ballot over ID“Obviously there were always going to be teething problems, but I also think quite clearly that if you – whether intentionally or otherwise – exclude 1.5 to 2 per cent of the population, that is a significant problem,” he said.“The process was quite well run. Staff were welcoming and generally helpful, they tried to assist people who didn’t realise they were required to bring ID.“But the problem is some people clearly weren’t able to produce it, and we don’t know how many people didn’t come because they didn’t have it in the first place.”Cat Smith, Labour’s shadow minister for voter engagement and youth affairs, clamed it was “impossible” for the government to justify rolling out the scheme.“After completely ignoring a number of serious warning signs, the government decided to pilot discriminatory measures which denied people their right to vote,” she said.“We cannot allow the Conservative Party to undermine our democracy, which is why Labour is calling on the government to scrap its voter ID plans as a matter of urgency.”Campaigners had questioned the evidence on which the trials were based. Figures from the Electoral Commission show there were just 28 allegations of impersonation in 2017 out of nearly 45 million votes – or one case for every 1.6 million votes cast. Only one of these allegations resulted in a conviction.Senior officials in trial areas expressed their concerns about the trials, while the government was criticised by the UK Statistics Authority for pushing misleading figures to support the need for the pilots.Local elections 2018 – in picturesLocal elections 2018 – in picturesJeremy Corbyn outside a polling station in IslingtonTheresa May and her husband Philip arrive at a polling station to vote in local elections in central LondonBoris Johnson leaves after voting in LondonLiberal Democrats leader Vince Cable with his wife Rachel at Twickenham polling station A man enters a polling station as voting begins in local government elections in LondonA man fixes a sign to the door of a polling station as voting begins in local government elections in LondonA poll clerk hangs a polling station sign outside the Victoria and Jubilee Halls in Hartley Wintney, Hampshire, some 45 miles west of LondonVoters at The Vyne polling station in Knaphill, part of the Woking borough, which is one of five councils working with the Cabinet Office to trial the use of ID in polling stationsA government spokesperson insisted the pilots had been a “success”.“Voter ID is an important step to ensuring the public can have greater confidence in our democratic system and the success of yesterday’s pilots proves that this is a reasonable and proportionate measure to take,” he said.“The overwhelming majority of people cast their vote without a problem. We will evaluate the pilots before announcing the next steps in delivering voter ID nationally. As well as this, the independent Electoral Commission will conduct a planned evaluation of the pilots.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Mr Pashinyan was always a charismatic leader, they say, with unlimited energy, righteousness, and an appreciation for troublemaking.Born in the regional town of Ijevan near the north-eastern border with Azerbaijan, Mr Pashinyan moved to the capital Yerevan to study journalism in the early 1990s.He was a straight-A student, one of the brightest in the year, but he never managed to finish his degree. Officially, he was expelled for missing classes, but classmates said he had angered superiors by writing an article, published in a newspaper, alleging corruption. “He was always for the truth,” says Alina Ordyan, who studied with him at Yerevan State University. “Then and now, he believed he was right, and he had the intellect to back it up.” In the late 1990s, Pashinyan became the editor of his own newspaper, Armenian Time. As the country cascaded into authoritarianism over the next decade, his newspaper came to be known as the country’s most fearless. The transition to politics was a natural next step. He began by aligning himself alongside Levon Ter-Petrosyan – Armenia\u0027s first president, from 1991-1998 – who was again standing in the February 2008 presidential elections.Mr Ter-Petrosyan\u0027s bid was unsuccessful, and he lost to Republican Party chairman Serzh Sargsyan in a disputed vote.Pashinyan led protests against it – protests that were only dispersed violently on 1 March, culminating in 10 deaths. The former journalist was forced into hiding for several months. The shadow of 2008 has loomed large over Armenia’s latest uprising. Throughout his campaign to remove Sargsyan from government, Pashinyan has referred to the need for a proper investigation and punishment into the deaths. On 22 April, at a critical crossroads in the revolution, Sargsyan also made an ill-advised reference to the events. He warned the protest leader that he had “not learned the lessons of March 1.” People interpreted that thinly-veiled threat as a confession, says opposition activist Mikayel Hovhannisyan. And it was an easy rallying call.“People who had never been to a demonstration before came out on street only because of that sentence,” he said.  Supporters of protest leader Nikol Pashinyan attend a rally in downtown Yerevan on 1 May (AFP)Later that day, a record number of protestors gathered on Yerevan’s Republic Square.Pashinyan, two fellow opposition MPs, and 200 others were removed from the crowd and arrested. But under intense pressure, the very next day, Sargsyan relented, released them and resigned. “Nikol Pashinyan was right. I was wrong,” Sargsyan wrote in his dramatic final statement. Pashinyan, who in the space of a couple of weeks emerged as the undisputed leader of the masses, pushed for the absolute capitulation of Mr Sargsyan’s party.With the power of the street behind him, he had political momentum. But on Tuesday, the ruling Republican Party pushed back by blocking his candidacy for prime minister. The protest leader responded by orchestrating a national shut-down the very next day. This seems to have quickly changed minds inside the ruling party. Leading figures in the Republican Party were already conceding defeat when contacted by The Independent on Wednesday morning. One of Pashinyan’s leading critics, Armen Ashotyan, vice chair of the Republican Party, contended that it would have been “political hypocrisy” to have supported Mr Pashinyan’s candidacy in his initial bid.Yet, they will now back him, he said, at the second vote, scheduled for this coming Tuesday – but only after “defending the institution of opposition.” Footage from the scene of a major protest in Armenia following transport shutdown“Pashinyan’s main success was choosing the right moment,” says political analyst Mikael Zolyan.His decision to begin the protest at the point where Sargsyan attempted to transition from president to prime minister was a masterstroke, he said: “He knew when to strike – in a power vacuum – and when Sargsyan could give the order to crush, it was already too late.” Pashinyan has also managed to come to power while giving little away on his actual political programme.In parliament on 1 May, the former journalist said he would not describe himself according to old isions of left and right, which “no longer worked.” World news in picturesWorld news in picturesRussian police carrying struggling opposition leader Alexei Navalny at a demonstration against President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.

Adult victims of alcohol-fuelled violence in the home are more isolated and less able to seek help. And in 51 per cent of violent incidents between strangers, the offender was drunk. The new strategy will focus on how to protect vulnerable people from the impact of alcohol-related violence, how to help high-risk drinkers change their behaviour and how to better manage the licensing system. The strategy would look at ways to boost the Government\u0026rsquos Domestic Abuse Bill and its new helpline for children living with alcohol dependent parents.

Margaret Thatcher sent two aircraft carriers – HMS Hermes and HMS Invincible – to help take back the Falklands in 1982.They were accompanied by an array of British destroyers, frigates and subs. A new £3.5 billion HMS Queen Elizabeth carrier is nearing the end of its trials and a second HMS Prince of Wales is still under construction.But critics claim at least ten more escort ships are also needed. Challenged yesterday, Sir Mark signalled the intention was only ever to use both carriers as part of an international taskforce when they are operational.Speaking to MPs on the cross-party Defence Committee, he said: “We will see what happens in the circumstances but that is part of the thinking about the use of the carriers“It is projecting them as a British sovereign capability but one that will almost inevitably - I would actually say inevitably - be used in a context of allied operations of some kind if used in a contested environment.”Lord West said it was clear the Government need to “put its money where its mouth is”. “I have always said we should have 30 escorts – indeed that number came out of the Strategic Defence Review in 1998. We have 19.”He stormed: “There may well be an occasion where we have to do something on our own. We would cobble together whatever taskforce we could. But we haven’t spent enough on escorts.”Downing Street last night insisted that Britain’s Navy did have enough ships.A spokesman said: “We are clear that our aircraft carriers are a sovereign capability and that we have the ships to allow them to deploy independently.“What the National Security Adviser was saying was that we are a member of Nato and have close defence relationships with allies and so such a scenario is unlikely.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A vibrant metropolis, at ease with its diverse, tolerant self.A shining example to the world of how folk from different backgrounds and cultures can rub along together.At least, that’s what we’re invited to believe. But the truth is this depiction of our capital city is not one recognised by millions of its citizens. That’s because London is, in fact, a tale of two cities.There are the gentrified hotbeds of liberal cosmopolitanism — the Islingtons and Camdens — top-heavy with the professional classes and cultural elites, the type of areas that were a bedrock of Remain support in the EU referendum.But then there are those places outside the bubble. On the one hand the grittier, traditional working-class areas — the Canning Towns and Bermondseys — populated by those steamrollered by globalisation, for whom austerity and mass immigration have exacerbated the problems of low wages, poor housing and under-pressure public services.On the other, the middle-class suburbs — the Upminsters and Eastcotes — inhabited by those who sense that their “small c” conservatism is increasingly incongruous with the image of their city as a beacon of progressive modernity.It is between these places that a new and unintended coalition has emerged, born out of resentment at having  to watch their old-fashioned, socially conservative — what some describe as “faith, family and flag” — views shunned and disparaged by the liberal elite.You can see something similar writ large across England: An accidental alliance between once-loyal Labour voters in the post-industrial towns and Conservatives in the shires.It’s an alliance which manifested itself most starkly in the Brexit vote.For the Londoners that fall within these groups, their city is not the harmonious and cohesive ideal seen through the eyes of the chattering classes.It is, instead, a place increasingly atomised, where millions feel a diminishing sense of belonging and in which entire communities within a few hundred yards of each other live utterly parallel lives.Take, for example, the borough in which I grew up, Barking and Dagenham.As working-class as it gets, it was once the very essence of a traditional Labour heartland. Never affluent, but stable, close-knit and settled.Centred around a sprawling 1930s council estate and with generally healthy levels of employment — the dominant Ford factory being at the heart of local industry — Barking and Dagenham enjoyed its steady constancy, its social and cultural familiarity.For those short on money and opportunity, the concepts of place, belonging, identity and relationships take on so much more meaning.But then things changed. Over a few very short years, around the turn of the century, there was a sizeable influx of migrants, precipitating rapid social and cultural transformation.The demographic convulsions meant stable, settled Barking and Dagenham found itself in the eye of the storm of the debate over mass immigration.The indigenous population cried out for respite. The letters page of the local paper was filled with correspondents begging to be heard. But nobody in power took a blind bit of notice, other than to patronise them with trite arguments about improved GDP and cultural enrichment.Rather than rally to their support, the Left — including, shamefully, the Labour Party and trade unions — treated these marginalised working-class folk like an embarrassing elderly relative, imploring them to “stop blaming migrants” (something they hadn’t done in the first place).What was genuine bewilderment and disorientation on the part of local citizens was, inexcusably, dismissed as casual racism and bigotry.Yet it wasn’t their sense of race that had been violated by the sudden upheaval in their community. It was their sense of order.So, in 2006, locals took the only route of protest they thought left available to them and returned  12 British National Party councillors at the local elections.The noxious far-Right, which previously had never gained a foothold in the borough (though it had penetrated areas close by) now formed the official opposition on Barking and Dagenham council, not because thousands of locals had overnight turned into vile racists, but because they had repeatedly been ignored by a tin-eared establishment.But even then, nothing changed. Locals were told to get with the zeitgeist.Women in their eighties who had lived in the borough for most of their lives, had raised  families there and in many cases now lived a life of lonely isolation, were told to embrace the vibrancy of the new multiculturalism.That was the level of condescension to which the liberal establishment had sunkSo thousands of people simply upped sticks and left. In the first decade of the new century, Barking and Dagenham experienced a vast exodus of families who had been rooted in its streets, workplaces and  institutions for generations.It was the only home that many had ever known, but they went all the same. They departed for the Essex coast or Kent. It wasn’t “white flight”, for skin colour was irrelevant to most of them.It was, instead, a flight to familiarity.The tragedy was that most of these people never were anti-immigration. They would not have objected to the integration of a modest and manageable number of arrivals over a reasonable period.But the whole debate around immigration has been toxified by what the ruling elites imposed on places such as Barking and Dagenham.They shook a kaleidoscope then stood back in surprise when the pieces didn’t fall exactly where they wanted. Remember all this the next time you hear someone speak of London as the greatest city in the world.Chances are the words are being spoken by a politician or a celebrity or a middle-class liberal from one of the trendier parts of town.For there are, in reality, two Londons. One half — alienated, neglected and resentful — represents a potentially formidable army at the ballot box.Who will speak for it?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well, the customs partnership idea, which would involve the UK collecting tariff revenues on the EU’s behalf, would make the UK a much less attractive country to do trade deals with.To be fully effective, it would also  require the UK  to essentially copy all EU regulations on goods.With the scheme also leading to the European Court of Justice getting involved in Britain’s affairs, it would not be “taking back control”.But even after the remarkable rebuff it received from the Brexit inner Cabinet on Wednesday, despite the Prime Minister putting her authority on the line by making clear her support for it, No10 won’t give up on the idea. It believes that, with a few changes, it can be made to work.Ministers are now bracing themselves for a huge effort from Theresa May’s allies to get them to change their minds.Already, No10 is telling ministers that what really matters is getting out, and that once the UK is no longer a member of the EU, all these problems can be ironed out at a later date.I understand that one minister has even been warned that the whole Brexit project might collapse without a customs partnership.The argument is that there is “no deal” without a customs partnership, which the Government views as being  key to solving the Irish border question.Without a deal, Parliament could turn on Brexit.The Chief Whip has also told Cabinet colleagues that he hasn’t got the votes to defeat a customs union amendment in the Commons. So, the best way to see that off is to embrace a customs partnership instead.But the local election results show that the Tory vote is becoming more and more Leave dominated. Number crunchers estimate that 70 per cent of Tory voters are leavers.As one influential Tory warns, this means that if Mrs May loses Brexit Secretary David Davis or Boris Johnson from the Cabinet over the customs partnership “and is seen to be selling out Brexit, the Tories will be utterly screwed electorally”.Another problem with the customs partnership idea is the message it sends the EU.As one insider tells me: “The EU is trying to force us into a false choice between a customs union and no deal — and we’re encouraging that by not being clear enough in our negotiating position.”Rather than trying to pressure ministers into backing her customs partnership idea, Mrs May should tell the  EU she wants a free trade  deal with sensible customs arrangements that keeps red tape to a minimum.Once she has been clear, she might find the EU more willing to negotiate.THE country is there for the taking. The local election results show neither Labour nor the Tories are able to break the political stalemate.If these results were replicated at a General Election, we would have another hung parliament.It is easy to declare that the country is permanently split, and that’s why no party can win a big majority. But I don’t think that’s right.Rather, the problem is that neither Labour nor the Tories are capable of reaching out.If Labour was led by a working-class leader from the Midlands who stood up for the country, then they would be on course for a proper majority. Equally, if the Tories were led by a Brexiteer whose upbeat, optimistic vision could appeal in Remain areas then they would be beating Corbyn comfortably.  Indeed, these local election results suggest that Labour under Corbyn has stalled – that it hasn’t kept up the progress it made in last year’s General Election.Now, Labour are highly unlikely to change leader before the next election.Jeremy Corbyn and his allies have seized control of the commanding heights of the Labour Party, and the new members who so fervently believe in him wouldn’t back a challenge to him whatever Labour MPs do.But the Tories will almost certainly change their leader before 2022. These results are a reminder that they need to show  they have delivered on Brexit by the time of the next election. Government whips have been calling round to ask Tory MPs what they think of handing the  NHS a funding boost on its 70th birthday in July, and how they would pay for it.These results suggest they would be well advised to portray this money as the beginning of the Brexit dividend for the health service.This might stick in the craw of Tory Remainers, but  voters now expect them to deliver on Brexit promises.When the Tories pick their new leader they need to go for someone with cross-over appeal – someone who can firm up their support among Leave voters but reach out to Remainers too.I am told that Bercow, who is currently under pressure over bullying allegations, doesn’t feel   he can say this publicly. But I am assured that this is his plan. It remains to be seen whether the knowledge that Bercow will go  will curtail calls for him to quit.Many in the Commons feel  the claims against him must be properly investigated if Parliament is to show  it is serious about protecting its  staff. Senior figures in Government are also keen to see the back of  him because they suspect him of encouraging Labour’s use of an arcane procedural device – “a humble address” – to try to winkle embarrassing information out of ministers.PENNY MORDAUNT presented to Cabinet on the gender pay gap this week.She turned in an assured performance less than 24 hours after being appointed minister for women and equalities, telling ministers to demand a plan to close the gender pay gap from the sectors covered by their department.But as one female Cabinet minister points out, no one mentioned the elephant in  the room – the fact that the second most senior woman  in the Cabinet had to quit  her job, only to be replaced by a man.Only five of the 23 full members of the Cabinet are women.  The Government might want to concentrate  on improving this balance before they lecture business any more.PHILIP HAMMOND and Michael Gove are clashing over the powers of the post-Brexit environmental regulator.The Environment Secretary wants it to have the  same power to hold the Government to account that the European Commission  has.  But the Chancellor is sceptical. Senior Treasury figures tell me he does not think it is sensible or necessary to continue these restraints post-Brexit.The dispute is causing some raised eyebrows. One Whitehall source describes it as part of the “constant war” between the pair.  The two obviously disagree on Brexit.But Hammond is also deeply unenthusiastic about Gove’s green agenda.James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We hope the PM and her ­europhile backbench rebels realise it.Some half-baked customs compromise, or another forced on it by a ­Commons vote, will be a knife to the Government’s jugular and hand Ukip an unlikely route back from the dead.Some argue that voters couldn’t care less about the customs union. But wait till they realise that staying in one ends our newly-won independence as a  trading nation and locks us for ever into voiceless subservience to the EU.Brexit voters would be merciless.So Mrs May MUST heed her Cabinet Brexiters over her Remainer aides, dump her foolish “customs partnership” fudge and face her rebels down. She must then challenge the EU to get serious about solving the Irish border issue.Millions of Tory votes count on it.The party has a right to celebrate its election victories and improved  campaigning team. But it also has to recognise the precarious position it’s in.The ­Government is in a state of paralysis. It must start offering something positive to Remainers — especially those under 47 who lean towards Labour.Jeremy Corbyn’s vision is economically insane, but at least he has one. The Government must make the case for capitalism over socialism and give younger voters a real stake in it. A huge increase in affordable homes is vital.The Tories cannot survive on Brexit alone.AT long last voters have given Corbyn’s toxic party the bloody nose it deserves.Its rampant anti-Semitism killed it in Barnet. Maybe lefties’ racist barracking of new Home Secretary Sajid Javid online cost Labour elsewhere. Corbyn’s excuses for Russia and Assad didn’t help.Nor do voters like being hectored in public by arrogant young Corbyn cultists convinced of their own moral superiority.Brexit-backers, meanwhile, know Labour cannot be trusted. Especially not while it supports staying in a customs union.WHY did it take so long to reprieve brave Afghan interpreters from deportation and let them stay here without paying a penny?It was blatantly unfair on people who  served our country.

Being in the second camp did not foster any sense of belonging, Ms Gosling told the High Court.If a staff member gets pregnant, they dont have to hide it for fear they might lose their work. My periods of time off for the birth of each of my three children were 12 weeks, nine weeks and 13 weeks because I could not afford to take longer off unpaid.She later told how in 2001, when pregnant with her first child, she was called by somebody running the news rota saying as they couldnt find cover she was needed for cover on her due date.Ms Gosling, who felt vulnerable being pregnant without a staff job, agreed.Then while heavily pregnant with her third child in 2007 she received an email from bosses saying they wished to sever her contract and start a new one once she returned, at a cheaper rate.Earlier she told tribunal judges how she felt she had no choice but to set up a company in order to continue presenting for the BBC.Gosling, David Eades and Tim Willcox are challenging income tax and national insurance demands from Her Majestys Revenue and Customs (HMRC) officials at a specialist tribunal hearing in London.The dispute centres on terms of employment.

I have osteoarthritis and cannot work. If I have to buy new school shoes, I decide what bills I can’t pay.I shared a bed with Emilia for more than two years and in that time I barely slept. Every time she moved, I’d wake up and it took me hours to get back to sleep. In November 2017, I was referred to the charity by my support worker.Within days, I received a message about a bed that was going to be delivered. The charity was a lifeline for me and Emilia.I know so many families in need – one friend puts her three children to sleep in a single bed each night. Children shouldn’t be living this way.Thankfully Emilia now has the space to dream. Without Buttle UK this wouldn’t have happened.FOR 18 months, Sylvia Johnson, 35, woke up in the morning to find her youngest son Daniel, 11, lying on the floor in a sleeping bag.His big brother, Quentin, 13, would be curled up on the sofa, groggy and irritable after a terrible night’s sleep.With no money to replace her two boys’ broken beds, Sylvia – who suffers from rheumatic pain and cannot work – felt like she was not doing her job properly as a mother.Sylvia, of St Austell, Cornwall, says:MY children had third-hand beds that became unbearable for them. So Quentin felt happier sleeping on the sofa, while Daniel chose to sleep on the floor.He’d pile cushions on top of one another to make it more comfortable and fell asleep in a sleeping bag. Quentin was angry and irritable and the two of them would argue all the time because they were so tired.Both are bright and their schoolwork suffered. They were constantly late for school and Quentin started to take time off because he was so exhausted. His mood suffered and he started to get depressed.Every night, I was so stressed. I didn’t know where Daniel was going to sleep – the chair or the floor? I knew I had to tell someone but I was scared and felt like I wasn’t doing my job. I worried people would judge me or take my kids away.But I was losing my mind so I told the school and was referred to the charity in June last year. I know people take having a bed for granted but sleep is so important to a child’s health and education.Now with their new beds, Quentin is in the top set for maths, science and English.My sons have their own space and don’t argue anywhere near as much.It’s not shameful to need help and to ask for it. Some people think there’s no such thing as poverty in this country but they have no idea.This gift has changed our lives. Because someone was willing to help me and not judge us, I’ve been able to ask for help in other areas of my life.SINGLE mum Emma Ross couldn’t afford to replace her sons’ bunk beds when they broke last year.Emma, 38, was forced to share a bed with her sons Daniel, 13, and Christopher, six, for four weeks, while daughter Emily, 11, slept in the room next door. The barber, from Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, says: WHEN we moved house last November, the boys’ bunk beds got damaged. When you’re a single parent who works part-time, you allow for day-to-day expenses but not that kind of money.The three of us slept in my bed for four weeks and it was a nightmare.Daniel was grumpy when he woke up and teachers started to notice how tired Christopher was at school. I couldn’t tell them the truth so I just said he was going to bed too late.Daniel moved in with my ­parents until I was able to sort out a new bed. I got in touch with Buttle UK and they delivered new bunk beds within four weeks.I felt as if a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders. The kids were over the moon and now wake up fresh for school.MUM-of-one Siobhan Flynn, 32, shared a bed with her nine-year-old son Joseph for almost a year after she could not afford to replace his broken one.Siobhan, who lives near Rochester, Kent, says:JOSEPH has autism. Sometimes I don’t think he knows why he doesn’t want to do something and he finds it hard to verbalise his needs. He had barely slept in his own bed when it broke in August 2016. It was poorly made and uncomfortable, and Joseph refused to sleep in it.I’d ask him questions and jokingly say, “Even Superman sleeps in his own bed,” but he found it difficult to be there alone. The company refused to replace his bed and wanted to send an engineer to check if there was a fault. But I was worried they would tear it apart and leave it in a worse condition, so I refused.I didn’t have enough money to buy another so Joseph ended up in bed with me. It was hard. He’d hog the covers and I’d always end up with no space, with either an arm or leg thrown over me, and it affected our sleep.Joseph finds it difficult to go to sleep at a normal time and usually drifts off around midnight. It doesn’t matter if I read him a story, put him in his pyjamas or give him a nice bath, Joseph reminds me of a mobile phone battery. He’s not going to switch off at 25 per cent, he needs to wind down completely. He is often tired at school and has fallen asleep in class but I can’t force him to go to sleep.It was almost a year living like this before I applied for a new bed and mattress – and I don’t know what I would have done ­without the charity’s help. Perhaps I’d still be in the same position because £400 for a new bed and mattress is a huge amount of money to me.There were no other options. Nowadays, Joseph still doesn’t sleep in his own bed as much as I would like.He doesn’t like being alone and hates the dark but it’s important he feels ­independent. Knowing he has his own safe and secure bed to sleep in is a huge relief. Kids need breathing 7 space of their own.THERE are three ways to get involved with our Beds for Kids campaign – and YOUR support will make all the difference.FOR every bed or mattress bought from Dreams Beds stores across the country, one will be donated to Chances for Children.READERS can also donate directly to the charity through the Beds for Kids page at mydonate.bt/charities/bedsforkids or via your Sun Savers wallet.YOU can also buy a copy of the specially created book, That’s No Place To Sleep.   Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was so miserable I even contemplated ending it all.“I’ve given up on my dad and the pain that he causes and I’m starting to build a life for myself.”In a heartbreaking interview, Taylor-Ann, a delivery driver, reveals how “Rocket” Ronnie has seen her just ten times in 21 years, despite living just TEN miles from her in Essex.She also told how Ronnie, who is worth £8million, cut her £1,000-a-month maintenance payments after accusing her of treating him like a cash machine — and claimed he branded her a “cokehead”.He also offered ZERO help in her recovery, even though Ronnie checked himself into rehab in 2000 for drug and alcohol addiction.That lack of support left Taylor-Ann hurt and bewildered.She said: “I thought of all the people in the world he would understand better than most how I struggled with depression and how I’d turned to drink and drugs.People had helped him recover and forgiven him but he was clearly writing me off.”Growing up, Taylor-Ann saw very little of Ronnie, who last weekend crashed out of this year’s Snooker World Championships in the second round.Taylor-Ann’s mum, Sally Ann, discovered she was pregnant just weeks after an acrimonious split with Ronnie in 1996.Taylor-Ann says: “When I look back our relationship was tragic. I used to google my dad when I was little. I’d screen-shot pictures of him and compare them to ones of me to see if I resembled him. I was desperate for his attention.“I haven’t watched him play since I was four. He promised he’d wave to me from the telly and I watched a whole tournament just waiting for my special wave. It never came and I was heartbroken.”But with no real understanding of her dad’s true character, Taylor-Ann was not prepared for the blow that sent her life reeling in 2013, when she was just 17.She explained: “I’d got a place at college to do business studies. As it was too far to commute my mum helped me find a flat. I was thrilled. I loved the course and got distinctions in the first year. I was so excited about telling Dad so I met him in a cafe.“I told him Mum had transferred the £1,080 per month maintenance he paid to her into my bank to cover my rent, bills and college fees.“He seemed a bit surprised. He raised an eyebrow and said, ‘That’s what you use it for?’ I hit back, saying, ‘I just want my dad’.“He smiled and nodded. I asked him to stay in touch. I remember saying a phone call every couple of months would be plenty. It was pathetic, really, looking back. But then I had no idea what was about to happen.”She claims that after dropping her home, Ronnie severed all contact and immediately stopped the payments.She said: “He’d stopped paying the court-ordered amount. I couldn’t believe it, especially when he knew it was covering my rent and college fees.”Unable to pay her rent, Taylor-Ann lost her home and was forced to drop out of college — before the courts had time to order Ronnie to cough up the arrears. He later resumed the payments — but the damage had been done.Taylor-Ann said: “I became depressed by what had happened and started drinking heavily to forget how miserable I was. I lost my driving licence for speeding, my job, and doing cocaine became a regular thing.“To be honest I didn’t really care. I just wanted to blot out the pain my dad had caused. Several times I thought about just ending my life and the whole sorry mess.”Taylor-Ann, from Redbridge, Essex, claims she had no contact with dad-of-three Ronnie, who is now dating Holby City actress Laila Rouass, 46, for years before texting him in 2016.She said: “I hadn’t called him or spoken to him for three years. It felt like we were finally building bridges“I wasn’t even sure of his number but just sent a text saying, ‘Hi Dad’ and he replied, ‘All right mate’. Even that was difficult. I didn’t want to be his mate, I’m his daughter.“To be fair, we did have a long chat on the phone a few days later. We caught up on everything that had happened to both of us. He sounded like he cared then.“We talked a couple more times on the phone over the next few months. It felt we were finally building bridges.”They even went out for a Thai meal last March with his children from another relationship Lily, now 12, and little Ronnie, ten.She said: “It was lovely to see my brother and sister. I really love them and am happy and grateful that they have a better relationship with their dad than I do. I confided in Dad about my problems.“He offered to pay for me to re-take my driving test and get my licence back. He could see how touched I was by the offer and even said, ‘Look, it’s not just you I ignore when things get difficult — I do it to Lily when she gets demanding’.“I think he was trying to make me feel better — in a clumsy way. I was grateful and managed to ask why he’d stopped paying my maintenance the year before.“His reply stunned me. He said, ‘You know Taylor-Ann, I’ve gone through life with people treating me like an ATM machine. Why should I keep paying? What do I get out of it?’”She found Ronnie’s hard love a shock and was more confused when he sent her a text that night. She said: “He sent me a really lovely message. He said he was proud of me for recognising my problems and attempting to deal with them.“I immediately forgot his harsh words earlier and was so delighted that he’d said he was proud of me. It was one of the few times he’d paid me a compliment in my life.”But the relationship took a terrible turn when Taylor-Ann — who had still not kicked her drug issue — went on a night out with a mutual friend of Ronnie’s.During a cocaine binge, the friend told Taylor-Ann her dad had warned the rest of the family to sever all ties with her. She said: “I was so hurt, so upset. I had no idea whether it was true. At some point the person I was with rang my dad and started having a go at him.“She had the phone on speaker and I heard my dad say, ‘You pair of cokeheads need help’.“I just broke down and sobbed because he obviously wasn’t going to help me. I tried to contact him to explain but it seemed he no longer wanted to know.”A few days later — in March last year — a broken Taylor-Ann checked into a rehab centre for cocaine addiction. But she claims at no point did her dad visit, call or even message to ask how she was.Just days after coming out of rehab she landed a new job at a car parts firm, where she met her boyfriend — and father of her child — Naihan Chowdhury, 21. The pair are now sharing a one-bed flat in Romford, Essex.Taylor-Ann, whose baby is due in October, said: “We don’t have a lot but we have everything a baby needs — two parents that love it and want to cherish and care for it.“Naihan is the same age as my dad was when I was born, but I already know he’s going to be a better dad than Ronnie ever was because he’s here and helping. I wish Dad had been there for me but he wasn’t, all I ever wanted was his love. I’ll make sure we learn from all the mistakes he made with me.”Ronnie declined to comment on Taylor-Ann’s claims.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We work aggressively to ensure that we do not have terrorists or terror groups using the site, and we also remove any content that praises or supports terrorism.Our approach is working – 99 per cent of ISIS and Al Qaeda-related content we remove is found by our automated systems. But there is no easy technical fix to fight online extremism."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000403689862.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"john bercow likened harvey weinstein black rod","story":"A former House of Commons official says the Speaker had “stepped over the line”.Mr Bercow is resisting calls to step down over bullying allegations which he denies.Former Black Rod David Leakey — who worked with him — said: “John Bercow is not an altogether bad Speaker.

Four-year-old Prince George does not appear in the latest photographs.The duchess\u0027s eye for photography was recognised last year after the Royal Photographic Society gave her a lifetime honorary membership for her \"talent and enthusiasm\".The 36-year-old, a history of art graduate, bucked tradition in 2015 when she took the official photos of Charlotte when she was born.In those pictures, the princess is seen being cradled by her older brother at Anmer Hall - their home in Norfolk.The latest photos mark a busy period for the Royal Family, with Prince Louis\u0027s uncle, Prince Harry, set to marry Meghan Markle later this month. :: Sky News will broadcast live in Windsor the week before the royal wedding with all the build up to the big day, with exclusive live coverage of the wedding in UHD in a special programme \u0026#8234from 9am to 3pm on Sky News and Sky One \u0026#8234on Saturday 19 May."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/04/2048x1152/skynews-meghan-markle-prince-harry_4292390.jpg?20180425153030 ","title":"royal wedding meghan markles family woes make the whole thing a bit more relatable","story":"It has led to suggestions her dad wouldn\u0027t be at the wedding, that they aren\u0027t close, and he wouldn\u0027t walk her down the aisle, but the couple have squashed those rumours by announcing that both Thomas and Doria will have important roles on the big day.There is of course the often slightly awkward \"meeting of the in laws\" moment especially if divorced parents are involved.I think most of us can sympathise with that cue artificial small talk or general banter about what your daughter was like as a baby. But this transatlantic relationship has meant that for Harry and Meghan that meeting has been delayed for longer than you\u0027d normally expect, with the Markles and the Windsors only getting together for the first time in the week running up to the wedding.The mud-slinging from Meghan\u0027s half siblings must have been another difficult thing for her to deal with, and another sign that it isn\u0027t all happy families.An open letter from her half brother Thomas Junior suggesting Harry should walk away from the wedding was astonishing.But again it\u0027s been a reminder that actually this Royal romance has had its hurdles."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-papers-sunday_4302037.jpg?20180505220218 ","title":"why today is a day you should laugh","story":"Modern day chimps - genetically our closest animal relatives - produce similar sounds in rough play, which some have interpreted as an indicator that the games are not genuinely aggressive.Unlike other verbal utterances, laughing does not use many of the muscles associated with speech, but involves many changes in breath pressure and facial expression, suggesting its origins are much older than our ability to speak.Instead, during exuberant laughter, thoughts and emotions trigger the muscles of the arms, legs and abdomen in an often uncontrollable display.Experts have long noted that when we laugh with others, it creates social bonds, as we recognise we are experiencing similar emotions to our immediate neighbours.Indeed, possibly because it predates speech, it can bring people together even if they don\u0027t speak the same language, with one recent study finding it was the only thing understood by an African culture when they heard recorded Britons chatting.Three decades ago, a doctor in India became convinced that the reflex action that causes us to go \"ha, ha, ha\", had consequences beyond merely the sound it made or the relations it smoothed.Dr Madan Kataria used traditional Indian practices to create a new form of exercise, called laughter yoga, which aimed to help people come together and feel better.World Laughter Day sprung from his research, in a bid to get increasing numbers of people taking advantage of its benefits. Odette Kurland, who as the founder of Laughter Yoga Wellness London is one of the organisers of some of the day\u0027s events in the capital, is keen to extol what she believes it offers.She told Sky News World Laughter Day was founded on the idea that getting people to laugh together can help promote world peace.\"Dr Katari was a medical doctor who found evidence that the body cannot tell the difference between real and simulated laughter through yoga.\"He got together with a group of friends in Mumbai to get people to laugh because the benefits are fantastic.\"Laughter yoga involves using a combination of deep breathing exercises and voluntarily moving the diaphragm to force laughter when someone exhales.When within a group, it often causes involuntary laughter.Ms Kurland, who also practises under the nickname Lady Ha Ha, says that causes the brain to produce chemicals that have positive effects. She claims it can be used to treat bipolar disorder, depression and even chronic pain.\"When you laugh, the endorphins you release are stronger and more powerful that morphine.\"People with chronic pain who have done laughter yoga sessions have told me it has been the first time they have felt no pain for a long time.\"Dr Sophie Scott, a cognitive neuroscientist at the Speech Communication Lab, University College London, says: \"It\u0027s true that there are measurable benefits for pain, but that is entirely due to the exercise that you are doing.\"It would be the same if you were running on the spot. You do get a decrease in adrenaline and a decrease in cortisol, the stress hormone.\"You get an impact on brain chemistry, you feel better.\"But there is no evidence that there are health benefits beyond that.\"She says that she knew of people who could in fact experience the opposite effect, by being made to laugh when they don\u0027t want to.\"Many people won\u0027t laugh at any time. They feel awkward. I know people who hate laughter yoga for that reason. One friend, his cortisol actually rose. When I tried it, I got a migraine.\"The effects of involuntary laughter are wider, however.Dr Scott says: \"There is evidence that married couples, for example, who deal with stress with laughter, stay together longer. \"But it\u0027s not limited to those in romantic relationships. Its importance as a behaviour cannot be understated. It depends on the social context.\"I also know people who do not like to go to stand up comedy because they don\u0027t want to be forced to laugh.\"What\u0027s clear is that in order for people to laugh, they need to be with others and people they feel comfortable with - jokes are not enough.But, Dr Scott has no doubt about its benefits, whatever makes you titter, chuckle, snort or guffaw.\"We learn the importance of laughter very early. Babies have been found to pay attention to their parents\u0027 laughter to determine whether a situation is safe. They do that long before they have language.\"It\u0027s also been found, in research on psychopathy, that children who show the early traits do not join in (with laughter) when in groups.\"When you think about it, it only ever exists in social situations. You don\u0027t really laugh when you are on your own.\"We\u0027ve ignored it for too long but we are slowly learning about how important it is.\""}]
