The House of MinaLima gallery holds the work of the graphic design studio which created most of the props from the Harry Potter films including spellbooks, the Daily Prophet newspaper, tickets and posters. The Marauders Map covers the floor in the gallery’s exquisitely designed rooms. The House started as a pop-up in 2017 but looks here to stay – a second gallery has now opened in Japan.MinaLima is named after cofounders Miraphora Mina and Eduardo Lima. Mina graduated in Theatre Design from Central Saint Martins and entered the Potter universe in 2000, when the production designer she worked for was hired for the first big-screen adaptation of JK Rowling’s beloved books.By the time the second film started production, Lima had moved to London after graduating from Brazil’s Pontifical Catholic University, and was put in touch with Mina, through a family friend, for work experience. “We’ve been together since then,” says Mina. “It was a symbiotic moment of realising we had the same aesthetic, the same sense of humour and approach to design.”The two founded the MinaLima studio in 2009 and worked on all the Potter films, shaping the way the world saw the wizarding universe. Now they’re working on the Fantastic Beasts film series, as well as designing a new kind of magical book: exquisite, illustrated pop-up fairy tales. This month Pinocchio becomes the seventh book in the MinaLima book collection, on a list including Peter Pan, The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast.“We were tasked by Harper Collins roughly 10 years ago to do a celebration book of Harry Potter and blindly said yes,” explains Mina. The fairytales come from that. For each, they consider what a book would look like in the character’s world. Pinocchio has a whimsical wood theme, as though the pages were made in Geppetto’s workshop. There’s wood block on most pages and the folio numbers are decorated with little tools.An integral part of the process is producing a white model – a book with blank pages that serves as a proof of concept to ensure all the moving parts function properly. “It’s a dextrous, 3D process”, says Mina. “You’re blocking out the flow of the story.” As for what goes in the book, Eduardo adds: “In Pinocchio, we could not miss that one moment he’s inside the shark!”The MinaLima Classics edition of The Adventures of Pinocchio is published by Harper Design"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/754e39bf1a4be56233d2ce3ff4caa717d1dbe2e4/0_191_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96fdf4215baebe9bce01104237e6ff1c","title":"margaret atwoods lockdown diary life as an eccentric self isolationist","story":"How to make firelighters, combat squirrels and conduct a rubber chicken choir … the author shares practical tips from lockdown in CanadaAs the first world war dragged on, volunteer women’s groups of all kinds formed in aid of the troops in the trenches: bandage rolling, preserved foods box packing, knitting. My grandmother joined a knitting group in rural Nova Scotia. You started on washcloths, progressed to scarves then, if you were sufficiently adroit, you moved on to balaclavas and socks, and ultimately – the pinnacle! – to gloves. My grandmother was a terrible knitter. She never got beyond washcloths.I’ve often wondered about these knitting groups. What were they for, really? Were they providing much-needed knitted items, or were they boosting morale by giving a bunch of otherwise very anxious civilians, whose sons and husbands were in jeopardy, something to do with their hands while waiting, waiting, endlessly waiting? I can see the socks and gloves making it to the frontlines, but the washcloths? Photographs of muddy, cramped, stinky trench life don’t show much washing going on. And my grandmother’s wonky, hole-filled washcloths in particular – were they sent to a secret depot where they were unraveled, and their wool reclaimed for something more functional?So, in the spirit of my grandmother’s washcloths – not ultimately useful, perhaps, but let’s hope they focused the mind and gave a sense of accomplishment – I present some of my more bizarre self-isolation activities. You can do some of them at home. Though perhaps you won’t wish to.I won’t bother with the photo sorting, the purging of old files, the delving into storage trunks, the wonderment at some of the things found there – why did I save that, and what exactly is it? – or the reading of letters from boyfriends long gone now, or bald. I expect we are all doing something like that. Or the gardening, which would have happened anyway. Or the return to baking, something I used to do at industrial volume when there were teenagers around, and have made a tentative return to. Instead, I’ll move straight to the fire starters made from dryer lint, egg cartons and candle ends. Why should these clutter up landfill sites when you can make fire starters from them instead? The method was given to me by a group of female bush pilots who took me out to breakfast in Whitehorse, the Yukon, back in the 1990s, and I’ve been making them ever since. They are popular holiday gifts among certain of my easily pleased family members.Here’s what you do. Collect the lint from your dryer. Collect egg cartons, the cardboard variety. Collect candle ends. Stuff the lint into the pockets of the egg cartons. Melt the candle ends in a metal container kept for that purpose and set in a larger pan of boiling water. Do not melt them directly over an open flame. Pour the melted wax over the lint. When hardened, cut into cubes. To quote the bush pilots, who never took off for a flight into the trackless wilderness without some, just in case their plane went down: “Best damn fire starter you ever saw!”Another activity I’ve been doing lately is squirrel foiling. Hear a gnawing sound in the ceiling? These are your choices, in this part of the world: raccoons, possums, rats, squirrels, Google Earth. Probably squirrels, I thought, and so it proved to be. At first I foiled them by playing hot jazz and acid rock right under their gnawing station, but they got used to the wailing and screaming, so I climbed up a stepladder, placed a large steel bowl against the ceiling, and whacked it with a big metal serving spoon. Yes, I know, I shouldn’t have been doing that alone at night – the Younger Generation will scold when they read this – because people my age fall off ladders and break their necks, especially when not holding on because you need two hands for steel bowl banging. I won’t do it again, promise. (Until next time.)The hole having finally been located by the roofer – roofers can work at your house as long as they don’t come inside – I was able to climb out of a window on to a flat part of the roof and stuff the hole with hot pepper powder. (More hand-wringing by the Younger Gen, who kept saying: “Let me do it!” To which I replied: “You’re too big.” This was true – the Younger Gen tends to be taller, thanks to the postwar food glut of the 1950s – but the Younger Gen did help me get back in via a different stepladder. They have long arms.) End of squirrel gnawing. Don’t try this yourself. It’s not a recommendation. (Mad old grannies will do it anyway. I can’t stop them, and you won’t be able to either.)Not to worry. The pest guy came, and locked the squirrels out. Pest guys too (or pest gals) can work at your house as long as they don’t go into it.Those are my ersions. Now we’ll get down to the serious business: the remote events. These are multiplying like mice, since talks, festivals, fundraisers and shows that would once have been analogue, with real physical bodies gathered together in celebration and glee, quaffing, chattering, entertaining and applauding, have all been cancelled, and substitutes have had to be devised. Livestreams, videos, podcasts, radio interviews, FaceTime events in which you have to hold your phone at arms length from your face – all are swarming on to the internet, which has been crashing lately.Mary Beard, the two-fisted Cambridge classicist who understands crises, debacles and pandemics, being an authority on ancient Rome, asked me to do a remote item for the BBC Front Row Late show, which usually reviews theatre but now can’t because there isn’t any. “Just a little something,” she said, “as long as it’s on plagues.” This awakened the Kraken of my deep past – a childhood of reading horror literature, not only the Betty Crocker’s Picture Cookbook for proto-homemakers but also the collected work of Edgar Allan Poe. Who let that into the kiddie section of the library? Well, there isn’t any sex in it: that was probably the excuse and children are so fond of decaying corpses, especially those with all their teeth pulled out, as in “Berenice”. So me and “The Masque of the Red Death” go way back.Add to the mix my early career as a teenage puppeteer, and the fact that my baby sister, Ruth, and I had already watched all of the TV drama series Miss Fisher’s Murder Mysteries, and the devil found work for idle hands to do. We decided to stage “The Masque of the Red Death” using nothing but what could be found in the house. Out came the old Christmas wrapping paper and the saved-up bows and the stainless steel tableware. Prince Prospero is played by a champagne bottle, the courtiers by wine glasses, and the fortified abbey by the knives and forks. Never mind that you can’t go to the West End – you can watch “The Masque of the Red Death” instead. It’s amateur theatre at its most … at its most amateur.Then there was the hastily planned launch of the author-and-book show that will now be streamed regularly by the National Arts Centre in Ottawa, with Canadian authors presenting their spring-list books in one on the few locations available to them. My interlocutor was the honourable Adrienne Clarkson, a former governor general of Canada. We went to the University of Toronto at the same time in the late 50s and early 60s, though she went to Trinity, the Anglican college, and I to Victoria, founded by Methodists. They had gowns, we had moral earnestness. But Adrienne and I both studied  English language and literature, and what better match for a thrown-together online hour in which we discussed a lot of books we didn’t have and hadn’t read, but felt we would like to read? If university teaches you nothing else, it’s how to rabbit on about stuff you don’t actually know anything about. At one point my wifi froze and I had to go running around the house, holding up my device and looking for a signal. Just like the old days.On my plate now is the upcoming online bird extravaganza, a fun-packed substitute for two events we usually do in May at the height of the spring migration: SpringSong, on Pelee Island in the middle of Lake Erie, a stopover on a major flyway, and the Pelee Island Bird Observatory, the bird-banding and educational station on Pelee. We will try to recreate all the features of those two events, including the visiting authors, the Green Bird Race, and the Rubber Chicken Choir. As we’ll be streaming on Facebook Live, you can bring your own rubber chicken, wherever you are, and join in. I am the conductor.Meanwhile, my sister and her sewing machine are hurtling down the highway towards me at the speed of light well, not exactly, but faster than usual due to the scarcity of cars on the road. I have dug out my own ancient sewing machine, and after I’ve oiled it and figured out how to work it again, we are going to sew face masks for health workers. I’ve even found some elastic, in short supply on the ground these days: there must be a lot of face mask sewing going on. The result may be like my grandmother’s washcloths – not perfect, lopsided, but well meant. And, with hope, they will also be functional. Fingers crossed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f47e0c1fe593617e18d14a33d0b1a319e8e6aad7/0_157_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=247856ced2d26f38da3a8ef5e495f0f7","title":"ey ordered pay whistleblower 11m dubai gold audit case","story":"Court rules accountancy firm breached code of ethics in its dealings with a refinerA former partner at the accounting firm EY has been awarded $10.8m (£8.6m) in damages after being forced out of his job when he exposed professional misconduct during an audit of a Dubai gold refiner.The high court in London ruled on Friday that EY had repeatedly breached the code of ethics for professional accountants in its dealings with one of its clients, Kaloti Jewellery International.The claim was brought by Amjad Rihan, who revealed that silver-coated gold had been shipped from Morocco to avoid export restrictions and precious metal obtained from other countries such as Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Iran without due diligence.After telling EY about his concerns, Rihan was ordered back to Dubai but feared for his and his family’s safety. He resigned and subsequently made whistleblowing disclosures in 2014.Mr Justice Kerr found EY had breached its duty to Rihan through failing to perform the Kaloti audit in an ethical and professional manner.The court awarded Rihan a total of $10,843,941 and £117,950 in sterling for damages for past and future loss of earnings, and loss of employment benefits.After the ruling, Rihan said: “Almost seven years of agony for me and my family has come to an end with a total vindication by the court. My life was turned upside down as I was cruelly and harshly punished for insisting on doing my job ethically, professionally and lawfully in relation to the gold audits in Dubai.“The court ruled in my favour and found that EY breached its duties towards me, for which I am very grateful. I hope that EY uses this judgment as an opportunity to improve and take the necessary measures to avoid anything like this ever happening again.”Paul Dowling, a solicitor from law firm Leigh Day who represented Rihan, said: “For years EY has refused to admit any wrongdoing in relation to the Kaloti audit. Instead it accused Mr Rihan of being a liar and a fantasist. Our client’s character and actions have now been completely vindicated by the court.“By contrast it is EY which has been found to have committed serious professional misconduct at the highest echelons of the organisation. This important judgment sends a clear message to would-be whistleblowers that they do not have to tolerate unethical conduct within their organisation, no matter how high up the chain it goes.In his judgment, Kerr said: “Gold is used in the banking industry, for investment purposes in the jewellery industry and in the electronics industry, for manufacturing. It is recognised internationally as being among the ‘conflict minerals’ attractive to criminals and terrorists because it is relatively easy to move and holds its value well.“For these reasons, the importance of good due diligence and regulation in the gold refining industry and other ‘conflict minerals’ trading is emphasised in guidance published by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and in US legislation known as the Dodd-Frank Act. The claimant and his colleagues at EY Dubai and EY MENA saw this as an opportunity to acquire fruitful work producing assurance reporting to gold refiners in Dubai and elsewhere in the region. Kaloti was the most substantial of the Dubai refiners, with the largest market share.”Commenting on the Morocco transactions, Kerr said: “I accept as a fact that the defendants were responsible for suggesting to Kaloti that it should draft its compliance report in a manner that masked the reality of the Morocco gold issue, removing the reference to Morocco and changing the coating of gold bars with silver to documentary irregularities. I regard this as professional misconduct.”An EY spokesperson said: “We are surprised and disappointed by the judge’s decision, its introduction of an unprecedented legal duty and its financial award to a former EY Dubai partner. We will appeal and, therefore, not comment in detail. It was the work of an EY Dubai assurance team that uncovered serious irregularities and reported them to the proper authorities. Their work ultimately resulted in sanctions against the refiner and contributed to significant changes in the sourcing of precious metals and the regulation of refiners in Dubai.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a16d0a4579e9df28986d8a49e4b7c0084222ce4f/0_84_3559_2135/master/3559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f29f4e2cfbcb330796ec6a26b6da65e","title":"us airlines empty planes coronavirus environment","story":"The coronavirus outbreak has provoked a string of unsettling sights, such as the sudden widespread use of masks, shuttered businesses and deserted streets. Another unusual phenomenon is also playing out in the skies – near-empty airplanes flying through the air.Slightly more than half the flights within the US have been canceled, leading to a slew of near-empty flights. Less than one in 10 seats on domestic flights were filled by passengers last week, according to an estimate by Dan Rutherford, aviation director at the International Council on Clean Transportation.“The evidence suggests that the number of people flying is dropping faster than the flights so there are a lot of empty planes,” he said. “The airlines are left to figure this out for themselves and they are playing catch-up.”This situation is leading to a “huge environmental waste”, Rutherford said, as planes burn huge amounts of fuel to transport just a handful of people around America.In March, Sheryl Pardo shared a video of her being upgraded to first class and given a personalized safety briefing after being the only passenger to check in to an American Airlines flight from Washington to Boston. Meanwhile, a Virgin Atlantic flight from London to New York subsequently carried just seven people.However, passenger numbers may well bounce back quickly following the end of the Covid-19 crisis.“You have dips around recessions but within two or three years it returns,” said Rutherford. “I imagine leisure travel will recover pretty quickly. In the boom years, airlines have eased off on attempts to improve fuel efficiency – what was going on was not sustainable. The million-dollar question is whether we will curb flying to protect the climate, as we are now doing to protect public health.”The US airline industry got $25bn in assistance in the recent stimulus package to deal with the sharp downturn in business. In return, the airlines are required to maintain a certain level of service, which may be leading to the near-empty flights.The economics of running an airline can also be counterintuitive in that it can sometimes be cheaper to fly a commercial airliner to a planned destination than pay for a spot to simply park it.“The novel coronavirus pandemic has had, and continues to have, a severe and unprecedented impact on the US airline industry,” a spokeswoman for the lobby group said, adding that flights are also shifting important cargo such as medical supplies, food and mail.Doug Parker, chief executive of American Airlines, said: “Those that are flying today are doing so for important reasons.” A spokesman for United said it was “still somewhat rare” for a single passenger to be on a flight and said that the company had made investments in more sustainable fuel to lower its carbon footprint.The commitment of airlines in general to addressing the climate crisis has been questioned during the coronavirus shutdown, however. Airlines are lobbying to rewrite the rules of a global agreement designed to tackle aviation emissions, with the coronavirus outbreak expected to make its targets tougher to meet.Campaigners accused airlines of attempting to “dodge their obligations”, but the industry said it was “a matter of survival”."},{"url":null,"title":"have you been affected coronavirus anywhere but westminster","story":"For our next episode of Anywhere but Westminster we would like to hear from you As the ’s Anywhere but Westminster video series continues about life in the coronavirus crisis, we want to hear from people directly affected by the illness itself.Do you have the virus right now, and are you enduring self-isolation?

On news programmes and at daily briefings, politicians across the world face versions of the same query again and again: when will the lockdown end? But that’s the wrong question.Imagine a family has escaped a rampaging bear in the woods, seeking refuge in a log cabin. After sheltering there for days and weeks, they’re desperate to know when they can come out. But they wouldn’t simply be asking “When?” They would be asking “When will it be safe?” which is a different and tougher question, one whose answer would depend on several other questions: has the bear been tamed? If it hasn’t, do we have the weapons to destroy it or at least protect ourselves against it? And are those protections strong enough that we won’t have to rush back inside the cabin the moment we’ve ventured out?We should be clear on one thing. Impatience to see an end to this mass, global quarantine is understandable. It’s not just boredom or lack of stamina that prompts it. There are people struggling to put food on the table there are people whose mental health is faltering there are people for whom a day stuck at home is a day stuck with a domestic abuser. For them lockdown is a jail sentence and they need it to end. So of course it makes sense to long for an exit strategy. But it has to begin with an understanding of what lockdown is and what it is not. It’s tempting to see it as a solution: everyone stays at home, we “flatten the curve” and then, slowly and gradually, we lift the restrictions and return to normal. But that’s not how it is. Instead, lockdown is merely the crudest, bluntest instrument we could reach for when the coronavirus first struck. Its primary objective was to keep the number of people infected sufficiently low that the health service could cope. Judged by that standard, preventing, say, the NHS in Britain being overwhelmed, it has succeeded.Read the expert plans, and they all come back to one thing. Sure, social distancing will have to endure, in one form or other, but the key will be the one identified by the World Health Organization at the start: testing, testing, testing.And yet here, too, there is a misconception, and it is one of scale. So far, testing has been limited to those with symptoms and in hospital. But the Nobel laureate Paul Romer – admittedly his prize was for economics rather than epidemiology – has got a lot of attention for a plan that argues that for the economy, and human life, to return to anything like normality, testing will need to be conducted for millions of people, all the time. He imagines health workers being tested at the start of a shift the same would go for care workers, pharmacists, police officers and bus drivers. You might add teachers and restaurant workers. Romer wouldn’t bother testing people who already have symptoms: they should be presumed positive and immediately self-isolate. It’s the “asymptomatic spreaders” you need to identify, stopping them in their tracks. The logic underpinning the plan is clear: there will be no point in reopening shops, pubs and restaurants if people feel too scared to visit them. As virologist Prof Nicolas Locker puts it, “You can’t lift the lockdown as long as you are not testing massively.”Do the maths and the numbers are colossal: Romer estimates some 22m tests would be necessary every day in the US alone, the equivalent of testing every American once every two weeks. Consider that there’s still no sign that Matt Hancock will reach his goal of 100,000 tests a day in the UK, and you realise how many orders of magnitude stand between where we are now and where we would need to be. The obstacles are huge and obvious, though Romer reckons he has answers for all of them. Shortage of swabs? Move to saliva tests instead. Shortage of the key chemicals known as “reagents”? The test kits that rely on them are not the only option. The sheer numbers of tests that would have to be produced? The world’s manufacturers could do it it just requires the political will. Which, given that our lives depend on it, should be there.If that seems daunting, there is another approach. It would still require testing – though not on the same scale – followed by contact tracing: finding all those who’d been in close proximity to someone who’d tested positive and isolating them. “Test, trace, isolate” also has logic on its side, but it, too, takes lots of money and people. It’s thought one contact-tracer is  required for every four cases of infection.That means using the hiatus of lockdown to recruit and train people now in the mechanics of contact tracing. With no leadership from the top – on Thursday Donald Trump effectively announced that the buck stops with the 50 states – the likes of Massachusetts are already assembling their own squads of contact-tracers. San Francisco is doing the same, deploying a combination of librarians and medical students. The UK government could follow their lead immediately, putting to work some of the thousands of people currently at home and itching to help. Tech can play a role, too: note this week’s announcement that Apple and Google will join forces to see if they can produce the app that will make tracing easier and faster, though the threat to privacy of such surveillance is obvious.What specific methods are deployed matter less than the bigger shift that is required, which is one of imagination. Governments need to realise that what’s coming is not a decision about easing this or that rule of social distancing, but rather a massive political, industrial and collective drive unseen since the last war. It may well mean repurposing factories to mass-produce testing kits. At the very least, it should mean a dedicated cabinet minister for testing.This demands a huge shift by the UK government, which wasn’t even testing people coming out of hospital and going into social care until this week. But nothing less will be enough. It’s not enough to flatten the curve we have to get ahead of it. It’s true that we cannot stay in lockdown for ever. But we cannot leave until it’s safe – and that requires a monumental effort, starting right now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91d1f89573af2d10686a1246a92a136a44f670ab/814_87_3134_1881/master/3134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07f6f77411fd7aee8cd1a3cbf3bc6d02","title":"britain one party state tories coronavirus power","story":"Even before coronavirus, today’s Conservatives had a far worse record than the infamous governments of the 1970s. And yet they’re still likely to win another electionNext month the Conservatives will have been in power for 10 years. British parties who manage that anniversary are usually unpopular by the time it comes.In 1989, Margaret Thatcher’s government lost its poll lead for good. By 2007 Tony Blair was no longer a dominant premier. Accumulating mistakes, personal burn-out, the difficulty of finding fresh goals and voters’ boredom with the status quo all usually ensure that even parties with able leaders weaken and fall from power after three or four terms. To a large extent, the UK’s traditional sense of itself as a erse, healthy democracy depends on it.Yet recently our revered political pendulum seems to have stopped swinging. Last year, the Tories won their fourth consecutive general election, by a far larger margin than the others. Since then, their poll lead has swollen further. They are widely expected to win a fifth election, whenever it comes. No British party has done that since the early 1800s.This Tory ascendancy has been maintained despite a record in office since 2010 that is arguably worse than those of the UK’s most infamous modern governments, the overwhelmed Conservative and Labour administrations of the 1970s. The Tories have called and lost the EU referendum, pushed Scotland and Northern Ireland towards leaving the UK, pursued austerity policies that hugely damaged public services and society – without reducing government debt as promised – and presided over the worst wage growth for two centuries. Now they appear to be mishandling coronavirus catastrophically. Labour has never been allowed to forget its smaller failure to halt the winter of discontent, more than 40 years ago, when strikes notoriously delayed the burial of some people who had died of natural causes. After coronavirus, Britain may associate the Conservatives with far worse horrors. But that is not happening yet. Surveys show some mild public disapproval of their performance during the crisis. Yet there remains a general acceptance that, for the foreseeable future, for good or ill, the Tories will be our masters. Such feelings can be self-fulfilling. In 1954, the French sociologist Maurice Duverger wrote: “A dominant party is that which public opinion believes to be dominant.”And Boris Johnson’s administration seems to be seeking a more complete dominance than previous British governments. It demands compliance rather than frankness from Whitehall. It excludes critical journalists from official briefings. It avoids scrutiny by parliament: the Commons has sat for one full month in Johnson’s first 10 as premier. Meanwhile, the Tories have repeatedly claimed to represent “the people”, as if no other party can.In all these ways, the UK may be moving closer to becoming a one-party state. Not a totalitarian one, but a democratic one, like postwar Italy or Japan, where one party is in power for decades, on its own or in coalitions, absorbing ideas and policies from rival parties, shamelessly moving rightwards or leftwards according to circumstances, and winning the pragmatic support of ever more interest groups. The life of a single party – its ideological trajectory, factional struggles and leadership contests – becomes almost the whole of politics.For some voters, one-party democracy is a relief. It saves them having to think much about politics, from having to evaluate other parties. Last year’s Tory victory owed a lot to this impulse: voting in a third general election in four years, some people were tired of having to consider Labour’s alternatives, and settled for what they knew.In the UK, one-party democracy does exist in non-Tory forms – thanks to devolution policies enacted by Labour. Wales has been continuously governed by Labour (sometimes in coalitions) since 1999, Scotland by the SNP since 2007. And concerns about the UK’s tendency to produce democratic monocultures pre-date the present Tory era. Twenty years ago, under Blair, the political scientist Colin Crouch coined the phrase “post-democracy” to describe the contraction of electoral politics to “a small range of issues”, selected “by rival teams of professionals”, while more fundamental questions were settled in private by big business and deferential politicians.In one sense, our democracy is healthier now. Labour and the Tories disagree much more profoundly than they did during the Blair years – voters have a proper choice. But in other ways, what we have now is worse: a political system dominated not by “professionals” – New Labour’s bland but often competent and hard-working ministers – but by amateurish Tory figures.Will this one-party democracy last? Parliament finally returns next week. The government’s clear failures over coronavirus continue. Labour has a prosecutor for a new leader. And the Tories, for all their electoral supremacy, still look ill-equipped to deal with the crises that will return to prominence after coronavirus: over the climate, the viability of modern capitalism, and how to create a society that works for all age groups, rather than mainly the old and middle-aged. These questions are likely to be too isive to be settled inside one party.When the Conservative era eventually ends, it may do so spectacularly. As many dictators and long-serving premiers have discovered, there’s one big problem for practitioners of one-party rule. When the public finally decide that you’ve failed to deliver, there’s no one else to blame."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b8a098f1908c315f1aa62a1f5e974ab9b7d382c/0_312_5210_3128/master/5210.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2b0a47107d1f17c576d5fbd945cc7f1","title":"germany ease lockdown harder","story":"Relaxation measures for schools have been criticised from all sidesThe coronavirus has been kind to Germany’s political elite. After years of bleeding votes to the Alternative für Deutschland on the right and the Greens on the left, Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union has finally started to see rising approval ratings. It’s easy to see why. The country’s lockdown was enacted relatively swiftly and presented clearly, its testing programme has been unparalleled in the western world and its healthcare system has proven far more robust than those of neighbouring countries. Now, however, with the virus seemingly in retreat and parts of Europe tentatively easing out of lockdown, tensions are beginning to show, and Germans may soon look back on the quarantine with a kind of nostalgia.The government has emphasised repeatedly that the relaxation of the measures is provisional and that continued progress will require the development of sophisticated contact-tracing programmes, including the controversial suggestion that smartphones be used in a widespread programme to track interactions between citizens. The “fragile partial success,” Merkel has insisted, can only hold if the population continues to abide by social distancing regulations as much as possible.The plan to reopen some shops has been largely greeted with muted relief, though there doesn’t seem to be much hope that it will stimulate the economy more broadly. The plan for reopening schools has been roundly criticised. The Leopoldina’s guidelines for maintaining social distance and proper hygiene at schools are “just not realistic,” as Ilke Hoffmann, the head of the education union, Gewerkschaft Erzeihung und Wissenschaften, told Der Spiegel. There aren’t enough teachers to maintain class sizes of 15 students or less, as the report suggests, and classrooms are far too small to maintain a two-metre distance between students. Furthermore, the report’s claim that older primary school students would be able to abide by social distancing strictures has been roundly criticised, with teachers calling the idea a fantasy. Harriet Kühnemann, the director of a primary school in Gießen, Hesse, told NTV that she “absolutely cannot guarantee that students will wash their hands”.While plans to reopen primary schools have been criticised for moving too quickly, the Leopoldina’s recommendation that nurseries stay closed until the end of the summer break in August or September has been widely condemned as too restrictive. The theologian and ethicist Peter Dabrock, for example, has said the decision endangers the wellbeing of children. Closing daycare for six months, Dabrock told Deutschland Funk, would constitute “a massive violation of the rights of children”. Heinz Holger, the president of the Deutschen Kinderschutzbundes, a child welfare organisation, warned that such a long closure had already led to increased calls to their domestic violence hotline. Parental groups, meanwhile, have pointed out that many families already face enormous financial difficulty due to the lack of childcare.The inept recommendations of the Leopoldina can hardly be surprising given its membership. The panel that issued the report consisted of 24 men and two women. The average age of its members was over 60. One wonders how the institution arrived at the conclusion that it was more important to include a physicist specialising in the “mechanics of materials” than experts on the experiences of immigrants, people of colour, or women. Professor Jutta Allmendinger, a member of the Leopoldina (though not a signatory of its report), had no trouble in assembling a more erse group of signatories to an open letter criticising the report – more than 40 female professors from a variety of disciplines and backgrounds have signed the letter calling for daycare centres to be opened more quickly.As the burden of the coronavirus begins to be distributed more and more unevenly, and as women and the young are forced to bear more and more of the weight of the crisis, one suspects that many Germans will look with bitter envy towards Denmark, whose prime minister, Mette Friedriksen – a 42-year-old mother – has made early childhood education the first priority as the country emerges from lockdown. Denmark’s experts have concluded that it is not the young but the elderly who should bear the burden of social isolation during the remainder of the pandemic. The very young, who are generally not at risk from the virus, should not have to sacrifice important educational opportunities so that those who belong to at-risk groups can return to public life more quickly. It’s no coincidence that Germany, in contrast, is keeping the youngest children in isolation, while hair salons and department stores are being allowed to reopen. Ending lockdown is not an end in itself, as the German government has made clear, but even getting that right in a country that has excelled so far is proving to be harder thanimagined.• Peter Kuras is a writer and translator based in Berlin"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd04a56ee1fde98cfa894b9a67fd1f8734bf2aa6/45_0_4445_2668/master/4445.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00abd47ac734e486dafbcc2a9d3958de","title":"the world is now mirroring my twisted teen psyche but there is an upside","story":"I can tell you how it feels when you no longer need to keep the world at a fearful arm’s length: it feels amazingNext month, I will have been at the  for a midlife crisis-inducing 20 years. No party, for obvious reasons, but I will mark the occasion by sitting alone in a dark room and watching the grains of sand slip ever faster through the hourglass of my life. Rock on!I recently looked back on what no one refers to as my juvenilia, and the first article I ever got into the paper was about my early teenage years when I had anorexia nervosa. Now, with my platinum anniversary coming up, I shall bring you the sequel, about what happened in my late teenage years, because I seem to be reliving them, and so, as I shall shortly explain, are all of you.There was handwashing, of course. I washed my hands so much, my knuckles bled for years and are still, over two decades later, ridged with scars. I feared other people hugely, as Lord only knows what they were contaminated with, and maintained a strict distance from them, inwardly raging at anyone who breached it, crossing the road to avoid big groups. Mainly, though, I stayed home, as the outside world was too full of perils. But even home wasn’t entirely safe: I anxiously watched which surfaces – counter tops, doorknobs – family members touched and would then frantically wipe them down, like a grande dame, pointedly tidying up after my scruffy guests. Coats and shoes were a nightmare, food packaging even worse. And, obviously, no one could ever touch me. Any of this now sounding weirdly familiar, Britain?But this also means I can tell you what will happen afterwards, because I have lived it. My imprisonment was self-imposed as I fought an imaginary enemy. Today’s stakes are obviously higher, the rippling aftereffects a little more global than me no longer moving seats in the cinema because someone sat too close. (Only three seats away! How dare they?) But I can tell you how it feels when you no longer need to keep the world at a fearful arm’s length: it feels amazing.It has been almost 15 years since I last insisted on bringing my own utensils to restaurants, and still I thrill at the freedoms of normal life: spontaneously leaving my home without spending 20 minutes beforehand covering my hands and face like a serial killer letting myself be hugged and hugging back. A few summers ago, I met some friends for a picnic in the park. We stayed there all day, sharing food, lying in the grass. As the day slipped into evening, someone suggested going to the pub, and off we went. To everyone else, this was just a normal summer’s day, but it made me almost cry with happiness. When you have been through self-isolation, there will always be a part of you afterwards that stands to the side of yourself, marvelling at the life you can now lead.At the worst point of my OCD, doctors told me I was being self-destructive. Now, in a deliciously ironic twist maybe only I can enjoy, they are recommending those same quirks as lifesaving essentials. Validation has never been so unexpected. But none of this has triggered a relapse in me, because there’s some hard core inside of me that is so happy to be free of the self-imposed imprisonment that not even an externally imposed one can respark it. I acknowledge the real risks around us, now, but I shut my ears when my mind starts to whisper about the false ones. Because I know how good it feels to be free. One day, all of us will feel that freedom once more, and you will never take it for granted again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/398f7cba9c7748958910b9caa8884c17d444e7ff/0_204_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efac44bd0765ab6794dda02c37309326","title":"campus lockdown how to cope alone in university halls","story":"Being isolated in student accomodation can be distressing, but these expert tips will help you get through this difficult periodWhen it looked like the UK would go on lockdown, final year student Jia Wei Lee knew she had to stay in her student house in Wales, away from her home country of Malaysia. It was a difficult decision, but with a dissertation to write and a student visa to worry about, Lee decided to isolate in Treforest, where she studies biology and conservation at the University of Wales.“It feels like we’re a community but we are separated by walls. I realised that I didn’t want to dwell on suffering,” she says. “I want to bring this community closer together – breaking the virtual barriers between everyone.”Lee started posting videos on social media to share life hacks – some useful (like tips for folding clothes in three seconds) and some not so conventionally helpful (how to make a slingshot from a rubber band).It’s one of the ways Lee has learned to cope on lockdown, as just one of thousands of students in the UK who are now isolating in university halls and student accommodation.With around one in seven people experiencing distress associated with lockdown, we asked students and psychologists for their tips on how to get through this difficult period.Setting a routine is vital for your wellbeing. Professor Kevin Morgan, sleep expert at Loughborough University, warns that you shouldn’t use sleep “as a counter-product to boredom”. He says it’s critical to get out of bed at a normal time in the morning. Although all the usual life cues are gone – like lectures, or meeting friends – we need to keep the things that synchronise our body clocks, Morgan says, such as meal times, recreation, and winding down in the evening.Keeping a routine not only helps with sleep but will keep you motivated, says survival psychologist Dr Sarita Robinson, from the University of Central Lancashire. “People in extreme environments can survive and come out mentally intact because they have appropriate coping mechanisms. A structured plan can be really helpful in keeping you motivated, so you don’t just fall away into feeling listless and depressed.”Build studying into your routine. Mike Leaf, a final year geoscience student at Keele University, advises giving yourself deadlines. Setting yourself a goal of finishing a chapter of a project by the weekend, for example, will “keep you focused without guidance from supervisors.”Lee says she checks in with friends to keep on task. She calls them her accountability buddies. “We motivate each other to finish our aims for the day.”Try not to put too much pressure on yourself to achieve. This is an unprecedented time, and “it’s absolutely OK to not be OK at the moment,” Robinson says. It’s good to have goals, she adds – “but my goals aren’t things like I’m going to write a high-impact journal. My goals are finishing that jigsaw, or spending an hour learning how to dance the Charleston. Low-level goals keep you motivated.”See what support is on offer at your university or students’ union. Robinson says: “It’s about reassuring students that we’re here for them. There is a lot of support, especially for international students unable to travel home, or students estranged from families.”Call your friends and family, and arrange virtual pub quizzes or games. “If you’re a person who enjoys social contact, then it’s about trying to find a new way to connect,” she adds.Morgan says the key is to get outside to exercise. “Get out and do a sensible amount of exercise when the sun is bright. Tell your physiology that it’s daylight. Don’t make the mistake of thinking you can exercise yourself to sleep – you can’t, but what you can do is relieve some of the stresses that would otherwise accumulate through a confined environment.”Lee adds: “Whenever I feel anxious, I make sure to get out of the house and take my one hour of exercise. I can take a breather. It’s about listening to your body.”The mental health benefits from interacting with green space are huge. If you can, go for a walk in a park or garden. But if that’s not possible, bring the garden inside instead. “Try virtual tours,” suggests Robinson. ”Just looking at green scenery has been shown to be beneficial. Growing things is also very therapeutic.”Extensive research suggests gardening helps reduce anxiety and stress-related symptoms. You can still grow plants if you’re living in one room in block halls. Herbs such as coriander or rosemary are good for windowsills, and you can even get a (free) houseplant after eating an avocado. Fill a glass with water, and put toothpicks in the avocado stone to suspend  it on the rim, so the bottom half rests in water. Make sure it has sunlight, and when the stone sprouts, pot some compost and watch it grow.“If you start thinking that you’re stuck in your room, that can be quite demoralising. Rephrase it to ‘I’m safe in my room, I’ve got opportunities to do things that I can concentrate on,’” Robinson says.Many exercise classes, social activities, concerts, and theatre shows are taking place online, so there will always be something to keep you busy. See if your favourite artist or comedian is livestreaming a gig. Or use this time to discover new experiences, whether it’s cooking, gaming, or going to the theatre (virtually). There are resources to help you find these new and mostly free experiences. For example, Cheapskate newsletter, which normally lists affordable things to do in London, is now collating the week’s best free indoor activities, from digital art tours to “e-life drawing” workshops."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26fe6c7f86b889d385b35f1ffbd05df5035a60cd/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eea6e1c8da508881fb1f77af29054619","title":"british workers reject fruit picking jobs as romanians flown in coronavirus","story":"Contract length, farm location and caring duties cited as reasons for turning down workThousands of British workers who responded to a nationwide appeal to help pick fruit and vegetables on farms have rejected job offers, it has emerged.The Alliance of Ethical Labour Providers said it had received 36,000 applications of interest but only 6,000 had opted for an interview for a role.Concordia, one of the three recruitment companies in the alliance, said: “To date 900 people have explicitly rejected the roles we have offered and 112 have taken up our offer of a role on a UK farm.”It said the main barriers were the length of the contract, location of the farm, and inability to work full-time because of care responsibilities.People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will:Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.“Some are saying they cannot commit to 40 hours a week, some can only commit for a few weeks whereas some roles can be full time for eight weeks and some can be up to six months,” said Sarah Boparan, the operations director at Hops.She said that even though they were not able to hire all who applied, she felt there was an education process under way about farm work that could have a lasting impact after Brexit, when Conservative party plans will put a block on low-paid and low-skilled workers coming to the UK from abroad.“We are so pleased to see so many people apply and so thankful they have responded to the call to support agriculture in this country and we appreciate their patience as some of the crops are not yet ready and new offers will be going out,” she said, adding that peak recruitment would not really start till the end of May for most farms.Several people who said they had responded to the government-backed appeal complained about the barriers to taking up the posts, particularly the on-site accommodation.One man who contacted the , who lives in Norfolk and wanted to commute to a job locally, where there are many farms, said: “Some of the jobs require you to live on-site. It doesn’t make it easy at all. If we really need to be picking all these vegetables, they don’t make it very easy. I can’t move I have a family.”Gary Leshone, 35, who used to work in fishing in Grimsby, launched his own personal recruitment drive when the national Feed the Nation appeal, backed by the environment secretary, George Eustice, was launched three weeks ago.He managed to get 150 volunteers who were willing to cross the country to Herefordshire and to live on-site for six months.“I contacted farmers inidually and initially I was told by one farmer he’d take as many workers as he could get, so I went on radio and social media and got 150 people. I know I could probably find 1,000 to 2,000 here because people are out of work.”He was then told by the farmer that he needed a gangmaster’s licence if he was going to place that many workers on the market, which he was told would take 10 weeks to obtain.“By that time the fruit and veg will have rotted and the borders will probably be reopened,” he said.Underlining the confused messaging surrounding the sudden recruitment drive, Hops pointed out that the Gangmaster and Labour Abuse Authority was doing checks and handing out gangmaster licences within five days because of the crisis.“The Romanians coming in are just like us, looking for work to feed their families themselves, but if they need 90,000 people and you have all these British people unemployed and the government has to pay out universal credit, it’s just ridiculous. The government should do more to sort this out,” said Leshone.Recruiters appealed for patience among British hopefuls, pointing out that the peak season started from May and there would be “thousands of roles available for people who are in need of a job”.There was controversy in Romania after photographs emerged of crowds gathering in regional airports for flights to Germany, which, like the UK, is also suffering a labour deficit. Questions are being asked in Romania as to how workers could leave to help ease other countries’ demand for fresh food when much of Romania is in strict lockdown.G’s Fresh, one of the UK’s biggest salad growers, which has chartered two of the six planes from Bucharest, said it had recruited 500 British workers so far.“We’re really pleased with how the recruitment campaign is going, but it is important that we have got these people from Romania. These are key skilled workers who were with us last year. We need experienced people who can make sure everyone is safe and knows what to do,” Beverley Dixon, the company’s HR director, told Eastern Daily Press.Romanian workers travelling to the UK were given masks and sanitiser before boarding and would be be quarantined in small teams before full deployment, G’s Fresh said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/793d548a22f401fc02018343a7e929bf9aff1edc/0_115_5472_3285/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85a58b2b92ca153149a3afb3cae3b7a9","title":"rebuild it shade it breed it three tactics to buy time for the great barrier reef","story":"While emissions reduction is the only long-term solution, scientists are testing ways to keep the reef going in a warming worldCan the world’s greatest coral reef system be rescued from the rapid march of the climate crisis?With global temperatures already about 1C higher than pre-industrial levels, Queensland’s Great Barrier Reef has been through three mass bleaching events in only five years.Corals are dying and the system is changing rapidly as temperatures keep going up and greenhouse gases keep accumulating in the atmosphere.Earlier this week, the Australian government revealed a $150m research and development program to build the reef’s resilience to future warming.Ken Anthony, a principal research scientist at the Australian Institute of Marine Science, said: “It’s a bit like the Apollo 11 mission. It really is on that scale. We have to be able to look Australians in the eye in in 10 years’ time and say that in the time we had, we did our best.”On its own, the project – called the Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program – is a clear signal that scientists now know cutting greenhouse gas emissions will not be enough to sustain a vibrant reef.It’s time for intervention at a scale never seen before, scientists say, and they’re in a race against time to find enough solutions before climate change bites even harder.Some 43 concepts are being backed under the plan, from futuristic cloud brightening to using concrete blocks to stabilise damaged reefs.The program has split the concepts into seven groups and scientists say none of them will be enough in isolation – it’s more likely that a combination deployed at different scales will give the reef the best chance. These seven categories fall broadly into three approaches:So what’s being planned, and could these approaches really buy the reef enough time?In early March, Daniel Harrison, a biological oceanographer at Southern Cross University, led a trial of equipment that sprays trillions of nano-sized salt crystals into the air.The idea is the salt crystals reach existing low-level clouds and, because of their tiny size, encourage the formation of smaller cloud droplets that reflect more sunlight than larger droplets.The process mirrors what happens over the oceans every day as winds carry salty ocean spray into the air to help form clouds.Harrison is leading a project to try to scale-up the trial to see if clouds over hundreds of kilometres could be brightened. If this was possible, the brightening effect could slightly lower ocean temperatures below – perhaps keeping corals just cool enough to prevent them from bleaching.Such a system could be turned on and off quickly, and could be deployed when weather forecasts and models show that corals are under dangerous levels of heat stress.Harrison, who is leading the cooling and shading efforts under the government program, says: “It’s a combination of light and temperature that causes corals to bleach.“We are pursuing the things that are really big in scale, but also looking at small scale actions that could support outcomes on a local level at high value reef sites.”Other methods under this “shading and cooling” category include machines to create artificial low-hanging sea fog that could provide shade over smaller areas. Researchers are also looking at ultra-thin reflective films that could temporarily cut the sunlight over small areas.Anyone who has walked around an ancient Roman city will have seen restorers working behind steel props and scaffolding that hold up what’s left of a once majestic temple or amphitheatre.Coral bleaching and cyclones can weaken the structure of reefs, known as the substrate. Scientists think that if reefs could be stabilised, it might give other methods a chance to take hold and restore inidual reefs.There are question marks over the economics of deploying mesh or 3D printed frames at scale, but the restoration programs suggest there could be small-scale deployments that could help reefs recover.Removing natural rubble around reefs could also help create space for new corals to grow, and is another area under investigation.Modelling for the program found these approaches tended to only be cost effective if emissions in the future were very low. But they could still help at smaller scales.Anthony says if temperatures stay below 2C “then there is so much we can do” across all the approaches.“It’s both daunting to look at the challenge ahead, but also we know we have to come up with a plan,” he says.“At 3C the reef will look very different – it would be a sad story, but you still wouldn’t give up.”Prof Peter Harrison, at Southern Cross University, is a global expert on how coals reproduce and was among the first to discover their mass spawning on just a few nights of the year after full moons.“It’s like an underwater snowstorm and billions of eggs and sperm get released,” he says.One approach under development is to find ways to capture larvae during natural spawning and then move them in “slicks” and drop them in places that need help to recover.“Because the production of larvae has been so dramatically impacted because of the mass bleaching, we are now looking to see how we could use what we know about coral reproduction and more effectively transfer them onto damaged reef systems.”Harrison says methods being researched under the new program include scaling up floating ocean pools to transfer coral larvae, or eggs and sperm raised in aquaculture ponds, onto reefs.Corals get much of their colour and nutrients from the symbiotic relationship they have with special algae. Harrison says that some corals are more heat tolerant than others, and the same goes for the algae.Combining heat tolerant algae and heat tolerant corals, and then producing more heat tolerant larvae, could give reefs “more scope for growth under warming conditions”.“We are buying time to help coral species to evolve and adapt and buy enough time to get some real action on climate change. There’s a large group of people around me who feel we can’t wait for action. We have to work out what we can do now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ab67628e7a3611278fcebcc1dcef3e3e6293972/0_120_5262_3157/master/5262.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b75774ee8969bcb10a3fe8db3451211","title":"food waste lockdown larders coronavirus food banks","story":"Use-by dates are ignored, while new findings show increasing numbers turning to food banks It is a snapshot of a more abstemious nation, as staying at home and being unable to eat out means Britons are making their food go further and throwing less away.Consumers are rising to the challenge of a “lockdown larder” as a result of the pandemic, and ignoring recommendations on best-before and use-by labels and piling less food on to their plates, new research has revealed.Cooking from scratch, having “virtual” dinner parties online, and eating more family meals together are some of the positive shifts in shopping and cooking behaviour under way in households across the UK since restaurants and pubs closed, according to a survey by the environmental charity Hubbub.Yet the findings also reveal that many are struggling to put meals on the table and are worried about food, with increasing numbers turning to food banks for the first time.Trewin Restorick, chief executive of Hubbub, said: “At what is a deeply troubling time, it’s encouraging to see some really positive changes taking place in households across the country.“Families are eating together more, young people are learning to cook, people are planning meals better and using up leftovers. However, it’s concerning to see some of the downsides of food restrictions impacting on the health of people’s diets and I was horrified by the recent report from the Food Foundation, which showed that 3 million people have gone full days without meals since lockdown started.”Despite the generally positive experience of reconnecting with food, nearly half said they were more worried about food than before and a similar proportion were anxious about the extra cost of putting food on the table.The consumer group Which? advises that while the rules can be bent for some products, those on fresh and processed meat, poultry and fish should not. Anyone classed as vulnerable or with underlying health conditions should also adhere to the dates on the labels. Unlike use-by dates, best-before labels are put on foods as a quality indication to show that though they are no longer at their best they are still safe enough to eat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8da6da54bceca94025f57b0d30dff25c3523d0c6/108_1151_3350_2009/master/3350.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8575f00e863748437a0a17ebe6a81629","title":"lockdown larder the best store cupboard recipes for cheap easy meals","story":"Can’t get what you want in the supermarket?

Or swap them out for any frozen fruit you have lurking in the bottom of the freezer, but make sure it’s thoroughly defrosted before mixing it with the lime juice.KA: Dates can be substituted for all manner of dried dark fruit, from figs and raisins to cherries and cranberries. Mix and match with whatever you’ve got to hand. Dried apricots would work, too, though that would make for a very different tasting end result. Use any sugar you have to hand, if need be, and try sunflower or pumpkin seeds instead of the walnuts pistachios would also work.KA: In India, subjis are made with just about every vegetable going, so use whatever you have in store – carrots, green beans, cabbage, potato – for this classic dry curry. If you can’t get hold of cashews, try almonds, walnuts, hazelnuts or even pine nuts.Egg noodles with peanut, sugar snaps and chilliKA: Try mangetout if you can’t get sugar snaps young, fresh, new-season pea pods, which are just coming into grocers now, would also do the trick nicely, as would fresh or frozen and defrosted edamame, if you can get them. Failing that, use french or runner beans blanched so they still retain some crunch.Quick soba noodles with double gingerKA: Try half the amount of spring onions, finely shredded, in place of the chives, while parsley, dill or tarragon, or a mixture of all three, can take the place of the coriander, if that’s all you have.KA: If the supermarket’s run out of basil, try parsley or oregano in its place, or just leave it out altogether. It’s not an essential flavouring in this rich sauce. And while it’s traditional to serve it with long, thin noodles, there’s no law to say you can’t use another pasta shape – it also works particularly well with short stubby tubes such as penne, rigatoni and tortiglioni.KA: This is Egypt’s go-to store-cupboard dish, so is endlessly adaptable. If need be, swap the macaroni for another smallish tubed pasta such as cavatappi, chifferi or ditaloni rice-shaped orzo or broken up vermicelli would also do. While every vinegar has its own distinct flavour profile, any red-wine, sherry, cider or even balsamic vinegar would be more than capable stand-ins for the white-wine vinegar.KA: If the shelves have been stripped of Hobnobs, try digestives or gingernuts in the base (the latter add a nice, spicy note, too). And if double cream is scarce, try whipping cream, or even plain yoghurt let down with a little milk.• For more store-cupboard dishes on the  site, try here, here and here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a148f5ba6131af53561a3f8c92be9702e6644c9c/369_90_2437_1463/master/2437.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c37404075122eebf56c53002a148cef3","title":"drew spence phils not spoken to me once is it because of what happened","story":"Chelsea midfielder feels she’s not being given a chance by England after the Eni Aluko fallout but feels valued by her club“I’m not saying I deserve to be in the England squad but I think I deserve to have been given a chance,” says Drew Spence, Chelsea’s longest serving player. A new two-year contract signed in March will take the 27-year-old into her 13th year with the club. Plenty of players have been ditched by Emma Hayes, with the manager unsentimental in her quest for success, but Spence, the only player to have been at the club longer than Hayes, remains firmly in the manager’s plans.It is a huge vote of confidence for the midfielder, yet the respect of one of the most experienced club managers in the game, two league titles, a Spring Series trophy, two FA Cups and, this year, the team’s first League Cup, have not been enough to earn her a place in Phil Neville’s England squad.Spence admits “the squad is difficult to get in, especially my position, because there’s so many good midfielders in England. It’s tough”. However with defenders such as Lucy Bronze and Leah Williamson filling in in midfield and formations tweaked game by game to try to compensate for injuries, the inability of Spence to get a look-in seems odd.“Phil’s not spoken to me once,” says the softly spoken Spence, with no anger but a tinge of disappointment. “To not be given that chance makes me question: ‘Is it because of what happened?’ I think it is because of what happened, if I’m totally honest.”Spence is referring to her involvement in the Mark Sampson racism case. In 2017, when her then Chelsea teammate Eni Aluko spoke to the  about her treatment after taking part in an anonymous questionnaire on the culture within the national team, Spence was pulled into the ring as the unnamed player who, while the only player of colour in the room, had been asked by Sampson how many times she had been arrested. Initially Spence stayed quiet before writing to the FA to confirm Aluko’s account of the event.After a very public and messy series of investigations, the FA “sincerely apologised” to both Spence and Aluko. The latter did not play for England again, but with more than 100 caps and the end of her career a bit closer she was aware she had less to lose by speaking out.Spence, who was 25 and had attended only one England camp, under Sampson, stayed quiet in an attempt to protect her position. “The reason I didn’t speak out straight away was because I was worried,” she says. “I was stressed at the time. There was a lot going on behind closed doors. My main concern was whether it would affect me playing for my country. I’m happy with the decision I took – I didn’t speak out then, it wouldn’t have been right.”She has had one call-up since, for the squad’s training camp in La Manga in the immediate aftermath under the interim manager Mo Marley, but she is a little sceptical of the intent behind her selection, speculating over whether it was to make the FA “look good in the media”. The FA said in a statement on Friday that “players are only ever picked on merit and all English players in the WSL are watched and considered for selection”.Reflecting on the situation triggers a little frustration, but for now Spence is relaxed about her international future. Why? Because at Chelsea she has Hayes’s trust and feels valued. “Right now I’m not losing any sleep over it,” she says. “I’ve got a good career at Chelsea, we’re winning titles, we’re challenging every season, so I’m happy with my status at the moment.”Her life at Chelsea is by no means a walk in the park. Staying in Hayes’s plans is tough. She had eight league starts this season – she started 15 games in 2018-19 – before it was halted by the coronavirus pandemic. “It’s difficult for me because a lot of people always write me off,” she says. “Every year, I’ve got to push myself. I know there’s going to be signings coming in every year.“Emma’s made that clear every season really, to make sure that the squad is pushing again and pushing to another level. It’s just really believing in myself, making sure I’m doing everything right in training every day and competing with the players that come in.”Hayes’s “honesty” in telling her where she needs to improve, and her willingness to adapt and take it on board, is the secret to her longevity at the club. “Emma can rely on me to be put in wherever she’s needed me,” Spence says. “I’ve played higher and lower. I’ve even played out wide sometimes, which is definitely not my game. Emma always wants a player that can play in different positions so she makes you adapt.”Hayes prides herself on building teams of leaders, of finding the “right players”, and that approach has yielded trophies. Before the season was suspended, Chelsea were one point behind Manchester City with a game in hand and a domestic treble in their sights having lifted the League Cup in February.“Obviously, not being in the Champions League this year was even more frustrating. If we don’t win it in the next two years I feel like it’ll be a massive failure to be honest, because the team we have at the moment can easily win the Champions League. I think everyone knows that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/599aadfd4ea23f006661c8e0d82a3d07d9733dd3/0_297_2801_1682/master/2801.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3218b15924345422492440696da3225c","title":"premier league could return by mid june in best case scenario football","story":"Premier League clubs have discussed resuming the season on the weekend of 13-14 June after Uefa wrote to domestic associations stating a desire they should finish their competitions by 31 July to leave August clear for the completion of the Champions League and Europa League.The letter from European football’s governing body formed the basis of a two-hour conference call on Friday that explored how the Premier League may be concluded.While any resumption is being modelled on matches occurring behind closed doors, guiding the decision-making is the overriding principle that the National Health Service’s ability to treat those with Covid-19 should not be compromised and that it has to be at ease with the top-flight restarting. This means the Premier League wants the NHS to give the go-ahead and so the health service has power of veto.In the best-case scenario clubs would have a “pre-season” from 10 or 14 May, giving players four weeks to regain fitness, with the minimum they would need set at two weeks. If training began three or four weeks before the weekend of 13 and 14 June, the opening days may feature players training inidually or in small groups to ensure the best protection before squads worked together as normal.Protocols devised by the Premier League and club doctors and signed off by the requisite bodies would have testing at the forefront and would be in place to try to ensure a safe return to games. Those at matches – players, club staff, officials, security and media – would all have to be tested and there would have to be procedures to address the prospect of large groups of fans gathering outside stadiums.Uefa’s wish is that the Champions League and Europa League should each recommence from the week of Monday 3 August with the final of the former being staged on Saturday 29 August and that of the latter to be played a few days before.If the Premier League was to restart on 13 June – a Saturday – it would allow seven weeks to finish the season. As 16 clubs have nine matches left and Manchester City, Sheffield United, Aston Villa and Arsenal have 10, the timeframe would appear to be long enough for the campaign to be finished comfortably.It is understood the Premier League is conscious of a worst-case scenario given the unpredictability of coronavirus and how long it may take to tackle it. The pessimistic view is that no football can resume until October, seven months after the last round of matches."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0981f79ae8ebf3824a034b61ae0ae89bff4c862/0_70_2848_1709/master/2848.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8a3837215caa6e8d54a1c4501c6b516","title":"my favourite game chelsea v bradford city 2015 fa cup","story":"It was pure pandemonium in the Stamford Bridge away end as Bradford pulled off one of the great modern-day upsetsAdrenaline is a funny thing. When all hell broke loose in the away end at Stamford Bridge at around 4.48pm on Saturday 24 January 2015, nobody associated with Bradford City wanted to stop and draw breath. Mark Yeates had just completed perhaps the greatest FA Cup upset in modern-day history and talk was already turning to the almighty party that would be happening in West Yorkshire when the 6,000-strong away support returned up the M1.The list of pubs and clubs we were planning to descend upon that evening was endless. Bradford would have never seen a party like it. But as we sat down for our first pint at around 10pm, the adrenaline had escaped us. The journey had taken its toll, and all we could do was think of bed. Physically and emotionally exhausted, but still in a sense of complete disbelief at what had happened that afternoon.My dad was never one for optimism. He warned upon taking me to my first game on Boxing Day 1995 – a bleak 1-1 draw with Sheffield United – that supporting Bradford would be a miserable experience. After half an hour at Stamford Bridge I couldn’t help but think he was right. Gary Cahill and Ramires had put Chelsea 2-0 ahead and our big day out in the capital was turning into a nightmare. Suddenly, though, right on half-time, a goal from Jon Stead gave us something.Not something to build on – I mean, nobody predicted what would happen next – just something to take home with us. A moment to remember. I battled in the concourse to try to get a phone signal to call home. “Not going well, is it … 2-1 down,” my dad said. “Are you kidding? We’ve scored at Stamford Bridge,” I replied. “Who cares what happens now?” I’m happy to admit that I was wrong. I did care.It’s easy to turn up your nose when people say the greatest moments in their lives are a blur. Looking back I understand why all that emotion and adrenaline may leave some hazy, but I remember every moment of the second half like it was yesterday. That feeling of optimism when we pushed the Premier League’s best side on to the back foot from the off was incredible.Somehow we equalised 15 minutes from time when Filipe Morais prodded home from close-range. I remember hugging people I’d never even met before, and over the next quarter of an hour we embraced again. “Imagine getting this lot back to Valley Parade,” I heard someone cry amid the mayhem of Morais’s equaliser.José Mourinho had clearly contemplated that prospect and, just before Morais made it 2-2, he sent on Cesc Fàbregas, Willian and Eden Hazard to kill the tie and silence the deafening noise in the away end. It didn’t work. With eight minutes left, Andy Halliday put Bradford ahead with a curling effort that Petr Cech in his prime, let alone the version who was between the sticks that day, would not have saved.It was 3-2. Grown men – myself included – were now in tears. Little old Bradford were about to do the unthinkable. And it became a reality in injury time when Yeates made it 4-2. Pandemonium doesn’t come close to describing the chaos among the supporters who had travelled south that Saturday morning in hope rather than expectation.Post-match I remember our tube carriage being full of supporters with claret and amber scarves trying to work out if they were dreaming. One or two Chelsea fans actually wished us luck for the next round – they probably couldn’t believe it either.The party back home never actually happened for us, but the memories made it worth the early night. And getting home early meant being able to watch Match of the Day. We were first on. I can’t imagine that will happen again for a while."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14e1433615a5fdb5eaa228722ab5038ef750aabc/0_0_2064_1239/master/2064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51de0d80fc5f980612347ab29a3aba7d","title":"how norman hunter became one of leeds uniteds biggest legends","story":"Nicknamed ‘Norman bites yer legs’, the Leeds defender won 28 England caps but had his biggest successes at Elland RoadNorman Hunter had to wait 41 years for his World Cup winners’ medal – as a non-playing member of England’s 1966 squad he was not deemed entitled to one until the rules were eventually revised – yet the Leeds United centre-half’s no-nonsense playing style is as fondly remembered today as any other from the era when televised football turned local heroes into household names.Partly that is to do with the wonderfully apposite nickname that followed him around after the 1972 FA Cup final against Arsenal, when a banner in the Leeds end declaring “Norman bites yer legs” was spotted and commented on by the studio pundit Brian Clough. There was more than a grain of truth in the assertion, though rather than being a menace on the pitch Hunter, whose death at the age of 76 was confirmed on Friday, was simply a brusquely physical defensive presence of a type common at the time.Every team seemed to have a strongman with a memorable and fondly bestowed pet name – Liverpool had Tommy “Anfield Iron” Smith and Chelsea had Ron “Chopper” Harris – and though some of the tackling might be considered hair-raising by modern standards, half a century ago it was just part of the game. In a way Hunter did bite yer legs – opponents had to be good or quick to get past him – but first and foremost he was an excellent defender, not merely the enforcer his sobriquet tends to suggest.Had Hunter not been able to play good football he would have been nowhere near a World Cup final at the age of 22. The reason he was unable to break into the side was because Alf Ramsey had decided Bobby Moore and Jack Charlton formed the best centre-back partnership and neither player became injured or did anything to warrant being replaced. Hunter just had to wait until 1970 but even then he found Everton’s experienced Brian Labone had moved ahead in the queue to play alongside Moore.Hunter did manage to make an appearance in the ill-fated quarter-final against West Germany in Leon. He came on for Martin Peters with nine minutes remaining only to see Uwe Seeler send the game into extra time then Gerd Müller supply the Germany winner.The defender’s luck was no better when he finally managed to break into the England team. He had replaced Moore in the side at long last for the 1973 game against Poland at Wembley that Ramsey’s team needed to win to qualify for the following year’s World Cup but ended up blaming himself for a mistake the visitors capitalised on to take the lead. Though England equalised, the win eluded them and for Ramsey as well as Hunter the World Cup trail came to an abrupt end.While Hunter might have won more than 28 caps had he played at a time when England were not quite as well-equipped with centre-backs, his club career at least was eventful and rewarding. He played 726 times for Leeds after being scouted as a Gateshead schoolboy and signing on at the age of 15, making his debut at 19 and forming a partnership with Charlton that would last a decade.Don Revie’s side were promoted from the Second Division in 1964 and were on course for a league and Cup double in the following season before losing to Liverpool in the 1965 FA Cup final and being pipped to the title by Manchester United on goal average.Compensation for those disappointments arrived later in the decade as Leeds built on their success to become the strongest team in the country as the 60s turned into the 70s. Not necessarily the prettiest or best-liked, as Clough as Leeds manager is notoriously supposed to have pointed out, but there was no arguing with the eventual success under Revie, or that Elland Road had become the most daunting stadium for opposing teams.With Hunter a fixture in the side, Leeds won the title in 1969 and 1974, the FA Cup in 1972, and were losing finalists to Sunderland at Wembley a year later. The 1972-73 season also brought defeat in the European Cup Winners’ Cup final by Milan, a match in which Hunter was dismissed for retaliation at the end amid protests from the crowd over the impartiality of a referee who would receive a ban for match-fixing in subsequent games.However that controversy was nothing next to the heated disputes over disallowed goals and non-awarded penalties that disfigured the 1975 European Cup final against Bayern Munich.Franz Beckenbauer’s side won 2-0, though many still feel that Leeds, now being looked after by Jimmy Armfield after Revie had moved on to England, were cheated in Paris. The violent reaction from sections of the Leeds support resulted in the club being banned from European competition for two years, though it never needed to be applied as the great Elland Road years were effectively over.Hunter moved on to Bristol City in 1976. The £40,000 fee was an eye-catching one for a 33-year-old and Hunter played more than 100 games for the Robins before moving back north to end his career with Barnsley. He tried his hand at management when he finished playing at Oakwell, lasting four years after taking over from Allan Clarke, though a later spell at Rotherham was shorter and his last.Inevitably, perhaps, he spent later years as a meeter and greeter back at Elland Road, where he has a banqueting suite named in his honour. Every club should make the most of its legends, after all, and club legends do not come much bigger or bolder than Norman Hunter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fb926805d751d4017347d57641d973f6a1d6654/38_0_1777_1066/master/1777.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=722f57c573dbcc12d1e63b7fa3474a28","title":"archbishop of uganda urges women to use contraception during lockdown","story":"Family planning group hails Stephen Kazimba Mugalu’s break with Anglican tradition, but Catholic officials brand advice immoralThe new archbishop of Uganda has become the first primate of the country’s Anglican church to embrace the use of modern contraceptives after urging women to be “very careful” to avoid getting pregnant during the Covid-19 lockdown.The ninth archbishop of the church of Uganda, Stephen Kazimba Mugalu, said in a televised Sunday sermon he is “really concerned” that many women will get pregnant during the nationwide shutdown. On Tuesday, President Yoweri Museveni extended the initial 14-day lockdown for a further three weeks.Simon Richard Mugenyi, advocacy and communications manager at Reproductive Health Uganda, welcomed the archbishop’s comments.“We are happy with the church of Uganda stand on certain areas of reproductive health, including the use of contraceptives. For a long time, the church of Uganda has been progressive on these matters.“On his installation service, the archbishop spoke in support of sexuality education - one area that has received mixed reactions. And when he comes up and speaks about the reality - encouraging women who are sexually active not to forget their contraceptives – it show that the church is not living in denial,” he said.“We applaud the archbishop for speaking out on an issue that is being left out in the Covid-19 messaging, yet is so crucial.”Sibenaler added that the UNFPA had worked with the Inter-Religious Council of Uganda to tailor messages about sexual and reproductive health to suit respect different religious teachings.Kazimba’s comments have not been universally accepted by other members of the Christian community.Russell added that before the outbreak, Ugandan women were facing “tremendous barriers” to access safe, quality, comprehensive sexual and reproductive healthcare services.“The government’s Covid-19 lockdown policies are twisting the knife in, leading to new crises. There has been a massive and egregious failure by the government to protect pregnant women who need health care services,” said Russell.Civil society is calling on the government to declare a blanket exemption on the travel ban for pregnant women, so they can seek proper obstetric care and prevent avoidable maternal deaths."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/101846dcb4d1599fd14a421c040b692ec3c9631f/0_0_2952_1772/master/2952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8a0fd4f1344cd1adcc17474d112113c","title":"calling her lifts my spirits three parents on isolation away from their children","story":"As the UK remains in lockdown, parents share their stories about how they’re connecting with their children via technology …With much of the world in lockdown, staying connected with our loved ones has never been more important. Whether we’re checking in with a call, keeping ourselves entertained by taking part in online pub quizzes, or updating the family WhatsApp with our latest baking attempts, we have a burning desire to keep in touch. Our home broadband has gone from “nice to have” to the lifeline between us and the outside world.For some mums and dads who find themselves self-isolating away from their young children, this lifeline is critical. Here, three parents describe how they are managing to stay connected with their families from afar …Rosie: ‘I haven’t seen my son in four weeks’ “Dropping my son off with his father without knowing when I’m going to see him again was the most impossible thing I’ve ever had to do. And that feeling hasn’t lessened over all these weeks of self-isolation. My son is only three years old he’s so young. I feel ready to run out of here and scoop him up at any moment – to hell with it all.“I have to remind myself constantly why I have to take self-isolation so seriously. I’ve got bad asthma. So when my doctor advised that I stay indoors for 12 weeks, I decided it would be best for my son if he was with his dad, who has lots of outdoor space. We broke up in October, so I was only just getting used to the separation. And now this.“It’s been four weeks already, which is the longest I’ve ever been away from my son. FaceTime is essential, but it can be incredibly painful as well – I have to be positive because naturally I just want to burst into tears. I call him on my laptop as it has a bigger screen and his face is the normal size. At the end of the conversation he’ll hug the phone he’s using.“He recently showed me that he can now put his own socks on and told me that he’s being ‘independent’. He’s learned quite a few new words – I’m really proud of him. He’s also been collecting sticks and stones as presents for me when we’re reunited.“We talk at breakfast and dinner – it’s like how we used to sit around the family table, and he finds it entertaining to try to feed me bits of his food through the camera.“We’ve also had some family group calls – we had a lovely one with my sister and her son, my ex-husband and my son, and my dad and my stepmum. My son was playing the keyboard, and his cousin, who has just turned two, was dancing. It was so good!”Leo: ‘I had to isolate away from my daughter when I became ill’“When I started to feel ill a few weeks ago, with what I assume was coronavirus, my 12-year-old daughter was with her mum so it was easy for me to self-isolate.“As the illness took hold, I could do nothing but be in my bed. One bright part of the day, though, was FaceTiming my daughter, which isn’t something we did much previously. My ex and I share equal custody, so I’m used to seeing her every few days.“We’ve WhatsApped each other a lot, too. That way I got to check she was OK, what she was up to and, of course, my knowledge of emojis became fairly impressive.“My symptoms are now subsiding, but we feel it’s best that she stays at her mum’s until I’m completely clear, so the video calls have been such a help. We don’t have to talk every day, but knowing I can see her lifts my spirits. The distinctive sound of the FaceTime ringtone, and then seeing her face and that she looks so well, and isn’t bored or scared, makes this all much easier for me.“It has been very hard to be away from her especially because we don’t know when this is going to end. Several years ago I went to Brazil to work for a few weeks, but this will be the longest I haven’t been with my daughter. I know she is OK, though, and I know that right now she is in the best place with her fantastic mum, and in a wonderful home.“Loneliness, of course, comes into it, but weirdly with everyone in the same boat, you can sort of move away from thoughts of pure isolation. Knowing my daughter is only a video call away helps me so much.“We chat about what we’re doing, laugh about how mad we’re going, and I can put her mind at rest about any questions she has right now. We give each other a kiss on the camera, but we can also just sit in relative silence. She is painting a lot and during one call when I was ill and quite weak, she just got on with that while I watched and relaxed. That was lovely.”Mark: ‘We haven’t told my daughter I’m back in the UK yet’“I travel a lot for work and had recently spent a month in New Zealand away from my family – but when it began to look like everything was shutting down I decided to catch a flight back to the UK so I wouldn’t be stranded.“After discussing it with my wife, we decided that it would be best if I didn’t come straight back to the family home and – as a precaution – I would spend two weeks in isolation. I was very lucky that a good friend had moved in with his girlfriend during lockdown and he kindly offered me his flat to stay in.“However, this meant telling my little girl, who is seven years old, that I was still away. Although she doesn’t totally understand everything about what is going on, she knows enough that she’s been scared of things she’s heard on the news and fearful of us getting ill. So my wife and I decided we didn’t want to worry her even more.“Every day I FaceTime her as I normally would when I’m away, and it’s been a real lifeline for me to be able to see how she’s coping and reassure her that I’ll be home soon. We even watched a film together and her mum made her popcorn just like when we have family movie nights. Doing my best to pretend that everything is normal is the right thing for her, and it helps me cope with this awful situation too.“It’s really difficult to be away from my wife and daughter, especially when this is the time you want to be close to the people you love most in the world. Hopefully one day, when this is all over, we’ll be able to laugh together about how Daddy was hiding in a flat around the corner when she thought I was calling from New Zealand.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedWe know that now, more than ever, it is important for you to stay connected to your family.That’s why every day, we at Vodafone are working hard to maintain our network.

Obsessively rearranging your groceries by best-before date. Binge-watching old episodes of Terry and June. Blankly staring at the forks in your cutlery drawer wondering why they have four prongs and not three.Instead, the past few weeks have shown that being shut away could be making us more connected with each other. Thanks to strong internet networks and an array of digital apps and video communication software, we’re spending more quality time with loved ones, rehabilitating old relationships and forging new ones. Indeed, a recent study by Channel Mum found a quarter of British people now talk with neighbours they previously ignored. In short? Being confined to quarters is helping us rediscover a new sense of community.Every day brings more inspiring and creative digital gatherings, whether it’s quarantine quizzes, online aperitivo or friends slogging up their staircases thousands of times in a bid to conquer a virtual Everest. While we’re all busy rearranging our lives to adjust to the new norm, internet providers are doing their bit too. Taking capacity from commuter hotspots such as Waterloo to expand capacity in the suburbs is one way networks such as Vodafone are adjusting their behaviour. With internet connectivity remaining robust, here’s some inventive ways to escape the lockdown funk and embrace webcameraderie.The shutters might be closed on the nation’s pubs, but that hasn’t stopped people excitedly cheersing each other in brilliantly-named virtual pubs such as The Stay Inn and The Quarant Inn. Sequestered merrymakers have also been improvising cocktails from dusty bottles of crème de menthe and kumquat-flavoured vodka found lurking in their drinks cupboards (see the #quarantini hashtag on Instagram). For many, these sofa-based happy hours are preferable to the real thing: after all, there’s no five-deep bar queues, plus you can do a covert French exit by pretending to have accidentally snagged your socks on some cables.Online rendezvous: The Red (On)Lion: a cyber pub from real ale aficionados Camra. Mimicking the ambience of a traditional pub, remote revellers participate in games and quizzes, plus attend talks on subjects ranging from homebrewing to Belgian beer.Even Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall is a fan of Houseparty, the chat app where groups have been throwing virtual dinner parties, staging karaoke singalongs and playing board games. Quarantine quizzes have flourished, too (check out Edinburgh-based Goose’s Quizzes on Twitch), along with online book clubs: Yiyun Li’s #TolstoyTogether sees the author lead fellow bibliophiles in a daily War and Peace reading. Feeling cheeky? Try gatecrashing one of the growing number of nuptials and other parties held online. Hundreds of people tuned in to watch 13-year-old London schoolboy Jude Cannon’s bar mitzvah in his parents’ living room after his original one was cancelled, while in China one wedding was livestreamed to 3 million people. Just don’t expect any free drinks.Online rendezvous: Salon London livestreamed a book club where online audiences engage in Q\u0026ampAs with authors such as Emma Jane Unsworth.Personal trainer Joe Wicks has done a sterling job marshalling the nation’s cooped-up urchins into doing kangaroo hops at 9am. To help the 1.2 million subscribers doing PE with Wicks each morning, internet providers such as Vodafone are flexing to provide the powerful network we rely on to keep our kids active.

Its live chat room might be the digi-equivalent of the crisp-packet-rustler down your local multiplex, but there’s no better way to laugh, comment and discuss the intricacies of Joe Exotic’s mullet en masse.Online rendezvous: With many Hollywood films getting early digital releases, a number of stars are hosting interactive events.

An expedition team of 30 climbing friends in the UK recently clambered up a virtual Mount Everest – all 8,848m of it – by trudging up stairs, steps and ladders within their own homes (often kitted up in full mountaineering gear). Elsewhere, tourist attractions such as the Louvre, British Museum and New York’s Guggenheim now offer 360-degree videos and livestreaming on their websites. Wildlife fans can ogle webcams showing brown bears emerging from hibernation in Alaska’s Katmai National Park, majestic pachyderms and other charismatic megafauna at South Africa’s Tembe Elephant Park, or sea otters sploshing around at Monterey Bay Aquarium.Online rendezvous: The Scandi trend for slow TV is seemingly tailor-made for these trapped-inside times.

Our gardening expert has some suggestionsI think some of you might be new round here. Until now, for those fortunate enough to have a garden, it has probably been used mostly on the warmest days: hanging out washing, a ballgame, perhaps an Easter egg hunt, and maybe not much more. But now it is your vital playground: it allows you to breathe, to look up and out, in these confined times.What should you be doing with this space? The answer is gardening gently. Messy gardens are rich in habitats all those rotting leaves and old twigs are someone else’s home. So rather than sweep it clean, it is more of a case of ordering it so that it’s a space for you and all the others.Everything you tidy needs to go somewhere, and that’s not a bin bag – it’s the compost heap, if you have one. Perhaps it’s time to empty your compost bin, as the bottom may be full of rich material. If it’s still quite rough, spread it under trees and bushes, where it can further rot if it’s fine, use it for empty beds and to top-dress pots and containers. Don’t worry if you don’t have a bin: as long as it’s just garden waste, you can create a heap. If you’ve got lots of dead woody material, you could make a dead hedge, an amazing habitat for insects and amphibians.Next, tackle weeds: the RHS has a good identification guide, though, to me, half the plants on it are useful ones. Nettles and cleavers are good medicinal foods Japanese knotweed and bittercress are a delicacy in my mind and dandelions and celandine are important food sources for early pollinators. If you can, let them flower before it’s off with their heads.The point, however, is that all of these will take over if you let them. Until you get a little more experience, it can be difficult differentiating between a weed seedling and something you might want. Weeds tend to germinate thickly, so a dense swathe of seedlings is more likely to be weeds. Pull out half and leave the rest to see what they become (weeds grow quickly and soon show their true nature).Weed seedlings compost easily they will rot and make excellent food for the soil. Larger pernicious weeds, such as dock, nettles and bindweed, as well as dandelions, will need to be rotted down in a bucket of water first. It smells awful, but is nutrient-rich and can be poured on to the compost. Don’t let energy out of your system: the compost bin is your new bank and you want it full and maturing for future returns."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ff979afbf10cbd2db6f1c472e11d5403bae37b3/0_171_5010_3007/master/5010.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1001ef889d83cf95d832ab6dc0ed4aa2","title":"quiz what links angel of the north with fa cup thomas eaton","story":"From Flick Colby to JFK’s jacket, test your knowledge with the Weekend quiz1 Which novel “cannot take the place of JR Miller’s Practical Gamekeeping”?2 Which UK archipelago was evacuated in 1930?3 What were choreographed by Flick Colby?4 Which government department is named after a chessboard cloth?5 Who took the Tennis Court Oath?6 What type of animal is a krait?7 What did Churchill’s maxim KBO stand for?8 Who were Leonard, Adolph, Julius, Milton and Herbert?What links:9 Cleaning The Mirror Spirit Cooking Seven Easy Pieces The Artist Is Present?10 Manx Loaghtan Soay Greyface Dartmoor Bluefaced Leicester?11 Montevideo Rome Paris Rio Bern Stockholm?12 Max von Sydow Robert Powell Willem Dafoe Jim Caviezel?13 Bora bise buran brickfielder?14 Queen Elizabeth Daring Duke and City Sandown?15 Van Dyck painting JFK’s jacket Angel of the North maquette FA Cup?1 Lady Chatterley’s Lover (according to a review in Field \u0026amp Stream magazine).2 St Kilda.3 Top Of The Pops dance routines (Pan’s People, Legs \u0026amp Co et al).4 The Exchequer (used for medieval accounts).5 Members of the French Third Estate in 1789.6 Snake.7 Keep buggering on.8 Marx Brothers (original first names).9 Works by performance artist Marina Abramović.10 Native sheep breeds.11 Locations for the first six Fifa World Cup finals (1930-58).12 Played Jesus on screen: The Greatest Story Ever Told Jesus Of Nazareth The Last Temptation Of Christ The Passion Of The Christ.13 Names of winds: Adriatic Switzerland Russia Australia.14 Classes of Royal Navy vessel: aircraft carrier destroyer frigate minehunter.15 Major finds on Antiques Roadshow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/933f9e370a87924c8ab4f5085291a1c54265469d/0_79_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7d58967c95ee0b721ad6d6583eda679","title":"international space station crew return to earth","story":"American and Russian crew touch down in Kazakhstan after months on International Space StationThe three-person crew of the International Space Station returned to Earth on Friday morning, arriving back to a world that has been radically transformed by coronavirus in the time they were away.Space travel is often a journey into the unknown, but for Americans Jessica Meir and Andrew Morgan, and Russian Oleg Skripochka, their return to Earth may bring more surprises than the time they spent in orbit. The trio’s landing capsule touched down on the Kazakh steppe in the early hours of the morning.Morgan had been at the ISS for nine months, his first space mission, while Meir and Skripochka blasted off six months ago, back when shaking hands and hugs were still normal greetings, international travel was routine and there was not even a hint of the virus that would emerge in Wuhan and make its way around the globe.The trio got an early hint of the new world they had arrived in as they were met by a recovery crew wearing face masks and rubber gloves, who pulled them out of their landing capsule. Russian officials said the team assigned to aid the crew had been under medical observation for a month, including tests for coronavirus. It was also cut to a minimum of essential personnel.“Please keep your distance,” one ground crew member could be heard telling another, in footage released by Russia’s space agency.Following the medical checkup, the crew boarded helicopters to Baikonur, the Russian launch site in the Kazakh steppe. From there, Skripochka will travel to Moscow. Morgan and Meir had a longer journey ahead of them: a nearly 200-mile drive to the city of Kyzylorda, and from there a flight back to the US. A closer airport has been closed to international flights due to the coronavirus. “It’s a little bit difficult for us to feel like we’re truly going back to a different planet,” Meir said in a television interview conducted when she was still aboard the ISS earlier this week.“We were really the only three humans that were not subject to that at the current time. Billions of humans were dealing with this in some way or another and the three of us weren’t.”Isolation and quarantine is not likely to be too challenging for the crew, who are used to the long months aboard the ISS. Meir said the best tips for surviving long periods of isolation were ensuring daily exercise, keeping a regular schedule, treating those around with kindness and making sure to have fun.On Thursday, Russian officials reported the first case of coronavirus at Star City, the complex outside Moscow which serves as the control room and training hub for space flights. The director of Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, said on Wednesday that there were currently 30 cases of coronavirus among employees.Even minor illnesses can be disastrous in space, with the Apollo 7 mission in 1968 severely hampered when one of those on board developed a cold soon after blastoff and quickly passed it to the others. For this reason, crews undergo a rigorous quarantine procedure for a month prior to departure.Due to coronavirus, these procedures were made even stricter than usual for the new crew at the ISS, who blasted off from Baikonur last week. As well as daily medical checks, all living spaces were regularly chemically cleaned. The launch took place without the usual fanfare and guest attendances.Astronauts Chris Cassidy, from the US, and Russians Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner will spend six months on the ISS.

Do we need to shorten it or produce more sporting pitches? (Nasih Ul Wadud Alam, ) I don’t think we need to shorten Test cricket and the wickets are actually pretty sporting these days. The key is to avoid extremes. The best pitches have a bit of seam and a bit of spin but are good to bat on too.Being so elegant and seemingly effortless at batting, do you find that people think you are not trying when you are in a bad run of form? (Jack Counsell) For sure. But that’s been the case since I was young. If I got out people would say it was a lazy shot or I wasn’t interested. I am interested, it’s just my style and it looks like that. I feel like anyone else on the inside, and commit to shots the same. But I think commentators understand it more these days. Someone like David Gower moving into the commentary box probably helped. He almost gave players like myself a voice among all the analysis.Are you more nervous coming out to bat or before you bowl your first ball? (Chloe Hole) Definitely before bowling my first ball. The responsibility I have with the ball, especially in Test matches, is a lot more than my batting. I’m still nervous before batting, don’t get me wrong, it’s just there’s more on me as a bowler, especially if I’m the only spinner in the team. The more you play the more you get used to the nerves and start to embrace them.What advice would you give boys and girls thinking about trying to make a career out of cricket? (Rob Hamill) The cliche about working hard is true. But beyond this, I would tell any young cricketer to make sure they really enjoy the company and camaraderie. Runs and wickets are one thing, but the friendships you make during your playing days, and the times you enjoy together, will stay with you for ever.Hardest away ground you’ve played at? (Charlie @crobertson95Toughest place to tour? Declan Heels) Australia is for me, personally, the hardest place to tour. The wickets are so good for batting, which made bowling hard, and mentally it was quite challenging. In terms of the ground, Newlands in Cape Town is pretty tough to bowl on as a spinner.When was the last time you played a game for your local club side and how did it go? And do you think you’ll be tempted to play club cricket again when you eventually retire? (Tony Medlock) It was probably in 2014, a week before my Test debut. I have no idea how I got on, though. This year I have signed up for West Bromwich Dartmouth CC, where my two brothers (Kadeer and Omar) and cousin (Kabir) play. Any spare weekend, I’ll join them – if we get a season. I’ll play professionally for as long as I can and I’ll definitely play club cricket after that, probably until I can’t physically do it any more. There’s no ego. I don’t mind if the eyes go and some rubbish bowlers get me out – I’ve got out loads of times!The one thing you would change about cricket? (Sam @sam_willet) I’d probably say slightly fewer international fixtures or cut down some of the bigger tours length-wise – it can get very hard if you play all formats. One thing I wish we could change overall would be the price of equipment. It’s a very expensive sport to take up for kids if they want good-quality kit. Especially in England.What is the biggest meltdown you’ve witnessed when a dismissed batsman has returned to the dressing room? (Dan Davis) At Worcestershire it was Vikram Solanki putting his foot through a wall and getting it stuck in there. For England it was Alex Hales smashing his helmet up into the smallest pieces I’ve ever seen using his bat. Both were pretty funny.Which English Test ground is your favourite to bowl on and why? (Nathan Boroda) There’s two. Old Trafford for the bounce, which all spinners enjoy, and then also Lord’s for the slope. Even if there’s not much turn from the pitch, it gives you some natural variation to work with from either end.What style of batting best suits your game in the long format? You have been moved around the order with mixed success, but seem at your best when taking on the bowling. (Tom Barrington) It’s changed over time. When I first came in I was a bit more reserved, like during my first Test hundred at Headingley. That was the best of my five. But lower down the order I’ve always felt putting pressure back on the bowlers is the way to go. It has made trying to switch back and grind it out harder.How do you think I can get my young nephew and niece interested in the game? (Michael Brenna) Play the game with them and keep the drills very simple so that when they make those little improvements through repetition, it sparks their interest more and more.Do you ever see yourself captaining England and is it something you aspire to do? (James Hancock and Dave Churchley) There would probably need to be four players injured. I enjoy captaining Worcestershire and we’ve had success but with England it’s not something I’ve thought about too much. You have ambitions like anyone but, realistically, it’s not really crossed my mind.Favourite curry house in Birmingham? (Jack Downes) I don’t tend to go to them because the food at home is usually better. I like Lebanese or Moroccan restaurants when I’m out. My current favourite is Al-Bader, a Lebanese on Ladypool Road in Birmingham.Thoughts on Headingley 2014? You scored an unbeaten hundred and almost denied Sri Lanka a win only for Jimmy Anderson, last man in, to get out off the penultimate delivery. (Rex Clementine @RexClementine) The memories are a little bit bitter because we lost. But the innings did so much for my self-belief and knowing I could play at international level. It’s a shame too because if we’d saved the match that innings might have been spoken about more. We lost and it almost became a bit, yeah, whatever.Who is the greatest all-rounder, Kallis or Stokes? (Al Prince) It’s a tough one. You’d probably have to go Kallis as it stands because his body of work is so much bigger: more runs, wickets, catches etc. But if Stokesy carries on like he is he will become one of the greatest players to ever play the game. No doubt.Does racism still exist in top-flight cricket? (Stuart Drysdalen) I don’t really experience it these days. Maybe you hear the odd comment or a stereotype that sounds like it could be a bit ‘that way’. But I don’t think it’s really in the sport.Do you realise how much the majority of England fans love you and do you use a sports psychologist? (Simon Brett) The sports psychologists use me, rather than the other way around. In all seriousness, I do a bit but I also think there are limits and sometimes only a player or coach who has experienced the same problem as you’re facing can help.Yes and no on the fans question. You know there are a lot of fans and it’s nice to hear when they say they enjoy watching you play. True fans get it. But it doesn’t matter who you are, even Sachin Tendulkar or Virat Kohli, there will always be people against you for whatever reason. It’s not always cricket-related either.This current break has made me realise that when you find yourself surrounded by a few negative comments, somehow it’s all you can focus on. You have to be mentally stronger and filter more of it out.With so much happening in the world right now, this has been time to reflect. You realise you don’t know how long you are on earth and so what people might say about you really doesn’t matter. If that’s someone in the media talking about your cricket, they’re just doing their job and there is no point getting affected.It’s almost been a case of forgiving anyone who has ever said anything I didn’t like and now looking to start afresh when we get back playing. I may have felt like a scapegoat at times in the past but I’m over it now. It’s time to move on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2a3d89c19d4f0e3123071523cd3e27c42791a41/0_5_1654_994/master/1654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6892c4d1f0e53fc15ce442000e0322b4","title":"rerun the jewels the tv shows wed like to see back on the box","story":"There’s no need to just air old editions of 8 Out of 10 Cats – we could use this period to rediscover any number of lost greatsTelevision is on lockdown. New shows will keep arriving for a while because they’re filmed already, but soon schedulers will be subsisting on repeats. Yet, there’s no need to air old editions of 8 Out of 10 Cats – we could use this period to rediscover any number of lost greats. Here are 10 classics that are overdue a repeat.On the Air BBC Two, 1992Despite being David Lynch and Mark Frost’s follow-up to Twin Peaks, this experimental sitcom is seldom seen, especially in the US, where ABC axed it after three episodes. Set in the 1950s, it is a sort of surreal slapstick Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, centred on a washed-up star whose TV variety show is a farce thanks to the absurdly incompetent crew. After a brilliant opener, it goes round in wacky circles, so maybe just show that episode in a double bill with Lynch’s frightening, laugh-tracked 2002 web sitcom Rabbits.Holding On BBC Two, 1997Written by Tony Marchant and with a cast led by David Morrissey, this has still somehow fallen through the cracks of TV posterity: it is never repeated, and wasn’t even on DVD for years. Those who saw it will still recall its unique vibe of rage, redemption and despair, as a disparate gang of fragile Londoners all feel the shockwaves from a murder. Bleak and astringently funny – Phil Daniels’s bilious restaurant critic is unforgettable – at heart it is a compassionate portrait of urbanites so close together, and yet so alone.Wonder Showzen MTV2, 2005-06We need a network premiere for this weird-com, which was originally seen by about eight people but recently had its hand-washing sketch (“The shame never seems to scrub off”) go viral. A haunted spoof of Sesame Street, it features talking numbers with personality disorders, pre-teens delivering lines such as “I want to be remembered as a creepy loner”, and a segment where kids confront adults: the small girl asking Wall Street traders to “justify capitalism” now bears repeating.Dream Team Sky One, 1997-2007Obviously BBC One should be showing old Match of the Days on Saturday evenings but Sky can chip in by re-airing its bananas soap about purple-clad spice boys Harchester United: for the actually-OK scenes where actors were pasted into match footage for the chance to relive the prowess of club legends such as Karl Fletcher and (until John Terry blinded him) Luke Davenport and mainly for the cavalcade of poisonings, coach crashes and people being shot at Wembley after the cup final.In Bed With Chris Needham BBC Two, 1992In the 2000s this documentary’s fandom coalesced on messageboards, realising that, yes, lots of us do remember that metal kid in Loughborough. The cutely edited apotheosis of the “video diary”, it harks back to the era before social media made teens too savvy. Chris – whose crap tache and mullet confirm that, in the English provinces, 1992 and 1986 were the same year – unleashes his impossibly bad thrash band on the world, but it was his pronouncements that made him a one-man youthquake. “All you old bastards out there, you should learn something from this!”Public EyeITV, 1965-75The 1970s offers any number of series with cops or sleuths striding through a brown murk of smoky pubs, dingy digs and violent petty crime. This one is more level-headed than most, showcasing as it does Alfred Burke’s controlled performance as a private eye who is cheap, versatile and a bit too close to the bad guys, as evidenced by him at one point going to prison. Not so much gritty as simply grimy, it is a period piece, but the weary wryness and imperfect, sometimes open-ended, stories feel oddly modern.Play for Today BBC Two, 1970-84Now this is proper TV history, the telly equivalent of a crate full of collectable 45s. Schedulers can take their pick from the best (male) dramatists of the mid-to-late 20th century: Clarke, Osborne, Bleasdale, Hare, Bennett … all of whom tossed off singular dramas for a strand that was rarely bland. Candidates for an airing might include Mike Leigh’s clipped TV debut Hard Labour (1973), Dennis Potter’s disturbing 1976 meta-drama Double Dare, or David Pirie’s gothic horror of wartime paranoia, Rainy Day Women (1984).Home Time BBC Two, 2009Most comedy fans could devise an evening schedule of underrated shows (“Tonight on BBC Two, it’s Colin’s Sandwich, followed by 15 Storeys High, How Do You Want Me?, Catterick and If You See God, Tell Him”) but this one has been lost completely. Co-creator Emma Fryer is a 29-year-old forced by failure to move back from London to Coventry, where parents and old friends (Kerry Godliman, Rebekah Staton, Hayley Jayne Standing) await. A hymn to wistful regret aimed at knackered Britpop kids, it bristles with tart details but has proper sitcom plotting underneath.Dave Allen in Search of the Great English Eccentric ITV, 1974Society’s peripheral figures are a proven route to docu-gold (a shout out here for the outstanding 2015 Storyville film The Lost Gold of the Highlands), but the genre’s never topped this. Dave Allen puts comedy aside, and features himself as little as possible, as he meets an Eastbourne couple who are members of the Sioux nation, a chap with mice in the brim of his hat, and other oddballs. He gets something good out of all of them.After Dark Channel 4, 1987-97Best known for the episode where a conversation about male violence was derailed by a heroically drunk Oliver Reed, this talkshow has much to teach modern TV. It picked one knotty topic per week, then filled sofas with a lively mix of academics, experts and celeb wildcards and let them argue. With no host, no audience and a distinct lack of commentators fighting an unending culture war, it offered a thing that’s now extinct: constructive debate.The Wright WayBBC One, 2013Ben Elton is good again these days because of Upstart Crow, but he was bad with this instantly notorious sitcom howler, a runny mess of brutally forced innuendo. Everyone involved now pretends they weren’t.Bonekickers BBC One, 2008Does mystery-solving drama still work if they’re archaeologists, not cops? No it doesn’t, at least on the evidence of Hugh Bonneville, Julie Graham, Adrian Lester and Gugu Mbatha-Raw digging themselves a reputational crater.Curry \u0026amp Chips ITV, 1969A vault somewhere contains this Spike Milligan brown-face catastrophe (pictured), along with misjudged race-relations sitcoms such as Mind Your Language and Love Thy Neighbour. Let’s keep it sealed.I Love My CountryBBC One, 2013Brexit was directly caused by this Saturday night atrocity, an aggressively jolly quiz in which celebs answered questions about Britain in front of a foamingly patriotic audience.Animal PassionsChannel 4, 2004We’re ready to re-watch virtually anything. Are we ready for a documentary about Britain’s zoophiles, frankly discussing how they have sex with ponies and dogs?

It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was – and always will be – central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 201415, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.Is it harder to do in the case of a respiratory infection?Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street. It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure – originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So the contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.What do the contact tracers do then?In the way it was operating in February, the tracer would call the contacts and ask them how close they had been to the person with symptoms and establish whether they were low-risk or high-risk. If the latter, they would be asked to isolate themselves for 14 days at home. The contact tracers would either call each day to check how they were or ask them to phone if they felt ill. If they developed symptoms, the tracers would start again, looking for their contacts in turn.Who does the contact tracing?It is organised by Public Health England, which had 290 staff doing it before community testing stopped in mid-March. Public health in recent years has been the responsibility of local government, so any increase in contact tracers might come from councils.Which other countries have done this to scale?South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine. Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The World Health Organization says it should be the “backbone of the response” in every country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/278efe2de5529ef6c89322ec444d947899ed1b45/0_191_6145_3687/master/6145.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4ca84860a0da052c379bffad8aad09c","title":"sick elderly pregnant the california renters being evicted even during the pandemic","story":"Despite new tenant protections, landlords are pushing out residents who can’t pay rent, making some homeless amid Covid-19When Covid-19 halted California’s economy, state officials promised to prevent evictions and defend tenants’ rights. But a dozen renters and their attorneys told the  that some landlords are proceeding to expel them from their homes despite the new regulations, indicating there are significant gaps in the protections.Those tenants include a pregnant woman, a cancer patient, an elderly woman, a mother of six, several newly unemployed low-wage workers and others vulnerable to Covid-19.Unable to pay rent in April, they have faced eviction notices on their doors, police officers attempting to remove them, pressure from property owners to immediately vacate and written demands from landlords spreading falsehoods about the emergency laws. Some tenants said they were moving out as a result, becoming homeless amid a pandemic.“We want to pay, but we don’t have the money,” said Virginia Gómez, a 51-year-old Los Angeles woman threatened with eviction from her home of three years. The property owner of her building last week repeatedly called police to try to remove her and her six children after she couldn’t immediately pay full rent due. “I told the police, ‘You guys are wearing masks and gloves, but you want to throw us out to the streets when the virus is out there?’ How are we supposed to ‘stay at home’ when they kick us out?”As California prepared to implement a shelter-in-place order to stop the spread of the virus, government leaders acknowledged that rent would be an urgent and vast problem. In March, the governor ordered a two-month statewide delay on imposing evictions for people who cannot pay rent due to Covid-19. The order prevents the enforcement of evictions until the end of May, but requires tenants to repay the full amount later. Some cities, like Oakland and LA, have adopted stronger protections.But the accounts and records from tenants across the state indicate those regulations ultimately fail to provide relief for those who are most in need, and are not being properly enforced. In some cases, the confusing patchwork of local ordinances has allowed landlords to continue targeting tenants in a state that had a severe housing crisis before coronavirus.Roughly 2.7 million people have filed unemployment claims in California since residents were ordered to stay home. Across the US, an estimated one-third of renters didn’t pay April rent.Though the courts are not currently processing evictions, some landlords are still starting the process, or unlawfully attempting to remove tenants. It’s difficult to know how many tenants across the state are threatened with eviction, but advocates in LA, the Bay Area, and parts of the Central Valley say they have anecdotally heard of a handful of cases in which owners have launched evictions. They are hearing more frequently about tenants facing misinformation and misleading threats from landlords.Krystal McMorris, 29, is pregnant and currently fighting to keep her apartment in Alameda, an island across the bay from San Francisco: “I don’t have any options. I have to stay here. I have to fight. If not, I will be homeless and pregnant. I already fear this stress is going to cause me to lose my baby.”McMorris worked for six years for FPI Management, a real estate corporation, as an on-site property manager, a job which included her apartment. After the pandemic was declared last month, FPI terminated her position and told her she had 30 days to move out, despite the eviction moratorium and regional shelter-in-place orders. When McMorris asked the company to allow her to stay until the Covid-19 emergency had passed, telling her boss she was pregnant, the company responded that she “does not have rights” and that it could have forced her out in three days, but instead gave her until 17 April.“If she fails to vacate by that deadline, we will take immediate legal action to regain possession of the unit as soon as legally possible,” Brandi Hutchinson, FPI senior director, wrote to McMorris’s attorney, adding that she would now owe $3,030 a month.Despite her fears of contracting Covid-19, McMorris went to multiple open houses around the Bay Area last weekend in hopes of finding a new apartment, exposing herself to strangers, but found nothing affordable or livable. “There’s no housing, no employment. Everyday I’m afraid. It’s been dreadful, scary, stressful, frustrating.”McMorris, who lost her health insurance and has been unable to go to the doctor, said she wants to leave her apartment, but has nowhere to go. “People are dying left and right. I was just asking that they at least give me more time.”FPI’s chief operating officer, Dave Divine, did not respond to specific questions about how the company plans to “regain possession” of her apartment, but said in an email that “FPI is compassionate to Ms McMorris’ situation” and has not forced her to pay rent . “FPI’s actions have been and shall remain consistent with all applicable laws.”Gómez, the mother of six, has lived with her family for three years in the Courtyard Motel in Downey, an LA suburb. Although it’s a motel, she and other tenants live there full-time and, according to attorneys, are protected under anti-eviction laws, including the new Covid-19 regulations. But after the father of her children lost most of his income at a restaurant due to Covid-19, the family ran out of money to pay rent. She said she pleaded with the motel manager, saying she would pay everything she had as soon as possible.Managers responded by calling the Downey police department to remove her, and officers showed up to her door, telling her she had to leave. Because she happened to be on the phone at the time with Monica Arellano, an attorney with the Legal Aid Foundation of LA, the lawyer was able to talk to the officers and explain the law. Police eventually left, but the motel called the department again multiple times that day, requiring her to repeatedly explain her rights to new officers.She still paid the minimal cash they could, $370, after getting a check, leaving her with little money for other basic necessities. She said the managers continue to threaten her. “Anytime I leave my room, I fear they are going to call the cops on my kids, and I’ll come back and they’ll be kicked out,” said Gómez, who has lupus, a long-term autoimmune disease that puts her at higher risk of Covid-19 complications. “I keep telling them whatever money we have we’ll give it to them.”The Downey police department did not respond to inquiries. Reached by phone, Rushabh Bhakta, a representative with the motel, said his staff made a payment arrangement with Gómez after calling police.Sonia Aguilar, 43, who is recovering from breast cancer, has faced threats from her LA landlord, who has said he wants her family out by the end of April. Earlier in the year, Aguilar, her husband and three children had planned to move, but once the pandemic hit, it became impossible and dangerous for her: “I have underlying health issues and I only go out for food and medicine. I’m not in any condition to rent a U-Haul. It’s scary.”But the landlord, Ezequiel Navar, won’t stop calling them, she said: “The stress is making me more ill.”Some tenants are fighting hard to assert their rights in the face of eviction threats.“I knew it wasn’t an obligation to pay, and that it was better to keep that money for food and emergencies,” said Michelle Johnson, a 28-year-old LA resident recently furloughed from her job at a coffee company. After she told her property manager she couldn’t pay, the manager said she was required to submit three pay stubs, proof of unemployment and two bank statements, and then sign a payment plan. None of this is required by law. The manager then taped an eviction notice on her door, a “three-day notice” to pay or leave, the first step of an eviction lawsuit.“It was not only an intimidation tactic for me, but it was also for other tenants to see,” said Johnson, whose apartment is near the front door of the building. “Unfortunately for y’all, you picked the wrong informed tenant. I know this is illegal.”It was still emotional for Johnson, who experienced homelessness as a child. But she responded with an email reminding the manager of her rights, and then filed a complaint with the city. “The city isn’t doing enough to make sure landlords are doing their job.” (LA’s housing department did not respond to a request for comment.)Shirin Bina, 36, said she “completely fell apart” and cried for days after receiving a similar three-day eviction notice on her door in Oakland. “It just seemed like she had absolutely no regard for me as a human being,” Bina said of her landlord, Debra Reese. “She broke the ‘shelter in place’ to put that on my door.”Bina told Reese she couldn’t pay after losing a job as a bookkeeper and other work. She reminded her landlord of Oakland’s ordinance. Reese responded: “You failed to provide documentation and you failed to pay your rent therefore this method will be utilized.”Bina said she has struggled at times to understand her rights, adding, “If there’s such severe repercussions for a tenant not paying rent, there should be severe repercussions for a landlord abusing the law at this point.”Reese did not respond to inquiries.Chris Tyler’s landlord in LA asked that he sign an agreement saying he would immediately report his “stimulus payments, unemployment benefits, payments related to paid family leave, disability insurance payments and Covid-19 related loans” so the owner can ‘“accelerate amounts due”. Tyler, who works with the LA Tenants Union and lost his job at a bar, said he knew not to agree to the contract, but worries about others: “When you’re in a precarious situation, and you don’t know your rights, you obviously feel compelled to sign.”The LA Tenants Union has urged people to withhold rent and has called for lawmakers to freeze rent and mortgage payments during the crisis. If the state passed a rent forgiveness law, it would ensure tenants avoid insurmountable debts. In the meantime, advocates said, cities should proactively enforce the protections in place and hold landlords accountable when they violate renters’ rights.The tenants union is also assisting 70-year-old Pamela Fairbanks. She paid her rent, but her landlord, Steve Kaali, showed up at her door this week with an eviction notice, alleging she had too many cats. Fairbanks, who has lived in her apartment for 25 years, said she has long owned three cats. She said she has also been in quarantine for weeks while recovering from bacterial pneumonia: “I panicked. I was shaking. I could barely breathe through the tears.” Reached by phone, Kaali said the cats were an ongoing issue because they go in and out of the apartment, and his eviction notice was meant to be a “scare tactic” to get her to install a window screen: “I’m not taking her to court knowing I’m not going to win.”He added that he hadn’t tried to remove her from her rent-controlled apartment and bring in a higher-paying tenant: “I could’ve been a slumlord scumbag who kicks everyone out. I did not.”Jonathan Cañez and Tamiaya Moore, roommates who live in Bakersfield in the Central Valley, both lost their longtime jobs at a local hotel due to Covid-19. When they told their landlord they couldn’t pay rent, the manager told them they would owe the full amount and should move out if they can’t afford it.“We decided it’s better to just cut our losses,” said Cañez, 25, who is moving in with his brother. They didn’t know how they would ever be able to pay back the rent: “I’ve worked so hard to have this place to call my own, a safe space. To have that shift away from me has been very hard and humiliating.”Moore, 26, is going to sleep on an air mattress at a friend’s house for now. She’s been applying to jobs at grocery stores, but is also afraid of working there due to her asthma and the reality that essential workers are dying on the job. “I’m emotional because I was just getting my life together. Now it’s going to be rough for awhile.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f076725d5c5fb6452ffc9185218e32b75b3ff0a1/178_146_3972_2383/master/3972.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b639b58c4d92aa601025cead0f62e25b","title":"uk to start coronavirus contact tracing again","story":"Matt Hancock says government to rebuild teams amid criticism it stopped strategy too earlyBritain is to restart tracing the contacts of people who have had coronavirus symptoms, the health secretary has said, reverting to a policy recommended by the World Health Organization but abandoned by the UK as the numbers of cases and deaths began to rise in early March.Matt Hancock told the health select committee on Friday that police, fire, prison and Department of Work and Pensions staff would now be eligible for coronavirus testing, amid growing concerns that the country will miss its target of 100,000 coronavirus tests a day by the end of April.A former director of the WHO told the hearing that contact tracing, testing and isolation could have continued for longer across the UK and would have enabled the government to lock down London while leaving other areas of the country with fewer restrictions.Prof Anthony Costello, the head of the Institute for Global Health at University College London, pointed out that Yorkshire had fewer than 10 cases identified in 300,000-400,000 people around the time that contact tracing and community testing were halted and, as such, could have avoided a complete lockdown.Critics have said the UK was too quick to stop the universal testing of people with symptoms, and following up with their recent contacts, who could then be asked to self-isolate.The WHO has repeatedly urged governments to pursue the strategy, which has been key to stopping epidemics around the world in modern times. “Tracing every contact must be the backbone of the response in every country,” the director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said in March.Other countries such as Singapore and South Korea, have successfully used it to contain their outbreaks, while Germany, which has a far lower case and death rate than the UK, has also worked hard on contact tracing.But on 12 March, Boris Johnson announced that the UK epidemic could no longer be contained that way. Testing was then restricted to those who were admitted to hospital, and contact tracing was stopped. The numbers of cases and deaths in the UK soared and a lockdown was imposed on 23 March.Hancock said on Friday that the government would rebuild the teams of contact tracers as part of a renewed testing and tracing strategy.His predecessor Jeremy Hunt, who is chair of the health select committee of MPs where Hancock was giving evidence, pointed out that South Korea had up to 1,000 contact tracers. “Public Health England had 290 people doing this at their peak, but they now say it has been wound down. Are we going to build it up again?” he asked.Hancock said yes and that contact tracing teams would be part of a strategy that included the use of a phone app to identify recent contacts and warn them that they might need to self-isolate.“The app is itself a contact tracing app, that is the point of it, to be able to assist iniduals to do contact tracing themselves by notifying people who they have been in close contact with when they have downloaded the app. And then of course link that to testing, so people can get the tests.”Testing, tracing and isolating the contacts of people with Covid-19 is expected to be a key part of the exit strategy for every country that has imposed a lockdown, as a way to keep control of the epidemic. Asked if he accepted that comprehensive contact tracing would need to be in place to lift the UK lockdown, Hancock said the government was working “incredibly hard” on the WHO-recommended strategy.“We do need to have comprehensive test, track and trace in place as soon as possible,” he said. “And we need to get the technology right, we need to have the people, and we’re building that resource, and obviously we need to have the testing and we’re ramping that up as well. So we do need to have all three of those in place and we’re working incredibly hard to make sure that we are.”Earlier, Costello said the nationwide lockdown could have been avoided, with only the capital facing severe restrictions.He said the example of 10 identified cases in 300,000-400,000 people in Yorkshire meant that in such areas people could have continued to go about their lives and work while maintaining physical distancing.Hancock admitted the government had discussed it. “We did consider having a London-specific lockdown and decided it was better to do it across the country as a whole.”This was because people would be travelling between London and other parts of the UK and, he said, it was striking how the country had come together to observe the restrictions. “To separate one part of the country from another has downsides in terms of the national unity we have seen in the response.”Johnson’s spokesman later declined to say anything beyond Hancock’s words on the possible scale of testing needed to implement a full regime of contact tracing.He also declined to comment on why the UK did not isolate or trace people arriving in the country from overseas, while adding that this policy could potentially change in the future: “We’ve always said that we don’t rule out taking steps if that’s what the science advises.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/616c77b5b7be00424df70e728de7e9f1c89449e7/0_78_3210_1926/master/3210.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd8f785ad11d6aed16a1388805c27aaa","title":"caught in a superpower struggle the inside story of the whos response to coronavirus","story":"Caught between the US and China, the world health body has been unable to enforce compliance or information sharing When a pandemic strikes, the world’s leading experts convene – physically or virtually – in a hi-tech chamber in the basement of the Geneva headquarters of the World Health Organization.It is called the “strategic health operations centre”, or SHOC, an appropriately urgent acronym for a place where life and death decisions are taken, and it is where critical choices were made in the early days of the coronavirus outbreak.“We’re mostly like a 1950s, never-been-upgraded place, except for the SHOC room, which was built with all the screens everywhere and the desks with computers that rise up. The whole thing does look like something that Hollywood set up, imagining a pandemic,” a WHO official said.“You sit there and you hear these experts from all over the world and they’re really leading people. The best expertise available to get the best advice possible, it’s a very impressive sense that hey, this is really how it is supposed to work.”On 22 January, it was in this setting that the WHO emergency committee convened to make a pivotal decision on whether to advise the organisation to declare a “public health emergency of international concern” (PHEIC) – a formal red alert for the world.The WHO had been sharing information with member states constantly since the first cluster of pneumonia cases was first identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of December, but declaring a PHEIC still had huge symbolic importance.The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, sat in the SHOC with his top advisers watching as a succession of speakers gave their views on the screens in front of them.First there were reports from China, and then Japan and Thailand where cases had been recently confirmed. Then it was the turn of the 15 members and six advisers on the emergency committee, drawn from around the world.The debate was highly technical but it had one critical issue at its heart. It was known by then that the virus had spread from person to person, but the question was how easily?If human-to-human transmission was only happening in close quarters, in families, or between patients and health workers, then perhaps it could be largely contained without a worldwide alert, and all the global economic disruption that entailed. If the virus was spreading freely among communities, there was not a moment to lose.The emergency committee was split down the middle on the question. So Tedros told it to convene again the next day, in the hope new data might create a consensus.“Tedros’s only obligation under the law is to convene a committee but not to follow it. But he feels that politically he needs to get a unanimous decision before he acts or at least an overwhelming majority,” Lawrence Gostin, a professor of public health law at Georgetown University, said.The second day’s meeting however, changed no one’s mind, and the impasse remained. Tedros had the committee adjourn pending further study and put it on notice to reconvene at short notice. A international health emergency was declared a week later, on 30 January, after clear evidence of community spread of Covid-19 had emerged.The events of January were always destined for scrutiny. The WHO conducts an after-action report in wake of every pandemic. But by seeking to make the global body the scapegoat for the debacle of the US response, Donald Trump has ensured each detail will become exhibits in a highly-politicised show-trial, likely to last as long as the election campaign.Furthermore, the president has used claims of WHO’s dysfunction to justify cutting off US funding to it, worth over $400m a year, and hindering the organisation’s ability to help counter the spread of the pandemic in fragile and poor countries around the world.In a hail of accusations hurled at the WHO in recent days, Trump has accused it of withholding critical information about the danger of Covid-19, and being under the control of China.None of the accusations are supported by the facts.China argued against declaring an emergency on 22 January, but could not have carried the argument alone. The other emergency members and advisers came were experts from the US, Thailand, Russia, France, South Korea, Canada, Japan, Netherlands, Australia, Senegal, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, and New Zealand.Their advice is confidential, but for the vote to have been split, several western, or western-aligned, representatives must have voted with Beijing.While the emergency committee took a week to decide to declare a PHEIC, Trump spent more than a month after that playing down the threat to the US, during which the country fell weeks behind the rest of the world in diagnostic testing and stockpiling essential equipment.There is no evidence to support Trump’s claim that the WHO hid information at China’s behest. The US is well represented in the top ranks of the organisation. There were more than a dozen officials from the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) embedded in the WHO in January and February.US health leaders were part of regular conference calls, weekly or twice weekly, beginning on 7 January. From 10 January those calls included warnings about the risk of human-to-human transmission.Trump’s most recent line of attack has been that the WHO ignored vital warnings from Taiwan.“Why did the WHO Ignore an email from Taiwanese health officials in late December alerting them to the possibility that coronvirus could be transmitted between humans?” the president asked in a tweet on Friday, echoing a claim made by Taipei.However, the Taiwanese email appears to have made no such warning. It was sent from Taiwan’s CDC to its WHO liaison officer on 31 December, hours after the first official report of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan were published online.According to the text provided to the , the email said: “News resources today indicate that at least seven, atypical pneumonia cases were reported in China.”It restates the details of Chinese report, adding “I would greatly appreciate it if you have relevant information to share with us.”The email did not contain new information, and certainly nothing about human-to-human transmission. The WHO had picked up the same report on the night of 30 December and was urgently seeking more information. On 1 January it activated its incident management support team, putting the organisation on an emergency footing.The Taiwanese government has claimed that it did not receive a reply to its inquiry and was generally shut out from WHO deliberations. Since the UN voted to recognise the People’s Republic as the sole representative of China in 1971 and the World Health Assembly followed suit in 1972, Taiwan has not had full member status in the WHO, but it is involved in the organisation’s work.It is one of 15 non-state entities that have access to expert deliberations through an information network established by the International Health Regulations (IHR), a pact on collective action against infectious disease with roots stretching back to the nineteenth century. The latest version was agreed in 2005 by 196 countries, and it provides the legal framework for the work of the WHO.However, Taiwan says its participation is fragmentary and selective, largely because Chinese obstruction. A Taipei government statement pointed out that it reported its first confirmed coronavirus case on 21 January through the IHR system, but was not invited to participate in the three emergency committee meetings held in January, where its voice may have made a difference.“The Covid-19 outbreak is a reminder to all the world once again, that politics has barred Taiwan from contact and communication with WHO and global public health experts, and this can only gravely damage global cooperation in epidemic prevention and control,” the statement said.Tedros has also drawn criticism for his tireless praise of China and Xi Jinping’s leadership, hailing Beijing’s transparency despite the critical early weeks left when the authorities tried to cover up the extent of the problem in Wuhan. The director general’s defenders say such diplomatic flattery is the price of ensuring Chinese cooperation with information and WHO site visits. Tedros also complimented Trump in a March 23 tweet, claiming he was doing “a great job in the fight against Covid-19”, and Trump was also effusive in praising Xi in the first weeks of the pandemic.“They’re making it seem like he’s a crony of China, but he’s caught in the middle of a super power struggle competition,” Gostin said.The WHO also provided ammunition to its detractors when, on 14 January, it put out a tweet citing preliminary Chinese studies finding “no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission”.It was issued on the same day the WHO’s technical lead on Covid-19, Maria Van Kerkhove (a US immunologist) gave a press briefing in Geneva warning of precisely the opposite – the potential for rapid spread. Concerned that her briefing conflicted with the initial Chinese findings, a middle-ranking official told the social media team to put out a tweet to balance the Van Kerkhove briefing. In so doing, the WHO exposed itself to the charge of contributing to an air of complacency. But the tweet was factually true and does not appear to have been part of a deliberate strategy.Again and again, the events of January reflected the difficulties Tedros and his organisation faced in negotiating a path between two hostile superpowers, and the egos of their leaders, without any independent powers to enforce compliance and information sharing.However, what mistakes that may have been made in charting that course have little to do with the lethal fiasco that unfolded in the US in the two months after the WHO raised an international alarm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance saturday 18 april","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:More than 2.2 million people have been infected worldwide with Covid-19 and at least 154,219 people have died since the outbreak began, according to Johns Hopkins University.The figures, which are based on official data and media reports, are likely to underestimate the true scale of the pandemic due to suspected underreporting and differing testing regimes.Donald Trump said that protestors who flouted social distancing measures “seem to be very responsible people”. Demonstrations against stay-at-home orders, which have drawn elements of the far right, have been held in Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina and Virginia. Some protesters have carried guns, waved Trump and Confederate flags and sought to frame the debate as a defence of constitutional freedoms.President Trump also cast doubt on China’s death toll, which was revised up on Friday, and said that “a lot of strange things are happening” regarding the origins of the coronavirus. While the source of the virus is unknown, the broad scientific consensus is that it originated in bats.Trump’s coronavirus task force members have pushed back against criticism that limited testing ability is preventing the country from tackling the virus.Hospitals in Japan are increasingly turning away sick people as the country struggles with surging coronavirus infections and its emergency medical system collapses according to reports. Japan’s total infections stand at more than 9,800, with 207 deaths, according to a tally by public broadcaster NHK.China’s politburo has said that the government must pursue a comprehensive reopening of China’s economy while taking steps to restrict the spread of coronavirus, it was reported by China’s state-run Global Times. The meeting on Friday also said government spending should be increased and the central bank should cut market loan rates to support business. China reported 27 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, of which 17 were linked to foreign travel. No new fatalities were recorded.All airline passengers in Canada will be required to wear a non-medical masks or face coverings during travel to curb the spread of coronavirus. The regulator said travellers must cover their mouth and nose during the boarding process and flights. The rule goes into effect on Monday.The Guatemalan president Alejandro Giammattei has said that migrants who were deported from the US on Monday were infected with Covid-19. Giammattei said 12 randomly selected migrants who took the flight from the US tested positive for coronavirus when examined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US health protection agency.

Now there are calls to relax the rules amid growing concern over their mental healthWith each passing day, the bickering bouncing off the walls of one 90-metre square apartment in Barcelona has sharpened further. As Spain’s confinement stretches past five weeks, Ada Colau has watched her two children, aged nine and three, wilt under the pressure of life in lockdown.“Week after week, they fight with each other more and more. They have fits of sadness, of anger,” said the mayor of Barcelona. “The three-year-old, who was already out of nappies, has regressed and never asks to go to the bathroom any more.”Colau is unequivocal about the cause: a lockdown that has left children in Spain confined to their homes longer – and under stricter conditions – than anywhere else in Europe.“We have spent more than a month at home with two small children, who haven’t left home for even one single day,” said Colau. “These children need to get out.”The leftwing mayor is equally as clear about the remedy: “Wait no longer: Free our children!” Colau urged on social media last week. Politicians of all stripes have echoed her call, as have hundreds of doctors, psychologists and educators, citing concerns about children’s ability to manage issues such as anxiety and stress while being kept entirely indoors.The Spanish government plunged the country into a near-total lockdown on 14 March, ordering most residents to remain at home at all times, allowed out inidually and only for short trips to buy food, medicine, or to walk the dog. Save for a few exceptions – such as children with special educational needs or single-parent families – minors are to remain in their homes.The stringent measures were unleashed as the country tackled a Covid-19 outbreak that was spreading at one of the fastest rates in the world. Spain has seen more deaths per million than any other country, with more than 19,000 people killed as the virus raced through the country. Amid concerns that the actual number of deaths caused by the virus could be much higher, the government has said the lockdown is likely to stretch into mid-May. Recent days have seen the calls for children to be let out intensify – particularly after the government relaxed the lockdown to allow some non-essential workers to return to factories and construction sites.“Why do our children have to keep waiting?” Colau asked, arguing parents could be trusted to safely take their children out for walks close to home. “Let’s find a way to do it right and according to the advice of health experts.”Her view was echoed by more than 300 professionals who work with children – from psychologists to paediatricians – who signed an open letter to the socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez.“The results of this rigid confinement for children are beginning to show, particularly in urban areas with limited domestic spaces, with increased levels of stress and anxiety,” the letter read, urging that children be let out for at least one hour each day. Not doing so, it added, risks their “wellbeing, their health and their physical and mental development”.In France and Belgium children are allowed out of their homes for one hour each day within a limited distance. After weeks of total confinement, Italian authorities now allow minors out for a walk close to home, accompanied by one parent. Last week, Denmark reopened its primary schools and kindergartens, while Norway plans to follow suit later this month.The Spanish government has so far fended off any push to relax the rules, advising caution in a country where multi-generational families are common. “The measures – some of the strictest in Europe – are out of prudence, as children are a vector of transmission,” Salvador Illa, the country’s health minister told reporters last week. His government is monitoring the epidemiological data to decide when it will be safe to allow children outside, he added.Those who work with children say they have already seen a rise in anxiety issues. “We’re seeing more children with nervousness, more with insomnia, more with chest and stomach pains,” said Madrid paediatrician Alicia Arévalo.She stressed, however, that these cases were a minority. “I have families telling me that they’re rebuilding relationships now that day-to-day life has calmed,” she said, citing adolescents who said they were speaking more to their parents or engaging in more family time with activities such as baking or painting.That may be the case for some children, said Freire. But she warned against any generalisation, noting that the situation risks exacerbating existing inequalities. “You can’t compare a child that lives in a 600-metre square house with a backyard with a child that lives in a 30- or 50-metre square apartment without a balcony,” she said. “You can’t compare parents who have no economic problems with children whose parents have been temporarily laid off, or who have lost their jobs.”She argued that the issue was fundamentally one of human rights. “By law, children have the right to fresh air, sunlight, movement, play and contact with other children,” she said. “In my view, a society that doesn’t put its children ahead of everything – that doesn’t ensure their needs are met – is sliding back towards barbarism. It’s completely inhumane.”"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

There are five Irish people still on the ship, four members of the band Emerald Tide and an engineer.The passengers of the cruise ship got word on March 16th that the prime minister of New Zealand was closing the ports and no longer allowing ships to enter the country, which resulted in the ship making a three-day voyage back to Sydney, where 2,700 passengers disembarked on March 19th.“On March 20th, we got word that there were positive cases on board, so we were quarantined and isolated here then on March 21st,” Ms Heneghan said on the Late Late Show on Friday night.The Ruby Princess cruise ship, owned by Carnival Corp, has been docked at Port Kembla in New South Wales since and has been linked to hundreds of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Australia and about a third of the country’s reported deaths.The violinist and harpist described her situation as a “huge scandal”. Speaking to the talk show host Ryan Tubridy, Ms Heneghan said her contract as a musician aboard the cruise ship was due to finish on April 4th, but she remains unaware to date of when she and the other band members will be allowed to disembark from the ship.“It’s a big political game of chess at the moment,” Ms Heneghan told Mr Tubridy, regarding the police investigation into whether there was criminal negligence in the handling of the health issues on the cruise ship.“We’re just pawns in this big political game and kind of forgotten about until decisions are made and we get news that we can disembark and get repatriated home.”“We were told via intercom by the hotel general manager, who updates us daily, that there was a possibility of us going to Manila to let off the Filipino crew. One of our sister ships is outside Manila and the Philippines won’t let them port. We also heard through the media that we might be going to the United States, which would be disastrous for us because we don’t have visas,” she said.Ms Heneghan told Mr Tubridy that her “one wish” for the four Irish in her band and the fifth Irish citizen on board is “to get off this boat before it sails away”.Despite the situation, the young woman was in good spirits and said “structure and routine” have been “absolutely vital in maintaining a bit of sanity”. Ms Heneghan spends her days doing yoga, practicing her instruments, watching Netflix and staying in contact with friends and family.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4231840.1587149581!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"keelings and covid 19 reaping the whirlwind or harvest","story":"Dr Tony Holohan has said that the chartering of flights to bring workers into the country is not consistent with the public health advice, when asked about the KeelingsRyanair controversy.

Up to 70 per cent return year after year, it said. Few applicationsThis year, the company advertised locally for staff more than two weeks ago but had received just 27 applications by last week. It received a further 13 applications on Friday. According to the Irish Farmers’ Association (IFA) “probably 100 per cent of horticulture farms have some form of labour from overseas”, typically from Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and, in recent years, mainly Romania and Bulgaria. “Most of these seasonal workers have been returning to the same jobs and farms for years and therefore are already fully trained and suited to the nature of the work,” it said. “In the past two weeks there has not been any major interest in jobs advertised in the sector. Even during the last recession when unemployment was at 15 per cent, there was very little interest from the domestic labour force.” Farm accommodationThose who come to Ireland supply the soft fruit sector from May to September, vegetables from June to November, and protected crops such as tomatoes from April to October. In most cases, accommodation is arranged by the farms. On Friday, a statement from the Government said: “Seasonal workers are critical to the agricultural sector in terms of harvesting, planting and tending functions, especially in the current season.” The EU has defined agricultural seasonal workers as essential workers. According to the IFA, Germany recently relaxed its rules and is allowing 80,000 seasonal workers into the country during April and May.It said it was “very important to stress that the workers will be following all guidelines issued by the Government in relation to Covid-19”.

Photogrpah: Jess LoweBells will ring out in the Creggan in Derry on Saturday to mark the first anniversary of the murder of 29-year-old Belfast journalist Lyra McKee.Ms McKee was shot dead on April 18th last year as she was observing rioting in the city. The New IRA admitted the murder.A special Mass is to be offered in St Mary’s Chapel in Creggan by the parish priest who anointed her, Fr Joe Gormley. The Mass, which also will be in memory of Ms McKee’s mother, Joan Lawrie, who died last month, will be held at 6.30pm while the bells will ring at 8.30pm. The Mass can be viewed via the church’s webcam. Bells also will be rung in her native city of Belfast on Saturday to mark the anniversary.Fr Gormley said it was important that Ms McKee be remembered. “It is also important that Lyra does not become another statistic of the Troubles,” he said.“The effects of every killing of the Troubles continue on and on,” he said. “I am thinking how the death of her mother highlights the fact that people do carry pain to their graves, and it does hasten people going to their graves as well.” Ms McKee’s partner, Sara Canning, said on Friday she still hoped there would be justice. She described the past 12 months as the “most horrific and surreal year”.“I miss my life with her. If I could go back to this time last year I’d do things differently,” she told BBC Radio Foyle. “I wish we stayed in bed that night and just read books and talked nonsense to each other. I really hope we get justice. I don’t want to give up hope,” Ms Canning added.On Saturday at 11am, National Union of Journalist (NUJ) members will join “in solidarity and remembrance” to mark the first anniversary of the murder. The NUJ is to celebrate Ms McKee’s life and legacy and has encouraged members and friends of Ms McKee to take part in a symbolic virtual commemoration.The union has asked that social media be used “to highlight the shared values which Lyra embraced under the banner #WeStandWithLyra”.The NUJ has also asked media workers to share examples of Ms McKee’s journalism, tributes, memories and pictures on Saturday morning.Community helpThis week, the PSNI detective leading the murder investigation wrote to residents in the Creggan asking for community help in convicting her killers.Detective Superintendent Jason Murphy said: “Lyra’s murder was not committed in isolation, nor did it involve only one person. The events that led up to Lyra being shot, and the events afterwards, are equally important. I am asking the community to reach into its conscience and tell us what it knows.”Amnesty International’s Northern Ireland director Patrick Corrigan said Ms McKee’s murder was a “reminder of the risks that reporters face every day around the world, including here in Northern Ireland”.He said: “Northern Ireland continues to be the most dangerous part of the UK to be a journalist, threatening press freedom daily. In the year since Lyra’s death, reporters have continued to receive threats of violence and death on a regular basis.”Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken in marking the anniversary said that a truly peaceful society can emerge in Northern Ireland only when all communities give total support to the police and help them to put criminal gangs out of business.“The people responsible for Lyra McKee’s murder – like their criminal counterparts elsewhere in Northern Ireland – seek to invoke a political cause to try to give a veneer of respectability to their criminal activities,” he said.

The British government’s plan to deal with legacy issues from the Troubles, announced on March 18th, also promises to be a focus when normal life resumes, he said. Mr Mulvaney, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in March, had been scheduled to make his first visit to Northern Ireland as US special envoy next month. But the coronavirus has put that plan on hold. “I have been using the time to familiarise myself with the issues. Obviously, Covid-19 is the focus of everyone’s attention right now. It’s a very fluid situation,” he said, speaking from his home in South Carolina, the state he represented in Congress before joining the Trump administration. Like millions of people across the United States, the former White House chief of staff has been working from home where he is based with his wife and three children, as states have imposed stay-at-home restrictions. He says he will visit Northern Ireland “as soon as the door opens”.Interest in positionThe Irish-American politician has been communicating with Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, and Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis in the past few weeks.He has also spoken to previous holders of the post, such as Richard Haass, chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, who was appointed by George W Bush. Mr Mulvaney (52), who reportedly had expressed a long-held interest in the position that had been vacant since the end of the Obama presidency, said his appointment was a measure of the Trump administration’s interest in Northern Ireland and Brexit in particular. He said Mr Trump views the post as akin to the role held by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who he appointed to manage the White House strategy on the Middle East. “The president knew that Brexit is going to be a big deal – it’s a big deal just generally, and in terms of North-South relations – so he said to me: ‘Jared is going to go and take care of the Palestinians and Israelis, you make sure things go smoothly over there,” says Mr Mulvaney. The husband of Mr Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, is widely viewed to have had minimal success with bringing peace to the Middle East. Trump and PompeoMr Mulvaney visited Northern Ireland in February ahead of his appointment, where he met with First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and the new permanent secretary at the Northern Ireland Office, Madeline Alessandri. He also met Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and US ambassador Ed Crawford, a Trump appointee, at Farmleigh.The role of Northern Ireland envoy falls under the remit of the US state department, and Mr Mulvaney will report to Mr Trump and US secretary of state Mike Pompeo. Mr Mulvaney was replaced as Mr Trump’s chief of staff by congressman Mark Meadows last month. Like many in the administration, Mr Mulvaney played down the risk of coronavirus as recently as late February.Asked if he missed working at the White House, he replied: “I’m always happy to be home, but it’s kind of strange to be out of Washington at this time.” He says he still talks to the president and points out that Mr Meadows is a friend of his. Both were co-founders of the Freedom Caucus on Capitol Hill, a group of conservative, Republican lawmakers.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsFianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin is facing internal pressure from grassroots members of the party who say they should be given a vote on any potential coalition deal with Fine Gael.Local members of the party have expressed concerns that they may be denied a vote in the process and say it would be “madness” not to hold a postal ballot.Mr Martin on Thursday told RTÉ Radio’s Today with Seán O’Rourke that holding an ardfheis to ratify a coalition deal with Fine Gael could be difficult.He also said he didn’t think a postal vote would be “feasible at this stage”, adding that party rules say there should be an ardfheis.Party sources confirmed that the Fianna Fáil executive, comprising about 80 people, can make a decision on whether the party enters government with Fine Gael if a special ardfheis cannot be held. Such a move would be met with significant pushback by grassroots members, however.Lifelong party member Willie Kavanagh, who is based in Wexford, said that “every paid up member of Fianna Fáil is entitled to have a vote”.“Headquarters can just send a ballot to every member and it is a simple yes or no question. I don’t go along with the idea that it would be hard to have a postal ballot. Our membership is due at the end of June, and I’m sure they’ll find a way to remind us about that.Responsibility“I am not in favour of this coalition but I would abide by any majority decision,” he said.“I favoured a national government that could stay in power for a period of two years. If we go into coalition with Fine Gael, it is the end of Fianna Fáil. Who will be in opposition, it will be Sinn Féin.”He said that he believed Sinn Féin should be part of such a national government and said he believes “they have to take their share of responsibility. It is easy to make big noises when you’re in opposition”.Mr Kavanagh said that he has fought in, and taken part in, many elections and in February voters were being told that Fianna Fáil would not do a deal with Fine Gael.“We can change our mind on Fine Gael, so why can’t we change our mind on Sinn Féin?”Fintan Cox, who is a Fianna Fáil member in a Leitrim cumann, said it would be “madness” not to hold a ballot of party members.“What is the point of being a member if we can’t vote on something as important as this? If this goes wrong we could end up at 14 or 15 per cent in the polls while we let Sinn Féin take no responsibility. If Micheál had done a deal with Sinn Féin, he would be taoiseach by now. Now, Sinn Féin are off the hook and we are going to have a far-left radical government in five years.“So there should be postal ballot, absolutely. This caretaker Government could go on for months. We just need to give a yes or no and return that. They did it in Labour and for the Seanad.”He said he would have supported a national government of all parties followed by an election.“Going in with Fine Gael is putting the whole party at risk,” Mr Cox added.President of Ógra Fianna Fáil Tom Cahill said that a “number of Ógra units across the country have held their own votes on it, some as recently as last night, and so far all have voted to oppose. Our focus now is ensuring that a vote of the full membership takes place on any potential government deal that may be reached.Preference“We could still be a few weeks away from seeing a programme for government and it’s impossible to know what way restrictions will be at that stage. I think there will be logistical issues no matter what method is chosen.”He said a postal vote is his preference if a special ardfheis is not an option. “When we get to that point, I do think it’s doable but it may need a bit of creativity.”Meanwhile, the three smaller parties all held separate meetings on Friday to discuss the joint policy framework released this week by Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.Sources in the Green Party say there are major concerns emerging about the lack of costings and detail in the document. Party TDs are drafting questions to put to the two parties this weekend.Concerns about the joint policy venture were also aired at a meeting of the Labour Party. Party TDs will further consider the document over the weekend before issuing a statement, but two sources said it is highly unlikely the Labour Party will feature in the next government.Meanwhile, the Social Democrats have written to Leo Varadkar and Mr Martin seeking clarity on how much borrowing will be needed to fund the policy measures among other questions about costs.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: Medical staff may not work this weekend if there\u0026#39s insufficient PPE, union saysComment: The Left loves conspiracy theories just as much as the Right — and they should all grow up\u0026#39I don’t want pity...

There are now more people who have recovered than those who are newly infected,” Mr Spahn told a press conference in Berlin. Angela Merkel this week identified the reproduction factor as a key measurement of when lockdown measures can be lifted. German government scientists have declared lowering it to under 1 as a major target in bringing the outbreak under control.“The strategy we have pursued so far is showing success,” said Prof Lothar Wieler, head of the government-funded Robert Koch Institute (RKI), which is overseeing Germany’s response to the virus. “The positive trend is that the increase in the number of cases has slowed significantly. Not everyone with the virus is infecting another person.”But Prof Wieler warned it remains to be seen whether the reduction will be sustainable. “We survived the first wave well, but we mustn’t overplay this achievement,” he said.“The goal has not yet been reached because the number is not yet permanent. The goal now is therefore not to reduce the number further, but to keep it stable below 1. We must not overlook the fact that this has cost us enormous effort.”Germany has carried out more testing for the virus than anywhere else in Europe, with more than 1.73m tests so far.It already had more intensive care beds than any other European country at the start of the crisis, with 29,000, but has since increased the number to 40,000.Following the fall in infections, hospitals will begin to return to a normal footing and non-emergency surgery will be resumed from next month, Mr Spahn announced. “Four weeks ago, we told those who had already faced long waits for back or hip surgery that their operations would have to be postponed. That caused pressure and a fair bit of emotional and physical suffering,” he said.“That’s why I think it’s important, as we gradually return to a new normal in public life, that we will find a new balance in the hospitals from the beginning of May.”Around a quarter of intensive care beds will be kept free for coronavirus patients, Mr Spahn said.Six out of seven patients experienced mild courses of the virus and could be safely treated as outpatients, allowing hospitals to focus on the most serious cases.The announcement comes as Germany prepares to begin gradually lifting lockdown measures, with many shops due to reopen from Monday. But Mrs Merkel this week used the reproduction factor to explain how fragile the situation remains, and that Germany\u0027s health system could quickly be overwhelmed by a rise in infections.“If it reaches 1.1, our health system would reach crisis point in October,” she told a press conference on Wednesday, when the R0 was at around 1. “At 1.2, we would reach the limit as soon as July. With 1.3, we would already be at limit by the end of June.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"government extends furlough scheme another month coronavirus","story":"The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has extended the multi-billion pound wage subsidy scheme until the end of June in an attempt to protect jobs during the coronavirus crisis.The furlough scheme, under which the Government pays 80 per cent of wages for workers up to a maximum of £2,500 a month, will run for an additional month.Mr Sunak said the decision was made as a result of the three-week extension to the lockdown, which was announced by the Government on Thursday.The Coronavirus Job Retention scheme was initially meant to run for three months to the end of May. The scheme, which has taken time for HM Revenue and Customs to set up since Mr Sunak announced it, will formally launch on Monday, but payments will be backdated to March 1.The initial three months had been estimated to cost £30 billion to £40 billion, and the initiative is designed to encourage businesses to temporarily furlough staff instead of making them redundant.On Friday, the Treasury said the month-long extension would allow it to continue to protect millions of jobs.Mr Sunak said: We\u0027ve taken unprecedented action to support jobs and businesses through this period of uncertainty, including the UK-wide Job Retention Scheme. With the extension of the coronavirus lockdown measures yesterday, it is the right decision to extend the furlough scheme for a month to the end of June to provide clarity. It is vital for people\u0027s livelihoods that the UK economy gets up and running again when it is safe to do so, and I will continue to review the scheme so it is supporting our recovery.Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, the director-general of the CBI, which represents 190,000 businesses, praised the Government\u0027s agility with the scheme and said its extension would help protect the economy and prevent unnecessary job losses through this new lockdown phase.She added: This extension means that firms will no longer be forced to issue redundancy notices over the next few days to comply with 45-day consultation requirements, and can instead return to focusing on protecting jobs and their businesses.  Frances O\u0027Grady, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress said: Employers must continue to make full use of the scheme to furlough workers and protect jobs.

The powerful business owners who had an interest in keeping the mines running refused to shut down, allowing the virus to spread unchecked.This time around, the town - scarred by the memory of the tragedy - has taken no chances.Butte, which has a large Irish immigrant population, was among the first to shut down bars and restaurants and even cancelled its famous St Patrick’s Day celebrations before the first case of Covid-19 was recorded in the state.Most in the town have relatives who died during the influenza outbreak, or know people who did - a collective trauma from the past which has shaped the present.“Shutting down St Patrick\u0027s was like an earth tremor here but it was accepted with wisdom and understanding,” Father Patrick Beretta, the priest at Butte’s Immaculate Conception and St Patrick Parishes, told the . “I walked my dogs that day and I did not see a single gathering - a seismic departure from the wild celebrations of the past.”Father Beretta, who is studying how communities around the world build resilience, promptly decided to take his service online: broadcasting live on YouTube on Sundays rather than risk the health of his congregation.“We had closed our churches even before the order came to do so,” he said. “The trauma of 1918 is still haunting the collective memory of today. As a result people here took very seriously very early on the coronavirus dangers.”Residents began self-isolating long before Governor Steve Bullock declared a statewide lockdown. Butte has one of the highest rates of compliance in the country.Its swift action seems, at least for now, to be working: counting just six confirmed cases of Montana’s 208.The picture was not so rosy a century ago.The saloons servicing thirsty miners remained open, as did the brothels, allowing the flu to run rampant.At the height of the outbreak, 10 residents were dying a day in a town with a population of 100,000. Local newspaper the Great Falls Tribune reported “the undertakers no longer garage their \u0027death wagons\u0027, but leave them in the street as the calls became so frequent.”The high school was repurposed into a hospital ward and still, much of Butte remained open for business. The deaths only began to slow when the town finally started to close down in November 1918, nearly 10 months after the first detected case.The death toll ended up being on par with San Francisco and Philadelphia - two of the worst-affected cities in the country.“Mortality rate here was astronomical, largely as a result of the nature of mining life, confinement underground and above ground in overcrowded boarding houses,” said Father Beretta.“The Irish Butte inherited an intensely social culture. Churches, pubs, halls were always packed providing voracious vehicles of contagion.”He said the particularly rich “emotional landscape” of Butte was shaped by two defining tragedies and the recovery from them: the 1917 Granite Mountain mining disaster, which saw 168 miners killed in a fire, and the 1918 flu.It was also influenced by the resilience of the Irish after the great famine of the 1840s. The earliest Irish immigrants to arrive in Butte were children and survivors of the famine.“My town was one of the places hardest hit in America, in part because many believed the cure was worse than the disease,” saidKathleen McLaughlin, a local Butte journalist, quoting a recent speech by President Donald Trump in which he suggested ending the shutdown. “When you hear that reopening the economy is preferable to warnings of public health experts who want us to stay home and distance ourselves, remember the graveyards in Butte.”Butte, which now has around 35,000 residents, has rallied in recent weeks. Seamstresses in the town have turned their hand to making masks for medical workers, pop-up delivery services are ensuring the elderly and vulnerable are getting daily meals.Resident Sabrina Holland said its history of hard times gives people a greater appreciation of the need for a community to pull together. “Butte people have a sense of history that is so deep within us, that we see a current crisis as not a current crisis, but another thing to get through,” said Ms Holland, whose great-grandfather Daniel Holland died from the Spanish flu in 1919. “It’s such a Butte mentality. We’ve been through so much, we can survive,” she told the Montana Free Press.Father Beretta said that while the town understands the measures it needs to take, it has not stopped people suffering from the social separation that it has imposed.“The community hurts not being able to gather in sympathy,” he said. “But every day I think of the people of 1918.

The Cabinet wants to keep the directive simple. So it’s not very encouraging that on one of the simplest questions of all: “Should I wear a face mask?” the message is clear as mud.A review is under way, Grant Shapps said yesterday. The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, isn’t waiting for that. He wants us to wear one. In Germany and America, face masks are now recommended. In other countries, they are compulsory.While the intricacies of vaccine discovery or ventilator production are beyond the vast majority of us, the principle behind face masks isn’t. Coughed or sneezed droplets spread the disease. Yet, asymptomatic people spread it too.The very best masks prevent wearers (usually doctors) from \u2028getting infected. But even simple surgical masks help prevent those carrying the virus from spreading it, which may be particularly useful since the non-appearance of any meaningful testing programme means we don’t know who has Covid-19, and very probably won’t for many moons to come.So, given ample supply, surely it would be a good idea for us all to wear masks outside? Particularly as part of any exit strategy, given what we know about the immense effects of even minute adjustments in transmission rates.Many health agencies, including our own, have disagreed. Yet, it turns out that they have largely based their views on a single source: the World Health Organisation. So, if the Government continued to trust that WHO advice, why the review? Should we be surprised if, as in America, having been nudged to assess the situation themselves, officials here change the advice too?Perhaps the Government is maintaining its wait-and-see approach because, as with other protective gear, there are still not enough masks to go round. But that would make its “guided by the scientists” stance a deception.If that stance is true, however, then it is worth remembering that those scientists the Government is guided by can make mistakes and be subject to bias like the rest of us.On face masks, the public has been ahead of the game. But the pressure of “common sense” would have been useful even if it had been common “nonsense” – forcing a validation, rather than a change, of the existing advice.This is not to say that we’ve had enough of experts. Far from it. In a time of immense crisis their work is vital. But the mask debate shows that we, too, have a duty, to deploy that age-old wisdom of crowds, whether right or wrong, to challenge and be annoying, and make those experts investigate not just the disease but their own assumptions too.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Dominic Raab, our stand in-PM of daily Pret chicken caesar baguette (halcyon days!) fame, on Thursday night announced that we are to remain in our pens for at least three weeks more. A paper published in the journal Science this week, meanwhile, suggested that in order to prevent future waves of the outbreak taking hold, social distancing may need to stretch into 2022.Granted, two more years of bumptious park policing, pub-lessness and watching people stride towards barren grocery aisles while wearing lab goggles and a cycling mask, as I did from my second home of the supermarket car park queue the other day, do not fill the heart with gladness. But perhaps there are upsides to this whole enforced space thing, too. Such as:Planes keeping middle seats empty. Leaving the county, let alone the country, seems like the fanciful pursuit of a bygone era at present. But once commercial flights get back up and running, easyJet, and possibly others, will take to the skies with fewer people on board, leaving many (OK, a few) precious extra inches in which to luxuriate, free of neighbours’ elbows digging into your sides. Heaven. Will this send flight prices soaring? Undoubtedly. Though on budget airlines the real cost, of course, won’t be clear until the very last stage of booking, where a Pandemic Tax is tacked on as a “necessary extra”. Exciting!More civilised politics. Possibly getting a little ahead of ourselves here, but when MPs return to the Commons next week, they will do so on a 50-at-a-time rota. Which will surely make Prime Minister’s Questions marginally less aurally unbearable, given the reduced number of people there for simultaneous braying. Having said that, this slimmed-down political duelling could turn out to be worse than usual, depending on the screen time lags of those in digital attendance. Let’s hope they are not streaming on 5G.Scenery existing. Did you know that beautiful views lay beyond the swarms of people obscuring them? Revelatory.People continuing to wash their hands properly. It only took a pandemic, but people are now going to bathrooms and actually employing base-level hygiene after doing their business. Quite a thrill, not least because little bowls of nuts on bar tops may make a resurgence. And be safe for consumption this time.Learning more about friends. Not in any meaningful way, you understand – just how long Those Who Shall Remain Nameless continue to cite Covid-panic as a social event get-out. Every day after lockdown makes it significantly less viable as an excuse, in case you were wondering.Equine Deliveroo. Takeaway arriving via motorbike? So pre-Covid! So provincial! Instead, the residents of Tadcaster, North Yorks, are being treated to the, er, provincial but in a fun way clip clopping of shire horses to drop off their booty. Samuel Smith, Yorkshire’s oldest brewery, is now delivering booze to patrons in a horse-drawn cart. “The children are absolutely loving it,” a stable manager said of the local youngsters, who wave to the animals trundling down empty streets. I am sure the Beaujolais-addled parents are quite fond too.The end of rush hour crush. It’s hard to believe a world in which you don’t get near-shoved into the path of oncoming trains daily could be out there but, should working from home become more widespread, those still travelling to the office may do so without fearing their lives will be imperilled en route.The end of studio audiences. An entire generation may grow up not knowing the sound of canned laughter. The young really don’t know how good they have it.Regional stereotyping is, obviously, reductive and wrong. There was a simpler social media time, though, in which the unusual, oft-criminal pursuits of Floridians (man breaks into restaurant to eat noodles and play bongos, man climbs down well to prove he can climb back out – you get the gist) was a running joke. We’re all Above That Now, needless to say.But I was reminded of how Florida can be a little bit, well, Florida when I read a news report of a disgruntled judge reprimanding the state’s lawyers for inappropriate dress when attending Zoom hearings. Let he among us who has not, in this newfangled working from home world, adopted the business on top, party on the bottom strategy to \u2028video call dressing cast the first stone and all that.For the lawyers of Florida, however, this has been less shirt and tie above desk, jeans below – more swimwear by the pool, general toplessness and, in the case of one female attorney, broadcasting from beneath her bedsheets. Not only in Florida, I’m sure. But possibly less likely in Faversham.“I’m a hugger!” – one three word combination, at the same time chilling and a helpful window into the utterer’s disavowal for personal space, that the pandemic has put paid to. For those seeking avenues in which to dole out indiscriminate touch, the Icelandic Forestry Commission has suggested a new coping mechanism: hugging trees, as opposed to humans. Perhaps that’s a strategy we need to be employing here, too – draping oneself over an oak presumably doesn’t contravene our wonderfully clear Government guidelines.

In the UK, people want even tougher restrictionsWhat happened to the British people’s bulldog spirit, our instinctive libertarianism? Judging from how we’ve reacted to the lockdown, we’ve become a nation of authoritarians. Far from rebelling against our liberties being removed, most people are demanding the authorities impose even more draconian measures.According to an opinion poll published earlier this week, only six per cent of people think the current restrictions are “too severe”, while 44 per cent think they’re “not severe enough”. This is in spite of the fact that 84 per cent believe they’ll face years of economic hardship as a result of an extended lockdown.Contrast this with the reaction in Germany, where a comparable lockdown has been imposed. According to popular mythology, the Germans are pinched and hidebound rule-followers, whereas the British are Rabelaisian freedom lovers. Turns out, that’s not true. Forty-four per cent of Germans are opposed to more severe measures, while 32 per cent want the existing ones to be scaled back.In Berlin, hundreds of people took part in an anti-lockdown protest earlier this week – and we’ve seen similar demonstrations in Belgium and across the United States. In Michigan, even the police have joined the rebels, with local sheriffs issuing a statement saying they would not enforce the governor’s stay-at-home orders.If only our own police showed the same reluctance to do the bidding of their political masters. Instead, they’ve embraced their new powers and, in some cases, abused them. They’ve sent drones after walkers in the Peak District, arrested people for sunbathing in public parks and set up “hotlines” so wannabe members of the Stasi can dob in their fellow citizens.You’d expect journalists to baulk at this assault on our liberties, particularly with politicians telling them they should stop questioning the Government’s handling of the crisis. But, with a few honourable exceptions, many have become zealous lockdown enthusiasts, only criticising the Government for not having placed the British people under house arrest sooner. Those who do ask questions about whether the Government has a strategy for exiting lockdown, meanwhile, are attacked for undermining the national effort.I discovered just how unpopular any dissent from the official line is when I wrote an article suggesting the lockdown should be scaled back. I was rounded on, accused of being “irresponsible”.Derbyshire Police have been criticised for using drones to capture images like this one of members of the public during lockdownI was so shocked by this reaction, I’ve set up a website called Lockdown Sceptics where dissenters can gather to share their reservations. I’ve been amazed by the calibre of the contributors. For instance, I was sent a paper by Mikko Paunio, a key scientific adviser to the Finnish Government, estimating that the infection fatality rate of Covid-19 is around 0.13 per cent – roughly the same as seasonal flu. In spite of his impeccable credentials, as well as the robust evidence he presents, the paper was rejected by various academic journals for being too controversial.How can we account for this change in our national character? According to Jonathan Sumption, the former Supreme Court judge, we’ve been frightened into it. “When human societies lose their freedom, it’s not usually because tyrants have taken it away. It’s usually because people willingly surrender their freedom in return for protection against some external threat.”No doubt there’s some truth in this, but it doesn’t explain why there’s more support in Britain for limiting our freedom than anywhere else in Europe. It’s particularly mystifying when you consider that countries that have avoided hard lockdowns have recorded fewer deaths per million – Japan (1.2 coronavirus deaths per million), South Korea (4.3), Singapore (1.8) and Taiwan (0.3) – than those that have imposed the most severe restrictions – Spain (397.6), Italy (358.2), France (256.3) and the UK (193.5).If we’re worried about the “external threat”, as Lord Sumption claims, why not urge our Government to follow the more laissez-faire approach of the Swedish authorities? Schools, restaurants and bars are still open, and gatherings of up to 50 people are permitted, but deaths per million in Sweden (118) are lower than in the UK.Perhaps the answer is that we’re more easily frightened than our European neighbours. It’s tempting to think the feminisation of British culture has left us bereft of manly virtues. We have become men without chests, to use CS Lewis’s phrase. An alternative explanation is that our sense of ourselves as a nation of indomitable warriors has always been vainglorious nonsense. We’ve been able to keep this myth alive because the last successful invasion of Britain was in 1066, but if Hitler hadn’t paused at Dunkirk perhaps we would have fared no better than other conquered European peoples.But, I prefer to think it’s a temporary aberration and we will eventually recover our love of freedom. In the meantime, it’s up to the minority of us who still hold fast to Magna Carta to keep the flame of liberty alive.Coronavirus latest news: Medical staff may not work this weekend if there\u0026#39s insufficient PPE, union saysComment: The Left loves conspiracy theories just as much as the Right — and they should all grow up\u0026#39I don’t want pity...

The computer will show that the battery is full, but it may not actually be.The feature can be turned off and may not be activated in all situations, Apple said. It will also ensure that the battery life is not significantly affected, the company said.Everything you need to know about the new iPhone SEA similar feature is already in place on Apple\u0027s iPhone, and was introduced in a recent update. It means that the phone will learn when it goes on charge at night and when you tend to wake up, for instance, leaving the final bit of charge until it expects you to get up and start using your phone.The Mac update will work in largely the same way, using its history of charging and battery use to notice times when you tend not to need the full battery life. If a computer tends to be used plugged in throughout the day, for instance, it may not charge up its battery fully.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

Even then the impact on spending patterns was immense. There has never been a month like this one. That being the case, goodness knows what April is going to look like.Overall spending through bank’s credit and debit cards, which account for just under half of card-based consumer spending in the UK, was down by 6 per cent with some notably deep troughs such as travel, including public transport (40.5 per cent decline), and restaurants and bars (35.5 per cent lower). Purchases deemed “non essential” generally fell by more than 12 per cent.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

One researcher said it had the potential to be really, really stunning as it reached its closest point to Earth, in May.The comet that took 100 million years to pass EarthBut shortly after it became clear that the comet was actually distintegrating, getting dimmer as it did.As well as offering a chance to see the comet as it breaks apart, the images may prove useful to the scientists studying the object. Relatievely little is known about the object, which was only discovered at the very end of 2019.Comet Atlas is still heading on its trajectory towards Earth. Its orbit is similar to the famous Great Comet of 1844, and it is thought that the two might both be pieces of what was once a larger comet.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I misspoke,” he said.“As a heart surgeon, I’ve spent my career fighting to save lives in the operating room by minimising risks.“At the same time, I’m being asked constantly how we will be able to get people back to their normal lives.”He went on to describe\u0026nbspschools as “places of security, nutrition and learning” for children.Many states in the US are currently wrestling with potential timelines to ease lockdown\u0026nbsprestrictions without triggering a renewed spread of the virus.Donald Trump on Thursday gave governors a road map for recovering from the economic pain of the coronavirus pandemic, laying out “a phased and deliberate approach” to restoring normal activity in places that have strong testing and are seeing a decrease in Covid-19 cases.The new guidelines are aimed at easing restrictions in areas with low transmission of the coronavirus, while holding the line in harder-hit locations.They make clear that the return to normalcy will be a far longer process than Trump initially envisioned, with federal officials warning that some social distancing measures may need to remain in place through the end of the year to prevent a new outbreak. And they largely reinforce plans already in the works by governors, who have primary responsibility for public health in their states.Places with declining infections and strong testing would begin a three-phase gradual reopening of businesses and schools. In phase one, for instance, the plan recommends strict social distancing for all people in public. Gatherings larger than 10 people are to be avoided, and nonessential travel is discouraged.In phase two, people are encouraged to maximise social distancing and limit gatherings to no more than 50 people unless precautionary measures are taken.

N95 and medical masks, which offer the most protection and are heavily in demand, should be reserved for health care workers who are regularly exposed to infected patients.A mask is effective only if worn properly, fitting snugly from the top of the nose to below the chin with no gaps. Masks should be worn the entire time you are outside and should not be moved up and down. While no mask is 100 per cent effective, it can help keep both you and others safe when combined with social distancing and regular hand-washing.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHere’s a look at some of the types of masks you might encounter, how they work, what to consider when making your own and the level of protection they could provide.The N95 is the most recognisable and effective mask. Its name means it can block at least 95 per cent of tiny particles — 0.3 microns — that are the hardest to capture. An average human hair is about 70 to 100 microns wide.These masks, which are designed for single use, are made with polyester and other synthetic fibers, including layers of tangled fibers that act as a filter to make it harder for particles to pass through.Make sure there are no gaps between the edge of the mask and your skin. This one includes a nose piece that is moulded to your face. Many health care and other workers do annual fit tests that check for air leakage and ensure that masks are sized and fit properly. (If you have facial hair, you won’t get a proper fit. They don’t fit well on children, either.)Some N95s have exhalation valves on the front, which make it easier to breathe. Those masks are often used in construction. A mask with a valve should not be used in areas that are meant to be sterile, like hospital operating rooms.Medical masks come in a few varieties and are less effective than N95s: some filter as much as 60 per cent to 80 per cent of small particles under lab conditions. When worn properly, they can help prevent the spread of the coronavirus by catching droplets when you cough or sneeze.Medical masks are often made out of layers of breathable, paperlike synthetic fabric that is cut into a rectangular shape and has pleats to help it expand and fit more snugly around your face. They are disposable and designed to be used just once.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailWhile they can protect you from large droplets and splatter, their looser fit is partly what makes them less effective than N95s.With medical masks in short supply, many have turned to making or buying homemade ones. Depending on the fabric and how it’s made, a homemade mask can sometimes protect the way a simple medical version does. And any face covering is better than nothing.Trump: US \u0027king of ventilators\u0027 as coronavirus death toll tops 36,000A good homemade mask uses a material that is dense enough to capture viral particles but breathable enough that you can tolerate it.You can use materials like a heavy cotton T-shirt, flannel or a tightly woven dish towel. Material with a higher thread count – which allows very little light to filter through – will likely offer the best protection.Various patterns for making a cotton mask have spread around the internet. Look for one that has at least two layers of material, comes up over your nose and below your chin and has secure straps.Some homemade masks have a pocket sewn in to hold an additional filter.Coffee filters and paper towels have been tested. One experiment found that two layers of paper towels on their own blocked between 23 per cent and 33 per cent of 0.3-micron particles.People have been experimenting with filtering materials, including air filters and vacuum bags. They can be effective but can present risks. Many are not breathable and may contain harmful fibres that you could inhale. Also, the average person doesn’t need the level of filtration that these materials provide.Make sure there is a layer of cotton or similar material on either side of the filter.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Following a quick check-up, the crew will be flown by helicopters to Baikonur, from where Skripochka will be taken to Moscow, said Vyacheslav Rogozhnikov, a Russian medical official who oversaw the crew\u0027s return.Morgan and Meir will have to be driven from Baikonur to Kyzyl-Orda, 190 miles away, to board a flight to the US - a strenuous journey made necessary by Kazakhstan\u0027s quarantine measures.On Thursday, the Russian government coronavirus headquarters reported the first contagion at the Star City, which serves as the main hub for pre-flight training of US, Russian and other international crew members of the International Space Station.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

It will also mark the final test before the spacecraft is approved for use, sending Nasa\u0026nbspastronauts to the International Space Station and beyond.Nasa veterans Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley, who both took part in a number of space shuttle missions, will be carried up into space on a Falcon 9 rocket at 4.32am local eastern time, from Kenned Space Center. They will go for an extended stay at the space station, Nasa said, but the precise duration of the mission is yet to be determined.During the mission, they will test all parts of the Crew Dragon capsule, including the launch pad, rocket, spacecraft, and operational capabilities, Nasa said.Lifting off from Launch Pad 39A atop a specially instrumented Falcon 9 rocket, Crew Dragon will accelerate its two passengers to approximately 17,000 mph and put it on an intercept course with the International Space Station, Nasa said. Once in orbit, the crew and SpaceX mission control will verify the spacecraft is performing as intended by testing the environmental control system, the displays and control system and the maneuvering thrusters, among other things.In about 24 hours, Crew Dragon will be in position to rendezvous and dock with the space station. The spacecraft is designed to do this autonomously but astronauts aboard the spacecraft and the station will be diligently monitoring approach and docking and can take control of the spacecraft if necessary.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

By contrast, the new evidence suggests very clearly that the people of Nazareth lived purely Jewish lives – and kept to all the major ritual laws.The area seems to have been actively anti-Roman. In the year 4BC, an anti-Roman revolt is known to have broken out in the area – and rebels attacked the military arsenal and government treasury in the centre of nearby Sepphoris.Indeed, the archaeological investigation revealed that in Nazareth itself, in the middle of the first century AD, anti-Roman rebels created a sizeable network of underground hiding places and tunnels underneath the town – big enough to shelter at least 100 people.Religious Jews saw Roman and Greek influence as a serious and direct threat to their faith. Thus pious religiosity and anti-Roman politics often went together.The new archaeological investigation – the largest ever carried out into Roman period Nazareth – has revealed that Jesus’s hometown is likely to have been considerably bigger than previously thought. It probably had a population of up to 1,000 (rather than just being a small-to-medium sized village of 100-500, as previously thought).No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“Our new investigation has transformed archaeological knowledge of Roman Nazareth,” said Dr Dark, who has just published the results of his research in a new book Roman-Period and Byzantine Nazareth and its Hinterland.“For the first time ever, we are now gaining a reasonable understanding of the sort of place Nazareth was in Roman times.”By examining in detail all the archaeological evidence, gained from recent landscape-survey work and from a detailed re-analysis of previous excavations, we are now beginning to learn about the cultural and economic environment in which Jesus grew up,“ Dr Dark told The Independent.One of the most significant revelations to have come out of Dr Dark’s investigation is the fact that the farmers of Nazareth seem to have had a prohibition on the use of human manure as a fertiliser, in contrast to the people of Sepphoris and potentially many other areas. Field surveys by the archaeologists have revealed that, about halfway between the two towns, there is an abrupt change in the agricultural strategy.The discovery is significant because different Jewish groups took very different attitudes to human excrement. Mainstream religious Judaism took the view that such excrement was unpleasant, rather than ritually impure. Their only prohibition on the subject was that people should make sure that human excrement should be at least four cubits (almost 2 metres) away when prayers were being recited.However, an ultra-religious Jewish sect called the Essenes (and potentially, therefore, other extreme groups) did regard excrement as rituallyspiritually impure and unclean, as well as being merely physically unclean and unpleasant. They took the view that all human excrement must be buried so as not to offend God’s “ine rays of light”.The fact that the people of Nazareth seem to have had a strict prohibition on the use of human excrement as a crop fertiliser implies therefore that they too regarded it as ritually impure, rather than simply unpleasant.It therefore suggests that they were, in some ways, either aligned with aspects of Essene thinking or with the thinking of another similarly hard-line religious movement within Judaism of the first century AD.However, in other aspects of their material culture, the people of Nazareth were totally in line with other, more mainstream forms of pious Judaism.The archaeologists have found numerous fragments of stone bowls and cups in and around Nazareth: a fact that strongly suggests a high degree of traditional religiosity in the town.Religious Jews of the first century AD believed that stone vessels were immune to ritual and spiritual impurity in a way that ceramic and wooden vessels were not.So to keep themselves and their homes ritually clean, they often preferred to use stone vessels.The belief is stated quite clearly in chapter 10 of the Mishnah, the Roman-period compendium of Jewish tradition and law that was later incorporated into the Talmud. Indeed, the use of stone vessels for ritual washing is also referred to in chapter 2 of St John’s Gospel. Frequent hand-washing – after sleeping, before eating bread, before worship – was, and still is, an extremely important aspect of strict traditional Jewish religious life.However, religious Jews of Jesus’s time may also have been reluctant to use manufactured goods that may have been rendered ritually impure during their manufacture: for instance, by having been placed near non-kosher food or near to a dead body or by having been handled by a woman during menstruation.This fear may well be behind the type of ceramics used in Nazareth.Archaeological sites in Arizona threatened by Trump’s border wallWhy archaeological antiquities should not be sold on the open marketArchaeologists have found thousands of fragments of pottery in and around Nazareth. In contrast to the pottery of Sepphoris, however, it is virtually all of one type: a\u0026nbsprough ware, made in a Jewish village called Kefar Hananya, 23 miles to the north of Nazareth. Interestingly, archaeologists have found that the distribution of stone vessels and Kefar Hananya pottery in first-century Palestine seems to correlate. It’s likely that religious Jews were taking no chances with their domestic utensils, and made sure that their pots came from strictly religious Jewish sources that could be relied upon to keep them ritually pure during manufacture.The newly emerging picture of Roman-period Nazareth as a place of substantial religiosity does, however, resonate not only with the emergence of its most famous son, Jesus, but also with the fact that, in the mid-first or second century, it was chosen as the official residence of one of the high priests of the by-then-destroyed Temple in Jerusalem, when all 24 of those Jewish religious leaders were driven into exile in Galilee.Indeed, what are probably priestly tombs have been discovered by archaeologists in and around Nazareth. Remarkably, some of them were even equipped with extremely rare life-size glass versions of the goats’ horn musical instruments – the shofarot, or shofars, that had been used during religious services in the Temple in Jerusalem and which are still blown today during the two most important religious events of the Jewish calendar.Significantly, after the fall of Jerusalem in AD70, when the Romans destroyed the Jewish Temple there, the shofar came for a period to be seen, and blown, as an expression of mourning for the Temple’s destruction.The archaeological investigation in Nazareth will help historians to better understand the ways in which Jesus’s hometown may have helped shape his religious outlook. The gospels of St Mark and St Luke suggest that his views were not popular there – and it may be that what seems to have been the ultra-strict nature of Nazareth’s religiosity had actually pushed Jesus towards a perspective that would perhaps have been more acceptable to less strictly religious Jews, such as many of those living in places like neighbouring Sepphoris.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The initiative will be launched on Monday when the Hubb Community Kitchen plans to start cooking between 250 and 300 meals a day, three days a week.\u0026nbspThe scheme\u0026nbspfollows a Zoom conference call last week, when the duchess talked to women involved in running the kitchen about how they could adapt their service to feed people at a time when social-distancing rules prevent it from opening as normal. Much of the produce will be supplied by The Independent’s charity partner The Felix Project which sources surplus food from cafes, restaurants and supermarkets.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMeghan said: “The spirit of the Hubb Community Kitchen has always been one of caring, giving back and helping those in need, initially in Grenfell and now throughout the UK.\u0026nbspA home-cooked meal from one neighbour to another, when they need it most, is what community is all about.”How to support our campaign“I’m so proud of the women of the Hubb Community Kitchen, and the continued support The Felix Project gives them to carry out these acts of goodwill, which at this moment are urgently needed.\u0026nbspI’m equally moved by the many people who are contributing to campaign to raise money for these vital organisations in the wake of Covid-19.”The meals will be prepared in the cooks’ homes and delivered by another charity, StreetGames, which runs the Fit And Fed campaign that aims to provide nutritious meals for children at risk of going hungry during the school holidays.The Duke of Sussex, who saw the charity’s work during a visit to one of its centres in Streatham last year, put it in touch with the kitchen.Harry and Meghan on Thursday\u0026nbspcompleted two days of volunteering with Project Angel Food in California, helping to deliver food parcels to people in need.The Hubb Community Kitchen was set up in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower disaster in June 2017, when a group of local women gathered in a communal kitchen at the Al-Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre.The duchess first visited it in January 2018 and has continued to make regular private visits.

Others said it was “natural, without chemicals, and safe to eat”.Alongside the popularity of southeast Asia’s wildlife markets selling a wide variety of animals for consumption, the trade in dog and cat meat has been rising over the past three years, the organisation says.How we treat animals ‘still risking spreading disease’Before the outbreak, about 10 million dogs and cats were slaughtered for eating in Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia every year, according to Four Paws.But its investigators said they had witnessed and heard how\u0026nbspsales of the meat in the region had risen during the global pandemic.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“We had expected the trade to be curtailed after the outbreak and in view of the restrictions,” said Katherine Polak, a vet and head of Four Paws’ stray animal care in southeast Asia. “But were surprised to find the traders saying business was better than ever.”The research teams interviewed sellers in the Vietnamese capital, Hanoi, and in the northwest\u0026nbspCambodian town of Siem Reap and capital, Phnom Penh.In Siem Reap, she said their teams found a few traders had closed, but those that remained were “rewarded with better business”.With each trader selling at least three dog carcasses a day, about 300 dogs are being killed in the town daily, they estimated.Illegal wildlife traders cash in on coronavirus with rhino horn ‘cure’China promotes bile from caged bears to treat coronavirus Indian traders ‘risking more viruses with squalid animal slaughter’ China bans eating wild animals including pangolin in coronavirus blitzExperts pressure WHO over live animal trade to prevent more pandemicsMeat buyers in both Cambodia and Vietnam told the investigators that the World Health Organisation’s\u0026nbspannouncement on cats and dogs not catching the virus prompted people to think that eating them was safe.“Our team who talked to the traders reported an initial decrease after the outbreak because people thought maybe there was a relationship with the virus, but the Cambodian government dismissed that notion after the World Health Organisation said dogs and cats were not a risk. The WHO\u0026nbspsaid that to prevent mass abandonment of pets –\u0026nbspbut it had the opposite effect.”Consumption had also risen because people staying at home want to try more “exotic” meat, Dr Polak said.In interviews last year, patients had told Four Paws how medical professionals had advised them to consume the meat for its “warming and healing properties” thought – falsely – to ward off flu viruses and the coronavirus.The meat is particularly recommended to women after giving birth and is said to increase blood flow for women during their menstrual cycle.Animals around the world benefit as coronavirus halts tourismBut a report\u0026nbsptwo months ago by the group, which has studied the trade in the three countries, concluded there was no evidence for any of the medical benefits claimed by health professionals.“Patients are routinely advised by health practitioners of the health benefits, and vendors are reporting to us that their customers are partaking in dog meat consumption due to the ‘health benefits’,” Dr Polak said, adding that she strongly suspected doctors were now recommending it\u0026nbspeven more in view of Covid-19.In Indonesia, people widely believe dog meat cures respiratory illness –\u0026nbsplargely asthma – so demand for it in that country could soar, Dr Polak said.The animals may be strays or stolen pets, or are bought by traders\u0026nbspwho exchange them for pots and pans.Vendors in Cambodia and Vietnam stand in masks at the roadside, providing bags of the meat, which may be cooked on the spot or for customers to take home.Dogs and cats blowtorched alive at Indonesian street marketsCambodia’s capital Phnom Penh has more than 110 dog meat restaurants, many of which opened within the past\u0026nbsptwo years, Four Paws says.Since the coronavirus pandemic, the organisation’s teams found that a few had closed but most had switched to providing takeaway services.And restaurants across the country are advertising dog and cat meat dishes for delivery on food delivery websites and apps.“This is concerning because we had never seen dog and cat meat dishes being advertised on a food delivery app before the Covid-19 outbreak. It demonstrates that the dog-meat industry is adapting to the increased consumption at home and increased ease of obtaining dog and cat meat, even during a lockdown,” said Dr Polak.“The insanitary conditions of the cat and dog meat trade, coupled with the contamination risks of having so many different animal species caged and killed alongside one another, present the perfect breeding ground for new and deadly diseases\u0026nbsplike Covid-19.“The rampant trade and live animal markets across southeast Asia are ticking time bombs. If governments do not act now and shut down these cruel markets, the next global pandemic might originate in Vietnam, Cambodia or Indonesia.”Last week China\u0026nbspclassified dogs as pets, not livestock, for the first time – a move campaigners hope could signal an end to that country’s dog and cat meat trade.Four Paws, which is campaigning for a total ban on dog and cat meat, has long warned of the risk of the spread of rabies from the pet meat trade.The news comes as The Independent’s Stop the Wildlife Trade campaign calls for an international effort to tighten restrictions on wet markets to reduce the risk of future pandemics.A recent study has proposed that the virus might have travelled from bats to humans via stray dogs.cat and dog meat\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

was successfully paired with one of two male owls from a New Zealand subspecies.The cross-Tasman relations meant that all subsequent generations of moreporks on Norfolk Island were now a unique hybrid of the Norfolk Island and New Zealand morepork owls.Dr Sally Box, Australia’s threatened species commissioner, said the Norfolk Island morepork owl was one of 20 priority birds targeted for recovery

That sort of quintessentially British thing.There was also, you probably sensed, a collective feeling Britain’s Got Talent didn’t just have a responsibility to lt the nation’s collective mood, over the following  minutes, but a moral duty.An unfair burden to put on any show and a forlorn hope, I thought, given the production has, for many years, involved nothing more inspirational than mixing and matching acts from the worldwide “Talent” franchise with the sort of homegrown sob stories which, however worthy and sincere, can feel a bit beside-the-point compared to the nightmare that’s just engulfed the world.And so it mostly proved on Saturday’s episode.Opinions here will dfer, I realise. In the latter category, though, we had a choir and foster care dancer Yakub, who won me over instantly with his modesty and tact as he announced: “My dream is to dance on . . . I’ve forgotten what I was going to say.” In the former, there was the Belgian contortionist, Papi Flex, an Indian dance troupe and Russia’s Diana Vedyashinka, who has spent the past  years teaching five dachshunds to stand hind-legged on a podium.An admission that made me feel slightly better about spending a similar amount of time watching EastEnders, but not much.There were also, of course, acts that fitted neither category, like James Piper, who’s “a personal trainer by day, magician by night”, meaning he can probably make haemorrhoids appear from nowhere.There was only one person, though, who genuinely lted the gloom.That was the brilliant comedian Steve Royle, from Phoenix Nights and Car Share, whose riotous act, pretending to shove ping-pong balls up his fundament, was funny enough even without the earnest health and safety caption from ITV: “Do not try this at home.” For five glorious minutes I forgot lockdown and began wondering about Steve’s next routine. Then I had to check myself.Because that is the sad and unavoidable issue with these BGT auditions. Unless they’ve got about  weeks of material, coronavirus means it’s a series currently going nowhere.Attempt to press ITV on this matter and all it can tell you is: “We are working with our production colleagues to see how we can make the BGT live shows work in an ever-changing situation.”Mind you, attempt to read Simon Cowell’s mind at the moment and I’m sure you’ll get a far more succinct response.“A jetski.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Which month of the year was named after the Roman emperor Augustus Hardball, Ore Oduba: “Which animal has large breeds called Clydesdale and Shire ”Ben Shephard: “On a computer keyboard the abbreviation PGDN is short for page what ”And Ben Shephard: “Gerald Ford served as US President in which decade of the th century ”A BALLSY move, I thought, for ITV to screen a drama comedy about Who Wants To Be A Millionaire’s coughing cheats during the coronavirus outbreak.The dark irony is, though, it was the only show this past week that was good enough to make me forget the ongoing medical crisis for its duration.The second assumption was that Quiz would stand or fall on Michael Sheen’s impression of Tarrant.It doesn’t. And that’s probably just as well, as it’s a slightly hit-and-miss turn. One moment he’s Tarrant, the next he’s Tommy Cooper, but he always looks more like Les Dennis.Luckily for Quiz, however, it barely matters because James Graham’s script sings and Matthew Macfadyen delivers a performance that’s worthy of award nominations playing the thick-as-a-brick Major Charles Ingram. There are issues as well, obviously.Mark Bonnar’s accent sinks somewhere between Stranraer and Larne as Celador boss Paul Smith and there’s an air of ITV self congratulation in the opening hour about Millionaire’s ratings.A dangerous game to play when you’ve now got Secrets Of The Driving Test filling the show’s slot.All is forgiven and forgotten with tonight’s brilliant second instalmentthough, which concentrates on the coughing episode itself and the fallout, as ITV execs try to work out who they should call at Scotland Yard.“It’s the Celebrity Crime Squad.”“Really  It sounds like a s**t detective show.”“It sounds like something we’d make.”Quite.Manny Monthe: “- is a dangerous scoreline because the next goal wins.”Ian Wright: “Pep Guardiola came in and literally cut Joe Hart’s legs off.”Gary Lineker: “Rafa’s comeback in the Champions League final was his finest moment in the Premier League.”IN the continued absence of live sport, the contest of the week was The Great Celebrity Bake Off, on Channel , where two veteran camera-chasers battled it out for screen time and the winner’s apron.A Holly Willoughby on This Morning B Princess Fiona in Shrek The Musical ITV’s hugely entertaining drama Quiz. BBC’s nearly perfect World Cup Rewind series .The quietly brilliant BBC News health correspondent Fergus Walsh and his cameraman Adam Walker deserving awards for their coronavirus reports from UCL Hospital.And the bloke from pest control making a polite exit from Channel ’s The Mum Who Got Tourette’s: “Did Simon tell you I had Tourette’s ”“The thing that gave it away was when you opened the door and called me a c***.”Smug THIS week’s winner is Phillip Schofield and the Mekon from Eagle comic.Sent in by David Thompson, via email.

It’s no wonder so many bosses and workers are confused – lawyers are too!Without statutes in place and with regulations changing, it can be hard to provide a definitive answer. The Government has announced the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which means thatyou both agree, your employer can put you on temporary leave .This applies when they are unable to operate or have no work for you to do because of Covid-. If you are furloughed, you will be paid  per cent of your wages by the Government, up to a monthly cap of £,.It sounds straightforward, but your own unique circumstances can make things tricky.  I have been inundated with questions from people who have been furloughed, had their salary cut or lost their jobs.Here, I have provided my answers to some of your most common queries.Q I STARTED a new job shortly before the lock-down. My new company has advised me it cannot pay me the  per cent government pay because I didn’t start before February . What can I do A Annoyingly for you, your new company is almost certainly right. Unless you were on the payroll by February  they are not legally bound to extend the furlough scheme to you. There are talks about this being changed and lots of pressure on the Government because there are a lot of people in your position. In the meantime, you are entitled to Universal Credit — apply now.Q I WAS late getting to work at a food processing plant due to a change in bus timetables caused by the lockdown. My boss said this was a disciplinary offence and fired me. Is this legal A This is probably not legal. If you have been employed for two years or more this counts as unfair dismissal. If you took your employer to an employment tribunal you would have a good chance of winning.  If you haven’t been employed there for  months you would still be entitled to pay for your notice period.  It is possible you could bring a claim for breach of contract as your employer has almost certainly failed to uphold their own disciplinary procedures. You may also be entitled to a claim for discrimination.  Write to this firm making it clear the country is watching their behaviour — as am I.Q I AM on furlough but my employer is holding back a week’s wages I earned before I was furloughed, saying I will get them when my employment starts again. Can he do this  A Your employer cannot do this, unless it was agreed in a contract. You were promised this money and it has absolutely nothing to do with you being furloughed. I have had a number of messages about this unlawful practice and I understand employers are trying to protect cashflow. Butyou were promised this money your firm is not entitled to withhold it.  It may be that, like many others, you will have to work with your employerthey need that money to stay afloat and protect your job, but make sure they put in writing that the money will be forthcoming in due course. Waiting a while for the money may be better than your company going bust.Q AM I entitled to get another job – say, in a supermarket – while I am on furlough from my employer A I have been inundated with people asking this, but the law is not clear. My view is that unless the contract you have with your current employer specically states you cannot take another job , there is no reason why you cannot during this time. There is nothing as it stands in legislation that prevents you from doing this. The government regulationsare not clear and need clarication.  Importantly, disclosure to your current employer is critical. Do not accept another job without giving clear written notice to your current employer that you are taking up other employment while furloughed.Q MY employer wants me to accept a ten per cent pay cut. I checked my contract and I don’t believe they have the power to do this. Do I have a way of resisting this A Your employer cannot unilaterally decide to cut your wages. You have signed a contract and they have promised to pay you. But these are unprecedented times and there is legal provision which may, in certain circumstances, allow employers to sack you and then,necessary, re-employ you on a reduced salary. Multiple employers have asked staff to take a reduction in order for them to survive. The critical thing is thatyou accept such an offer it must have an end date, in writing. You can’t be forced to accept a contract change, including a salary cut. But be warned thatyou do not, your employer can put you on furlough, which will only cover  per cent of your salary.Q I RESIGNED from my job but my new one has fallen through due to the virus. Where can I get help  A I am afraid you will have to claim Universal Credit. It may be worth writing to your old employer to seethere is work still availble, but your legal remedies are limited. The Citizens Advice Bureau is updating its advice on this all the time.Q MY EMPLOYER has gone into administration. Can I still be furloughed A The law makes clear that administrators, independent professionals responsible for either salvaging a bankrupt company or ensuring creditors are paid, can apply to the government furlourgh scheme to ensure an income for staff. However, the administrator will probably focus on attempting to pay creditors and shareholders. Do not let them do this. Get together with co-employees and write to the administrator insisting you’ll not be forgotten and nor will their behaviour.Q I’VE HAD to cancel my holiday and my employer needs me to work during the time I had booked off. Usually we are not entitled to carry annual leave into the next year, butthey are requiring me to work, surely I must have the right to do so A Good news, the Government has amended regulations so workers can carry over up to four weeks holiday into the next two holiday years. This applies where it has not been possible for you to take some or all of your leave because of the virus. However, it has to be because you were required to work.Q I BECAME self-employed in February. Am I entitled to government grants A It looks like you are not, but this may change. You need to have accounts for   to be entitled to assistance. But this situation is moving, so don’t give up hope.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappeal Q I’M A zero-hours worker. Am I still entitled to be put on furlough  My employer is closed so I have no shts but nothing has been mentioned about furloughing. A The furlough scheme covers zero-hour contract workers so your employer should make an application on your behalf. Get in touch and ask them to explain their policy. It costs them nothing to offer you furlough so I do not understand why they have not.Q I WORK in a shop and my employer has made no effort to make the environment safe for the workers. In other shops I have seen screens at tills and employees issued with gloves and masks. We have none of that. I don’t feel safe. Am I entitled to stop working without risking my job A It is shocking that there are no specic health and safety regulations protecting workers like you which have the full force of law. I do not have a clear answer about whether you are entitled to refuse to go to workthe business is open and offering essential services. However, in due course your business failing to make the environment safe could be grounds for constructive dismissalyou were to make the decision to walk away. I urge you, in the strongest possible terms, to write to your line manager asking them to provide safety equipment, making it clear the environment is unsafe and explaining that you will be considering your optionsadequate safety measures are not introduced.Q I WANT to go on furlough, but my employer has cut my hours by half. How can I make them furlough me so I can get  per cent of my pay instead of  per cent A Your boss can’t just slash your hours by half, that is a straightforward breach of contract. If there is no work for you to do then furlough should be offered to you. Write to your employer at once asking for them to explain why they think this is lawful. I look forward to their answer.Q I CAN’T work because I have to shield myself due to health reasons. I asked my employer to furlough me and they said they couldn’t because I can’t work, so I am currently on unpaid leave. Is this fair A  This all depends on your circumstances. If you are able to work from home, and are healthy enough to do so, your employer should offer you this option. If your employer is unable to operate, or there is no work you could doyou did not have to shield yourself, then you should be offered furlough. Butthe business is an essential service that has remained open, and you have to attend work in person, the remedy is to apply for statutory sick pay .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some are already bust. Le will never be quite the same again.The Treasury is stumping up billions to pay furloughed full-time workers, help the self-employed and offer Universal Credit to the very large number who slip between the cracks.We are piling shedloads on to our already massive national debt. For many firms and iniduals this is a devastating blow from which they may never recover, financially or mentally.Lives lost from delayed emergency care, alcoholism, drugs and domestic abuse have rocketed.Together with fatalities from other causes — mostly poverty and despair — they could dwarf the toll from the virus.Some children’s le chances will be wrecked by a long break from school or, worse, from being cooped up with violent family members.Those who keep their jobs may be forced into severe pay cuts. Costs will spill down through the generations.Not everyone is suffering.Public sector jobs and pensions are secure, for the time being.Some with savings, decent homes and jobs they can do from home might actually be enjoying Easter with their families at their side.Breadwinners forced to stay in instead of eating out or flying abroad will have spare cash in their pockets at the end of the month. And some will have grabbed Rishi Sunak’s offer of  per cent pay to put their feet up at the taxpayers’ expense.But it all adds up to a crimson bottom line that our children and grandchildren will have to meet over decades to come.

But what will remain — and at what cost Downing Street, without its most important figure at the helm, must find a way to save Britain from destitution without being blamed for “putting money before lives”.It is a challenge only a loony Corbynite leftie would wish on their worst enemy.But to govern is to choose.And despite having just escaped his own near-death experience, it is impossible to see it happening without Boris Johnson’s say-so.The PM knows there will be questions to answer once all this is over.They are already coming thick and fast — on testing, NHS capacity and protective equipment for NHS staff.These need to be settled fast — at literally any cost.We will then need an inquiry into the failure of so-called “experts” to see this coming.We will want a detailed explanation from the Public Health England quango which focused costly resources on obesity and ersity, rather than the pandemic they war-gamed four years ago.Why, for instance, were they so slow to allow non-NHS specialists into the fast-accelerating battle against Covid- A gargantuan rise in debt and unemployment. A terrying collapse in tax revenues. A vast Government bailout to save businesses and jobs.It should be a comfort that these same official forecasts also predict a rapid rebound, assuming the lockdown ends and the virus is largely conquered.But eventhat startling optimism — which we struggle to share — is borne out, immense and permanent damage will already have been done. Millions of jobs will have been destroyed, thriving firms bankrupted and a monstrous new debt pile amassed, taking years to pay off. The pain of the austerity era after  will have been a mere taster.It is good at least that Britain now knows this. We hope it sinks in.

Many will also die from the hardships of poverty, unemployment, tax rises and spending cutsthe economy is kept paralysed much longer.The behavioural scientists advising the Government rightly fear that the public will doubt whether the lockdown’s success in protecting the NHS is still worth itthe recession it triggers kills thousands and destroys the health ­service’s funding anyway.We are not there yet. We do not yet knowUK deaths have peaked, though hospital admissions are flattening and the NHS does now look likely to cope.But the crunch point, where a date is set to slowly release Britain from house arrest, cannot wait much longer.Labour will blame the Tories, but all of these pandemic risks were pointed out as far back as  when Labour were in power.Boris, who became Prime Minister only nine months ago, was occupied with other matters until his December landslide.There are some “green shoots”, to quote one of our medical experts.The NHS now has spare capacity. There is no longer a risk of it being overwhelmed.This was one of the key reasons for the draconian crackdown — to avoid an unmanageable “spike” in crisis admissions.That risk has diminished.

We sing very close to each other and partner dance and there’s even kissing – and then there were the packed audiences too.When they made the decision to shut down it was still a major shock.As a single mum without much financial help I was scared we’d be out on the street. I have a friend who works at Sainsbury’s and she hooked me up with a job two weeks ago and I absolutely love it.The people I work with are genuine and lovely and I plan on staying as long as they’ll have me. It’s not as much as the West End would pay, but I am just starting out.I do nine-hour shts starting at am, working the tills, manning the queue, helping the online team – very dferent from my usual job. I spend most of those hours on my feet working and it’s exhausting.But I feel proud when I can help someone find what they’re looking for and don’t have to ask a colleague. Everyone at Sainsbury’s is like family and they’ve really welcomed me in.Obviously it’s far less glamorous than starring in the West End but I enjoy the challenge of learning new skills and working with people.I look forward to the theatres re-opening and getting back to singing on stage but for now I’m happy to just sing in the aisles!But Jenner isnt the only Brit to have swapped the spotlight for a new job during this pandemic.Keegan Brown, , from Carisbrook in the Isle of Wight is the th best player in the country.He has put his darts career on hold and taken on extra shts as an assistant in an NHS blood-science lab.While playing on the PDC pro tour – a series of darts tournaments for professional players – I tried to work three days a week in my lab assistant job, he tells Sun Online.This would normally consist of two full days am to .pm and one day from am to pm. But since the darts calendar has been put on hold I’ve been doing a minimum of five days and the hours can be anything now, including night shts and also on-call days.I figurethe NHS can use my skill set to help or support the service, then I want to offer anything I can to help in the midst of this pandemic. We have all been up-skilling too, to help backfill when people are being forced to take time off.The NHS has always had a family-feel but even more so now as we’re working under such dferent circumstances, something I’ve never experienced.My we Roz is extremely proud of me but also very worried. She worries about everyone!But I am so lucky to love both of my jobs. They come with highs and lows and there are times I prefer one to the other, but overall they both make me happy.The darts is more full-on, intense and competitive and you’re mostly judged on the last game you played.It can be an emotional rollercoaster and you do have to learn to grow a thicker skin.Working for the NHS can also be full-on and intense but you’re working as part of a team – rather than on your own - and you do feel like you’re making a dference.I’m not practicing my darts as much as I’d like to, but I am still keeping my arm in as much as possible. Just last night I was playing online darts with some children from a darts academy. The academy contacted me and I was happy to help!Leivi Saltman, , from North East London, is a professional photographer - but is now working at a greengrocers.I’ve been a professional photographer for six years and cover everything from engagements and weddings to charity and corporate events, he tells us.A typical day is editing photos, keeping my social media updated and going on location visits to scout out a venue so I can figure out lighting and places to get the best angles and atmosphere.Then in the evenings I’m usually out photographing events.When I first started hearing about the virus, there wasn’t a massive effect on my work and only one or two jobs were cancelled. But once the government ruled there should be no public gatherings, that pretty much tied my hands. Twenty-five events were cancelled or postponed, which was the majority of my events leading up to July.A friend of mine put a post on Facebook that a local greengrocers were looking for help and I thought, ‘Why not I am earning less compared to my photography, but it helps to structure my day and gets me out the house. It’s a full-on day starting at am and finishing at around pm.My typical day is unloading the lorry, which is full of fresh fruit and vegetables bought from the market that morning at am.Once the lorry is unloaded and put in the fridge, the remaining tasks include stocking up the shop, putting together customer orders and making sure there aren’t any empty shelves or shelves low in produce.There’s a lot more manual labour involved than in photography, but it’s surprised me how much I’ve really enjoyed it.I like meeting new people each day and being a part of a team rather than working on my own. It feels like I’ve become a part of their family and I’ve learnt a lot about dferent types of fruit and vegetables and how you should store them.Of course, I’ll be going back to photography when the crisis is over, but I will miss the greengrocers too.

But thats Cressida Dick for you.Another added: Met Police Chief Cressida Dick was on Westminster Bridge last night and did nothing!A stunned doctor at St Thomas Hospital filmed the crowded scene and wrote: Im a doctor working at the hospital thats right there. And yes, I was also somewhat perplexed by the lack of social distancing...Dr Damir Rafi told the : Though people may have wanted to go outside to show their support for healthcare workers, applauding them while being in a crowd is likely to have done more harm than good.As a doctor, I’m seeing that things seem to be getting better regarding the state of the wards and number of admissions. It’s all due to social distancing.Even though it’s dficult for everyone, it’s working. I’m concerned that people may become more lax as time passes, and so would strongly encourage them to keep it up so that progress is maintained.The bridge was packed last night with well-meaning families, young children and emergency workers - but many were failing to socially distance as they packed together facing the hospital.Every Thursday at pm since Britain was put into lockdown the nation has clapped out of windows and at their front doors to thank frontline workers.Medics have said the weekly clap gives them a boost during gruelling shts, but last night those gathered on the bridge were slammed for potentially creating more cases for staff to tackle.politan Police Commissioner Dick led dozens of officers in the weekly applause for key workers at pm last night.A video posted to the forces Twitter account shows her standing in front of officers, who are lined up with gaps in front of police vehicles along the bridge near Parliament.But the gesture drew criticism from some after the clip filmed by DrRafi emerged showing groups of people, near police officers, seemingly ignoring social distancing guidance.The Prime Ministers official spokesman said: We would ask that everyone takes responsibility and adheres to social distancing rules so that we can safely show our appreciation for those who are working so hard to fight coronavirus.He added: We would ask that in showing their appreciation for those who are working so hard as carers, they do so in a way which adheres to the social distancing rules.SUN readers are today urged to sign a petition calling for our NHS staff to be awarded the George Cross.Yesterday, we backed a proposal by Lord Ashcroft to honour our health heroes with the gallantry gong given for acts of bravery that did not take place in battle.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.”SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking readers to sign the petition online at thesun georgecrossfornhs.A furious nurse wrote under the video: This is just really infuriating!!!! I’m a Nurse  this scene made me sick!!!It’s more appreciatedsocial distancing was practise here than the clapping itself! Do we really CARE   Expect for more weeks of torture, more casualties because of this!!!And another said: It was a pointless exercise that made a mockery of the measures put in place.Public gathering on westminster bridge, ignoring social distancing, to clap the people who could end up now treating themthey’ve spread the virus among that crowd.Others blasted the crowd for blocking the road - one of the main ways in to the busy hospital - and criticised the officers who have been seen patrolling parks making sure people are sticking to restriction rules.A politan Police spokesperson said: Officers, along with other emergency service workers, came together last night on Westminster Bridge to celebrate the work of all key workers.A large number of members of the public also gathered to express their gratitude.While many people adhered to social distancing guidance, it appears that some did not. We regularly remind our officers of the importance of social distancing where practical, and will continue do so.Yesterday coronavirus deaths in the UK  jumped to , today after  more patients died in hospital. According to the Department of Health , people have tested positive for the deadly bug - up , from Wednesday.The long bank holiday weekend was blamed for the climb in daily coronavirus deaths.But experts said the slight rise was expected and was probably due to hospitals clearing a backlog from Easter.It comes as Britain is set to stay in lockdown for at least three more weeks until it passes five key tests, Dominic Raab announced yesterday.The Foreign Secretary’s checks include ensuring the NHS is not overwhelmed by coronavirus victims and seeing a steady reduction in deaths.Health Minister Nadine Dorries tweeted: “There is only one way we can ‘exit’ full lockdown and that is when we have a vaccine. Until then, we need to find ways we can adapt society and strike a ­balance between the health of the nation and our economy.“The introduction of a relaxation easement strategy eventually leads to a full exit.”Among the latest deaths is -year-old nurse Mary Agyapong, who died of coronavirus five days after her baby was born.It is understood doctors performed an emergency caesarean on the medic shortly after she was admitted to hospital last week - having lost her dad to suspected Covid- just days earlier.Mary joins over  NHS heroes who have sacriced their lives to treat patients during the crisis.It comes as War hero Captain Tom Moore completed  laps of his garden yesterday, raising more than £ million for the NHS.The -year-old WWII veteran completed the last few laps on his zimmer frame - and insisted he will continue for as long as people keep giving money.It comes as Britain could stay in lockdown until June over fears lting the drastic measures too quickly could lead to a second wave of the pandemic.Ministers feel pushing the lockdown to May or even June would be the right move.Others believe keeping it shut for too long risks a complete economic meltdown.Plans are being considered to reopen some primary schools and nurseries next month - with schools outside London and Birmingham set to be the first to open once the lockdown is lted.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He was backed by fellow Labour mayor, Liverpool’s Steve Rotherham.But the pair’s call risked a major backlash from unions, who warn that hospital staff are facing a daily battle to find the PPE they need.World Health Organisation official guidance says people need only to wear masksthey have Covid- symptoms or are caring for someone who does.And it adds: “WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources.”It also warns against another of Mr Khan’s suggestions — that people reuse masks. Last night Chief ­Scientic Advisor Sir Patrick Vallance said they were looking at the evidence and hoped to provide clearer advice on masks next week.He added: “At the moment we’re entirely in line with the WHO recommendations. It’s absolutely crucial that masks are available in hospitals and in other settings which are high risk of transmission.“That’s where the evidence is very strong that they do work.”But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealCountries including Austria and the Czech Republic have ordered citizens to wear face masks at work and in public spaces.In Spain, which began to ease its lockdown last week, police and Red Cross volunteers handed out free masks at bus, rail and metro stations.In the US, New Yorkers were ordered to wear masks in public from Wednesday — despite President Trump vowing not to wear one.Angela Merkel has warned Germans they will have to wear masks on public transport and while shopping once the lockdown ends.And in Lombardy, one of Italy’s worst-hit regions, people must wear them outside. The French have been told to don them on trains until summer at least.But asked about Mr Khan’s comments, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC: “There is evidence that it could be counter-productive so I think it’s right to ask the scientists to provide guidance on it.“If the scientists come out and say, ‘Yep this is actually what people need to do’, then we will absolutely ask people to do that. But until they do that, that isn’t the message that we’re going to be sending.”Experts say all but expertly fitted high-grade medical masks can be largely ineffective.Researcher Paul Hunter, of East Anglia University, said public transport or supermarket workers might benefit, but added the protection offered “wasn’t great”.Professor Ben Cowling, who studied masks for the University of Hong Kong, said: “They reduce the risk, butpeople spend more time in crowds then that offsets the benefit.There are many practical issues to consider before everyone is asked to wear a mask outside the home.London’s Mayor Sadiq Khan rightly says it would be wrong to tell the public to buy surgical masks as this would massively cut supplies available to NHS and care staff.He suggests bandanas or other fabrics — but they can’t stop a mph sneeze.Masks need changing every three to four hours but just to give everybody one mask a day means half a billion a week are needed, requiring production of , every second. We don’t have that capacity.To be effective, we also need lessons in their proper use, such as not touching the mask’s front as you take it off and how to fit it from under the chin to the bridge of the nose.“We need to make sure masks are an additional measure and not a replacement for other measures.”Shaun Bailey, London’s Conservative candidate in next year’s mayoral election, tweeted: “The mayor knows nothing is stopping him from providing PPE to every London transport workerhe wanted to.”Meanwhile, Waitrose showed off new anti-coronavirus visors — quickly compared online to Darth Vadar’s helmet.

If governments do not act now and shut down these cruel markets, the next global pandemic might originate in Vietnam, Cambodia or Indonesia.Despite the global pandemic, the continued sale of dog and cat meat in the region has seen a transition from a cruel ‘dine-in’ to a ‘to-go’ service.With  dog meat restaurants across Cambodias capital of Phnom Penh, vendors are taking sales one step further by offering dog dishes on food delivery apps.Vendors can also be seen wearing facemasks on the roadside as they hand out bags of dog meat for customers to eat or prepare at home.In Vietnam, a similar trend has been observed particularly in the north of the country, where dog and cat meat consumption has a longstanding history.Doctors are also said to be promoting the consumption of dog meat because it is perceived to be ‘natural, without chemicals, and safe to eat’.One seller in Cambodia said that those in her community believe that, ‘dog meat is good for health and helps ward off cold or viral illness, like COVID-’, however the meat is often linked to outbreaks of cholera, and cases of trichinella and rabies.The meat can be a cheap alternative but Micheal Chour, founder of animal charity the Sound of Animals, says that the rise in dog and cat meat consumption is due to Chinese influence, with many restaurants only opening in the last two years.He told the Sun Online: People are still eating a lot of the meat in these areas because they believe it to be a cure.They was a big increase in the number of Chinese workers coming to the country and they have bought many of their practices along with them.Many of those, such as torture, have been introduced here and people believe that because China is a big and powerful country, that we should be listening to these practices.There is a very little warning from the government because wet markets are good business, they are still happening.In the wake of the COVID- pandemic, the Chinese cities of Shenzhen and Zhuhai have banned the eating of dogs and cats as part of a wider clampdown on the wildle trade.Yet in the absence of a national ban, other cities in mainland China are believed to be considering their own legislation to stop the consumption of dogs and cats.China has also drawn up new guidelines to reclassy dogs as pets rather than livestock, as part of a response to the coronavirus outbreak.The announcement by the Ministry of Agriculture was described as a potential game changer in animal welfare. The new virus, which is believed to have originated from horseshoe bats, put a spotlight on Chinas wild animal trade.COVID- - which was first identied in the Chinese city of Wuhan - could have been passed onto humans by intermediary species on sale at a wet market.Those markets, where wild and often poached animals are packed together, have been described as a breeding ground for disease and an incubator for a multitude of viruses to evolve.As it stands, Vietnam has  cases of coronavirus and no recorded deaths with Cambodia having  cases and no confirmed deaths.    Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She added: They are indebted to serve himNOT the people.Ms Corbett also claimed doctors would deliberately choose to deny ventilators to black Americans, leaving them to die instead. Ms Corbett wrote: I tweet for the people who will die when doctors has [sic] to choose who gets the last ventilator and ultimately... who lives.

And, while the article doesn’t explicitly say it... the black.A senior Health and Human Servicesofficial told Fox News: HHS career ethics officials are reviewing the matter.It is believed the inquiry is being taken “very seriously as unprofessional social media posts about sensitive government work can violate federal ethical guidelines.Ms Corbetts claims come as a study reveals black New Yorkers are twice as likely to die from COVID- than their white peers.The shocking statistic was revealed on Friday by the New York Health Department, showing the devastating impact the global pandemic is having on people of color.New York City has become the American epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak - with , people with coronavirus dying in hospital beds.That is more deaths in the US than all of the states and more than most countries.But according to the NYC Health Department data, the black and Latino community are facing disproportionally higher rates of infection, symptoms and tragically, death rates.It claims , black or African American people have been killed by coronavirus across the five boroughs as of April .Their deaths make up .% of the citys total death toll, despite accounting for just % of the citys population.Fatalities among Hispanic or Latino people were the second-highest in the city, with at least , deaths, according to the data.At least , white people have died, making them the third-most affected group in terms of fatalities - however white residents account for at least % of New York City.Deaths of Asian people were the lowest, at .  The same trends can be seen in infection and hospitalization rates, showing that this community is more severely impacted by COVID- than any other.The stark data also revealed black residents are twice as likely as white people to diethey contract the virus.It claims . black residents in every , cases of coronavirus die.This is compared to the . deaths per every , cases in white residents.Hispanic and Latino residents also have a higher risk of fatality from the virus than white residents, accounting . in every , cases resulting in death.Fears have long been mounting for black and latino communities across the US, with state officials and lawmakers warning the global pandemic was hitting African Americans the hardest - further highlighting systemic racial inequality.The disparity reflected what Mayor Bill de Blasio blasted as ”clear inequalities in healthcare.He said in a press briefing: “The disparities that have plagued this city, this nation that are all about fundamental inequality are once again causing such pain and causing innocent people to lose their lives.”Mr Cuomo said: “Lets figure it out. Lets do the work. Lets do the research. Lets learn from these moment and lets learn these lessons and lets do it now.”However it appears the shocking New York City statistics are not an anomaly.Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed that African Americans accounted for % of the hospitalizations despite being % of the population.Among the cities where black residents have been hardest hit include Chicago, Detroit, New Orleans and Milwaukee.In Chicago, % of the deaths have been black residents, despite them only making up % of the citys population.In Louisiana, where New Orleans is a major hot spot for the virus, about % of those who have died were black.Black residents only make up  per cent of residents in the state.America has recorded at least , confirmed cases of coronavirus and , hospital deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.Do you have a story for The US Sun team Email us at exclusive@the-sun or call   .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Weaposve had billions in funding for businesses, promises on testing and ventilators, new aposNightingaleapos field hospitals built in weeks, and help for the NHS and social care. Many of these announcements have been made at the daily  Downing Street press conference. But not all the utterances at those pm briefings have been quite what they were cracked up to be. Sometimes, journalists and the general public come away from the press conferences without having been given all the facts, which only emerge some time later on.So in the interests of public duty, weaposve analysed seven pledges that were made either in No, or by the government more widely, that didnapost quite happen as advertised. Ministers are of course working in unprecedented times, and some things theyaposre going to get wrong. But itaposs important to know when something hasnapost quite met the grade. . , tests per day A government statement on March  said testing for coronavirus would be ramped up to , a day, a level expected to be ready within four weeks. But at no point did the number top , - despite No claiming capacity had risen to , by April . The failure prompted furious recriminations, with Downing Street saying it was clear the NHS and Public Health England should fill capacity - but insiders blaming bureaucracy and poor planning for labs on the go-slow. Health Secretary Matt Hancock incorrectly claimed the target was set for the end of April, and superseded by a new target to hit , by the end of the month. But with testing still below , a day with two weeks to go, that , target looks like it could be in doubt.  . , tests per day... On March , the Prime Minister claimed the UK would be going hopefully very soon up to , per day.But Boris Johnson didnapost say when or how, and his pledge has never been repeated. Questioned afterwards, the government said the ambition remained but there was no set date for it to happen. ... And the millions of failed antibody tests The , included both antigen tests, which showyou currently have Covid-, and antibody tests. Antibody tests might showyouaposve been infected in the past and have some immunity. On March , Boris Johnson claimed the finger-prick devices would be as simple as a pregnancy test and have the potential to be a total gamechanger. But none of them have yet been approved for mass use, and many have failed completely, giving  results. On March , National Infection Service director Sharon Peacock said .million of antibody tests had been ordered - and she expected them to go through the approval process by the end of the week. This did not happen. The government has ordered several dferent designs of antibody test, none of which yet work. No refused to say where they were ordered from, but said it aposdoesnapost recogniseapos claims it blew m on tests that donapost work.  . aposAll key social care workersapos getting a test The lack of testing for NHS staff put the government in the firing line - so you can understandministers wanted to get ahead of the criticism. And on April , Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced: I can announce today we have capacity for all key social care staff and NHS staff who need to be tested. But while it was great news at last for NHS staff, there was a crucial word in the statement - key. While all NHS staff with symptoms could get tested, the same was not yet true at that point of all staff in care homes. The discrepancy prompted fresh claims that social care staff were being treated like second-class carers.At the time of Mr Hancockaposs announcement, not only could they not all get a test - they also faced new residents coming in from hospital without being tested either. Both those situations were remedied the next week. But care home deaths still arenapost included in daily statistics, which means they risk becoming a forgotten factor of the outbreak.. aposNew proceduresapos on the right to say goodbye Matt Hancock pledged to end the indignity of coronavirus victims dying alone due to isolation rules. The Health Secretary announced on April : Iaposm pleased to say that working with Public Health England, the care sector and many others, we are introducing new procedures so we can limit the risk of infection while wherever possible giving peopleaposs closest loved ones the chance to say goodbye. He highlighted the tragic case of -year-old Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, whose death alone made me weep. But while no-one could argue with the principle Mr Hancock was trying to achieve, it emerged these new procedures were largely not new rules on April . They were more of an order to obey rules already in place.  Both the care sector and hospitals had already been sent Covid- guidance saying visits should not take place - with an exception for people in end-of-le care. But government sources admitted the guidance wasnapost being adhered to, forcing Mr Hancock to make a new statement. The advice for hospitals had been issued on April . It said: Visiting is suspended with immediate effect and until further notice. The only exceptional circumstances where one visitor - an immediate family member or carer - will be permitted to visit [include]: The patient you wish to visit is receiving end-of-le care.” The guidance for care homes was issued on April . A new aposaction planapos for care homes on April  simply reinforced the fact visits can be paid for end-of-le care.  . The aposfirst of thousandsapos of new ventilators On March , Michael Goveannounced the first of thousands of new ventilator devices will roll off the production line on the weekend, and be delivered to the NHS next week. But while , of the Penlon ventilators were indeed ordered, Mr Gove did not clary exactly how many would roll off the production line that week. The next day, the government claried the initial number was in fact in the region of . Officials insisted potentially hundreds more could arrive in the weeks afterwards. The Penlon devices were part of a ventilator challenge urging UK firms to produce hastily-designed breathing apparatus.However, unlike orders for entirely new ventilators from firms like Dyson, the Penlon devices were a re-working of a design of ventilator already in use. As of April , itaposs not known that any other models from the UK challenge have yet been approved for use.. , in a week - and more ventilator questions Questioned on April , Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there should be another , ventilators in the next week. A week later, Downing Street said the figure had been . Supporters of the government would say the exact number doesnapost matter when, as of April , the government insists there is plenty of ventilator capacity in the NHS. But there are more discrepancies in the numbers, and critics would say they raise questions over the overall strategy. For example, Mr Hancock was originally hoping to raise the nationaposs , ventilators to , - but revised the figure down to , after lockdown measures began working. A few weeks ago, government officials told the Mirror there were , ventilators in place, , more aposoff-the-shelfapos models on order - and plus any from the UK challenge. Yet on April , Downing Street said that while the number in place was now ,, just , were on order. Where did the other , on order go  We donapost know.  . A badge for carers Amid negative news stories about the governmentaposs response on social care, Matt Hancock announced on April  a badge for care workers.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailHow well has the Government handled coronavirus  The outbreak is the biggest ­challenge faced by the country since the Second World War. It has required a huge economic bailout and an immense effort by the NHS, care staff and other key workers.But has the response by Boris Johnson ’s administration been adequate Here our experts look at what the Government got right and what they got wrong, and deliver their verdicts. Lockdown WHAT THEY GOT RIGHT We managed to introduce lockdown measures without shutting vital public spaces. This approach has managed to maintain extremely high levels of public support for the measures. Covid- victims are infecting on average fewer than one person each – the crucial “R” reproduction number threshold which,social distancing is maintained, will kill off the outbreak. This has been achieved while keeping most parks open and allowing daily exercise. By contrast, Italy shut public spaces entirely from mid-March, which exacerbated mental health problems in the population. No also made a good call in using experts to sell its social distancing message. England’s Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty and Chief Scientic Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance have been vital in maintaining public trust. WHAT THEY GOT WRONG We introduced lockdown measures slower than almost all of Europe. The Government’s mantra on this is that it is “guided by the science” – but in reality, such decisions are a judgment call by politicians. The Prime Minister and his Cabinet decide which experts on its Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies to listen to most and then interpreted their advice. In mid-January, when China locked down Wuhan, few thought it would happen in liberal Europe. By early March, many countries were shutting down. But here, Boris Johnson was still joking about shaking hands with patients on a hospital visit. The PM and his team got updated modelling that triggered a U-turn on March . Data from Italy suggested that unless we were also locked down immediately, , people would die in a matter of months. Now, our death rate per capita is twice that in Ireland and we are tipped to have Europe’s worst outbreak. VERDICT An increasing number of experts believe we acted too slowly – but a final assessment is only possible with full data after the pandemic. Testing WHAT THEY GOT RIGHTWe were one of the first countries to develop its own coronavirus test.Public Health England’s swab test was used to contain the outbreak as patients were isolated after ing from abroad. Detailed contact tracing was then carried out so everyone in contact with a confirmed case could also be isolated. This delayed widespread community transmission and is the main reason we are two or three weeks behind the likes of Italy and Spain in outbreak trajectory. Hospital bed numbers were low at the start of the outbreak but this swt action bought the NHS time, enabling temporary Nightingale hospitals to be set up. Intensive care was also kept within capacity in the first wave. WHAT THEY GOT WRONG The March  decision to abandon widespread community testing shocked scientists. This was the start of the much-disputed “herd immunity” phase of the strategy. It went directly against World Health Organisation advice for governments to “test, test, test”. The decision came amid an initial clamour for tests by the general public from GPs. From this point, only the most seriously ill patients in hospitals were tested. It soon became clear other countries were outstripping our testing capacity. Germany was achieving remarkably low death rates after scaling up testing using private labs. The UK decided to initially only use PHE’s Colindale lab before some NHS labs were kitted out to do swab analysis. While we were withdrawing from the arms race on testing, other countries were building up supplies needed to analyse the swabs. And as the Government came under pressure to ramp up testing, lack of supplies hampered efforts. VERDICT The decision to axe community testing and contact-tracing means we have no reliable data on how widespread Covid is outside of hospitals – which could delay an end to lockdown. PPE - personal protective equipment    WHAT THEY GOT RIGHT The Government says we have enough personal protective equipmentfor all who need it. But it admits there have been distribution problems, hampering efforts to deliver equipment where it needs to go. Since the beginning of the outbreak,  million pieces of PPE have been delivered to the front line. The Royal College of Physicians has said a combination of revised PPE guidance issued two weeks ago by Public Health England, plus the NHS drive to get millions more pieces of kit to the front line, had made a big impact on the shortages and helped to allay the fears of workers. WHAT THEY GOT WRONG To frontline doctors and nurses, it doesn’t really make a dference what caused the problem. Hospital trusts are reporting “critically low” supplies, with the British Medical Association reporting “dangerously low levels” in some parts of the country. A survey by the Royal College of Surgeons found a third of surgeons did not have access to enough masks, gowns and other equipment. And a BMA survey last week found half of doctors felt pressured to work in high-risk areas despite not having adequate PPE. VERDICT Whatever the cause of the shortages, the Government either did not recognise the scale of the problem or it did not respond to it quickly enough. The economy    WHAT THEY GOT RIGHTIT is a month since Chancellor Rishi Sunak ’s Budget pledge of £billion for coronavirus-hit companies.Smaller firms were promised emergency cash through the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loans Scheme while big companies could access funds via the Covid Corporate Financing Facility. That is without the Government’s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, where firms can reclaim % of workers’ wages, up to £, a month. WHAT THEY GOT WRONG ONLY just over , smaller firms have had loans through the CBILS, out of , that managed to apply. There have been more than , enquiries. Banks are accused of failing to respond, dragging their feet, making business owners jump through hoops, or in some cases unfairly rejecting applications.  Around £.billion of CBILS loans have been approved. Together with the £.billion loaned through the CCFF, it is .% of the £billion earmarked by the Chancellor. Amid criticism, Mr Sunak has now launched the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme for firms that could not access either pot of money. VERDICT The Job Retention Scheme could be a game-changer in preventing millions more workers getting the chop. But the go-slow on loans for firms is a cause for concern, especially with , companies already in trouble.

On Thursday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announced that the country would need to stay at home for a further three weeks. But there’s thought to be some disagreement in the Cabinet over whether lockdown restrictions should be lted on May  or whether they should remain in place into June. The first scenario would mean restrictions are lted earlier, in the hope it would cause much less damage to the economy – but would risk a second virus ‘peak’.Butlockdown is extended into early summer – it is expected to push numbers of coronavirus cases right down – but would risk further damage to the economy. It’s believed some ministers are unhappy that there has not been a proper debate about the two options, according to the Daily Mail. Scientists say extending the lockdown into the summer would drastically reduce transmission rates and the ‘extremely low’ level of cases would make it easier for health officials to manage the pandemic.  But this approach means the economy would continue to stall. Meanwhile, Tory former party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said the Government should stop treating people like children by refusing to discuss exit strategies for ending the lockdown. He told the Times: The Government is going to have to accept and admit we are coming out of lockdown. We need to trust the British people and not treat them like children. We must respect their common sense. They need to know that the sun is rising at some point in an economic sense.  Labour leader Keir Starmer has claimed an appropriate exit strategy from lockdown is ‘in limbo’ while Boris Johnson recovers from coronavirus. The Prime Ministeraposs spokesman said that claim was just wrong. Keir Starmer said ministers are failing to take decisions on when and how tothe UK to normal le - and suggested the government has not acted “quickly enough” throughout the crisis. He added: “I suspect, although I donapost know, that  Dominic Raab  is just reluctant - he probably does know that itaposs time for an exit strategy - but heaposs probably reluctant to sign it off without the Prime Minister and I think thereaposs a bit of that in the mix.” "},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror lockdown goes on","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Mirror: As lockdown goes on, draw strength from heroic national effortThere are signs the rate of infections is starting to plateau.

These acts of kindness have lted our spirits at this most challenging of times. Class issue All parents want their children to go to a good local school. But the latest figures show an increase in the number of families failing to land a place at their first-choice primary.  Families on low incomes are not in a position to game the system by buying properties in exclusive catchment areas. They often end up having to send their kids to schools miles from home, requiring long journeys by public transport.

Everyone is being told to stay at home and only go out when they absolutely have to for essential items like food and medication and for exercise once a day. Pubs, cafes and restaurants have been closed, along with schools and theatres. Long queues have formed outside supermarkets with retailers struggling to keep shelves stocked with many of the goods weaposve all come to expect to be readily available. And with people spending all their time at home, unable to go out to eat and often without many ingredients that used to be readily available, providing exciting and delicious meals is a challenge.  But Damian Adams, Head Chef at The Jockey Club’s Newmarket and Huntingdon Racecourses, has come up with five simple tips to ensure you can make the most of your lockdown meals. He explained: These are unprecedented times but there is one thing that will always be certain - we all need to eat. So, as we continue le in lockdown it’s important we start to get better at planning meals. This won’t just help save money, it’ll cut down on food waste, too. One of the key things, says the respected chef, is to make sure you only buy what you need - this will not only make meal planning easier but also help you cut down on waste. Damian said: There are some simple things we can do to control our food waste at home. For instance, just about any vegetable can be turned into soup, portioned up and then stashed away in your freezer for when you want it. And he said lockdown is the perfect time to spend longer cooking your meals than usual because you longer have a pesky commute to contend with. Damian said: When we’re flat out working it’s easy to see making meals as a bit of a chore. So, whether you’ve got more time on your hands or just using the part of the day you’d usually spend commuting, try to put a bit more love and time into your food. I promise you’ll reap the benefits. The biggest dference we can make is when planning out our meals in advance.

MPs were also told that healthcare staff are genuinely concerned about the safety of patients being compromisedworkers are spread too thinly. Dr Alison Pittard, Dean at the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, said: Weaposve had to spread ourselves more thinly and we have developed guidance to try and make sure that continues to be safe, butwe have to expand even more and spread ourselves even more thinly, there would be concern that safety could be compromised.  So everyone is working really well, weaposre doing everything that we can but staff are genuinely concerned. Dame Donna Kinnair, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, told the committee sick NHS workers are being forced to drive two hours away to be tested. She urged: We need some really clear direction on how we can access testing both in the NHS but more so for social care, because they donapost have the same infrastructure as the NHS. Prof Costello, a former British director at the World Health Organisation, said he was not sure we need , tests per day in realitywe can get this epidemic damped down and that it was more important to have the systems in place. How are they restructuring the public health teams  Have they got plans in place Will they need extra volunteers, for example He also suggested offering incentives to % of the population to stay socially isolated in order to get the economy going again. We have to get the economy going andit means locking down % of our population, even giving them incentives to stay in quarantine and with digital apps to help monitor their symptoms and give them support, thataposs the way to really keep this going until we get a vaccine and safe herd immunity.The committeeaposs chairman Jeremy Hunt later called for a massive ramp-up - not just in the testing, but also the tracing of everyone who has been in contact with someone who has the virus. He told BBC Radio aposs World At One programme: If weaposre going to be in a position where we can track and trace every single person who has Covid or might have had Covid in three weeksapos time, because thataposs when we could next potentially end the lockdown, well that is a huge logistical undertaking. Mr Hunt added: If weaposre going to copy the best in the world then that is what we now need to do.

Business Secretary Alok Sharma branded it a colossal undertaking, and said that evena vaccine is found, it will need extensive testing. It comes as scientists from Oxford University said they were confident they could have a vaccine available by September.

He said: If everything went perfectly, we can do slightly better than that, but there will be a trade-off. We will have less safety testing than we would typically have and so governments will have to decidewill they indemny the companies and say, ‘let’s go out with this’ when we just don’t have the time to do what we normally do.   months is what we would expect.Although it could take more than a year for a vaccine to be generally available, it is possible that it could be fast-tracked for some key workers, including hospital staff, thereports."},{"url":null,"title":"how send captain tom moore","story":"NewsHow to send Captain Tom Moore a birthday card before he turns Captain Tom Moore celebrates his th birthday on April .

The marquee, which has been built at a vehicle depot, can accommodate up to  bodies. It was completed earlier this week and contains six chilled containers that are covered by a large gazebo. Faith leaders and a humanist gathered for a ceremony today to offer thoughts and prayers for those who might need to use the site and their families during the pandemic. The event was also attended by Mayor of Bristol Marvin Rees. Mr Rees said: “This is a dficult time for everyone in our city and we know the reason for building this place of rest is distressing for our communities. It’s important we take all preparations necessary so we can provide a dignied place to rest for citizens who sadly lose their lives during the Covid- pandemic. “Today’s event exemplied kindness, respect and dignity. It’s reassuring to see representatives from a range of faiths and non-faiths coming together today. I hope it gives some comfort to all our residents that we will do all we can to support each other through this dficult time. “We stand with people from all faiths and no faith because We Are Bristol together.” Hospitals across the UK have increased their general capacity for patients who died over the last few weeks but local councils have been working to be preparedfurther space is needed. This was one of the first times members of the public have been allowed inside. The council said they allowed dferent faiths from across the city to view the site as they wanted to be open and transparent about the preparations it was making. Representatives from dferent religions gave a prayer while a leading humanist also gave a reading to a small gathering inside.  Although no funeral services will take place at the site, Bristol City Council said it held the ceremony so faith and non-faith representatives can help bereaved people better understand the process. The council said it had been quickly established to ensure sufficient capacity to allow for dignity and respect to be maintained before funerals are held. Attendees at the event included The Bishop of Bristol Vivienne Faull virtually over Zoom, The Buddhist Chaplin at the University of Bristol, Sister Jinho, Humanist Celebrant Chrissie Hackett, and Zaheer Shabir, represented the Muslim community. A number of other faith leaders, unable to attend in person, also joined the ceremony by Zoom, including Rabbi Monique Mayer and Hindu representative, Shiv Sama. Restrictions will be in place at the site to protect staff who will be offered continued emotional support.  The site is not yet in use and Bristol City Council has written to neighbours around the site to keep them informed. The tented site is located off a residential street, but vehicles will reverse into a covered area to ensure all dignity is maintained. Those transporting the body would stop at an infection control point and the deceased would be transferred in the same way as a traditional mortuary to be stored in one of six refrigerated containers until they are removed for a funeral. There is a three pronged walkway for staff to use to ensure infection control and PPE wearing is carried out and strict instructions on following safety measures. Mortuary and coroneraposs support manager for Bristol City Council John Pitchers, said: The purpose-built facility is to ensure there is sufficient capacity to continue to look after the deceased in a way that ensures dignity and respect. We all hope it is never needed butit is, it is vital that we can continue to deliver the same care.  It is designed to be as close as possible to a traditional morgue. Within the containers are the same wrappers as in a permanent one. The procedures are all the same and anyone using it will be moved around with the same equipment. They are kept safe and the level of security is the same. It is essentially ready now but we are limited to the number of people we can accommodate until the racking is here which is due to arrive at the end of next week. Any deceased comes through the main door and there is strict infection control. The van reverses and the bodies are transferred into the temporary resting place. There is a three stage process for staff with walkways to ensure all safety measures are carried out. Bristol City Council said it originally purchased containers which could accommodate  deceased during usual operation. It has also ordered bespoke racking which could increase this capacityrequired, and decisions will be made later on according to levels of demand. Bristol Mayor Marvin Rees said: I never thought I would have to deal with this kind of issue as mayor.

Stephen, , drove from Liverpool to Pendle Hill to climb a steep hill and was forced tohome by officers who found him in Barley on April .But Stephen has hit back after the ordeal, saying he needs exercise due to his high blood pressure to keep him off medication, reports the Liverpool Echo. At the time, Ribble Valley Police said: Today we have removed an inidual who thought it was okay to drive from Liverpool to Barley to walk up Pendle Hill. His justication for this was his local hills were ‘closed to the public’ and he needs to exercise as he has high blood pressure. This man was ill-equipped for the task and clearly not physically fit enough to tackle what was in front of him. It was below freezing this morning and whilst it was a beautully clear day he had no idea of the route terrain or direction back to his car once he had got to the top. If he made it all. No map, no compass, no fluids and no idea...However, Stephen believes the implementation of the government’s coronavirus emergency powers towards him was inappropriate. Speaking to the ECHO , Stephen, a civil engineer, said he suffers from hypertension and has only recently come off medication for the condition.He said: An essential and ongoing combination of weight loss and regular exercise has resulted in my being able to manage my hypertension without the need for prescribed medication. However, the regular exercise concerned consists of regularly walking steep inclines as I cannot run or jog due to cartilage problems in my left knee.  Previously, Stephen said he was travelling to Moel Famau and Loggerheads Park in North Wales once or twice a week to perform such exercise. But due to recent Covid- restrictions, these sites have temporarily closed, which Stephen says meant he had to venture to Pendle Hill in Lancashire instead. At the start of his walk, Stephen says he was flagged down my a marked police vehicle, who enquired whether he had parked his car on the road. Stephen said: I turned to address the officer and was met with an exclamation of stay back, don’t come any closer. I was about ten feet away from the officer at this point, who remained in the vehicle. I confirmed that the car on the road was mine. The officer then askedI had driven from Liverpool.  I was having trouble hearing the officer, due to the noise of the vehicle engine, and endeavoured to take up a position at the side of the vehicle, whilst maintaining an appropriate distance, so I could hear him better but was met with another caustic exclamation of don’t come any closer, I won’t tell you again. Stephen says he then explained to the officer his medical condition and how upon research Pendle Hill had not been identied as a closed site for visitors. Following a further conversation, Stephen says was he was asked to leave the area immediately. Stephen says he was left saddened by what he believes to be aposinappropriate and completely disproportionateapos behaviour of the police. He said: It was never my intention to obstruct the officer in the execution of his duties in any way, nor fail to comply with the officer’s subsequent appraisal of the situation.  I was simply conversing with the officer in an attempt to explain the overarching circumstances and convey the fact that I had in fact travelled a ‘reasonable distance’ to the nearest available location able to facilitate my health requirements via appropriate exercise. He added: I am an experienced climber who was appropriately dressed and profoundly familiar with Pendle Hill. New government guidelines released to police yesterday state driving to the countryside and walking, when far more time is spent walking than driving is a reasonable excuse to leave the house for. A spokesperson for Lancashire Police said: We can confirm that we have received a complaint so it wouldn’t be appropriate to comment any further on this particular case at this time.

Prince Philip has previous chosen to say such choice ditties as “You managed not to get eaten then ” in conversation with a British trekker in Papua New Guinea in  and, famously, “If you stay here much longer, you’ll get slitty eyes, which he said to a British student in China in . Charles, meanwhile, was more coy when he let slip a famously rude comment - but perhaps did not expect to be caught out by the latest in sound recording tech. It was back in , at a photo session in Klosters ski resort in the Swiss Alps, when the Prince of Wales was asked about his upcoming wedding to Camilla. The eager reporter was one Nicholas Witchell, a seasoned operator who since  had been the BBCaposs royal correspondent. In , Witchell had been the first reporter to announce the death of Princess Diana, Charlesapos first we.And in  his obituary of Princess Margaret - the Queenaposs sister - caused some offence at the Palace for references to her lovers and copious consumption of whisky.For whatever reason, on that cold day in the Swiss Alps, Charles, surrounded as he and his two sons William and Harry were by TV cameras, microphones and journalists, let slip his true feelings about the BBC man. Witchell had asked how Charles was feeling about his upcoming nuptials - William having just answered a similar question. Somewhat cheekily, the Prince of Wales replies: Iaposm very glad you heard of it anyway, before his face contorts into an awkward, somewhat exasperated grin. But then, through gritted teeth, Charles mutters under his breath: Bloody people. I canapost bear that man. Heaposs so awful. He really is.  Whether or not he expected his comment to be picked up is open to debate, but thereaposs no doubting he could see the dozens of microphones honed on his every word. William, to his credit, remains composed despite his dadaposs muttered utterances and continues with a light-hearted response. As long as I donapost lose the rings. I have one responsibility and Iaposm bound to do something wrong, he jokes. William was to be a witness at the wedding the following week.The clip recently resurfaced on Channel aposs The Royals on Holiday programme.Ten years on from that day, Witchell and the Prince had an uncomfortable reunion.  The royal correspondent came face-to-face with the Prince of Wales at an environmental fundraiser in Washington DC in March . It was believed to be the first time the two had met since the heir to the throne was caught muttering his cutting aside. But the Prince seemed unrepentant when confronted by the reporter outside the event. He gave a curt reply when Witchell asked why he still cared so much about environmental issues.  Well, Iaposll turn it round the other way, responded Charles. I think youaposd be more surprisedI didnapost care about these things. But I think particularly in terms of what Iaposve been talking about now, thereaposs an awful lot to worry about. The Prince then quickly got into his car. Speaking in  about the incident, Witchell said: There has never been an apology, and why should there be  He was probably quite right. You know, awful man. You could take the view it was the best thing that happened to me, because it showed that it is our job as BBC journalists to report fairly and accurately, but not to seek approval. Weaposre not there to be liked.  Reports suggested that, back in , Charles had perhaps hoped the cameras would leave him and his sons alone for their weekaposs holiday while preparations for his wedding continued back home. Along with the comment about Witchell, Charles was also caught muttering, I hate doing this, and, Bloody people, as he smiled wryly. That day was also famous for an endearing interaction between Charles and his then-youthful sons. As the reporters bustled in their media huddle, Charles asked William and Harry: Do I put my arms around you   William replied: No, donapost, but you can take the horrible glasses away. Charles said: Do not be rude about my glasses, I couldnapost bear ityou were. A cheeky photographer then tells the Royal trio to look like you know each other, causing the princes to lean into their dad who puts his arms around his sons. Charles then said to his sons: What do we do   And William replied: Keep smiling, keep smiling. As the clip began circulating the globe - far more of a scoop than anything the hopeful hacks could have dreamed of bagging that day in the Alps - the Palace was quick to offer explanations to mitigate the impact. Pictures of Prince William sitting next to his then girlfriend and fellow St Andrews student Kate Middleton on a restaurant terrace the previous day had appeared in the press, and aides suggested the Prince was narked by this.

Before the lockdown, her parents were buying her two portions a day from their local KFC, spending an estimated £, on popcorn chicken in total.

Akiraaposs condition originated when she suffered a severe throat infection at just eight-months-old which saw her stop eating. Doctors advised her parents to put dferent foods in front of her until she selected something. She chose a piece of popcorn chicken when she was nine-months-old and has refused to eat anything  since. Mr Gujadhur, a senior actuarial analyst for finance firm Capita, said: Before the lockdown, we invested in the same kitchen equipment that is used by KFC and cooked the KFC frozen popcorn chicken at the recommended temperature and cooking time.

After just two years she decided to turn her back on the spotlight and along with husband Prince Harry stepped back from her duties. Many experts have tried to pinpoint the moment the couple decided enough was enough, but one believes there was one engagement in particular that was a real turning point. Christine Ross, the editor of the Meghanaposs Mirror blog, thinks we saw a new side of the royal couple on the first day of their South Africa tour. Shortly before they left a township in Cape Town, the couple were stopped by a group of performers and started dancing with them, and the casual, fun moment became a tour highlight. Speaking on the Mirroraposs royal podcast Pod Save the Queen, she said: She was dancing with the children and it was such a stark contrast to some of the events we had seen before her pregnancy. Sheaposs in this very affordable dress, sheaposs in affordable wedges, her hair is in a ponytail, sheaposs dancing with children. We didnapost know then what we know now but I think that moment and that look was a turning point in their roles, in that they werenapost going to be these high glamour royals any more. They wanted to be more down to earth, with the people, dancing with the children, getting out with the crowds.  Meghan wore a stunning black and white wrap dress by Mayamiko for a visit to a organisation that promotes female empowerment in Cape Town. The £ patterned dress was from Mayamiko, a sustainable Malawi brand. Christine said: I love that wrap dress because itaposs not a royal colour. Meghan does wear bright colours but her signature style and her personal style is more monotonatic - its black, itaposs white, itaposs grey, itaposs deep navy.  This was still her signature colour pallet - she looked so incredibly beautul, she was still showing a very normal post-postum body which so many women around the world appreciated and that outfit to me, especially as it marked the beginning of the tour, was a turning point with her relationship with her role as a duchess. Meghan and Harry shocked fans around the world when they announced their decision to step down in January.

Daniel added: To have someone come and deliver the food is amazing, it makes us here feel that somebody cares outside. “It’s also good for me and us here to have the people contact, too, because we’re here and self isolating. “So for Harry and Meghan to do this is amazing. “I have been a client of Project Angel Food for two years and I am on a blood pressure diet, which helps me. “There’s two or three people in the building that get for from them.  “The deliveries usually come at . in the morning on a Wednesday, so when I got told it was being delivered later I thought that was strange.” After announcing their plans to quit the royal family in January, the couple fled to Canada but have now moved to LA where they plan to set up home. They are in the process of setting up a new charity venture, however have said it wonapost launch until the time is right.  Speaking about having Meghan and Harry in the city, Daniel said: “You know, I hope they get a better reception here in LA than they have in the UK. “They’re doing a great thing and I for one am very grateful.” Benita Hood, who manages the building, took the day off to attend a physio appointment and was gutted to miss the royal visitors.  Benita said: “I can’t believe I took the day off! “Oh my God I can’t believe they came to my building. “Nobody knew they were coming, we had no idea.

The mask can be created with just a thin paper towel, two elastic bands and a stapler. The single-use masks reportedly limit the transmission of droplets, lowering the chances of coronavirus carriers passing on the disease. Staples are used to secure the mask the elastic bands go around the useraposs ears. The creators said the mask should be thrown away after each use.

Since most of the world went into full blown lockdown, coronavirus hacks aplenty have been keeping citizens in isolation busy.  When lockdown was first announced almost four weeks ago, panic-buyers stripped the shelves of supermarkets bare, fearing goods would dry up. One top tip was to freeze milk in an ice cube tray for tea and coffee to avoid wastage.According toeatbydate , fresh milk can be frozen for three to six months. Though the texture and colour of the milk may change once thawed, it is still safe for consumption. One the milk cube has been thawed at room temperature, it can be added to tea and coffee when desired.

From being on the Titanic and trying to stop it sinking, to going for a walk with TV star Lorraine Kelly and her dog - our imaginations are running even more wild than usual as we catch  winks.Experts say itaposs because we are sleeping deeper and for longer, while some of us are suffering from anxiety about the unprecedented situation we find ourselves in. The Google search term “why am i having weird dreams lately” has quadrupled in the past week in the United States alone.People have also been sharing their #pandemicdreams on Twitter after being left either deeply distressed or just really baffled.In my dream, I called an Uber, but a hearse showed up instead. Not liking these #pandemicdreams, posted one Twitter user. A second added: I dreamed I was on the sinking Titanic and I was in charge of figuring out how to fill the leboats to capacity but maintain social distancing in the leboats, and everyone cared more about N masks than lejackets. While a third wrote: I was arguing with a guy in Tesco as he was standing in my spot at the till then I went for a walk with Lorraine Kelly and her dog Angus! Another mused: I dreamt Boris Johnson was feeding me ice cream off a spoon.  Some are finding that they are getting more rest than normal in lockdown, however around a third are reporting losing sleep and suffering restless nights. A study in France found that the coronavirus pandemic has caused a  per cent increase in dreams, with people reporting  per cent more negative ones than usual.Another study in Italy - one of the worst affected countries by Covid- - found that many were experiencing nightmares and parasomnias in line with symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Sleep medicine expert Dr Meir Kryger said: This [pandemic] is something that theyaposve never experienced before.  And itaposs possible that their brains are trying to find a time when things werenapost like that.Itaposs like when sometimes people are trying to fall asleep and they canapost turn their minds off. They will try to think about a time when things were better. A dedicated Twitter account – @IDreamofCovid – has even been set up to collate peopleaposs dreams, as well as a Reddit thread. In the UK, sleep expert Professor Russell Foster said the majority of Brits are experiencing a spike in vivid dreams. Professor Foster, who is a director of the Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute at Oxford, told the Sunday Times: Many of us now seem to be populating our dreams with images from the current crisis. Because we are sleeping longer and more deeply, we are having more vivid dreams and remembering them better. And Patrick McNamara, an expert in dreams, told National Geographic: “We normally use REM sleep and dreams to handle intense emotions, particularly negative emotions.Obviously, this pandemic is producing a lot of stress and anxiety.” So what do our most common dream means  A new study from online bed specialists, Bed SOS, which spoke to , people has revealed their top  most common dreams.It showed what percentage of the , had dreamt about:Having sexFallingBeing chasedTeeth falling out or crumblingBeing at workBeing lateFlyingMeeting a celebrityBeing cheated onDemons or monsters - nightmares  in  men also said they have dreamed about being pregnant. Dr Keith Hearne, a British psychologist who conducted the world’s first sleep-lab research into lucid dreams, said: “Dreams, especially those that wake you suddenly, are probably best understood - not literally - but as symbolic messages, and verbal puns, from your wise unconscious. The emotion left on waking is probably the best indicator of whether the dream portrayed something good or bad.” He also explained the deeper meanings behind common dreams... Dreams about sex It is not unusual for human beings to be attracted to each other. In the generally friendly long-term situation of a work-place, little fantasies and flirtations often occur. Freud would have said that a part of our personality which seeks basic gratication, would be responsible. In dreams it is safe to happen and can remain unspoken. Dreams about falling This can cover several dferent scenarios, and often seems to come up as a linguistic pun. The word ‘fall’ is used in several contexts in everyday le. It may appear either as a wish , or refer to a negative event . Recall what was happening in the dream, and the characters present, to uncover the probable topic. Dreams about teeth falling out or crumbling Apart from direct warnings from the unconscious of poor dental care, this dream may be interpreted as a warning that time is passing, and important things need to be done in le, or that you are embarrassed over something insensitive you’ve said to someone . Dreams about being at work Most reported dreams are about ordinary daily situations, so in the two hours or so of dreaming each night it is not surprising to find yourself at work – especiallyyou actually enjoy your job – or carry work-stress home. Dreams about being late This is a common term in waking le for missing an opportunity. In dreams it can be visually and dramatically displayed. Perhaps your unconscious is chiding you for your laziness. Dreams about flyingThis is a well-known metaphor for doing well in le and progressing with ease. Such a positive theme can ‘make your day’ and be encouraging for even more success.Dream about being cheated on by your partner Sometimes such a dream is indicating to the dreamer that cheating is indeed happening. The subconscious is sensitive to subtle clues that go unnoticed consciously, and the dream is just about the only channel of the communication to consciousness. But equally, a person who is lacking in trust may project that issue into their relationship. If the dream occurs in each relationship, the cause is more likely to be the latter.  Dream about demons or monstersThese are feared by most people, but in fact they present a wonderful portal for experiencing ‘lucid’ dreams. Nightmares usually have the same sequence of events. At some point in the dream, the thought occurs ‘Oh, here’s the nightmare’ - which unfortunately has the effect of releasing the full nightmare. You can however convert it into a lucid dream, using the main ‘law’ of all dreaming - that what you think, you will then dream. The technique is to change the mind set from ‘Oh, no! - here’s the nightmare’ to ‘Great, wonderful, here’s the nightmare. That means I’m dreaming, and I can control my dreams.

For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here Kathrine Polak, a FOUR PAWS veterinarian, says that the shocking practice of eating dogs and cats carries the risk of new illnesses spreading. The unsanitary conditions associated with the cat and dog meat trade, coupled with the contamination risks of having so many dferent animal species caged and killed alongside one another, present the perfect breeding ground for new and deadly diseases, like COVID-, she said. The charity is urging governments to shut down cruel live animal markets, which it describes as ticking time bombs. It says that Phnom Penh, Cambodiaaposs capital, has a shocking  restaurants which serve up dog meat, which has been linked to cases of cholera, trichinella and rabies. But one seller says that in her community, it is believed that eating dogs can prevent colds and viral illnesses. It is claimed that doctors have been encouraging people that it is safe to eat as it is natural, without chemicals. Although Vietnam has a tradition of eating dog meat, Micheal Chour, founder of charity the Sound of Animals, says that the recent rise is also down to Chinese influence.  There was a big increase in the number of Chinese workers coming to the country and they have bought many of their practices along with them, he told the Sun. Many of those, such as torture, have been introduced here and people believe that because China is a big and powerful country, that we should be listening to these practices. Vietnam currently has has  cases of coronavirus while Cambodia has . Neither country has recorded any deaths from the flu-like virus. Wet markets where live animals are sold, slaughtered and skinned, as customers browse the stalls, have reopened across China. The Wuhan wet market, has been widely blamed as the source of the virus, which has killed thousands of people across the world.

Maurina Musisinyana, , had left her two children playing under an umbrella on the bank of the Runde River in Zimbabwe while she went fishing nearby. She heard a scream and dashed back to find the umbrella floating in the water – and the crocodile ­dragging away son Gideon, three. Maurina jumped on the beast and used her fingers to block its nose, forcing it to release its grip on the boy. She managed to snatch Gideon away but the crocodile bit her hand. Her boy was rushed to hospital after the horror, near Gonarezhou National Park, with severe bleeding and facial injuries that were making it hard for him to breathe. But he has since made a  full recovery. Maurina, from Chihosi village, Chiredzi, said: “I pressed its nose hard, a tip I learnt from the elders long back.  “If you ­suffocate a crocodile from its nose it loses its strength and that is exactly what I did. I used my other arm to free my baby’s head from its jaws. Even to this day, I still do not believe I rescued my son.” "},{"url":null,"title":"scan finds coronavirus lungs healthy","story":"NewsScan finds coronavirus in lungs of healthy woman, , with no symptomsThe worried woman went to a hospital and asked to be tested for coronavirus after a relative died of Covid-, and two days later she was being treated in hospital for the killer bugShareCommentsByChris Kitching:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video vr-video-shows-damage-coronavirus-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news world-news scan-finds-coronavirus-lungs-healthy-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

The worried -year-old woman went to a hospital and asked to be tested for the new strain of coronavirus after one of her relatives caught the flu-like bug and died.Her CT scan revealed patches look like frosted glass - or fluid in the spaces in the lungs - which are commonly found in X-rays of patients with severe cases. By analysing scans from patients around the world, doctors have been able to identy specic abnormalities caused by Covid- and the patterns are similar to those found in victims of the SARS and MERS outbreaks. Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror.  In the -year-oldaposs case, she presented to an imaging department in Iran after the death of a relative, ABC News reported.Normally, a person would not be given a chest scan in such as scenario, but doctors made an exception in her case. They found ground glass opacity in her lungs, the markings of Covid- pneumonia. She was being treated for the highly contagious virus in hospital two days later.Radiologists are now sharing the womanaposs CT scan - and the X-rays of hundreds of other patients - to better understand the typical signs of the virus and understand the damage that it can do to the lungs. Tehran-based radiologist Dr Bahman Rasuli shared the -year-old womanaposs scan with the Australian website Radiopaedia.org. He told ABC News: She insisted on taking a CT scan because she was very worried. Maybe this case in Australia would not have taken a CT scan, despite her insisting, but the physician saw her worry about the person who died and we just did the CT scan to relieve her mind.  Paediatric radiologist Jeremy Jones, of the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh, said staff have discovered coronavirus cases while scanning patients for other reasons. He added: We had a couple of cases where [patients] had presented with abdominal pain and they got a CT scan of their tummy, but actually, we saw at the bottom of their lungs they had the [signs] of Covid. Experts have been sharing and analysing scans since the first cases emerged in China late last year. Their findings could lead to a quicker diagnosis and help to prevent infections.  In one case, a -year-old man, who worked at the Wuhan seafood market where the virus was thought to have originated, went to a hospital after suffering a high fever and cough for almost two weeks on December  last year. A chest CT scan showed similar patches and scans taken later showed how the opacities had spread. The man was diagnosed with severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, but he died a week later. CT scans of a -year-old woman who tested positive after visiting Wuhan - where the outbreak started - showed white patches in her lungs.The abnormalities were more pronounced in later scans as her condition worsened. The woman was admitted to hospital after having a fever for a week, a cough, fatigue and chest congestion. She was diagnosed with severe Covid- pneumonia and treated with oxygen and antibiotics. A -year-old woman from Sichuan Province in China was diagnosed after ing from Japan and developing a fever, cough and chest pain.

It was then that we decided to put our foot on the ball and pause.#We conveyed that decision to the centre and ceased taking calls on the subject.  We needed time to develop a clearer DFC view on the situation.#Whilst it is not our responsibility to take the lead on solutions for the league , it is our duty to attempt to ensure that the future of Scottish Football remains promising for all the clubs.#To that end, we have we have worked tirelessly to achieve solutions to help those who were being disadvantaged and sought ways to help them.#We have discussed options with a iety of member clubs to show solidarity to the clubs most negatively impacted by the SPFL proposal.  Relegated clubs must have financial assistance to help soften the landing so they can begin the next season on more equitable footing.#Through our discussions it appears that there is an appetite to provide ious forms of support from other member clubsthese clubs are in fact relegated.  Further details of these acts of kindness and solidarity will be worked out amongst the member clubs.#Also, we are sorry to disappoint all of the conspiracy theorists by saying that we were never exposed to any ‘deals’ from either of the Glasgow giants.  They both acted, as we would expect, with complete professionalism.#Additionally and most importantly for Dundee FC, we spoke to other member clubs regarding their appetite for reconstruction, as the SPFL’s briefing notes does not give us much of a chance and this is the only aspect of any proposal that helps Dundee FC in any way.#There are several things that have to be in place in order to deliver a proper opportunity of achieving a better foundation for Scottish Football’s future.  First, a working group should be assembled and must have members from the highest levels of Scottish Football with long-term interest in the future success of the game.#We need to agree a set of goals that will be the basis of reconstruction which takes into account current and future wants and needs of media member clubs’ financial benefits and sporting integrity as a basis.#It is our belief that after speaking to numerous clubs that the appetite for reconstruction is there and the intention is to set up an immediate and focused working group to take on this task.  The centre will have to accept and support the will of the members.#We do believe the centre has made mistakes in this process, namely not taking into consideration any financial fallout to their member clubs and publishing of the incomplete ballot results, which has put Dundee FC in a position to receive criticism and undue torment.#If what we achieved in our pause was presented by the SPFL in the first instance we would have voted in favour of the proposal.#We would like to thank the fans for their patience, and most of the member clubs for their cooperation and support during this time.  Make no mistake, we continue to have a daunting task ahead of us, but we are encouraged by everyday acts of kindness, resolution, and humanity that we are all sharing as we get through this together.  Stay safe and hope we see you soon in a newly revamped league.#lthr  gtltstronggt🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

This was a highly unusual end to the season, to say the least, and not the one any of us would have preferred, but all three deserve enormous credit for their performances over the course of the season.“With the turmoil and uncertainty caused by the Covid- outbreak, there was always going to be a highly-charged and passionate debate about how we secure the future of Scottish football.“It is no exaggeration to say that this was an existential matter for Scottish clubs, with many of them telling us they were at real risk of going under unless the situation was resolved very quickly, so I’m pleased that the game has moved decisively.“Whilst more than % of clubs agreed with the directors’ written resolution, it’s clear that others were strongly opposed.“There has been talk of voiding the season, making emergency loans and so on, but what has been agreed today is not just the best way forward, it was the only realistic way forward and I now call on all  clubs to move forward in a constructive and positive way.”SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster also had his say on tonight’s development.He said: “Prior to this positive result, we were unable to make the vital end-of-season payments, which will provide a leline to so many clubs in the lower isions. From our detailed discussions with clubs, many were facing an enormous cash-flow crisis. We have moved as quickly as possible to try to resolve this unprecedented situation.“We’ve achieved the % agreement threshold in the Ladbrokes Premiership, Championship and Leagues  and  and will now be working as quickly as we can to get the end-of-season payments to members in the three lower isions by the end of this week.”🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

dundee fans want answers from john nelms over vote u turn","story":"Dundee chief John Nelms told fans a ‘yes’ vote was the best possible deal for the club after supporters questioned his U-turn in the SPFL voting saga.Managing director Nelms responded to an email from the Dundee Supporters Association, which comprises  clubs and over , members, after they demanded answers over the Dens Park side’s stance on the controversial SPFL proposal that handed titles to rivals Dundee United, Raith Rovers and Cove Rangers.The Dark Blues have been at the centre of the storm that engulfed Scottish football since last Friday’s requested deadline where their ‘no’ vote failed to arrive with the SPFL and subsequently saw the club holding the decisive call for five days.The club issued a statement at lunchtime yesterday outlining their side in the furore but fell short of declaring their intention to later change to a ‘yes’ vote which sparked outcry from a number of Dark Blues fans when it emerged.The vote saw the SPFL resolution passed but also brought forward league reconstruction talks with Hearts chair Ann Budge joined by Hamilton counterpart Les Gray leading the working group – a stipulation Nelms had made clear would be in exchange for a ‘yes’ to minimise the financial harm dished out to some clubs by the original deal and get the best deal for the Dee.The reaction has been mixed across the Dundee fan group, some positive, many refraining from casting judgement, but amongst that there has been real anger with some fans left dismayed and some even feeling betrayed by the change of decision from Nelms, prompting the request for answers from the DSA.The concern from many is the move did little for the club’s interests while, at the same time, gted the Championship league title to their fiercest rivals.The email sent by the DSA committee yesterday and seen by the Tele said: “We are sure everyone felt a sense of relief yesterday with the casting of the Dundee FC vote in regards to the SPFL resolution of April  but are disappointed that the club has not yet offered a statement to clary the Dundee FC position or explain the change of mind in the voting process from a ‘No’ to a ‘Yes’.“We would urge you therefore to make one as soon as possible to put an end to the conjecture which still continues.“Supporters of Dundee Football Club have been patient over the last few days while trusting that the club would make the correct decision in not just our interests and but the interests of Scottish football as a whole and would welcome a public statement of clarity.“The statement issued by the club yesterday was thought to be vague in some quarters and we feel did not clary or explain our voting position and so we would like to request that the club do this as soon as is practically possible.”Nelms moved quickly to try to assuage fears from the fans responding in a statement: “By way of further explanation of our statement from April , Dundee FC submitted its vote to the SPFL and issued its statement simultaneously.“There was no changing of our vote at any time that day as has been reported in some channels.“If what we achieved in our pause was presented by the SPFL in the first instance we would have voted in favour of the proposal on  April .“We have achieved the best deal possible out of a situation that was going to be bad for us in any iteration that was being proposed.“Let us be clear, no matter what the proposal looked like, the majority of the clubs in the Premiership and the Championship are proponents of promotion relegation.“Any solution that did not include this would not have enough support to be passed.  Therefore, the SPFL chose to include it to expedite the conclusion, but without considering the ramications to all clubs.“Most importantly for Dundee FC, we spoke to other member clubs regarding their appetite for reconstruction, as the SPFL’s briefing notes did not give us much of a chance.“This is the only aspect of any proposal that helps Dundee FC in any way.“As stated yesterday, reconstruction could help ensure the future of Scottish football as a sustainable and profitable one.“After speaking to numerous clubs we believe that the appetite for reconstruction is there and the intention is to establish an immediate and focused working group to take on this task.“We stated that the SPFL will have to accept and support the will of the members.  As you saw in the SPFL statement last night, they already have started this process.“In conclusion, from a very poor situation we have gotten the best result for Dundee FC and for Scottish football as a whole.“Of  teams,  have voted yes in a democratic ballot and for most, the important thing is the monies can be distributed and they can work on survival plans for their clubs.“It is time now toour focus on staying safe and planning for the future of Dundee FC.”🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to

will also discuss the planning permission required to form an access road from the A to MuirtackA previous bid for the project was rejected by councillors and the Scottish Government.The application has already been heard by the Formartine area committee but will now be heard at Buchan area committee as well, due to having a signicant impact on more than one area of Aberdeenshire.Sand and gravel would be extracted from the site, which is currently an undeveloped field.A total of  objections have been received on the application regarding extraction, and  on forming an access route.A report to be discussed by councillors next week states: “The proposal would see the extraction of approximately , tonnes of sand and gravel, with approximately , tonnes per annum anticipated.“Extraction would take place over two phases beginning in the north-west, moving east and south during phase one then towards the southern and eastern boundary in phase two.“The quarry is anticipated to remain active for between eight and  years, depending on the demand for the extracted resource.“Following the appeal decision, the applicant has now amended the access proposal which consists of forming new access joining the quarry at its northern edge to the A .km north-east of the site, approximately  metres north of an existing lay-by on the A.“The access would accommodate all traffic associated with the quarry operations.

I’d like Dundee United coming up, I’d like Inverness, I’d like Hearts to stay in the league.“If you had those big clubs in the league it would be good for the league.“For ourselves we’ve missed going to Dundee and Dundee United as those grounds are ones we like visiting as we take big crowds and they are games you want to be involved in.“Even Inverness, when they were in the league, although it was not the best of journeys, the games attracted a good support and they were good games as well.“It’s outwith my control and it’s down to the league but I’d like Dundee, Inverness and Dundee United in the league for sure.“You’re playing more teams but the league want Rangers playing Celtic four times a season as it has more people watching and it benefits the other teams in the league as well.“It attracts money into the game and helps the other teams outwith Celtic and Rangers but it’s the league’s decision.“I’m surethe league wants everything done right and as much money as possible they will want Celtic and Rangers playing each other as much as they can.“Having  or  teams in the league may hinder that in their eyes.”McGinn has been keeping himself busy during lockdown by training as well as helping Aberdeen’s Community Trust with phone calls to check on supporters.He has also been helping the trust with deliveries of food.The -year-old has been following developments this week with the lower league seasons declared over.McGinn has sympathy for those teams negatively impacted by the decision.He added: “It’s a tough situation to be in, even in the lower leagues where Falkirk are a point behindand Partick Thistle had a game in hand and a chance to move off the bottom of thetable.“You definitely feel sorry for the players there and the fact they didn’t get to fulfil their fixtures.“If you are in mid-table and not challenging or fighting relegation it is perhaps an easier decision to make but you do feel sorry for the teams who will be affected the most.”June  is the earliest clubs in Scotland will be able to resume training and it will be even longer before matches .McGinn reckons, following the extended lay-off, everyone will appreciate football more when it eventually s.He said: “We won’t take things for granted. We appreciate how much football and sport means to everyone.“We go out trying to win every game and fans will always be serious and passionate about their sport.“But everyone being able to watch their team win, lose or draw, can do so with a smile on their face.“There are games we won’t win but we have to come away happy we’re still able to play.“It’s times like now that you definitely appreciate when you were playing and whether it is three games a week we play you just want to be out there playing.“It will feel strange coming back after a long break not playing.“But I will appreciate things a lot more and hopefully we can attract more fans to help out the league and the inidual clubs.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 21 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAt the Argyllshire Advertiser we take pride in impartiality, believing our readers have the gumption to work things out for themselves without us reporting matters in a biased way.In the past five years, the paper has spoken out on just two important issues.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club. In , he flamboyantly arrived in Inverness by helicopter for Inveraray#s Camanachd Final against Kingussie."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs we have highlighted in the paper over the past few weeks, the response of the public in the coronavirus crisis has been superb.People generally have abided by government advice to stay at home.

We have three dogs and three cats in foster that were in place before the lockdown. We are trying to support them as much as possible.\"Unfortunately, the lockdown means that we cannot re-home any animals at this time. We had people lined up to come and meet two of the dogs on the week that the country went into lockdown and had to cancel their appointments due to this.\"Also, Pal, who has been waiting for over a year for a new home, was due to go away to his new home that week which has had to be put on hold. And we have no idea when he can finally go to his new home.\"And the centre isnt just coping with the stress of caring for the animals during a crisis, theyre also facing potential financial strain as the weeks progress.\"Our centre relies heavily on income generated from our four shops,\" added Lee-Ann. \"Seventy per cent of our annual income is generated via the shops so loss of income is a real concern.\"We have had to cancel fundraising events during the key fundraising period of spring summer.

I can see this being a dficult year.\"If anything, we may see animals being handed in. People will misjudge and panic about the situation. And it wont just be dogs being brought to rescues but being dumped.\"It will be interesting to see how this all works out.\"And to help ease the strain on the rescue, Sonia has created an Amazon wishlist for donations to help keep the dogs fed.The wishlist gives donors the option to either donate physical items, such as a bag of food, or they can gt a cash amount straight into the Greyhound Rescues account to spent on vital products.On the other hand, the Arthurshiel Rescue Centre, in St Boswells, hasnt seen an increase in their four-legged residents, with the charity manager Shona Middlemass saying: \"Were managing fine\".She added: \"Weve not had an influx of animals, any strays that get raised with us we share over Facebook.\"Fingers crossed everything keeps going smoothly, weve not had any problems.\"We dont have any cash coming in.

There are obviously many reasons why you may be thinking about acquiring a new dog.Our receptionist Lesley Baillie ndash who works in both Dunedin Vets branches in North Berwick and Prestonpans ndash recently had to bid farewell to her elderly dog Millie, her companion and friend for many years.Lesley was devastated but knew she needed a companion to fill the void. She began to consider which breed or type of dog would be best for her.The arrival of a new pet is a very exciting time, but careful consideration should be made regarding the type and breed of dog you choose.Many problems we encounter in the practice are a result of purchasing a pet not suited to lestyle and family environment.There are, however, many benefits of owning a pet. Companionship is the most obvious.Having a pet to talk to and interact with can take away many of the stresses of daily le.Taking a dog for a walk provides exercise and helps in creating a healthy lestyle. Having a pet is known to assist in the recovery from illness. In fact, PATdogs are encouraged in some hospital wards to help patients on the road to recovery.Dogs come in a huge iety of breeds, shapes and sizes, so choosing a dog to fit your lestyle can be extremely dficult. It is best to do lots of research before contemplating buying a dog.Many dogs have natural instincts such as herding and guarding, and these should be considered prior to choosing a dog.Also consider how the pup was raised. Were they house or kennel reared There are seven main classes of dogs, each with their own characteristics:l Toy dogs: as the name suggests, they are small dogs but are generally high maintenance and require a lot of grooming. They are, however, dogs and not toys or accessories. Examples: Bichon Frise and Chihuahua.l Utility breeds: there are a iety of breeds in this class but most tend to be courageous extroverts so need good control. Examples: bulldog and Dalmatian.l Terriers: they hunt by instinct and are brave and tough. They may be generally small but require lots of exercise and play. Examples: Border terrier and Airedale.l Hounds: these hunt and can be quite aloof they are quite independent and often like to be with one owner. Examples: bloodhound and basset hound.l Working dogs: as the name suggests, they have specic jobs. They are intelligent and may be quite large and guard dogs. Examples: St Bernard and Samoyed.l Pastoral dogs: these are bred to work with livestock and are very intelligent. They require mental and physical stimulation and tend to be tough and need a role. Examples: Border collie and Belgian shepherd dog.l Gundogs: they find and retrieve game. They have amenable temperaments and are active and affectionate. Examples: springer spaniel and retriever.We cannot, however, forget the crossbreed dogs, which are by far the most popular dogs around. Their nature will depend on their breeding and obviously they come in a huge range of sizes.Nowadays, there a large number of crossbreeds which are designated lsquodesigner breedsrsquo. Breeders will tell all the advantages of these lsquobreedsrsquo, but be aware not only are there advantages attributed to the parents, genetic traits from both breeds may also be present and in veterinary practice, we do see a disproportionately high number of problems with these dogs.There are many questions you should ask yourself before considering buying a dog.l Are there young children in the family  A utility dog, such as a miniature Schnauzer, or gundog e.g. Labrador may be breeds to consider.l Is everyone in the family out of the house during the day  Are you really able to look after a dog  An independent cat may be the best option.l Do you live in a flat  Consider a toy dog, e.g. Chihuahua.l Are you fit and able to go for long walks  Then the working or pastoral dogs should be considered e.g. Border collie or Doberman.l Do you have any fur allergies  Consider some the soft-coated dogs such as poodles.l Do you have a large garden  The terriers enjoy running around in enclosed spaces, e.g. Border or Patterdale terriers.Lesley considered very carefully what breed she should choose.She knew she wanted a fairly active dog who would enjoy long walks and travelling in her campervan with her.She also knew she did not want an overly large breed. She works part-time so wanted a breed which could be trusted to be left for short periods but was also friendly and enjoyed loving, human contact.After much deliberation, Lesley settled on a Tibetan terrier.These are a medium-sized breed originating in Tibet.Despite the name, they are not terriers but actually working dogs.They are therefore very loyal and affectionate but also energetic and sensitive.Tibetan terriers have a mid- coat which is very soft and hypoallergenic so excellent for anyone with animal hair allergies, but does require a good deal of grooming.After searching far and wide, Lesley found a breeder who had just had a litter of puppies.So, after a few weeks and a long journey, wee Hetty arrived home with Lesley.She really is a cutie and was so well behaved when Lesley brought her to the surgery.She is settling in well at home and hopefully she and Lesley will have many happy years and enjoyable adventures together.The rewards of owning a pet are immense.With careful consideration prior to purchasing a pet, you can have a cherished companion for many years to come.Caring for them can sometimes be a challenge but should give great pleasure to owner and pet alike."},{"url":null,"title":"couple-toast-diamond-wedding-anniversary","story":"The message came as a very pleasant surprise for Lyn and Alan Vaughan, who are living in self-isolation on the townrsquos Williamstone Court.Lyn said that, unknown to her, her daughter Julie had made contact with the relevant officials.ldquoThe letter from Her Majesty was as a huge surprise when it arrived, said a delighted Lyn.It was also thanks to Julie ndash though inadvertently ndash that the couple were able to celebrate with  members of their family and friends at a pre-anniversary dinner in La Potiniere restaurant in Gullane a few days before the coronavirus lockdown was imposed.ldquoJulie was going on be on a ski holiday on the actual date of our anniversary, so we had a family lunch at La Potiniere, said Lyn.ldquoDue to the lockdown we canrsquot see them now, so it was very fortunate that we got together that day.On the evening of their anniversary, they joined the applause for the NHS in their road.Lyn, , and Alan, , were both born and brought up in Birmingham.The couple met at a ballroom dancing class and got married three years later on March , .The couple moved to Scotland in the s when Alan was working as a chartered surveyor on the St James Centre in Edinburgh.They moved to Gullane in  and lived there for  years before moving to North Berwick so they could be closer to the railway station as Alan had become partially sighted.As well as Julie and Andrew, the couple had another son Chris, who sadly died in  from a brain tumour.

He didnrsquot live in the forest like the squirrel, but it was important for him as he would use the forest often to eat bark and twigs when there was no grass to eat.ldquoI wouldI could, said the hare, ldquobut the thing is I donrsquot have a bushy tail like you.ldquoHmm thatrsquos true said the squirrel, ldquobut you do have long ears.

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio.

Simple language, delivered calmly and directly, has the best chance of sinking in.Honesty, clarity, calmness and directness have never been more vital than now, as we try to take in the enormity of the coronavirus crisis and its consequences. And yet many of our leaders are showing themselves to be woefully, shamefully, sometimes even deliberately incapable of giving straight answers to some of the most fundamental questions.The public accepts that scientists and medics do not yet understand every facet and quirk of this virus. But there is simply no excuse for the disgraceful lack of honestly and clarity around many issues that politicians can control.If ever there was a time for politicians be direct with people, this is it. We do not want obsequiousness, we do not need the pill to be sugar-coated. Donrsquot patronise or insult us. Just tell it like it is, even when itrsquos bad. Especially when itsbad.

Be up front when the system is struggling to cope tell us what work is being done to remedy failures and give us a realistic assessment of whether the action will be successful.:Home Secretary lsquosorrypeople feel there have been failings over PPE supplyrsquoWe badly need a new, more direct approach, particularly from the UK Government, one that is better able to encompass the eye-popping statistics and harsh truths created by coronavirus.The current information vacuum grows more worrying by the day. After all, there is still no reliable death toll, no UK or Scottish stats that include care home and community deaths as well as those that took place in hospital. Grieving relatives are left to tell their stories on social media, devastated that their loved-onersquos death doesnrsquot seem to count, distressed at the lack of knowledge or discussion around care home guidelines.There is still no honest or plausible explanation for why so few coronavirus tests are taking place, or why tracing ndash which has helped Germany and South Korea keep deaths down ndash was abandoned so early on. It cannot be unrelated that no minister or official dares to explain why the death toll in the UK is on course to surpass that of Italy and Spain, despite having had more time to prepare. People in England are dying of Covid- at . times the rate of Ireland, which has a comparable number of ICU beds per head of population.Theses and explanations already exist, of course, but are not judged by politicians to be politically expedient or comfortable. And thatrsquos how you end up with the likes of Home Secretary Priti Patel, the coldest fish this side of Greenland, issuing a textbook  apology ndash ldquoIrsquom sorryYOU feel there are failings ndash at a recent daily briefing. This chastising tone is an insult to us all, not least the dead and bereaved.Indeed, the defensive insults are starting to stack up. Over the weekend Ms Patelrsquos cabinet colleague Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, made the contemptuous suggestion that the continuing shortage of personal protective equipment at the frontline could be down to doctors and nurses over-using it.And while some sections of the media choose to focus unhealthy amounts of attention on one particularly well-known Covid- patient, offering a running commentary on his recovery complete with sudoku, texts from his girlfriend and the films he is watching from his hospital bed, it is left to others to highlight the far bigger tragedies already emerging from this crisis.As Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis pointed out in a blistering attack on the patronising and ldquomisleading language being used by some ministers during the crisis, we are not all in this together.

That the arrogance of this post-imperial country, with its delusions of Global Britain, led the UK elite to ignore the threat of Covid- until it was too late.Many Scottish nationalists feel much the same and say that Scotland has been harnessed to inept policies fashioned by a grossly incompetent Tory clique in Westminster.If only we could have closed the border with England, they sigh, looking at the way Jacinda Ardern has handled things in New Zealand, where the disease appears to have been stamped out by a total lockdown. At least for now.Reports that English firms had been declining requests from Scottish care homes for protective gear only confirm the suspicion that Scotland is a low priority, at the back of the queue, an afterthought.The SNP MP Angus Brendan MacNeil is by no means alone in believing that Scotland would be better ldquodealing with [our] own problems unfettered..[like]Norway, Ireland. Many MSPs are saying so privately, and wondering why Nicola Sturgeon is not distancing herself from the ldquolaissez faire approach of the English Tories.It was certainly possible that Scotland could have taken a dferent path to the rest of the UK. Smaller countries like Iceland and Singapore moved faster in locking down against Covid . Ireland closed the schools earlier than we did and seems to have been much better at suppressing the disease. Certainly the crude death rate has been around half the UKrsquos.But there is a problem: throughout this crisis there has been no signicant dference between Ms Sturgeonrsquos approach to coronavirus and that of the other three nations in the four-nation pandemic alliance. SNP MPs may say that the Scottish Government was press-ganged into backing the UK approach to handling Covid- and that her instinct was to go for a much tougher lock down earlier. However, there is no basis for thinking this.When Leo Varadkar made his dramatic announcement on March  closing the schools in Ireland, the First Ministerrsquos response was that this was unnecessary. She said she agreed with her own medical advisers that the disease would likely be spread just as readily by children at home, and that the emergency services would be undermined by parents having to stay at home to look after their kids.As for testing, this was actually stopped by the Scottish Government in mid March. As the National Clinical Director, Professor Jason Leitch, told Channel  on March , ldquocommunity testing and contact-tracing was halted after the containment phase. The First Minister was fully aware of this. On April , standing next to Ms Sturgeon, the then Chief Medical Officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, said that testing was ldquoa distraction. This seemed to be a general view among UK medical advisers.Ms Sturgeon has said that she ldquofollowed the science. This has been the mantra used by ministers like the UK Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, since this outbreak began. Many commentators regard this as a convenient excuse for incompetence. ldquoWhy didnrsquot they listen to dferent scientists and the World Health Organisation who were advising countries to test, test, test But Britain has some of the best epidemiologists in the world sitting on the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies. The UK Chief Scientic Adviser, Professor Patrick Vallance, said again yesterday that ldquoI donrsquot think it is quite right that testing saves lives. Our medics still believe that tests should be confined to people who have symptoms and to essential workers. Mass testing will only make sense in their view when there is a reliable antibody test ndash and there isnrsquot one.Yet, testing and contact-tracing seems to have worked where, not just in South Korea, but in Germany where the death rate has been signicantly lower. Critics like Professor Devi Sridhar, Chair of Global Public Health at Edinburgh University, insist that the Scottish Government could and should have embarked on mass testing, though itrsquos not clear how it could have found the capacity so to do.She also claims that Mr Johnson and Ms Sturgeon adopted a ldquoherd immunity strategy because of ldquoBritish exceptionalism. Herd immunity has morphed into an ideological battle-ground, rather than an epidemiological truism.The problem for politicians like Ms Sturgeon is that they are expected to base their policy on ldquothe science, listen to the ldquoexperts, and make policy ldquoevidence based. But as soon as they do so, they are liable to be accused of listening to the wrong kind of scientists.Epidemiologists take a long view about the progress of a disease through its le-cycle involving several peaks and troughs. They have said from the start that since there is no vaccine,  per cent of us are going to get the disease anyway so there is no way of stopping it. That was one of the first remarks Ms Sturgeon made about Covid-.It is what the top UK advisers, like Professor Vallance meant when they were talking about herd immunity. In the absence of a vaccine, they believed that the only way the disease would die out would be when most of us were exposed to it. Prof Leitch was adamant on March  that : ldquothe alternative ndash closing the borders and locking everyone down ndash doesnrsquot work over a prolonged period.Thatrsquos as may be, but it now looks asthe politically savvy thing to have done was to ignore all this and go for a panic lockdown to show the voters that you are serious. In politics, doing something is always more appealing than not doing something.Scientists donrsquot have to answer to Twitter. The political cycle is not on the same trajectory as this disease, and politicians will get no credit for being right in a couple of yearsrsquo time.Shops across Scotland are closing.

In my tweed coat and Alice-band I probably embody the profile of a rural alcoholic. Trying not to look desperate or furtive only made it worse.Whisky isnrsquot my tipple, but among my first thoughts ahead of the lockdown was to ensure we had enough wine to see us through. The problem, of course, is how to define enough. Judging by the spike in wine deliveries across the UK in March, many were equally eager to lay down a cellar ndash or in our case a boiler cupboard ndash for the troublesome times ahead.

Income plays some part in what we consider crucial to keep body and soul together. Yet beyond the basic and inarguable provisions for making decent meals and keeping the household clean, where exactly is the line that distinguishes justiable consumption from self-indulgence  And who is in a position to judge one from the other  On a scale of one to , for instance, how do ice-cream or pimento-stuffed olives score  Are beef burgers or pizzas the wisest way to eat, or could a police officer confiscate these and insist we replace them with broccoli and wild salmon Most worrying of all, for me at least, is whether we should be abstaining from olive oil, the ingredient without which no dinner in our house is considered complete, and replacing it with a local equivalent, thereby avoiding air miles, and supporting our own economy  If so, what would that stand-in be ndash dripping or lard While the police thankfully did a U-turn on its threat to put our shopping under surveillance, it will have made some of us considerably more self-conscious as we feed our goods onto the conveyor belt. I never normally give it a thought, but now Irsquoll be worrying what antisocial habits my trolley reveals.Doubtless the contents of most baskets would not cause an officer to pause for a nanosecond, unless they included a box of party invitations and enough barbecue coals to fuel a power station. But now the issue has been raised, it makes you re-evaluate every purchase.After rummaging through my wardrobe, I can probably get through to the end of the year without buying anything  other than plimsolls. By December I might be looking a little shabby, but thatrsquos hardly news. And, since mending and making do is enjoying a comeback, others will presumably be in much the same state.If nothing , this enforced stasis offers the space to reflect on how often what we buy is surplus to requirement. Compost bins and landfill must be groaning under the weight of food whose sell by date, like one of Douglas Adamsrsquos deadlines, whooshed by ages ago. Last week a neighbour discovered self-raising flour among her long-lost ingredients at the back of the cupboard and, after checking for weevils, enjoyed a baking spree with some equally ancient dried yeast. Going through his chest of drawers, my husband came upon a lovely unworn jumper of mine that is at least a decade old, but looks brand new. That I hadnrsquot noticed its absence speaks for itself.What previously felt like must-haves now simply suggest a reflex. The act of repeatedly reaching out and purchasing says more about a magpie urge to acquire than any critical shortage. This is not a puritanical call to give up the worldly or frivolous or, when the good times , to eschew the pleasures of things that, strictly speaking, we could get by without. Tens of thousands of businesses, artists and companies would be bankruptedwe adopted an ascetic lestyle that pared everything to the bone. In fact, when finally we unlock, we will actively need to help cash-strapped outfits and iniduals get back on their feet.As Europe takes its initial tentative steps towards easing restrictions, the notion of what is indispensable to daily existence moves beyond the hypothetical to something more profound. In some parts of Italy, bookshops, stationers and stores selling childrenrsquos and baby clothes are now being allowed to open, under strict conditions. In Austria, meanwhile, garden centres and hardware shops are back in business.These highly specic priorities are revealing of each nationrsquos personality. And while some would refute the idea that books or plants are anything other than accessories, Irsquod go to the barricades to defend both as central to survival. After sustenance and medication, we need a reason to exist beyond merely ticking over. The proleration of good bookshops in Italy shows its reverence for literature, a cultural bias that is confirmed by this decision. Perhaps the authorities recognise that, while enforced incarceration is likely to continue for some time, people must be allowed to feed their minds and imaginations as well as their stomachs.The same goes for gardening, which is a universal expression of the desire to nurture and grow. Such is the over-abundance of stock in garden centres and nurseries right now, getting the tills ringing makes economic sense as well as offering a glimmer of light at the end of the polytunnel.Shops across Scotland are closing.

It is glorious.Even in the centre of the city the roads are largely silent. While its eerie, definitely, for the cyclist it is exciting. The roads are mine.Elsewhere, children cycle along with their parents, in that zig zaggy way little kids do, unfussed about straight lines. Older couples cycle side by side, leisurely, having a lovely time.Its not only the newfound freedom of space that makes the roads more enticing, its the lack of noise. Theres a nice silence, easy on the ears. Birdsong is more pronounced.Of course, its not all utopia. There are still idiots treating the almost empty roads as a racetrack challenge and lets hope these chumps feel the force of the law. Police forces in some parts of the UK have said the number of motorists exceeding speed limits has doubled since the start of the coronavirus lockdown.But, broadly, we are being given a glimpse of what cycling cities could look like. Its being widely reported that the sales of bikes are up. Cycling Scotlands figures show that in some areas the number of cyclists has doubled or more.Other countries have seen similar increases in cycling and have seized the opportunity to make cities more bike and foot friendly. Cities in Germany are turning roads into bike lanes to help people with social distancing.Road layouts have been adapted with relative ease using removable tape and mobile signs. The redesign of urban spaces helps everyone as it takes pressure off parks as people take their exercise on the roads, and gives more space to pedestrians trying to keep their two metre distance by stepping into the road.London is also looking at repurposing space on its busiest roads to make more room for cyclists and pedestrians. This is the perfect time for Scotland to do the same.There will be plenty of people tempted by cycling but who are afraid of going on the roads, given how congested they usually are.Novice cyclists are not now competing with as much traffic and so its the perfect time to gain confidence, find routes that work for them and develop a healthy habit that they wont want to kick when the lockdown lts.It also plans to reduce speed limits across the city. Were seeing, right now, what a car free city centre could look like. And its pretty glorious, as long as we have the public transport network to support it.Could we also introduce reduced speed limits  Cycling is a safe mode of transport - the danger comes from external forces and, even in lockdown, drivers are still putting their foot down and making roads less safe. If we could further curb that with an increase in mph zones, what a dference it would make to the feel of the roads.Deep rooted health inequalities dont go away during lockdown people still have diseases linked with inactivity.Cars destroy health - at an inidual and societal level. They destroy the environment.There are so many sound and sensible reasons for pushing active travel and cutting car use - we know them well already.The dference now is that this is such an opportunity to demonstrate the benefits of lightening the vehicular load on our roads.The means of creating wider pavements and segregated cycle lanes are easy to do, simple toto normal when lockdown lts. This, though, is a point for and a point against.Its hard to argue against simple, easily reversible measures. But when the pandemic is over we want to keep people using active travel. Hopefully, having had so many more people using cycling as a means of getting around, there will be wider support for current cycling strategies.Maybe there will be a push to take them further.It would be a great shame to see the current enthusiasm for cycling wane as lockdown is lted.It is joyous to see families cycling together, couples out on the roads, novice cyclists confidently owning the tarmac - all with reduced fear of vehicles.It is joyous to cycle fear-free down the middle of a road. It is a boost to mental and physical health, the fresh air, the bird song, the pure pleasure of physically activity.All columnists are free to express their opinions.

A death begets a byelection. Crises, however grim, can be opportunities.So it was quite a surprise to see the SNP come over all prim and prissy this week about discussing independence in relation to the coronavirus.The prompt was Scottish Tory leader Jackson Carlaw joining the dots between the two as he looked ahead to the  Holyrood election.ldquoI think it will look ridiculousthe first debate that the Nationalist movement want to have when we get to the other side of this is lsquoLetrsquos go gung ho for independence next yearrsquo, then more fool themthey do, he told the PA news agency.ldquoI think the public will look at that and say lsquoAre you kidding rsquoHe then twisted the dirk by observing Scotland was being helped through the outbreak by the UKrsquos ldquoeconomic resilience and strength.The SNPrsquos reaction to this was to try to shut down the debate entirely, a sure sign Mr Carlaw had drawn blood.ldquoThe last thing any Scottish politician on any side of the constitutional debate should be doing is trying to use the appalling crisis we all currently face as an argument for or against independence, the party gasped.Obviously, therersquos a calculation to be made about how far to venture into regular politics during the pandemic.The public has lost much of its appetite for the previous argy-bargy.But for the party of independence to echo Theresa May and say now is not the time to argue for its cause at all Well, that was a moment.Becauseever there was a time for the SNP to talk about independence - at least to itself - it is surely right now.Its previous case for leaving the UK, of a healthier economy creating a fairer society, is being dismantled by Covid-. Not speaking up would be a dereliction of the partyrsquos mission.The First Minister, as the tireless face of Scotlandrsquos response to the emergency, is an understandable exception. But for the Yes movementrsquos sake, she cannot be the rule.SNP MP Angus Brendan MacNeil had the right idea. He simply ignored the injunction from party HQ and tweeted that it was good Mr Carlaw brought up independence, as it let the SNP government mention it too and ldquohighlight that dealing with your own problems unfettered... is better.Regardless of whether you agree with his point, it made perfect sense for Mr MacNeil to make it, to keep saying what he believes in, and not cede the floor to his opponents.He could see Mr Carlaw wasnrsquot squeamish about a Unionist argument based on Covid-. That reference to the UKrsquos economic resilience and strength was a straw in the wind.Come the  election, the Tories, Labour and LibDems will be arguing that the Union, far from being an abstract anachronism, proved its worth in this crisis. That when it really mattered, Westminster broke the emergency glass at the Treasury and hosed the country with money. That the insurance policy paid out.: Mark Smith: A message for nationalists: do not make the virus about Scotland versus England ndash it demeans youPeople will of course argue over the many failings, about testing, PPE and the threadbare state of the NHS and the welfare state going into this.But the key message from the Unionist side, like it or loathe it, will be that the four-nations of the UK pulled together and got things done.And while there were regional tweaks, Scotland was a core part and beneficiary of that collective effort. Go ask its Nationalist First Minister.That argument is what the Yes movement, with its garlands of rosy hypotheticals, now has to overcome.It must rethink its own arguments - not its beliefs, but its messages to the unpersuaded - and it needs to get a sht on. Above all, it needs to say how a fledgling state can take off in the worst recession in a century.For what goes into the next white paper on independence now It was supposed to be rooted in Andrew Wilsonrsquos Growth Commission, the SNPrsquos economic blueprint for a new Scotland.Itrsquos not Mr Wilsonrsquos fault he didnrsquot factor in a pandemic. But it has made much of his work redundant.Its research on how small countries can prosper is salvageable. But his calculations for the first decade of independence - based on long-term growth of .%, halving a deficit of %, keeping debt below % of GDP - look like bygones of a dferent era.As the report said, persuading No voters about the economics of independence will need ldquoclear-sighted reality and a rigorous plan.But as wersquove learned, no plan survives contact with coronavirus, and economic plans least of all.That particular pillar of the SNPrsquos case has now crumbled. The longer the crisis goes on, the more pages in the old prospectus will turn blank.The one thing that could yet change the dynamic is Brexit. If the UK government refuses to extend trade talks with the EU in light of coronavirus and brings about a hard lurch to WTO terms in the depths of a recession, it will squander any credit it is accumulating at present, and remind a lot of Scottish voters why they wanted to wave Westminster goodbye.:Scottish independence support maintains lead in latest pollHowever the current refusal to change course probably owes more to the absence of the only Tory who can sell an extension to Leave voters than dogmatism. Only once the Prime Minister s from convalescence can a pragmatic position prevail.Eventhe PM sticks to his original mad timetable, Ms Sturgeon cannot rely on it tipping the case for independence. She needs a new pitch as well.Her announcement yesterday of an economic recovery advisory group acknowledged that. Despite insisting she has no time for party politics right now, she said the new group would plan how to build a ldquofairer, greener and more equal society after Covid-, a clear nod to independence.It will be instructive to see how many politicians she sprinkles among the economists and business leaders to help steer it in that direction.God knows, she needs something to go right for her cause just now.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

But the behaviour results in too many people arriving in locations that have less resources to deal with an increase in patients, who need specialist and often intensive care facilities.Scottish communities angrily reacted to the influx in visitors - some resorting to barricading lay-bys and would-be camping areas - warning that their already-under pressure local health services cannot cope with the extra strain.Last month, a military aircraft was needed to transport a critically-ill coronavirus patient from the Shetland Islands to Aberdeen to receive intensive care treatment.This led to the Scottish Government announcing that ferries services were now to only be used for islanders, allowing them to continue essential journeys.Even before the official lockdown was put in place, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told accommodation providers to stop accepting bookings - a message reiterated ahead of what would have been the Easter holidays.A Scottish Government spokesperson, said: ldquoWe need everyone to stay at home to help us save lives and protect our NHS.\"We also need businesses to help us achieve this.

Those wanting more than a stream of the new tunes were able to pre-order CD or vinyl copies ndash Cinnamon has spent his weeks in lockdown signing some at random ndash and for the true believer The Bonnyis available on flame-coloured vinyl, all delivered via Cinnamonrsquos website.Born Gerard Crosbie in Glasgow in October  and raised mostly in Castlemilk and mainly by his mother, Cinnamonrsquos stage name comes from The Cinnamons, the short-lived band he fronted in the late Noughties with friend and fellow Castlemilk boy Chris Marshall. By  he was performing on his own as Gerry Cinnamon at pro-independence events and had recorded Hope Over Fear, a rousing anthem for the movement. He gave up the series of jobs he had had since leaving school ndash among them scaffolder, joiner and chef ndash and honed his sound playing at Open Mic and Jam Nights at the Priory bar on Sauchiehall Street. Word of mouth seems to have done the rest. Although technically unsigned when he announced that he would play two nights at the Barrowland in , tickets sold out in hours. The same thing happened two years earlier when a Facebook post alerted fans to a date at the cityrsquos O Academy on Sauchiehall Street.Following that gig, Cinnamon gave a rare interview to Glasgow Liversquos Christopher McQuade.ldquoThe only reason Irsquom in this game is because itrsquos full of imposters ruining music and my very existence annoys them and it pleases me, he said then. ldquoIf yoursquore a working class musician hearing this or reading it and you respect the art of song-writing more than the art of pretending, then you have a responsibility to get involved. Therersquos a war on for real music andyoursquore sound and can write decent tunes then yoursquore on the front line whether you like it or not.The essence of his approach, he said, could be summed up as ldquoanti-marketing hellip thats what I call it. I try not to sell myself because it feels fake. Not for him the ldquosmoke and mirrors of  stories cooked up by publicists to make their artist appear more interesting. ldquoIf you try to pretend youre something youre not folk will see right through it andthey dont then what does that achieve . Not for him a record label taking half of his money ldquofor absolutely nothing. He prefers to try to do it himself.Late last year Cinnamon broke cover again to talk to veteran Scottish rock journalist Craig McLean ndash and in re-vitalised s style bible The Face, of all places. All it took was six months of negotiations and an audition of sorts when the pair met at a concert in London. ldquoI donrsquot deal with people that I donrsquot trust and I donrsquot trust people that I donrsquot know, so I donrsquot deal with any c*** is how the situation was explained to McLean.The interview itself finally took place ahead of Cinnamonrsquos gig at the cavernous, ,-capacity PJ Live complex in Aberdeen, but revelations were few. Cinnamon suffers from insomnia, which is what new song Head In The Clouds is about. Hersquos managed by his partner, Kayleigh, a former human rights lawyer. He has a dog called Rascal. Fame feels like ldquoholding on to the spoiler of a Subaru Impreza going round a roundabout at  miles per hour.But he did re-state his aims and perhaps itrsquos their awesome simplicity which drive to the heart of his ever-growing appeal ndash a desire to tell the truth, give audiences the best night ever and show it can be done by one man on a stage with a guitar and a head full of killer songs. And to forget the rules because ldquothe rules are bullshit, man.You canrsquot buy his sort of adulation, and you can only sell the thing that inspires itappears to transcend the cynicism of the industry and the empty posturing of many of those who inhabit it. Gerry Cinnamon, who affects to care only for the songs and the buzz and not a jot for the numbers, seems to have squared that circle. He has the mystique of the cult star, the common touch of the Everyman and ndash just one of the reasons hersquos so adored in his homeland ndash the tongue and the wit and the insight of the true Glasgow patter merchant. In an age in which disruption is praised and disruptors held up as mould-breakers to be emulated, itrsquos Bob Dylan caps off to the wee guy from Castlemilk who took on the music industry and won.The Bonny is out now___________________________________________________________Shops across Scotland are closing.

Cue worldwide debate to settle this thorny issue once and for all.Diary enthusiasts likewise squabble over which of our tales is the daftest. To help them reach a definitive conclusion we continue to celebrate our classic tales and quirky comments each Saturday.For instance, we recall the time a reader asked why abbreviation is such a long word.Legal languageWE often reminisce fondly over the quality quips of J Irvine Smith, the legendary sherf who graced the courts of Glasgow and Greenock. Having listened to an accused recite his version of events, Irvine Smith leaned forward and told him: ldquoYou are a fecund liar.ldquoOh no Irsquom not, said the accused. ldquoIrsquom telling the f***ing truth!High dudgeonTHERE appears to be no bounds to the allergy your average Celtic fan has to anything remotely connected with Rangers. We heard of one Hoops fan on a construction site who hated using the  lt because it was made by a company called Alimac. This meant it was an Alimac hoist.A light-ly storyA LANARKSHIRE father told us of the time his daughter noticed her car was low on petrol as she drove home. Ten minutes later she was stopped by the polis and asked why, at pm, she was driving without lights. She replied: ldquoIrsquom almost out of petrol so I switched off the lights to save fuel.Thistle do nicelyWE recall the advert for a shortbread mould that read: ldquoOur eight-inch shortbread mould is expertly hand-carved in Scotland with a pineapple mot. The traditional symbol of welcome and friendship. The pineapple mot, on closer inspection, looked awfy like a thistle.Ch-ch-ch changesTHE Diary has always had a penchant for detailing the dramatic changes in Glasgow over the past few decades. For instance, a while back no self-respecting Glesga journalist would use a word like penchant.Another example. A proud Glaswegianrsquos girlfriend used to be called Senga and she was a waitress in the works canteen. Nowadays shersquos called Miranda and shersquos a drama student who works part-time as a waitress with an outside catering company who provide on-location buffets for the BBC.Eveningrsquos entertainmentANOTHER of our favourite stories about the comedian Chic Murray, who was famous for his conversations with his doctor. ldquoTell me, asked the GP, ldquoAre you disturbed by improper thoughts during the night ldquoNo, Chic replied. ldquoI actually enjoy them.Menu minus mini munchersA SCOT on holiday in Winchester was severely molested by mysterious insects in the hotel garden.

Both Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, and the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon were at pains to stress in their daily briefings that a precipitate easing of restrictions could endanger the progress that has been made, and waste the enormous sacrices that have already been made by so many.They were right, too, to resist calls for a timetable on possible changes. If, as all the UKrsquos governments have accepted thus far, policy is guided by the science, it would be foolhardy to assume that the worst is past until there are solid grounds for believing matters are under control.At best, we may have done enough to slow transmission, to buy time for the NHS to prepare, and to ready infrastructure to deal with this deadly disease. The questions that remain over the availability of PPE, or reliable testing, or other less urgent supply chains indicate we cannot yet be sure even of that.Unless and until a vaccine is developed and ready for distribution, every countryrsquos response to the coronavirus has been one of containment alone: the disease will not go away. A premature end to lockdown could make matters worse ndash and psychologically, it will be much harder to reintroduce necessary measures once they have been loosened.Butwe should not expect a firm timetable for the reopening of schools, factories or shops, we can at least enquire what the current thinking is on the criteria that will allow such decisions to be made. That mightinclude a combination of factors: confident assessment that the number of deaths each day is falling, widespread reliable testing to see who may have immunity, or certainty that capacity for treatment is not under the colossal strain that has existed to date. And it will not be ato the status quo ante it is much more likely to be limited opening of businesses or services with distancing enforced.To obtain accurate information on the disease and its toll, to assist the front-line staff and volunteers who have received less support than their tireless work deserves, and for reasons of basic humanity, we also need to focus much more on care homes and areas of the system other than intensive care. Badges showing support for carers are not a bad idea, but they are a token, not a comprehensive solution.Similarly, it is not to belittle the efforts of fundraisers such as Captain Tom Moore, to say that their hugely impressive contributions need to be lined up against the cost of this crisis. There will need to be a detailed description of how the economy can restructure unprecedented government subsidy is welcome, but must be effectively directed ndash particularly for the poorest, and for small to medium businesses, on whom recovery will depend. We should not underestimate the damage caused, nor forget that ultimately it will need to be paid for.All of this will depend upon clinical advice, and balancing the wider benefits and hazards of a continued isolation policy. We accept that the data may alter approaches or priorities, but it is reasonable to expect a general outline of the circumstances that may indicate whether ato ndashnot normality ndash a less strict regime is possible.News from trusted and credible sources is essential at all times, but especially now as the coronavirus pandemic impacts on all aspects of our lives.

No government has given reason to hope that the present lockdown will be eased, for any group, any time soon.We need young people to keep the economy going and I for one would be ready to continue to stay in lockdownI knew that parents could resume a more normal le and little children could access the locked play parks again.Can we not agree that those in good health, those who are tasked to build all our futures be allowed to have their lives less restricted  By all means ask them to be careful, maintain social distancing wherever possible and restrict access to older people. Or must everyone follow the diktats of those who probably have never lived in a high-rise tenement with children indoors for as much as  out of  hours a day  We are not all suffering equally, as usual it is the poorest, most vulnerable in society who suffer most in a crisis.Kay Gall, Edinburgh EH.SOMETIMES, when as a child I asked where was my father, I would be told that \"he is sitting with someone\", from which I knew he was with a person who was doing that strange-to-me thing, dying. As an elder in our Welsh chapel he had a certain way with him to comfort people. People, of all religious beliefs round our home area would say \"send for Elwyn\" and he would keep the \"night watch\". Then be at work the next day.When it was his time to die, he was at my home so my late husband, my mother and I were there for the weeks of his last illness. Even when he was dying my mother always shared their bed and he was never alone. The doctor and district-nurse were constant presences. His last day, as I was at work, I was phoned and broke the sound barrier to get home to be with him. I lay on his bed, held his hand and whispered. He always knew that I loved him, as he loved me. My splendid old dad.The last few paragraphs of the article by Professor Andrew Elderreally struck a chord. I can live with myself because I was at my fathers dying and he knew that we all loved him he was not alone. My daughters suicide,  years ago, meant she was totally alone, I could not be with her so the pain and grief are never-ending. Prof Elder is quite right when he says: \"We can find ways to allow families to be together at this time\". Surely that is possible Thelma Edwards, Kelso.I WHOLEHEARTEDLY agree with Alan Simpson about the increasing number of people, with no medical qualications, claiming to have the right answer to the Covid- pandemic . I might add the increasingly annoying TV channel interviewers, who seem totally unable to listen to clear answers, given to their increasingly repetitive questions.As a retired GP, I am sure they will all soon perfect the use of an instrument which I found regularly to be  per cent successful: the retrospectoscope.Stuart Holms, Ayr.News from trusted and credible sources is essential at all times, but especially now as the coronavirus pandemic impacts on all aspects of our lives.

College biology lecturer Lisa di Meo manages the Zombie Science project at the University, and also plays a theoretical zombiologist.ldquoOur strength is in our mixture of skills, making for high-quality, professional productions that are funny but also provoke the audience to think and ask questions, added Professor OrsquoDell, who delivers lectures on genetics during the show and also plays a victim who is bitten but survives, as he is immune to the zombie virus.The lectures from the lsquoworldrsquos leading zombieism research facilityrsquo are aimed at those aged -. They include Brain of the Dead, Worst Case Scenario, and Genes of the Damned, in which you can discover who is most likely to become a zombie, contemplate the ethics of dealing with the infected, and decide how stem cells might be used to treat survivors.ldquoWe try to make people think about the consequences of an outbreak and about the ethics of decision-making, said Professor OrsquoDell,ldquoThese ethical questions are relevant today ndash do you quarantine a cruise ship with a few cases, exposing everyone on the ship to the disease so you keep whole cities safe from the virus  We also look at the stigma attached to the infected and the so-called super spreaders.ldquoAs the coronavirus spreads, itrsquos one of the few times that I have sympathy with politicians as they can only make the wrong decision ndash therersquos always a downside whatever they do.The lectures include apparently real CCTV recordings of a zombie outbreak at the University. Topics include the human brain and how damage could lead to zombiesrsquo insatiable appetites antibiotic resistance how diseases affect people dferently and how to stay safe during an outbreak, with a demonstration on effective hand washing using a gel that shows up under UV light.ldquoIf a research seminar and a pantomime had a baby it would be this show. Itrsquos story-led teaching through comedy that is fun and rowdy with lots of laughter, but there are some real take-home messages, said OrsquoDell.ldquoPeople are hooked on zombies because we are all interested in death and therersquos something appealing about the idea you can come back to le.ldquoThe zombie apocalypse is a useful hook as it encourages people to think more objectively about the consequences of contagion and ethical dilemmas. For example, we take a vote on whether you would kill a zombie or try to treat them and find a cure.ldquoWe are seeking further funding to go into schools and meanwhile our team of theoretical zombiologists is available to deliver science communication shows about biomedical science and the dangers of a zombie apocalypse at any event to anyone that will listen."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-vaccine-trials-finished-mid-august-says-expert","story":"Professor Sir John Bell, an advisor to the government on le sciences, said human testing began at Oxford University last Thursday.Asked about the possibility of a vaccine being produced by the autumn, Sir John told BBC Radio rsquos Today programme: ldquoThe real question is will it have efficacy :Fidelma Cook: There will come reckoning for British politicians over coronavirusldquoWill it protect people, and that has not been tested and it will only be tested once you have vaccinated a signicant number of people and exposed them to the virus and counted how many people have got the virus in that population.ldquoSo, we wonrsquot even get a signal for that until May.ldquoButthings go on course and it does have efficacy, then I think it is reasonable to think that they would be able to complete their trial by mid-August.Sir John said a candidate vaccine was being tested at Oxford.ldquoThey have got a candidate vaccine, which I think went into man for the first time this week after a wide range of safety studies.ldquoIt went into man, I think, on Thursday.ldquoIt was the first test of testing it in a human being.He added: ldquoIfwe can see evidence of a strong immune response by the middle or the end of May, then I think the game is on.ldquoThen, of course, there is the massive issue of how you manufacture at scale many billions of doses.The comments came amid fears that some hospitals could run out of certain types of personal protective equipmentthis weekend.Chris Hopson, chairman of NHS Providers, said some trusts will run out of supplies on Saturday or Sunday because we have ldquoreached the point where national stock of fully fluid repellent gowns and coverallsexhausted.:Opinion: Tom Gordon: What is left of the prospectus for independence after Covid The comments came as a British Medical Associationsurvey of more than , doctors across the country said a signicant amount of them remain without the protection they need to guard against Covid-.It echoed another survey of , medical staff by the Royal College of Nursingwhich found half of nurses have felt pressure to work without appropriate protective equipment during the crisis.It comes after it was revealed that doctors and nurses in England will be asked to work without full- gowns and to reuse items when treating coronavirus patients ahead of expected shortages of protective garments, prompting outrage from unions.BMA council chairman Dr Chaand Nagpaul said: ldquoThe Government says that one billion items will soon have been shipped, and while there have been signs of improvement, our research clearly shows that equipment is not reaching all doctors working on the frontline.ldquoToo many doctors and healthcare staff have already lost their lives.

Points will be awarded for such things as being able to speak English, having a job already lined up and meeting appropriate skill levels. They will also have to meet a minimum salary threshold, which the guidance informs is generally £,, although a lower salary might be accepted in some circumstances.Under this new system, low-skilled workers will not be able to receive visas to live and work in the UK.The new system however, will not apply to EU citizens already living in the UK by December , this year. They will be eligible to apply to the EU Settlement Scheme.Highlighting the impact immigrants have had in the fight against coronavirus, Mr Carmichael called on the government to rethink its plans and support key workers.“When the immigration proposals were first announced earlier in the year I called them short-sighted and a risk to the long-term future of island communities,” he said.“We are already seeing the potential harm we risk to our communities and our country. It is time that the government started rethinking its plans.“Around the UK we are seeing the positive impact that immigrants are having as key workers in the fight against coronavirus. That the government has not reflected on this at all in developing its advice on immigration policy is disappointing. If immigrants can be essential workers in our country’s time of crisis, then they deserve our support to remain here afterwards.”Mr Carmichael added: “Last week I joined my colleague Christine Jardine in calling for foreign nationals working in the NHS in this crisis to have the right to remain.

Charity workers based at CLAN House in Aberdeen came up with the idea of running a weekly quiz online, asking for a small £ donation per player.Regular hosts include Steph McCann, fundraising team manager for CLAN and her husband Lee, who regularly hosted quizzes when he was a student at university. The quiz, devised by Steph and the fundraising team at CLAN, includes questions on local knowledge as well as current events, entertainment and travel.Steph said: “We have had a fantastic response from people, not only from the north-east but across the UK to the CLAN Sunday Sofa Quiz.#We were looking for a way to continue to engage with our supporters, keep people entertained at home, and to help raise vital funds for people affected by cancer.#Over  teams took part this weekend, with the number taking part growing every week.

With the extension of the coronavirus lockdown measures yesterday, it is the right decision to extend the furlough scheme for a month to the end of June to provide clarity.#It is vital for people’s livelihoods that the UK economy gets up and running again when it is safe to do so, and I will continue to review the scheme so it is supporting our recovery.#The government has said future decisions on the scheme will take into account further developments on the wider measures to reduce the spread of coronavirus, as well as the responsible management of the public finances.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

That is the eventual way out of this.#Professor Pennington, who has chaired E.coli outbreak inquiries and in , was awarded a CBE for services to microbiology, believed the system could then be recreated on a large scale in other health board areas of Scotland.#The islands have good medical facilities, but you would need to have good and effective testing facilities in place with a quick result. It would not cost a lot of money.“It would be an example for the rest of the country as long as there was an early warning system in place. It could then be possible for the Highlands and Grampian to follow.#Hotspots will not last because people will either recover or sadly die. So we have to think of how we are going to get out of this.#Overall cases need to come down substantially — by about ten times — for the lockdown to be lted throughout the country. That is why we need test beds where levels are already low.#The virus has been spreading under the radar into places like care homes, presumably by workers who were unaware they were infected. The testing needs ramping up. The best you can say overall is that it is not now out of control, but we do not yet have control over it.#Professor Pennington, who has also been appointed by the Scottish Police Federation as a coronavirus advisor, warned that a vaccine will reduce the number of COVID- deaths, but will not offer complete protection or eradicate the virus.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However, the RSPB says these birds are in serious trouble, with numbers plummeting in former strongholds across the UK and Europe. It is reported that the species is now vulnerable to extinction.Puffarazzi aims to find out what is causing population changes across the UK, particularly focusing on dferences in food availability related to climate change. People can join the Puffarazzi by submitting photos from visits to puffin colonies in previous years where they have snapped pictures of these colourful seabirds with food in their bills. The photos help scientists learn more about what puffins are feeding their chicks, or ‘pufflings’, and how this might have changed over time.The project first ran in  asking for photos from that summer, before ing last year with the added request for images from any year which will help build a picture of how food sources might have changed over time.The RSPB says the public response in the previous two years has been incredible:This year the project is adapting to take coronavirus guidance into account, asking people to focus on digging through their photo albums and files at home in case there are any photos tucked away from previous visits to puffin colonies that could be of use.The photos will help scientists identy areas where puffins are struggling to find enough nutritious fish needed to support their pufflings, with the historical photos providing an invaluable comparison of how food availability has changed over time.Connie Tremlett, RSPB conservation scientist and manager of the project this year, said: “We’ve been bowled over by how many people have already taken part in Puffarazzi # the response so far really shows how beloved these ‘clowns of the sea’ are, and how each and every one of us can play a part in saving them. As puffinsto our shores, we’re once again asking people to share their photos from previous years with us. However old your photo is, as long as it has a picture of a puffin with food in its beak, and you know when and where it was taken, it will help.“Those who join the Puffarazzi are filling key gaps in our knowledge, helping us to understand what threats are facing these little seabirds. This is the first critical step to determining how to save them and ensure theyto our coasts for years to come.”Find out more about the project at: rspb.org.uk projectpuffincopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.: : : : : : : :No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.: : : : : : : :There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about.

The shot was clearly going just wide of the upright before Fraser MacDonald inadvertently erted it into his own net for a bizarre opener.”Under the canny guidance of manager Angie Murchison, Skye’s useful blend of youth and experience continued to revel on the big stage. Youngsters like Somhairle Macdonald, Ewen MacSween, John MacLean and Allan MacLeod had established themselves along with several survivors of the  team – Cowie, Willie MacRae, Peter Gordon, John ‘Bodach’ Mackenzie, Ally MacDonald and Ewen MacKinnon.With  minutes played the islanders doubled their advantage.McCormack takes up the action: “John MacLean delivered a corner into the danger area, and with keeper Kenny MacDonald under pressure Cowie took two attempts before slipping the ball over the line as he tumbled face-forward onto the pitch”.Skye’s fans were in dreamland but, as the reporter had noted: “Kyles are famous for their battling qualities”.By half time the match was level.From a powerful hit in from the right the ball broke to veteran Dan MacRae “who had time and space to place the shot beyond the reach of keeper MacKenzie.”Then, calamity struck Skye in the closing moments of the half.“Another massive hit in by Tom White caused panic in the Skye defence, and as MacKenzie lashed out in an attempted clearance the ball appeared to come back past him off team captain MacSween”.Seconds later it took an outstanding save from MacKenzie to deny Dallas Turner and prevent Kyles from turning around in the lead.Murchison’s men regrouped.“The second half had been underway less than  seconds before Skye retook the initiative thanks to a corner which was turned in by Cowie, with Peter Gordon hovering to pick up on any mistake.”For much of the second half Kyles were kept well away from the Skye danger area, but a fourth goal proved elusive – thanks in large part to legendary goalkeeper Kenny MacDonald.And with Skye just eight minutes away from sealing a place in the final the men in blue hauled themselves back from the brink.Our reporter said that Dallas Turner “had looked the likeliest threat” and it was the youngster who “saw a glimmer of an opening and fired in a shot which took a deflection and flew past Bodach MacKenzie and into the net”.“That was the signal for the islanders to lay siege to the Kyles goal and for the Tighnabruaich keeper to dig dep with a string of exceptional saves.”MacLean, Somhairle MacDonald , Gordon and Cowie were all denied before the whistle sounded to herald extra time.In “energy-sapping heat” it was hardly surprising that the added half hour was more low-key, but five minutes into the second period came a “glorious chance” for Skye.Referee Donne Fraser spotted an infringement in the area, and the islanders were awarded a penalty.Rankin stepped up, but was unable to make clean contact and the “scuffed spot hit was easily turned away by MacDonald”.And so to a penalty shoot-out. Both goalkeepers excelled themselves, MacDonald saving two, and MacKenzie doing likewise. With Kyles - ahead, Rankin had to score to force sudden death, but his shot sailed wide and it was Kyles who went through to the final.Ian McCormack concluded: “Rankin was hero as well as villain. Once he got the measure of Ronnie MacVicar he dictated play from the centre, giving a hundred per cent in effort and running himself into the ground in the process. Up front Willie Cowie was immense – especially for a player just back from injury.“And while the defence as a whole were tight, Willie MacRae at buckshee back gave another award-winning performance.“If there was a man of the match award it would undoubtedly have gone to Kyles keeper Kenny MacDonald, who had excellent cover from full back Fraser MacDonald.“Their most dangerous forward was Dallas Turner, while that veteran Dan MacRae showed he still has a few seasons left in him at the top level.”In the final Kingussie, in the middle of a run of seven-successive Camanachd Cup triumphs, proved too strong, though Kyles gave a good account of themselves and had taken the lead before succumbing to a - defeat.The redoubtable Kenny MacDonald was the final’s man of the match, but his remarkable career had still some way to run. Both he and namesake Fraser # the full back in the epic tussle of  – would again pick up winners’ medals in , by which time Kenny’s son Roddy had also emerged as a star of the sport.For Skye the wait for another shot at the big one goes on – with the club also missing out in semi finals in  and .Allan MacLeod, the current Skye co-manager, reflected on that game at Ballachulish – recalling that he played much of the first half without a contact lens.“I remember marking Dan MacRae – a fantastic player. But it was great chance for us.“We were the better side for much of it, but not for the first time Kenny MacDonald was the saviour for Kyles.“At the time Kingussie were virtually unstoppable and we’d have met them in their prime. Our chance of winning the cup may have been slim, but it would have been nice to have made the final.“A lot of that Skye team would have deserved a shot on that stage.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Covid-19.jpg","title":"details of covid 19 case on skye leaked to the free","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAs of Friday th April, there were a total of  confirmed cases in the NHS Highland area, but the health board have not released any further details on where the cases originate.Amid fears that some people might still consider rural areas to be isolated and virus free, there have been calls for greater clarity on where cases are.

It was a Saturday afternoon and the game was a supposed friendly against Rothienorman.“Back then I was a hard man, or so I thought! I was up against a burly young farmer-type at centre-half. I had a couple of robust challenges with the lad and he warned me that next time he was having me! Two minutes later he came in from behind and elbowed me in the head, I shrugged it off and instead of walking away I turned around and said: #You ain’t big enough to put me down, kid.# The next thing I knew, the birds were tweeting around my head and my front teeth were missing!“The game was abandoned and I had to go to the emergency dentist that afternoon and had months of repair work afterward. He had to pay my dental bill and a £ fine. Torquil Mackenzie # a name I will take to my grave!” “I can#t remember how far back it was but it was a while ago — it was a cup final up in Uig against Portree. The game went to extra-time # we had Bruce Neil and Paul Flynn sent off but ended up winning something like -.“I remember John ‘Spod# Macleod scoring a goal and running up the touchline with his hands cupped over his ears to the once noisy Portree support who had given him dogs# abuse during the game. That lives long in the memory!” “It won#t come as a surprise to learn the best match was the title-winning game on th August , for many emotional reasons. We had a great campaign that year and had won  out of  games with only three matches remaining. We had to go to Kyleakin away on this date and they were the only team who could catch us in the title challenge.“It was a really nice summer evening and we had a strong team out, although leading striker John Murphy was unavailable through injury which meant young James Pringle played upfront with Craig Brown.“Kyleakin got out of the blocks quickly and we found ourselves - down early on in the match in front of a big crowd. We settled after that and played some decent stuff but Kyleakin, as usual, were well marshalled by Michael Taylor and we had dficulty in creating clear-cut opportunities. However, with  minutes to go, coach Ian MacLeod and I decided to put youngsters Ian Morrison and Angie MacPherson on each touchline to give us pace and width. The freshness seemed to galvanise us and with  minutes to go, we pulled a goal back through Craig Brown. It seemed the whole match swung on that goal, we picked up some real momentum and Brown scored again to equalise. Then with five minutes to go, we were awarded a penalty with two Kyleakin defenders tackling Brown as he broke into the box. Craig dusted himself down and scored the penalty in off the post # we were delirious on the sidelines. We saw out the game for our first-ever title and then won the remaining two games to make it  wins from  matches # it was a campaign never to be forgotten!” “It was my first game in charge, and funnily enough, it was also against Kyleakin. In those campaigns it was always the case that the first game of the season in the Bagshaw League pitted the reigning champions against the team which finished bottom the season before. The bottom club then had to play the runners-up from the previous season and so on, so it was very dficult for the clubs at the bottom to gain any early momentum.“We went down to Kyleakin with a whole bunch of youngsters against the likes of Scott Graham, the Nisbett clan, Darren Wainwright # who were all top players in the league at that time. We lost - and I swearit wasn#t for our young goalie Calum Montgomery making one save it could have been . But in essence, that is where I started from in management.

The places where one would most clearly feel the presence of spiritual community are cut off – never mind that a pandemic might tempt one to question faith in any deity. Here in the Highlands many still can access the temple of nature, but for some even that temple is essentially out of bounds. We are exiled in our own homes.The theme of exile for some wrong-doing – not necessarily a penance but for something perceived as wrong by others – is, of course, international, never more so than right now.In the Gàidhealtachd, however, with a history of mass emigration, exile retained a particular relevance well into modern times. So I have gone to Tobar an Dualchais and to Dugald Buchanan, forthere was anyone who understood the agony of spiritual exile and the loneliness of doubt and fear and who grappled with them with profound courage, it was him.Buchanan lived from -, part of the time among the broken men of Rannoch, amongst whom he taught and preached. He was sent by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge in . He was to be a teacher and a catechist: the catechism was a sort of question and answer method of teaching religion, and its spiritual values.The place Buchanan was sent to was Kinloch Rannoch, and it was in dire need of religion and spiritual values. It was on the edge of Rannoch Moor and was so remote that all the rejects of society – outlaws, dispossessed and banished, had gathered there, as far from the law as possible.The broken men of Rannoch were a people destitute and desperate. In ministering to these last vestiges of society, Buchanan was working at its roots, not certainthey were strong or rotten, not certainhis own motives were good or bad.In Buchanan’s imagery, we engage powerfully with a Dante-esque poetic imagery:Each limb, each member – foot and hand, that ever buried were in land or sea or battle-field, shall come together. Loud is the noise among the bones, each coming to its place..In the five verses Robertson has chosen out of one hundred and twenty-one, the last trumpet is heard and the mountains pour out lava.“Quench your thirst with it, you horders of gold”. The sun is in mourning, the moon steeped in blood, the stars are shaken.The poem is terrying, and the hope of salvation depends not upon anything one does oneself, other than placing one’s trust entirely in God’s mercy. This is not something you earn: it is something you have to be given. And yet this solemn song, with its simple pentatonic melody, verse after verse, has a beautul and hypnotic power.I am no believer, but this is powerful stuff and not to be lightly dismissed.Confronting the great dilemmas of self-consciousness in his confessional diary and his poetry, Buchanan emerges triumphant and yet sober, thoughtful and grateful. # The Skull # came to Buchanan when, following a young woman’s burial, he picked up a skull left exposed in Lassintulloch graveyard near Loch Rannoch.Today, the graveyard is as neglected as were the people living there in Buchanan’s day. Picture him then among the tombstones, looking out northward and the thoughts racing through his mind like the wind through the branches of the surrounding trees as he addresses the skull in his hands.He asks the skullit belonged to a preacher and did the preacher care for his flock or leave them to the care of the fox  Buchanan ends assured that there is hope even in the grave, that the eyes that were once in the skull may shine again as brilliantly as the stars, and that the soul may fly to Christ with the speed of the eagle # to be greeted with love.., back in . I hope that recording will make its way into Tobar an Dualchais one day.I met Willie Matheson just the once long ago – Allan insisted I come with him to the hospital where Willie was in a wheelchair, frail but with bright eyes and a welcome smile. I was just at the very beginning of coming to an understanding of Gaelic culture, but there, with my hazy stumbling knowledge, I felt included.Such brief encounters can mean so much. – The Sufferings of Christ.

The couple share their Kensington Road home of  years with around  teddy bears of all shapes and sizes, collected over the past few decades.Having been encouraged by their four grandchildren, the couple came up with quirky presentations of the bears on their lawn, which is putting smiles on many faces, both young and old.In a bid to banish the boredom during their own self-isolation, Morrisand Jennyare keeping busy by meticulously arranging their daily displays, swapping bears in and out, giving their teddies dferent props, or moving them around the corner of the front garden.Behind it all is Jenny#s lelong love of teddy bears - she still has her very first bear Ted, given to her when she was just  months old. Morris did all the buying of the bears when he used to travel a lot for business, Jenny said.For  years he would always bring back a Harrods bear from London and they all sit on the stairs of our house. It became a tradition that when he would go away, he brought back a bear. Our kids and my brothers and sisters all bought bears for me down the years for Christmas and birthdays so we have accumulated a lot over the years.Alongside Brown Thomas bears sit several Paddingtons and others purchased at Aston Villa, Derby County, Wimbledon and ious Northern Ireland away games. Morris, however, called a halt to the bear buying  years ago once the teddy takeover became a bit too much. Now they take pride of place in the front garden each day, much to the delight of passers-by.What started off on day one as a small Teddy#s Bear Picnic has grown to much larger displays including a sports day, cricket match, Lego building, classroom scene, cycling trip, gardening and even a religious service on Easter Sunday. We began on day one with just four bears sitting out in the garden with tables and chairs and that was going to be it. But we got so many comments about it that we thought we#d better do something the next day, so it has grown from that, Morris said. The bears have a wee chat at night about what they want to do the next day and then let us know their plan in the morning so we try to accommodate them.We have had a constant stream of people coming past for a look every day. Until a few days ago we only knew a couple of our neighbours on both sides of the street, but now we#re meeting people we#ve never seen before. It has become a great talking point and people seem to look forward to it every day. The bears usually stay out until around  o#clock at night and then they all have to be put to bed. Thankfully the weather has been tremendous every day so far but we do have umbrellas, tents and gazebos in case of a rainy day.

He probably had a measure of anxiety when he started to feel so unwell.Mr Montgomery phoned Liz and his two other sisters Anne and Helen before he was placed on the ventilator on the Saturday afternoon, telling them that it would probably be for a day or two.But our gut feeling was that it wouldn#t be a day or two. That was the last conversation we had with him, said Liz.That has been one of the hardest things, not being able to be with him. We really appreciated being able to ask the nurse caring for him to let him know he was so much in our thoughts and prayers.His minister, Rev Eleanor Hayden, phoned the ward and asked one of the nurses to kindly read Psalm  and say the Lord#s Prayer to him.We are blown away by the kindness of staff and the willingness of them to do this for us, Liz added.It was a tempestuous fortnight for Mr Montgomery#s family who faced the uncertainty of not knowinghe would pull through or not in between the odd glimmer of hope.Liz added: David was a Christian and his faith in Jesus was very important to him.David enjoyed attending his local church and going along to other Christian fellowship gatherings. He had a large circle of friends and could definitely be described as a people person. His quick wit and humour were enjoyed by his nieces and nephews who thought the world of him.Liz explained how a doctor had phoned her sister before he died and assured her staff would be with him.The doctors and nurses handled the situation so professionally and were exceptional in their care and treatment of David, she said. We are thankful to all the nursing and medical staff in the critical care unit and know they did all they could for David and they too were upset his condition did not improve.We really appreciated how David#s neighbours, friends and farming colleagues stood on the roadside to pay their respects at this dficult time. It was very touching and lovely to witness this care for our family.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ee .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ccd-f--afc-fedfe_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ee .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ccd-f--afc-fedfe_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ee .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ccd-f--afc-fedfe_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ee .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ccd-f--afc-fedfe_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ee .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ccd-f--afc-fedfe_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"CoronavirusShortage of surgical gowns in England will lead to delays for Northern Ireland health staffThe delivery of , surgical gowns to Northern Ireland is facing delay as England has been hit by severe shortages of PPE.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_aef-ac-a-aa-eacbf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_aef-ac-a-aa-eacbf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_aef-ac-a-aa-eacbf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_aef-ac-a-aa-eacbf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_aef-ac-a-aa-eacbf_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"CoronavirusCoronavirus: Number of care home deaths in Northern Ireland is still unclear despite pledgeHealth officials have refused to say how many Northern Ireland care home residents have died from Covid-.Most ReadNear-tragedy brings clarity on Covid- lockdown to BBC Radio Ulster broadcaster Motorcyclist who died in Ballynahinch crash named as Matthew Stuart Loyalist serial killer Gary Haggarty#s sentence #unduly lenient#, Court of Appeal rulesCo Down crash victim Matthew Stuart a cancer survivor who was due to wed in Teen jailed for punching Belfast nurse in stomach in Mater Hospital,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Whereas more than , tests for Covid- have now been completed in the Republic of Ireland – one of the highest testing rates in Europe - resulting in over , confirmed cases. googletag.cmd.push In the south you can phone your GP to be assessed for a testyou are in a priority group and have symptoms. Andyou are in a priority group and have been in contact with someone you think or know has coronavirus and you have any of those common symptoms. Dr Paul Molloy said limited testing means it is dficult to tell how many people have COVID- and therefore how many have actually died of COVID-. He added that % of cases are mild and don’t make it as far as GPs or the hospital and % probably do with % severely affected. googletag.cmd.push Out of the % that make it to the COVID Centre probably  % of them are at present sent home again without being tested as only those admitted are tested, he said. That means that doctors are potentially only testing a very small proportion of those actually affected. He did caveat the statement by saying he is a GP and not a statistician or an epidemiologist. “The dficulty is that many people in the community have other illnesses like COPD, heart disease etc,” he explained. “It is very possible thatthese people acquired COVID- it would be too much for them to cope with and they’d die at home. This would be similar to people dying of influenza. “It’ll not be recorded on their death certicate but it may have been the final illness that just was too much to cope with and been the precipitating factor for death. If these people die at home from COVID- it will be unknown as at present we are only testing those who are admitted to hospital. “All the people who are in the community with a flu do not knowit is coronavirus or another virus. “We have no idea therefore of the real numbers of patients affected or even the real number of deaths.” UNDER-REPORTING While this isn’t important in managing the illness, he says, it does become important when a discussion takes place about moving out of the current lockdown. “We know that about % of the population have to be infected before we develop herd immunity. “This was the original path the government set out on. “It’s also important that when restrictions are lted we can employ similar means to the countries who have been most successful in controlling this. “That is quickly identying pockets of virus in the community, isolating those pockets, tracing and testing any contacts and avoiding indiscriminate spread. “There are many, many people, % of those with COVID  out there who will only get mild symptoms. We are not testing them so we are only finding out whether people have COVID  or not, in a small group of people.” He added: “There is potentially as much as % under identication of actual cases then approximately and under-reported death rates for the same reason.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Wayne Rodgers, a member of Magherafelt-based wedding band The Allstars, has been entertaining residents since lockdown brough an abrupt end to his normal work. “Everything has just fallen off a clf, it’s all stopped overnight,” he told the County Derry Post. “Mark Stewart, who runs a bar in Magherafelt, said some of the homes were askinghe could suggest anything entertainment-wise. “The Manor Nursing home [in Magherafelt] was the first one I did. They had me back so I couldn’t have been too bad!” googletag.cmd.push A driving instructor by day, Wayne says he wanted to bring the residents of the care homes a bit of joy at a time when they are not allowed to have visitors. He said: “I’m not an essential worker but I’m not doing anyone any harm. I’m there on my own and it’s entertainment for them and gives them something to look forward to.” “They throw a sterilised plug out the window to me and I plug that into my own equipment. There’s no contact made. “It breaks up my day. It’s as good for me as it is for them. You can hear them clapping and singing behind the windows. googletag.cmd.push  “It’s sad - some of the relatives would come and sit in cars. They can’t go in to see their parents. They can only wave through the window and it’s very tough on everybody, strained times. “Some of the homes are doing wee videos from inside and posting them online so the families can see them all enjoying themselves, singing and clapping along.” Wayne is now a man in demand as word spreads of his singing exploits, and has performances lined up both in his adopted County Derry and native town of Ballynahinch. He said: “We did one and then another got in touch. My brother in law arranged four in Ballynahinch on Monday, so I’ve done about ten now at this stage. “I don’t like forcing people or anything, but this week I’ve been asked back to a few I’ve done before because the residents are enjoying it so much. “I have another three lined up this week with a possibility of a few more coming on board.” The old classics are proving popular as Wayne does the rounds, with one song in particular being requested on every occasion. “They all seem to love Danny Boy,” he said. “It seems to bring back memories. A lot of the patients in the homes have dementia and it seems to be a song that takes them home. They like the classics, the ballads – all songs from their era.” Although the reaction has been overwhelmingly positive, there was one voice of dissent who would have preferred not to have Wayne singing outside his window. “I got one negative comment. I was in Ballynahinch the other day and a man said ‘what’s your name son ’ So I answered and he said ‘well will you feck off, I can’t hear the TV!’ “He didn’t enjoy it as much as the others, but it gave everybody a laugh.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There are , miles between Garvagh and the city of Chandigarh in the Indore district of Madhya Pradesh in India, but for Jimmy McGilligan, distance was trivial. Jimmy’s acceptance of the Baha’i faith in  marked the beginning of an extraordinary journey that would culminate in a visit to Windsor Castle to receive an OBE in . A former boy scout, who helped his father on the farm, Jimmy received pound compensation after losing a toe in an agricultural accident aged just . He used the money wisely, buying a digger and beginning to build up his business from scratch, while also maintaining an amateur radio station from his home between  and . googletag.cmd.push Gradually, he become frustrated with the wastage he encountered through his profession, often expressing disappointment at seeing milk dumped into the sea and the beef farming surplus.  “He was very passionate about the environment,” says we Janak, who still lives in the couple’s home, a self-sustaining farm in a mountainous region of central India. “He used to lead walks as part of the Ulster Rambling Club and he also was very proud to have a radio license and built his own radio station. “He was in the Orange Order - they used to call him the first Orange man who accepted Baha’i faith!” googletag.cmd.push After volunteering in a Baha’i centre in Haa, it was felt that Jimmy’s skills could be put to work where and he was invited to volunteer in Madhya Pradesh, India. It was there that a chance encounter brought him into contact with his future we. “Jimmy was asked to reclaim  acres of land for a residential school for rural boys near Gwalior. It had marshy lands and it needed his skills,” says Janak. “I was on my way from Delhi to Indore and I had no vehicle of my own. I had been working for three years, starting an institute for rural girls from a piece of barren land. “The Australian High Commission donated a jeep and I had a driver who wanted to see this school that was on our way to Indore. “We stopped there for a while and I told the principal of the school that I only had a short while, but he said he had a volunteer that wanted to see my institute. “I looked at my watch and told him I only had  minutes, butyour volunteer wants to come, we can take him with us. “That volunteer was Jimmy. Twenty-five minutes later, he was in our jeep and we brought him home.” SPACE AT A PREMIUM  If Jimmy was expecting the comforts of his County Derry home, he was in for a rude awakening as, with the institute in its infancy, accommodation was at a premium. “I had no space at that time,” says Janak. “I couldn’t give him an apartment or a room, but there was a small room where we used to keep the girls’ mattresses during the day. “When the  or so mattresses were taken out, Jimmy could sleep – and it was not a soft bed! “I didn’t know anything about the people in Northern Ireland. There was no toilet, he had to walk to the outhouse. There was no flushing system and you had to pour a can of water in.” Jimmy’s work ethic was insatiable. He set about preparing six acres of land, armed with little more than a Swiss Army kne from his keen interest in mountaineering. The Garvagh man was more used to working with heavy machinery, but after navigating the more primitive pick and spade and settling into his work, he had a suggestion for Janak. “We had three visitors arrive to see the institute one day,” she smiles. “Jimmy was talking to them and said it was such important work that he could spend all his le there. This was his proposal. “I said he was welcome, but his visa was ending soon. An elderly Baha’i man, who was sitting close by and who was very fatherly to us, then spoke. “He looked at me and he told Jimmy: This is your visa. The three girls started talking to me and they were encouraging me to talk to him about this.” The couple agreedJimmy was granted a visa to remain in India, they would discuss getting married and they travelled together to Delhi to meet the authorities. LUCK  With the country’s laws permitting only foreign women to remain in India after marrying Indian men, and not the other way around, Jimmy and Janak needed a stroke of luck. “When they found out I was the only person in central India working in a programme with funding from the Ministry of Science and Technology, he said they couldn’t afford to let me go. “They made an exception – he said to go and get married and they would sort out the visa.” Now engaged, the couple headed straight for Janak’s family home in Chandigarh. With no phones or internet, the news had to be delivered in person. “We had no other way of communicating,” laughs Janak. “We just arrived home on an ordinary bus at midnight. My mother opened the door to us and was shocked, but very happy with the news. “She was always complaining I was not going to get married. My four brothers and sisters were married with children and I always said I would never get married - Jimmy used to say that too. “It was the middle of the night, so she ran to where my father was sleeping, pulled back the blanket and said: ‘Get up, your daughter is here with this boy and she wants to get married!’. “My father just asked Jimmy one question. He askedJimmy was a Baha’i and when Jimmy said he was, my father said: ‘God bless you, only a Baha’i could keep my daughter happy.” The pair exchanged rings the next evening and on November , , less than a month after first meeting, Jimmy and Janak were married.  After a brief honeymoon in the mountains, they ed to work at the institute, and a few months later, with Jimmy now installed as manager, the couple visited his home country. “Everyone was constantly talking about the weather,” recalls Janak. “They kept telling me I had brought Indian weather, no one was asking about my mother or father. In India, we ask about everything. “I got into that rhythm eventually. The next morning my father in law asked me how I was doing, so I said it was a lovely day.” Janak fell in love with Northern Ireland, but as Baha’i pioneers, both her and Jimmy ed to their responsibilities at the Barli Institute, where the Garvagh man was adored by the students. “Jimmy picked up all the Hindi in female speech because he learned it from the girls,” says Janak. “These girls came from an area where they were treated as ‘untouchables’, almost equal to slaves in the past. “Jimmy would work with them - not like a boss, but as a father or elderly brother. He was very kind to the girls.” Janak suffered a health scare in  when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and Jimmy, who had seen his mother die from the same disease, was deeply worried. After surgery, Janak thankfully made a full recovery and the couple added celebration to relief when Jimmy received acclaim for his years of sterling work in India.  “In , the lady from British Deputy High Commission appointed him as a warden of British citizens in Indore and she nominated his name for OBE,” beams Janak. “He was conferred OBE in  after I had recovered from cancer. We both travelled and I had the privilege of going with him to Windsor Castle to receive the award. “It brought a lot of joy to all of our families and friends and was a huge recognition for him. After my recovery and this award, we made the decision to hand the institute over to our successors.” Janak and Jimmy set about making plans to retire and began training up another couple to take on the institute, but they were far from idle. The couple built a beautul house on a piece of farmland in Sanawadiya. The people of the village were living in darkness, so Jimmy built a solar and wind power station on site for them. Retirement was planned for April , , but tragedy struck just days before they were due to hand the institute over. Janak and Jimmy were travelling in a taxi when it was involved in a car accident on April  and Jimmy succumbed to fatal internal injuries on April . While admitting to feeling ‘completely lost’ without Jimmy, Janak is determined to honour his memory at their home. “I still run the solar and wind power station and call it the Jimmy McGilligan Centre for Sustainable Development. We train people here free of charge in sustainable technology. “It was a small, rocky place but now there are maybe  trees and we grow everything that we eat here. “There is a Baha’i saying that suits Jimmy and I well – humanity is a bird with two wings. The bird can only fly when both wings support each other. Jimmy and I were a really good bird.” Jimmy McGilligan would have celebrated his thbirthday last week, a man from humble beginnings whose dedication and integrity ensured he soared to a great height.

He askedJimmy was a Baha’i and when Jimmy said he was, my father said: ‘God bless you, only a Baha’i could keep my daughter happy.” The pair exchanged rings the next evening and on November , , less than a month after first meeting, Jimmy and Janak were married.  After a brief honeymoon in the mountains, they ed to work at the institute, and a few months later, with Jimmy now installed as manager, the couple visited his home country. “Everyone was constantly talking about the weather,” recalls Janak. “They kept telling me I had brought Indian weather, no one was asking about my mother or father. In India, we ask about everything. “I got into that rhythm eventually. The next morning my father in law asked me how I was doing, so I said it was a lovely day.” Janak fell in love with Northern Ireland, but as Baha’i pioneers, both her and Jimmy ed to their responsibilities at the Barli Institute, where the Garvagh man was adored by the students. “Jimmy picked up all the Hindi in female speech because he learned it from the girls,” says Janak. “These girls came from an area where they were treated as ‘untouchables’, almost equal to slaves in the past. “Jimmy would work with them - not like a boss, but as a father or elderly brother. He was very kind to the girls.” Janak suffered a health scare in  when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and Jimmy, who had seen his mother die from the same disease, was deeply worried. After surgery, Janak thankfully made a full recovery and the couple added celebration to relief when Jimmy received acclaim for his years of sterling work in India.  “In , the lady from British Deputy High Commission appointed him as a warden of British citizens in Indore and she nominated his name for OBE,” beams Janak. “He was conferred OBE in  after I had recovered from cancer. We both travelled and I had the privilege of going with him to Windsor Castle to receive the award. “It brought a lot of joy to all of our families and friends and was a huge recognition for him. After my recovery and this award, we made the decision to hand the institute over to our successors.” Janak and Jimmy set about making plans to retire and began training up another couple to take on the institute, but they were far from idle. The couple built a beautul house on a piece of farmland in Sanawadiya. The people of the village were living in darkness, so Jimmy built a solar and wind power station on site for them. Retirement was planned for April , , but tragedy struck just days before they were due to hand the institute over. Janak and Jimmy were travelling in a taxi when it was involved in a car accident on April  and Jimmy succumbed to fatal internal injuries on April . While admitting to feeling ‘completely lost’ without Jimmy, Janak is determined to honour his memory at their home. “I still run the solar and wind power station and call it the Jimmy McGilligan Centre for Sustainable Development. We train people here free of charge in sustainable technology. “It was a small, rocky place but now there are maybe  trees and we grow everything that we eat here. “There is a Baha’i saying that suits Jimmy and I well – humanity is a bird with two wings. The bird can only fly when both wings support each other. Jimmy and I were a really good bird.” Jimmy McGilligan would have celebrated his thbirthday last week, a man from humble beginnings whose dedication and integrity ensured he soared to a great height.

Seonaidh Mullan, who played camogie and ladies’ football for Ballerin, ran a STEM cell registration event following her diagnosis to encourage people to register as donors. The event, hosted at the GAA club in Ballerin, resulted in over  donors registering as potential lesavers. Camogie club Chairperson Melinda Robinson said many in the community were grieving the loss of a friend. “Seonaidh was an extremely private person, very modest. There was no fuss with her. She was the first at training and the last to go home. googletag.cmd.push “When we had younger players coming on the team who maybe faced dferent things in le, she was the one those girls felt confident in sharing a story with. “If they were having a bad evening, she was the girl they went to. The girls thought very highly of her. Seonaidh was steeped in the le of her GAA club. She was always on the starting , and her experience on the hockey pitch brought a fierceness to her tackling on the camogie pitch. Even on the warmest days, she would train in the black Ballerin waterproof jacket and bandana, socks to her knees, urging her teammates to ‘come on and be serious’. googletag.cmd.push Her words on the pitch were always of positive encouragement, but she wasn’t afraid to voice her opinion to the refereeshe disagreed with the decision. With coronavirus regulations limiting funerals to immediate family only, the club have taken the innovative step of creating a virtual guard of honour. Club members sent pictures of themselves in Seonaidh’s beloved red and white Ballerin colours in order to pay their respects. Seonaidh is survived by her husband Stephen, her son Oisiacuten and daughter Una and the wider Black and Mullan families. “People see Seonaidh’s picture on social media or the paper and see the mother, the camoacuteg, the woman who left behind a legacy for STEM cell recruitment. She was all of those things,” said Melinda. “But strip all that away and Seonaidh was our friend, a friend we’ve lost, a voice we won’t hear again, a smiling face we won’t see.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Tomorrow marks the first anniversary of the death of the -year-old journalist in Creggan last April. Detectives from the PSNI’s Major Investigation Team investigating the murder of Lyra have issued an appeal ahead of the anniversary. The Senior Investigating Officer has sent letters to people living in Creggan directly appealing to them to think back to the tragic events of a year ago and bring any new information forward to police. Detective Superintendent Jason Murphy, who is leading the investigation, said: “On Saturday,  months will have passed since journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead during rioting at Fanad Drive in Creggan. googletag.cmd.push Sadly Lyra’s mum died very recently without seeing justice for her daughter. While this appeal for information is being distributed by the police, it is also a direct appeal from the McKee family for help in getting justice for Lyra. “The community as a whole was devastated by Lyra’s murder. Condemnation of her killing was unequivocal. That condemnation brought support for the community’s response from countries across the world.” In his letter sent to Creggan residents, Detective Superintendent Murphy said: “Since Lyra was killed, many of you may have spoken with my team of detectives. We have strived to conduct the investigation with sensitivity and care. My investigation is being carried out with the community and this has enabled us to gather important evidence which has resulted in one man being charged with Lyra’s murder and a second man being charged with offences connected to the rioting which preceded it. googletag.cmd.push “My sincere thanks go to all those who have helped to date. “However, these charges do not signy the end of the investigation. For the police service, me and my team of detectives it is only the beginning. A huge amount of work has been done and massive amounts of community help has enabled us to piece together the events of  April  and gain a clear understanding of the roles played by those who were involved. “Lyra’s murder was not committed in isolation, nor did it involve only one person. The events that led up to Lyra being shot, and the events afterwards, are equally important. I am asking the community to reach into its conscience and tell us what it knows. Lyra’s family cannot begin the grieving process without the information about Lyra’s murder that they deserve. Anybody in their position would want the same. “One year on, I am still seeking the evidence to bring every single person who was involved that night to justice. I cannot deliver that without you. Specically I want to: Gather mobile phone footage or photographs from anyone who was there that nightSpeak to anyone who was present and who can identy those involved in the disorderSpeak to anyone who can provide first-hand evidence relating to the events which preceded or followed Lyra’s murderRecover the gun that killed Lyra“We have made the public portal available again, so that you can contact us discreetly. Log ontohttps:mipp.police.ukfrom your mobile, tablet, laptop or other device. We do not need to keep your mobile phone or device – we are only interested in downloading the videos or images of that night. Please tell us what you know.

On Lyra’s first anniversary I want to re-state the commitment of the police service to work with you as we collectively seek to release communities from the influence of terrorists. “For the purposes of this investigation, I will offer anonymity to those who wish to talk to us. All I am looking for is a conversation. That’s it. I know that iniduals may be struggling with their conscience, either about footage they have or information they know. We can help with that.

Emergency food parcels and hot meals are also being distributed by local groups. googletag.cmd.push Donna Matthewson, Apex Director of Housing, said they were delighted with how the initiative was operating. “Over the last number of years we have developed an excellent relationship with Fareshare, delivering fresh food to eleven local charities on an on-going basis,” she said. “Recently we have seen the impact Covid- has had on families in this city and this new service with Fareshare has been established as a result. “We are delighted to be able to assist in redirecting these vital food supplies to those who need them most. “Feedback from community groups has been fantastic and we hope to continue this service for the duration of the pandemic.” googletag.cmd.push Ciara Ferguson from Greater Shantallow Area Partnership praised the food delivery scheme. “This service has allowed us to provide much needed food parcels for those who have negatively impacted by the Covid- crisis. “The food is of great quality and iety and the extra help means the world to our local families whose incomes have been reduced as a result of the pandemic.” If you or someone you know is struggling to afford or access food during the Covid- pandemic, contact your local DEA partnership office:Outer North-   Outer West-   Triax-   Waterside-     If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The next job was to find a team name.Thoughts turned to Brazil and Rivelino.His club was Corinthians of Sao Paulo. The name stuck and soon there would be Corinthians of the Downpatrick Youth League.ldquoWe had a couple of good seasons, nothing special, but around  Austin got a squad of very good footballers together, David recalls.Each Saturday morning Austin took his big Ford Corsair out to Saul and Raholp to collect some boys, including Pat lsquoSkipperrsquo McMullan, Sean McMullan, Lorny Murphy and Noel Denvir.These joined a group of players from Crossgar, such as Mel and Con McCarthy, Leo Casement, Dan McHugh, Gregory Bell, lsquoChippyrsquo Bell and lsquoBootsiersquo Madine.Though Austin had an excess of players and it was hard to give everyone a game, the Crossgar boys encouraged him to sign a number of Killyleagh lads and so Jute Sullivan, Kevin Nelson and Chris Hagan joined up. They were a very talented forward line and team.Corinthiansrsquo main rivals were Panathinaikos, managed by Pat McKinney.At the end of the season Austin won the leaguersquos Manager of the Year award, for which he was very proud.He went on to be involved with Downpatrick Rec and was club chairman when they won the Steel and Sons Cup.Many of the Corinthians players went on to play for local teams in the Amateur League and Newcastle League, and also played Gaelic football.Corinthians may no longer exist, but they are still fondly remembered by those who can recall the early days of the Downpatrick Youth League and were fired up by the wizards of Brazil..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 Centre.jpg","title":"Centre set up as new community support hub  ","story":"A NEW community co-ordination hub to deliver essential supplies to vulnerable residents across the district has been set up at the Down Leisure Centre.The Market Street facility has been transformed into a new distribution centre to help meet the needs of people who have been confined to home as part of the governmentrsquos lockdown measures.And with restrictions on movement set to remain in place for the next few weeks, the new community hub will have an increasingly important role to play.Local council officials have been working in partnership with their colleagues across local government, health trusts and the Department for Communities to set up the hub.The Down Leisure Centre has been transformed into a processing centre to organise deliveries, with other sites currently being identied should they be required.When fully operational, over  leisure centre staff have been redeployed to work across all sites and alongside others from across the organisation to help operate a lsquovirtualrsquo hub to coordinate the response.Staff are working in split shts, while observing social distancing and other safety protocols.The new service covers the councilrsquos seven even district electoral areas with deliveries focusing on food supplies.In addition, a COVID- community helpline is already operational, with those in vulnerable groups seeking support can make contact between am and pm, seven days a week, with the helpline managed by Advice NI who are processing calls from across Northern Ireland.The freephone number is   , while the email is covid@adviceni.net.

Last year he opened the Acoustic stage at the Glastonbury Festival.He also opened for Snow Patrol in the US, Europe and Asia and stood in as an honorary member of the band when guitarist Johnny McDaid was recovering after surgery.The son of Nuala and John McMullan, who still in Portaferry, Ryan started off performing at a young age, singing in a local band, Purple Road, when he was in his mid-teens.He is now staying at his Belfast home, having made it back from the US last month, just two days before the country closed off its airports.Many of his concerts have had to be postponed, including two nights at the Portico Theatre in Portaferry, now rescheduled to June -, and hisUK and Ireland tour this month.

Amusing himself by throwing me into situations where Irsquom either out of my depth, hoping for reconciliation, or unable to escape the truth that even at theend, Irsquom still holding on to even the worst of my attempts at love.ldquoIn A Heartbeat was written to sum up a stage I think we all kind of go through sooner or later: the understanding that something that once was, is now no more.But even at the end knowing it still has a hold on you, so much so, that no matter how toxic it is, or how little sense it made, yoursquod still run back to it in a desperate attempt to salvage it.The new single is already going down well with fans as the video has been viewed over , times online.Ryan added: ldquoEverything has been going great for me so far, even without my debut album coming out and that. I donrsquot think that all these tracks will be on my new album when I feel that itrsquos ready to be released.

This has enabled us to expand the nursing and midwery workforce by reaching out to those who have retired or lapsed their registration over the past number of years and provided opportunities for early registration for overseas staff.ldquoI am exceptionally grateful for the excellent response demonstrated by those who have volunteered toto practice and support the professional response to this pandemic.ldquoEach and every new registrant on the emergency register is a very welcome addition to the professional team and the support you will provide will have a signicant impact on outcomes for patients and the multidisciplinary workforce.Mrs McArdle said she wanted to specically thank nursing and midwery students for their ldquovaluable contribution to the delivery of safe, person-centred care as members of the nursing and midwery team.ldquoI recognise that this is an uncertain time causing great anxiety for many of you and your families.

I believe it is important to openly acknowledge that many of us, as nurses and midwives, are frightened and uncertain regarding the impending challenges presented by the COVID- pandemic.ldquoIn order to meet these challenges, as professionals we will need to adopt a flexible approach.

O course Laffy was stabled at Major Corbettrsquos establishment prior to running in the Ulster National, being trained in England by Peter Cazalet.With no racing in Ireland or England at the present time, it is a good chance to do some reading and a book just recently published, The Story of Dundalk Stadium, is a must for local racing fans.As most people know Dundalk mdash always thought about as the third local track, despite being in Co Louth mdash holds some great memories for locals, too many to record here.A feature by Frankie Fitzsimons is most interesting and he recalls the day that his father and namesake, brother Brian and himself, all rose in the famous Sweet Afton Hunters Chase back in .Frankie senior finished fth on Royal Knight, now owned by Tom Kerr from Ballygowan, while Brian rode Satin Link, also owned by Kerr, whose colours were red with the initials THK on them. Frankie finished third on Bright Cottage in the colours of Brightrsquos Arnold Ennis, who at that stage was a farmer but later turned his farm into a popular golf club.The book records that Frankie senior won the Sweet Afton in  on Fort Wayne, trained by Major John Corbett at Tyrella. He also rode Copper Cottage, trained beside Downpatrick Racecourse by Ned Altern in . He also won the race in  on Copper Ridge, like Copper Cottage owned by Major T W Hughes, this one also trained by Ned Altern. This race was won in  by Frigid Fox, owned by S J Martin from Ballynahinch and ridden by his son Raymond.In later years this race became known as the Tallanstown Hunters Chase and was won by Bald Joker in the colours of Christine McBratney and ridden by her brother-in-law Colin, now a trainer at Crossgar.Frankie Fitzsimons junior rode a few winners under rules, but the one that he will always recall was when he rode Palo to victory in the opening hurdle race of the day at Dundalk in , the horse being owned by the well known busy draper, Downpatrickrsquos Joe Rea, and trained by Peter McGreevy.Back in  owner trainer Tom McConnell, from Carsonstown, near Saintfield, and Darragh Cross amateur Barney Jones recorded their first ever success when successful with loving star in the bumper race.Barney told me recently that on their way that day they collected a lot of bets to place on the horse and as his mouth got dry when he rode he was sucking a sweet that stuck to the roof of his mouth at the start.In  Farranfad farmer and horse breeder Brian Kennedy pulled off a   shock when he saddled Star of Venosos in his green and white belt colours to win the valuable CarrollHandicap Hurdle under Harry Rodgers, now a trainer.This was Brianrsquos first ever success as a trainer and although he only held a licence for a short time he also saddled his charge to win the Ulster Cesarewitch at   at Downpatrick when,memory serves me correctly, it was ridden by Ards jockey Philip Lowry.Lots of other names like Miss K R Payne, Leslie Crawford, Willie Rooney, Jeremy Maxwell, Sammy Shields, Robin Kidd and Pat McAteer feature in the book that brings back some great memories of a popular course, no longer the same to some of us..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Recognition.jpg","title":"Recognition for poet Stephen  ","story":"A BALLYGOWAN poet is celebrating after his debut anthology was recognised by two major awarding bodies.Stephen Sextonrsquos If All the World and Love Were Young was awarded the highly acclaimed American E M Forester Award which was previously won by Seamus Heaney in .His anthology, published by Penguin Books, was also shortlisted for this yearrsquos Shine Strong Award ndash an award presented annually to the author of the best first collection of poems published by an Irish poet.Stephen says his work centres on coming to terms with the death of his mother, Elizabeth, who passed away in .He said: ldquoI started writing a book of poems that initially were meant to be frivolous and entertaining.ldquoHowever, as I began writing, the intense grief I was battling at the time came to the fore.Critics say what developed was a touching tribute to his mother which they described as a moving narrative exploring bereavement, family le, memories and loss.The judging  consisted of poets Colum McCann, Jhumpa Lahiri and Paul Muldoon.As part of his prize fund for winning the highly acclaimed award, Stephen received , to travel and stay in the United States.Downpatrick poet Damian Smyth, head of literature at the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, congratulated Stephen on his award.He said: ldquoThe sense is quickly growing on both sides of the Atlantic that Stephen Sexton is already one of those rare poets whose obvious and prodigious lyrical gts are matched both by accessibility and universality.He added: ldquoIt is poignant that the person for whom the whole book is an elegy ndash his late mother mdashnever lived to see the acclaim lavished on her son.ldquoHowever, there are few contemporary works which describe the human processes of grief, loss, hurt and how love survives and endures as memorably and as movingly as this one, with virtuoso technique and profound wisdom, which I have to say is already a classic.

He was also brave and daring. He now attempted to conquer all of Ulster, which King Henry II had granted to him five years before. He gathered around him about  knights and archers, who, with their attendants, made up about one thousand men.Downpatrick was the capital of the Gaelic Kingdom of Ulidia. But de Courcyrsquos men were half starved when they reached the town they stole everything that they could lay their hands upon ndash they ate and drank, plundered and killed, until half of Downpatrick was in ruin.Almost at once the Gaelic king, Mac Dunleavy, came with a large force to attack de Courcy. He went out to meet Mac Dunleavy, and chose a strategic place to make an attack. The Gaels rushed in with great bravery, but they were unable to break the ranks of the Normans and after a fierce fight they were repulsed with great loss.But the Ulidians put up a most determined resistance. The valiant de Courcy attacked the Gaels as many as three times that year. De Courcy then suffered a number of reverses, so that it was an effort to hold his ground.He was defeated near Newry with the loss of  men and was intercepted in one of his many raids by the Dalaradian king, Cumee OrsquoFlynn. He escaped from the battlefield with only eleven companions and having lost their horses they fled on foot for two days and two nights, closely pursued, without food or sleep.But in other battles de Courcy was victorious, so that as the year passed his position in Ulster was strengthened. Now he started to build Dundrum Castle, along with Carrickfergus at a later date. The failure of local government in Down, now prompted King Henry II to make de Courcy the justiciar mdash or viceroy mdash in Ireland. During this time Connaught was invaded, de Courcy burning and slaying after his usual fashion.He was confronted by two kings from Munster and Thomond, who had united armies. Not venturing to make battle, he retreated northwards to save himself and his forces from destruction. He arrived in Ballysadare on the Sligo coast, with the enemy pursuing closely behind. He set fire to the buildings and fled south east.As he was crossing the Curlew Hills de Courcy was overtaken by the Gaels, who fell upon his men and killed a greater number of them. It was with dficulty that he escaped to Leinster with what remained of his army.De Courcy had enemies at court, chief among them being Hugh de Lacy, who poisoned King Johnrsquos mind against him. He was proclaimed a rebel and a traitor. De Lacy, now Lord Justice, was sent to arrest him.After a number of unsuccessful attempts de Courcy was atbetrayed by some of his own servants who led him to his retreat at Downpatrick, where he was taken in . His enemies came down upon him on Good Friday when he was barefooted and unarmed, doing penance in Down Cathedral. He snatched the nearest weapon, a great wooden cross, with which he dashed out the brains of many of his attackers before he was overpowered.Between his arrival at Downpatrick in  and his expulsion in  de Courcy founded many religious establishments, built abbeys for the Benedictines and the Cistercians and the great fortress of Dundrum Castle, then known as Rath.He had chosen a good site on a -foot high hill overlooking an inlet in Dundrum Bay in the plains of Lecale and the pass between the Mourne Mountains and the foothills of Slieve Croob.It is not known when the main keep was built, but it was a remarkable achievement in military science and architecture by the knights who had come back from the Holy Land on crusade. The diameter of the keep is  feet, and it is  feet high.But as a result of trouble in Downpatrick, de Courcy lost control of Dundrum Castle along with Carrickfergus Castle in Co Antrim. In the year after his expulsion de Courcy tried to recapture Dundrum Castle, now held by his father-in-law, the King of the Isle of Man. De Courcyrsquos attempts ended in failure and the castle became crown property. In  it was visited by King John.Dundrum Castle consisted of two storeys with wooden floors above the basement, and the original entrance on the ground floor.

She is currently putting our exhausted son to bed. I step into the back garden to drink in the last drops of warm air before the nighttime chill descends.My thoughts turn, as they usually do around this time of the week, to what I will write about in my column.I sit there for some time, my mind barren.No sound, just colour in the garden \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...I look around, trying to take the perspective outside of my own thoughts. There are colours in the garden - ochre, pale yellow, startling pink, and ying depths of green.I’m no gardener and I’m struck by how this cycle continues without any interference or direction from me. But, while some buds have sprouted already, others remain just a promise. Plants, like people, develop at their own pace.There is something even more erting than the wash of the leaves it is the sound. Or rather, the lack of it. The air is still tonight so there is no rustle from the tips of the trees. The birdsong has long since quietened.More, there is no low thunder of traffic from the nearby road, no distant rumble of a plane in the sky. There are no cries of children playing, no adults talking. There is no urgent rush of oil burners boiling.I have sat in the same spot on countless evenings before, but I’m not sure I’ve ever noticed this vacuum before. Is it always this way, or is this another manestation of our new condition The silence is, at the same time, both reassuring and disconcerting. I enjoy the peace, but still like to hear some activity, just to remind me that there is something  out there, on the other side of the garden fence. I crunch my feet on the loose stones, just to create a sound.I take a moment and consider the day just passed. I’m reluctantly forced to admit that it has been pleasant. I feel a certain guilt in this, knowing so much about how many are suffering at this time. But, undeniably, there is an degree of attraction in this slower pace of le.This was a family day. The three of us shared breakfast and dinner at the same table, played together, watched a film, went for a walk. I wore a sun hat. Our son talked a lot and we listened. Later, when my boy is dreaming, my we and I will watch something silly on TV. She will have a glass of wine while I munch crisps. There is nothing  to do.I have written a lot in previous weeks about the strain that lockdown has brought to me and others. While that is true, it is only honest to state that it is not the full picture. This adversity has also created a more profound appreciation and distinction of what is important in our lives, and what we can do without.I think about what I miss most of the old le. Being able to see extended family and friends, watching my son playing with those of his own age. Much beyond that now seems dispensable. My whole le has been lived aggrandising sport to appear more important than it should be. Now, I find, I don’t think much about it. The new reality has separated the substance from the garnish.I consider how a normal day off work, before the pandemic, would have looked. There would have been a panic to squeeze in many activities. We would have tried to take our son to a class or play date in the morning, fought our way around a supermarket or clothes shop, visited people, forced some small talk, perhaps gone out for dinner, all while I followed the progress of multiple sporting events on my phone and checked social media. It would have been typically frenzied.This frenzy is of mind as well as action. I can explain this best through a simple example. I enjoy drinking pure apple juice. Apple juice with other flavours added, I enjoy less. When I go to the shop I often set myself the task of buying the plain juice. Yet, more often than not, I get home to find I have bought apple juice flavoured with pear, elderflower or, worst of all, cucumber and mint.The problem is clear, it is a symptom of a cluttered mind. Forever anxious about the next thing that needs to be done, and the thing after that, and not focusing on what is in front of my eyes. Sometimes, it feels that I can only think with clarity when I write, it is the most effective way of finding a path through this troubled maze.It is hard to look past the current pandemic when the agony being suffered by many is absolute. As I said earlier, its claw is so long and pointed that I now feel a degree of guilt when I’m enjoying an experience that I know others cannot.But the crisis will pass and then some of the things that enrich and colour our lives will start up again. Perhaps we will be just as we were before, perhaps, because the trauma has the potential to improve us, we will be slightly altered. The upsurge in kindness and compassion which has become apparent throughout communities will hopefully prove more tenacious than the virus which spawned it.The air is cooler now and I’m surprised at how long I’ve been sitting in the same spot. It is harder to see the plants in the half-light but the night seems just as peaceful as what passed before. I enjoy it for a few more moments before I go back inside.One of the many effects of the lockdown has been to sharpen my senses towards what is around me. It has given me the chance to spend time with my we and son that I would otherwise have missed. Distractions have been removed as the regulations mean we have settled into a more sedate, purer set of habits.Tomorrow will be another family day. We have nothing in particular to do and nowhere that we need, or are allowed to go. It will be just the three of us in our home. I’m looking forward to it.When everything  is taken away, what is left is what is most important. And, as I constantly remind myself, it’s all that I really need.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We cannot afford to risk losing any more.He added: ldquoJust yesterday the Health and Social Care Secretary said he could not guarantee that hospitals would not run out this weekend. vw,vw,px, px\"The BMA survey found just under a third of doctors working in high-risk areas ndash aerosol-general procedureareas ndash and other non-AGP hospital settings said they were sometimes pressurised to work without adequate protection, while % of doctors working in AGP areas said there were shortages of, or no supply at all of, long-sleeved disposable gowns and disposable goggles.Public Health Englandreversed its guidance on Friday evening which stipulated long-sleeved disposable fluid repellent gowns should be worn when treating Covid- patients.If the gowns are not available, clinical staff are now advised to wear ldquodisposable, non-fluid repellent gowns or coveralls or ldquowashable surgical gowns, with aprons, and to wash their forearms afterwards.At least  NHS workers have now died after contracting coronavirus.A Department of Health spokesman said: ldquoNew clinical advice has been issued today to make sure thatthere are shortages in one area, frontline staff know what PPE to wear instead to minimise risk.Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, a body that describes itself as speaking for the health and care system, told BBC Radio rsquos Today programme: ldquoI think the worrying situation is absolutely there.ldquoThe reality is that there is a chance, and I donrsquot think itrsquos definite, but there is a chance hospitals could run out or, indeed, other parts of the system could run out of the gowns which are required to treat some, not all, Covid patients.Meanwhile, Tory former party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said the Government should stop treating people ldquolike children by refusing to discuss exit strategies for ending the lockdown.He told the Times: ldquoThe Government is going to have to accept and admit we are coming out of lockdown.ldquoWe need to trust the British people and not treat them like children.
