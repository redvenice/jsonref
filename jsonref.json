At current speeds, it estimated the Adrian Darya would reach Mersin in about a week.The State Department said it had \u0027conveyed our strong position to ALL ports in the Mediterranean that should be forewarned about facilitating Grace 1,\u0027 without elaborating.         resident Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron pose for a family photo with invited guests during the G7 summit in Biarritz, France on Sunday. The Adrian Darya\u0027s detention and later release by Gibraltar have added fuel to the growing tensions between Washington and Tehran, after President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from Iran\u0027s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers over a year agoThe Adrian Darya\u0027s detention and later release by Gibraltar have added fuel to the growing tensions between Washington and Tehran, after President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from Iran\u0027s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers over a year ago over concerns about Iran\u0027s ballistic missile program and regional influence. In the time since, Iran lost billions of dollars in business deals allowed by the deal, as the U.S. re-imposed and created sanctions largely blocking Tehran from selling crude oil aboard, a crucial source of hard currency for the Islamic Republic.         U.S. authorities allege the Adrian Grace\u0027s true owner is Iran\u0027s Revolutionary Guard, a paramilitary organization answerable only to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (pictured)In U.S. federal court documents, authorities allege the Adrian Grace\u0027s true owner is Iran\u0027s Revolutionary Guard, a paramilitary organization answerable only to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The U.S. declared the Revolutionary Guard a foreign terror organization in April, the first time America named a military force of a nation as such, giving it the legal power to issue a warrant for the vessel\u0027s seizure. However, that would require another nation to acknowledge the writ.The Adrian Darya had put its intended destination as Kalamata, Greece, even though the port did not have the infrastructure to offload oil from the tanker. The State Department then pressured Greece not to aid the vessel.Meanwhile, Iran continues to hold the British-flagged oil tanker Stena Impero, which it seized in a commando-style raid July 19 after the taking of the Adrian Darya. Analysts suggested the release of the Adrian Darya would see the Stena Impero let go, but that has yet to happen.Late on Saturday, Iranian state media reported the country\u0027s Foreign Ministry had imposed sanctions on the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies and its CEO for its role in promoting sanctions and \u0027economic terrorism\u0027 against Iran. Reports accused the foundation and its CEO, Mark Dubowitz, of \u0027intentionally\u0027 damaging vital interests of Iran through spreading lies and negative campaigning against Iran.State media said the sanctions allow judiciary actions against the foundation, Dubowitz and Iranian colleagues. But like U.S. sanctions, they have little effect unless a person actively uses the Iranian financial system. Iran in recent years has sanctioned U.S. government officials and businesses in response to American pressure.In a statement to The Associated Press, Dubowitz said his think tank \u0027considers its inclusion on any list put out by the regime as a badge of honor.\u0027 Later, Dubowitz began describing the move as a \u0027threat,\u0027 citing one English-language report by the semi-official Iranian news agency Mehr that said the \u0027taking (of) any actions by the judicial and security apparatuses against the FDD and their Iranian and non-Iranian accomplices will be considered legitimate.\u0027The State Department similarly described Iran\u0027s move against the foundation as a \u0027threat.\u0027\u0027The U.S. takes the regime\u0027s threats seriously,\u0027 State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus wrote on Twitter. \u0027We intend to hold Iran responsible for directly or indirectly compromising the safety of any American.\u0027Also on Saturday, the head of the Guard, Gen. Hossein Salami, said it had successfully test-fired a \u0027new missile\u0027 a day earlier, but did not elaborate on the type of weapon, according to the semi-official Tasnim news agency. Iran\u0027s President Hassan Rouhani on Thursday debuted an Iran-made air-defense missile system, the Bavar-373. In June, Iran shot down an American surveillance drone in the Strait of Hormuz.

That evening, Epstein was filmed leaving the mansion with an unidentified woman, as newly-released stills, far right, show.They were spotted laughing and kissing as they walked away.While there is no suggestion of any impropriety on the part of the Duke, the fact he was drawn into Epstein’s toxic world and spent nearly a week in his company will surely raise further questions about his judgment and the statement he released yesterday.The December 2 dinner was held in the mansion’s second-floor dining room. TV anchor Katie Couric, once the highest-paid female presenter in the US, sat alongside comedian Chelsea Handler, a close friend of Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Aniston. Also there was George Stephanopoulos, a former White House communications director under President Bill Clinton turned £15 million-a-year ABC News host.The soiree is believed to have also been attended by Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the disgraced media tycoon Robert Maxwell and Epstein’s one-time girlfriend.Multiple Epstein accusers have claimed that Ms Maxwell ‘procured’ girls for the perverted millionaire. She denies the allegations.Guests would have walked past bizarre erotic artwork en route to the dining room with its gleaming mahogany table, including a painting of Bill Clinton in red heels and a blue dress, a reference to the outfit worn by Monica Lewinsky when she performed a sex act on him.         Jeffrey Epstein and unidentified lady left his Upper East Side mansion, variously dubbed the House of Horror and the House of Depravity by the banker’s young victimsIn an interview published on Friday in the US political magazine Mother Jones, Epstein’s friend Stuart Pivar, a respected scientist, told how the financier loved to shock at his parties. Mr Pivar described one dinner party to which Epstein had invited a group of top scientists. ‘Jeffrey had no attention  whatsoever, he would interrupt the conversation and say things like, “What does that got to do with p***y?” That was his favorite expression. It was a subject changer.’Whether Andrew heard Epstein utter those crass words remains unknown but the Prince, albeit unwittingly, was undoubtedly a ‘draw’ in New York where ‘you can buy anything except the caché of Royalty’, according to one woman who attended an Epstein party.The socialite told The Mail on Sunday last night: ‘There’s nothing socially mobile Manhattanites love more than brushing shoulders with a genuine member of the Royal Family. ‘Diana was a superstar. Prince Charles can command tens of thousands of dollars for tickets to a dinner. Jeffrey knew exactly what he was doing.‘Who is going to turn down the chance to mingle with a real-life Prince at dinner, even if the guy hosting it has a conviction for something as terrible as child molestation?         The Prince has fiercely denied any wrongdoing and knowledge of Epstein’s crimes, but he has faced questions about how he could have missed a procession of beautiful young women visiting the mansion during his six-day stay‘Royalty is stardust. People held their noses after Jeffrey was convicted but they were not going to turn down the chance to mingle with Royalty.’The Prince has fiercely denied any wrongdoing and knowledge of Epstein’s crimes, but he has faced questions about how he could have missed a procession of beautiful young women visiting the mansion during his six-day stay.‘There were girls coming and going the entire time Prince Andrew was inside the house,’ an eyewitness said.‘It was happening in broad daylight. If the Prince didn’t see all the girls coming through that door, he was the only person on 71st Street who didn’t. It was flagrant.‘At one point someone who looked like a royal protection officer came outside. Even if Andrew didn’t realise what was going on, you have to wonder why the people assigned to protect him didn’t say something?’Many of Epstein’s victims have described how assaults took place in an upstairs massage room which was strictly off-limits to other house guests.Some reports this week claimed Prince Andrew is now ‘fearful’ of returning to the US because he worries about being dragged into one of the multiple civil lawsuits being brought against Epstein’s £500 million estate. Lawyer Bradley Edwards, who represents several of the victims, said last night: ‘We would welcome the chance to speak to Prince Andrew under oath.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Sir Elton John set feature new set stamps mark 50 years showbiz","story":"Share this article               It is understood there will be a set of four stamps, each charting a different phase of his career (pictured: A Mail on Sunday interpretation of how the stamps commemorating Sir Elton’s career could look)A source said: ‘To Elton, this is the most tremendous honour.

Hydraulic fracturing was not taking place at the time.\u0027According to the British Geological Survey, the tremor had a depth of 1.2 miles and was felt by residents in areas including Great Plumpton, Blackpool and Lytham St Annes - which are up to four miles away.Regulators were informed and the \u0027integrity\u0027 of the well has been confirmed, Cuadrilla said.Stephen Hicks, seismologist at Imperial College London, said the movement was almost as strong as a 2.3-magnitude tremor at Cuadrilla\u0027s Preese Hall site in 2011, which led to the suspension of fracking in the UK for seven years.He tweeted: \u0027M2.1 is the largest induced event so far during the 2018-2019 hydraulic fracture operations at the Preston New Road site.\u0027It is close in size to the M2.3 earthquake in 2011 at the Preese Hall site which resulted in the suspension of fracking in the UK for 7 years.\u0027Those who felt ground movement last Wednesday blasted Cuadrilla for \u0027playing down\u0027 the extent of the tremors with their comparison to dropped shopping.Cat Smith, Labour MP for Lancaster and Fleetwood, tweeted: \u0027We\u0027ve woken up to the news there\u0027s been an earth tremor - again.

About 200,000 were from threatened species. Of those, 2,500 were brought home by British hunters, including hundreds of heads, feet, tails, hides, tusks and horns from some of the most endangered species – including rhinos and elephants.

Theresa May\u0027s decision to back a free vote on repealing the foxhunting ban is thought to have damaged the Tories at the last election.Mr Gove introduced a string of initiatives on the issue, including the ivory ban, restrictions on puppy farming and a ban on the use of wild animals in circuses. "},{"url":null,"title":"Private schools raise fees sack teachers t","story":"Share this article The contribution rates are due to be increased from 16.4 per cent to 23.6 per cent from September to fill a multi-million-pound black hole in the scheme.It comes as the NHS is threatened by a ‘brain drain’ because of a pension problem which has seen senior doctors turn down overtime and even retire early to avoid hefty tax bills.Since the changes to the teachers’ pension were announced, private school leaders have warned fees may have to rise to cover the cost.But fees have already doubled over the past 15 years – with the latest annual rise topping 3 per cent, analysis by the Independent Schools Council found this year. Boarding fees are now £34,704 a year on average, while the cost is £14,142 for day schools.More than half of the 360 private schools that responded to the Department for Education consultation this year said they could leave the pension scheme, but 57 said they could be forced to close.So far more than 60 independent schools have told the department they intend to pull their staff out of the scheme. Campaigners also fear schools will face recruitment challenges if teachers cannot benefit from the pension.

Nature’s soft nurse, how have I frighted thee  That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down.” Henry IV, as portrayed by Shakespeare, would have sympathised with people who struggle with insomnia. Now a major publisher has come up with a novel idea – audiobooks with such soothing sounds as soft rainfall and lapping water to relax the listener and send them off to sleep.In a project to be launched this week, Penguin Random House has collaborated with the Sleep Council and the Children’s Sleep Charity in creating collections of “Sleep Tales” for adults and children.Combining “cutting-edge technology and the ancient art of storytelling to help solve an age-old problem”, these audiobooks are part soundscape, part descriptive narrative, with softly spoken voices to calm anxieties and take listeners to the land of nod. analysed data from NHS Digital, the health service’s data provider in England, showing admissions of those aged 16 and under with a primary diagnosis of sleep disorder rose from 6,520 in 2012-13 to 9,429 last year.One audiobook story, titled Wakarango Mai, takes listeners to a paradise setting, New Zealand’s hot springs at Lake Taupo. Against a distant soundscape of chirping birds and lapping water, the narrator Sally Scott sets the scene: “This huge shiny expanse of water isn’t far from civilisation in terms of miles and yet, when you enter this ancient place, the bustling modern city is left behind, as if it ceases to exist at all, leaving with it all your stress and worries …”Each story lasts about 15 minutes, enabling listeners to set their sleep timer.The stories draw on the Sleep Council’s research into sounds that help people wind down, such as waves lapping on a shore, soft rainfall and birdsong.Richard Lennon, publisher at Penguin Audio, told the  the project was inspired partly by the realisation that increasing numbers of people were listening to audiobooks “as they’re going to sleep or as part of their bedtime routine”.He said both adults and children respond to something comforting and familiar as they are nodding off.These are tales without a beginning, a middle or an end, he added: “It’s something that’s being described to you, rather than a story that’s being told to you … Nothing happens that jolts you.”There are no authors’ names. He said: “We’re launching them as simply Penguin, Puffin and Ladybird Sleep Tales, rather than mentioning the writers by name because the focus isn’t just on the words. The combination of the words, the voice and the sound design all contribute to the relaxing atmosphere.”Asked whether a boring story could have the same effect, he said the stories needed to be “engaging enough not to put you off”: “This is about creating the right environment and headspace for you … to go to sleep. Strangely, if you’re bored, it doesn’t have that effect.”Audience research had been very positive, Lennon said. One listener reported: “The story made my mind stop racing.”The phrase “sleep like a baby” does not apply to a lot of children, with four in 10 having sleep problems. But Lennon said the children’s sleep tales were not intended to replace a bedtime story, only to become part of a bedtime routine.Lisa Artis of the Sleep Council said not everyone liked the same sounds: “Some people love thunder and lightning or birds tweeting. That’s why we came up with different stories with different effects. For some people, listening to rain just makes them want to go to the loo. But I personally like the sound of rain. I find it quite therapeutic.”She added that listening to “non-stimulating” stories were about switching off before bedtime: “It is the sort of thing you need to be doing before bed to feel more relaxed, rather than scrolling through Facebook and checking work emails … We need to forget about everything that’s going on because we will not get a good night’s sleep otherwise.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf4b3e2dae9509a92b21f05c5152270bb776c10b/0_340_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79a158dd6fce08942495a1a27f2d1b42","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Let’s begin with a tribute to Ronald Blythe’s Akenfield by PatLux:I just spoke to my 88 year-old mother who is reading Akenfield, which is reminding her of her own rural childhood and the stories told to her by her parents. I had discovered it in a charity shop in Edinburgh and brought it back to Luxembourg to read and enjoy. I then passed it on to my sister in Spain who devoured it and discussed with me scenes that resonated with her. She then gave it to my mother in northern England and when she has finished it we will donate it to the bookstall in our family’s village church for someone else to discover. I wonder where it will go next and I trust that it will give as much joy to the next reader as it has done to three of us. Many thanks to whoever it was on Tips, Links and Suggestions who inspired me to add this title to the list which I take with me to charity shops.MereMortal has “finally got round to starting” Howard Zinn’s “legendary” The People’s History of the United States:I’ve known about it for a decade or more and have owned it for about three years. He’s the most marvellous and sympathetic writer and he brings out of obscurity a wealth of highly character-driven stories of African slaves, American Indians, indentured white European servants, and women. People he considers were always omitted by the founding fathers when they declaimed “we the people”.I’m loving it. Zinn was that rare thing, an American socialist and a superb academic and this book was a massive hit as a history book and has been widely translated around the world.LLCoolJ is in need of lighter reading after finishing one of this year’s Booker nominations, Lost Children Archive by Valeria Luiselli:Here we have a “No names, please” family of four – Ma, Pa, boy, girl – driving from NYC to Arizona. The parents are documentariansdocumentarists (definitions and distinctions provided) who worked together on a sound-recording project that among other things recorded the over 800 languages spoken in NYC (I had no idea there are that many). Ma is now focused on a project about the “lost children” and detained migrants from Central America, and Pa is working on a project related to the Apaches. The marriage, it is announced early on, is ending, and it is projected that the parents will separate at the end of the trip, each taking one of the children.The first half of the book is narrated by ‘Ma’, and I was pulled in right away by the style of the writing. Much of it is muted, internal, Ma’s ruminations about her children and her marriage and her project ... I didn’t participate in the last two RG books because I didn’t feel I had the strength to take on Levi or Steinbeck. This book turned out to be just as harrowing. I expect it will haunt me for a long time, and I feel the need for something frothy next. So … Nina Stibbe, here I come.GELBuck has “just finished” The Frayed Atlantic Edge by David Gange:His series of kayak journeys down the Atlantic coasts of Scotland, Ireland and bits of Wales and England is the thread linking history, culture, geography and nature. A different perspective on our history and a book that makes me want to retire immediately and spend my time reading and kayaking on a west coast somewhere!Ubik by Phillip K Dick has been keeping Bacon78 guessing:The question of what is reality is explored here with a fun plot that keeps you guessing, and the philosophy never gets in the way of a good story. How do I know what I am experiencing is reality? How do I know that I’m not a simulation in an advanced computer, or that my reality is a product of my own imagination, and I’m actually in a coma somewhere on life support? Well, I don’t and neither do the characters in Ubik!!Richard Flanagan’s The Sound of One Hand Clapping has moved paulburns:A heart-wrenching story of a father-daughter relationship, set against the background of WW@ refugees living and working in Tasmania from 1954 to 1990. There are so many twists and turns in the story, most of them unexpected, that it would be unfair to other readers to give too many details. Suffice to say Flanagan writes with lyricism and passion of his beloved island, with his usual deep and sensitive understanding of the human condition.Finally, a eulogy in honour of Sebastian Barry from JayZed:Crikey, Sebastian Barry‘s a splendid writer, isn’t he? I was blown away a few weeks ago by Days Without End, and I’ve now been moved by The Secret Scripture. If I didn’t rate it quite as highly as Days Without End, that’s mostly because I loved DWE so much.A lot of similarities between the two books, despite the contrasting plots. In both Barry is masterful in creating compelling and distinctive narrative voices and both books are ultimately stories which celebrate love and humanity within a context of brutal cruelty.He can certainly write them.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

The advert is aimed at members of the influential Business Roundtable (BRT) lobby group, which represents 181 of the US’s biggest companies.The letter – addressed to the powerful group that includes Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, and Tim Cook, the boss of Apple – is designed to capitalise on the BRT’s recent landmark decision to change its definition of the “purpose of a corporation” from making money for shareholders to include broader goals such as caring for staff and the environment.“We are part of a community of certified B Corporations who are walking the walk of stakeholder capitalism,” said the open letter. “We are successful businesses that meet the highest standards of verified positive impact for our workers, customers, suppliers, communities and the environment. We operate with a better model of corporate governance – which gives us, and could give you, a way to combat short-termism and the freedom to make decisions to balance profit and purpose.”Billed as a fair trade label for companies, the B Corp movement describes itself as a “global movement of people using business as a force for good”. B Corps commit to focusing as much on social and environmental concerns as they do on profits – the so-called “triple bottom line”.Andrew Kassoy, the co-founder of B Lab, the charity tasked with growing the B Corp movement, said the BRT statement had been a “moment to celebrate”.The B Corp movement is gaining momentum as the climate crisis coupled with rising inequality has made business leaders question what success looks like in the 21st century.

Travel said: “It is unacceptable for passengers to be regularly inconvenienced with delays that can leave them hundreds of pounds out of pocket when they miss connections or transfers, are fined for picking up their hire car late or miss their train or cab home.”In a robust response, Ryanair rejected the findings. In a statement, it said: “These Which? figures are inflated and inaccurate. They refer to 2018, which was the worst year on record for ATC delays in Europe.”EasyJet and Thomas Cook both claimed factors beyond their control were to blame for the delays, such as airspace, weather and strikes.Stansted said it had posted significantly improved results in the first quarter of 2019, in part because Ryanair had invested in additional resourcing and equipment to support ground operation.While delays at British Airways improved over the five-year period, over the weekend furious customers attacked the airline for its handling of the pilots’ strike planned for September.Customers swamped BA helplines, and many passengers reported calling every hour but never getting through. Others messaged the company on Twitter with their frustrations, some complaining they would miss weddings and honeymoons.Scott Kishere, a filmmaker and police community officer, said: “My wife and I have been told that our flight to Toronto has been cancelled. This was a full package we booked through BA for our 10-year wedding anniversary. I have made over 100 attempts to contact them for a refund and they’re not answering.”BA said it was receiving nine times its normal call volumes and that 500 staff worked over the weekend to help sort out customer issues. But the airline admitted to adding to the chaos, after it sent some customers an email to say their flight had been cancelled, even though the flight was on a non-strike day and was scheduled to go ahead.After it realised the error, BA emailed customers again but by that time many had rebooked with other airlines.In a statement, it said: “We are sorry for any confusion and inconvenience this has caused. We would encourage anyone who has incurred any expenses as a direct result to get in touch, and we will deal with each case on an inidual basis.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e654a89d9b1b7b0555864d59ec58001122f635f6/0_39_5862_3517/master/5862.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ea38405c1adb2aa62426f62f5c9b121","title":"brexit no deal mps panic","story":"It’s not leaving the EU without a deal but jitters in parliament afterwards that the prime minister should worry aboutAre you ready for a no-deal Brexit? Have you stockpiled enough toilet paper? Built a small fort of tinned tomatoes, just in case? Over the next few weeks, government adverts will start warning the British public, businesses and neighbouring countries to prepare for Britain leaving the European Union without a deal, even though the official position of the government is that it still wants an agreement with Brussels.Ministers insist that they are now preparing properly for this sort of departure on 31 October, and that leaked documents predicting chaos are out of date, wrong, and being released by political opponents who want to scaremonger. They point to the extra £2.1bn being spent on protecting the supply of medicines, on ports and important freight routes, and on preparing local authorities. They argue that Boris Johnson’s administration is taking no deal seriously, unlike Theresa May and her chancellor, Philip Hammond.Even if ministers are right that their preparedness for the physical consequences of no deal are perfect, how sure are they that their colleagues are mentally ready? A number of senior Brexiteers are worried that if Britain does leave without a deal, the main problem might not be that there are what many of them optimistically term “bumps in the road”, but that MPs end up having a massive and very noisy panic attack about the whole endeavour.MPs have a tendency to panic even in small crises, calling anxiously for anyone even tangentially involved to resign so that they can at least appear to have a handle on the situation. They are much like the relatives regularly observed by doctors on geriatric wards: the ones who are the most demanding of the healthcare professionals invariably turn out to be those who failed to visit their ailing mother for years, and are now taking out their guilt on the poor nursing staff.When flooding hit the Somerset Levels in the winter of 2013-14, politicians who had paid scant attention to the activities of the Environment Agency suddenly started running around like disturbed ants. One even threatened to take Chris Smith, the boss of the quango, and “stick his head down the loo”. They’re no less brutal with their own parliamentary colleagues: ministerial resignations during bumpy periods are often seen as a way of releasing pressure, rather than actually holding someone accountable for making a mistake.It will be easy for this pattern to manifest itself again in a “bumpy” no-deal scenario. One Brexiteer fretted to me recently that “if there is no deal, journalists like you are going to find various things that have gone wrong, or a few bins that have fallen over, and then my colleagues are all going to start panicking about what no deal has done to the country, even if these problems were entirely unrelated to Brexit. They’ll start saying, ‘Oh no, this isn’t what I meant at all,’ and will then look around for someone to blame.” Another senior Tory predicts that “we might have another dodgy dossier-style situation, where you get MPs saying, ‘I only supported the evidence I was presented with, but now I’ve changed my mind.’”Johnson may find this panic hard to weather. Most Conservatives predict that he will win a vote of no confidence if the Labour party calls it in the first week of parliament sitting. But many of them worry that this result will mean the government limps on to a no-deal Brexit without having an election to clear the air. This is one of the reasons why senior Conservatives are making plans for a mid-October poll, which they hope would give Johnson the mandate to demand a new deal from Brussels.There is also the rather obvious blame game going on between the British government and its European counterparts. If there is no deal, Johnson will want to say it was recalcitrant EU leaders who forced Britain out in this way. Similarly European negotiators want to impress upon anyone who will listen that Britain is already dead set on leaving without a deal, and is only throwing up silly suggestions on the backstop that it knows could never work.If the EU fails as a convenient scapegoat, No 10 can also blame the May government for failing to prepare properly, and remainers in parliament for undermining the negotiations. This will drive an even deeper wedge through the Conservative party.Most ministerial attention is currently focused on what the first two weeks of September will bring, rather than on how MPs might behave in November. There are some plans to try to stop parliamentarians panicking. Michael Gove is likely to do weekly statements to the House of Commons on no-deal preparations, so MPs can’t say they weren’t informed, and the prime minister is holding regular dinners with MPs. Johnson on Sunday tried to prepare his colleagues and the public, saying: “I do not want at this stage to say there won’t be unforeseen difficulties.” His top adviser, Dominic Cummings, has been pushing ministerial aides to look for possible problems in their own departments in order to avoid a “black swan event” – an unexpected and severe crisis.The problem with genuine black swans, though, is that they only ever appear obvious once they have surfaced. Anything special advisers find now isn’t what will cause them the most trouble in the future. All they can do is hope that the most unexpected thing of all happens, which is that MPs don’t conform to their usual pattern, and manage not to panic.• Isabel Hardman is assistant editor of the Spectator"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d0366a25887f06821ed7da23480c12da819d498/0_202_1965_1179/master/1965.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2e2e71317b68614399180e3ec6fbca3","title":"swearing journalism potency guardian liberal","story":"It is difficult to discuss coarse language without using some. So, if reading on, be warned. Our style guide says the  is “more liberal than any other newspapers, using language that most of our competitors would not”.The editorial guidelines say: “Respect for the reader demands that we should not casually use words that are likely to offend. Use swearwords only when absolutely necessary to the facts of a piece, or to portray a character in an article there is almost never a case in which we need to use a swearword outside direct quotes. The stronger the swearword, the harder we ought to think about using it … and never use asterisks, which are just a cop-out.”As a readers’ editor swiftly learns, thresholds and tolerances vary. Mostly, when I enquire I find that writers and editors have deployed the controversially strong words for considered effect. This is particularly so in satire. Stewart Lee, for example, has hinted at his assessment of the UK prime minister by repeatedly fixing him with his career gaffes as nicknames, like so: “What was Boris Piccaninny Watermelon Letterbox Cake Bumboys Vampires Haircut Wall-Spaffer Spunk-Burster Fuck-Business Fuck-The-Families Get-Off-My-Fucking-Laptop Turds Johnson up to now? I wondered.”In former days, profanities were the focus. Now, at least in secular societies, taboo words associated with genitalia, sex, excretion, race and ethnicity tend to cause most concern. “I must be old-fashioned,” wrote a man upset by several uses of “cunt” in the same article. “My dad used to call it ‘pit talk’ where he worked.” In this case, the relevant editor had thought carefully before publication. The writer had skilfully skewered a senior figure’s use of the word to abuse on Twitter a younger person who had called attention to what seemed to the younger man to be double standards around race and ethnicity. In the context, and noting that a warning had been given, I supported the editor’s decision.Do not think sweary uses of religious words no longer offend. A commentator’s “Boris Johnson, the Minister for Oh-Christ” caused upset. And when, in a piece about housebuying, a writer self-assessed with “I mean, Jesus Christ, I’m an idiot”, a reader let me know that “the use of a name sacred to many people as a swearword or for humorous emphasis is both gratuitous and offensive”.Respect for sincerity of religious belief requires that the offence caused should be acknowledged. But in a secular society that values free speech, there is no general right not to be offended. What can reasonably be hoped is that, especially at a time when public discourse seems louder, harsher, coarser, writers will recognise that overuse drains the strongest words of the potency writers need.Conveying views such as mine on this issue runs the risk of compounding the offence already caused. Yet I find most complainants respond good-naturedly. A favourite reply came from a vicar, who graciously took the point but lamented nevertheless the decline of written English, and ended with a list of 13 “mild” swearwords – product, he said, of his research – so that his sign-off to me read as follows: “• Goddam • Jesus Christ • Minger • Sod off.

Put together with concerns over the impact of the new GCSEs on lower-ability pupils, the sense is growing that yet another Conservative educational reform has been bungled.The point of the changes to GCSEs pushed through by the former education secretary Michael Gove was to raise standards by making them harder. Almost all headteachers believe that this aim has been met. Increasingly, though, it appears that the price of this ratcheting up of difficulty was too high. Not only has a new schism opened up between the private and state sectors, since some private schools have refused to teach the new exams and instead opted for IGCSEs – International GCSEs – that are more similar to the old version (often retaining a mixture of exams and coursework). Existing inequalities in state schools have also been exacerbated by reforms whose overriding purpose was to make it easier to differentiate between the highest achievers (by creating two grades, 8 and 9, in place of the old A*).How to ameliorate this situation – without causing pointless disruption, undermining public confidence or worsening the situation with regard to the recruitment and retention of teachers – is the question that the new education secretary, Gavin Williamson, must now answer. Universities must be called to account straight away for the reasoning behind their decision to treat IGCSEs as if they are equal to the new GCSEs, even though they are said by the government not to meet “the new gold standard” and are excluded from official performance tables on this basis. Given that the first new GCSEs in English and maths were taken two years ago, the onus must be on universities and Ofqual, the exam regulator, to demonstrate that the students due to begin courses shortly have had their achievements at age 16 correctly weighted. Ministers must also explain why guidance in this area has not previously been issued. At least one private-school head warned more than a year ago that state-school pupils could suffer as a consequence of being forced to sit harder exams. Why, then, did ministers leave it to Labour’s Lucy Powell to investigate?But the problem with the new GCSEs goes beyond the knock-on effect on higher education, important though this is. For some students and teachers, the new exams were welcomed as a challenge – and those who performed well under demanding conditions deserve praise. But reports of increased stress and low morale among pupils must not be shrugged off. Putting children off learning in their mid-teens is a serious mistake. In particular, criticisms about the new exams’ unsuitability for pupils with special educational needs and in lower-ability groups must be addressed, and modifications considered.Nor can ministers, including Mr Gove, avoid taking responsibility for the new system-wide problem that they have created – with some children of fee-paying parents now studying for different exams from their state-school peers. Given the entrenched inequalities of the British education system (though Scottish children take different exams, the privatestate ide in cities such as Edinburgh follows a similar pattern), and the role of private schools in perpetuating hierarchies of social class and position, this new parting of the stateprivate ways was the very last thing the country needed. How can pupils, parents or the public be expected to embrace qualifications that are shunned by the most academically competitive fee-paying schools?Mr Williamson, should he try to rectify these problems, can at least claim to be a new broom. But he – or his successor, depending on how long the government lasts – will have their work cut out. Flaws in the new GCSEs are far from the only Conservative schools policy that should, in as orderly a way as can be managed, be swept away as soon as possible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe34de8b6b7fb942335c8cc29a5aeb2892595fa7/0_1128_3695_2217/master/3695.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54e67f4b4f3ae5e25ece24e8b6762473","title":"england school places shortage made worse by academies","story":"Government urged to restore powers to councils to open new schools to cope with demandCouncils are warning that a looming shortage in the number of school places across England is being made worse by academies, as last decade’s baby boom enters secondary schools over the next five years.The Local Government Association (LGA) is calling for the government to restore powers to councils enabling them to open new maintained schools if residents support them, and for new powers for councils to require academies to expand to meet local demand.Anntoinette Bramble, the chair of the LGA’s children and young people board, said that without such changes children were at risk of not having a secondary school place.“Our secondary school places crisis is now just one year away and this will be the reality for thousands of families without action,” Bramble said.Councils say their position is made impossible by conflicting rules, which place a legal duty on them to ensure adequate school places for local children but allow only autonomous academies and free schools to be opened to provide more places, other than in rare circumstances.With most state secondary schools in England now academies, the problem is made worse because local authorities cannot direct them to expand their intake or offer more places to meet forecast high demand, as they can with maintained schools.“Councils need to be allowed to open new maintained schools and direct academies to expand. It makes no sense for councils to be given the responsibility to plan for school places but then not be allowed to open schools themselves,” Bramble said.“The government needs to work closely with councils to meet the challenges currently facing the education system.”A spokesperson for the Department for Education (DfE) said: “We are determined to create more choice for parents when it comes to their children’s education and we have created around 920,000 school places since 2010, and are on track to see that number rise to a million by 2020.As parents and families prepare to apply for school places in 2020 when applications open later this year, the LGA says the DfE’s statistics suggest 15 areas have a shortage of classrooms, with the number of councils affected then rapidly increasing.By 2022, about a third of councils are expected to have a shortage of places for nearly 60,000 pupils. That figure rises to nearly half of all local authorities in England by the school year starting in September 2024, when more than 120,000 young people are “at risk of no place” if no new schools are built.In recent years, councils have created an estimated 600,000 places in primary schools to cope with the mini baby boom of the previous decade. But as children in that group move on to secondary school, councils say they have far less ability to provide more places.Last year, councils say, they created 96,000 places through their existing primary and secondary schools and, in a small number of cases, by commissioning places in academies. But only 37,000 of the new places were in secondary schools.The LGA’s plea comes as the government is reviving plans to rapidly expand the proportion of academies and free schools in England."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9383adb7e707b328b0f7373a2e958f4274a44e8c/0_240_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8394dbf134191ea5c90dceec10612ed9","title":"massive pumice raft spotted in the pacific could help replenish great barrier reef","story":"The 150 sq km field of floating rock was created by an underwater volcanic eruption near TongaA giant raft of pumice, which was spotted in the Pacific and is expected to make its way towards Australia, could help the recovery of the Great Barrier Reef from its bleaching episode by restocking millions of tiny marine organisms, including coral.The pumice raft, which is about 150 sq km, was produced by an underwater volcano near Tonga. It was first reported by Australian couple Michael Hoult and Larissa Brill, who were sailing a catamaran to Fiji, on 16 August.“We entered a total rock rubble slick made up of pumice stones from marble to basketball size,” the couple said in a Facebook post.“The waves were knocked back to almost calm and the boat was slowed to 1 knot. The rubble slick went as far as we could see in the moonlight and with our spotlight.”The yacht’s steering became temporarily jammed by rocks between rudders and hull, but they managed to clear it and warn other vessels in the area.Since then, the pair have been working with Queensland University of Technology geologist Scott Bryan by providing pictures and samples of the volcanic rock.Bryan said the raft will be the temporary home for billions of marine organisms. Marine life including barnacles, corals, crabs, snails and worms will tag along as it travels toward Australia and become a “potential mechanism for restocking the Great Barrier Reef”.“Based on past pumice raft events we have studied over the last 20 years, it’s going to bring new healthy corals and other reef dwellers to the Great Barrier Reef,” Bryan said.Pumice forms when frothy molten rock cools rapidly and forms a lightweight bubble-rich rock that can float. The pumice raft comes from an unnamed but only recently discovered underwater volcano that satellite images reveal erupted about 7 August.It should begin to hit Australian shores in about seven months’ time, passing by New Caledonia, Vanuatu and reefs in the eastern Coral Sea along the way as coral begins to spawn.“It’s the right timing. So it will be able to pick up corals and other reef building organisms, and then bring them into the Great Barrier Reef,” Bryan said.“Each piece of pumice is a rafting vehicle. It’s a home and a vehicle for marine organisms to attach and hitch a ride across the deep ocean to get to Australia.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa1c4051aaff50e0522304d7a9ff70b1758a6071/0_121_3936_2362/master/3936.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d093510d460f31e82ea497357f389fc","title":"uk fracking site near blackpool reports largest tremor yet","story":"Cuadrilla reports ‘mico-seismic event’ at Preston New Road facility on Saturday nightA tremor of magnitude 2.1 has been recorded at the UK’s only active fracking site – the largest detected at the facility.The energy firm Cuadrilla said the “micro-seismic event” at its site near Blackpool had occurred at 11.01pm on Saturday.It came days after the previous record was set at the Preston New Road facility last Wednesday, when a 1.55-magnitude tremor was recorded.The company said Saturday’s tremor had lasted for about one second and had occurred when no fracking was taking place.While some local residents may have felt the movement, it was not strong enough to have caused any damage to property, the firm added.“We can confirm that a micro-seismic event measuring 2.1ML (local magnitude) on the Richter scale occurred at Preston New Road,” a spokeswoman said.“This lasted for around one second and resulted in ground motion less than 1.5 mms. Hydraulic fracturing was not taking place at the time.”According to the British Geological Survey, the tremor had a depth of 1.2 miles (2km) and was felt by residents in areas including Great Plumpton, Blackpool and Lytham St Annes.Regulators were informed and the “integrity” of the well has been confirmed, Cuadrilla said.Stephen Hicks, a seismologist at Imperial College London, tweeted: “M2.1 is the largest induced event so far during the 2018-2019 hydraulic fracture operations at the Preston New Road site. It is close in size to the M2.3 earthquake in 2011 at the Preese Hall site which resulted in the suspension of fracking in the UK for seven years.”Fracking was halted temporarily at Preston New Road after Wednesday’s tremor, which Cuadrilla said would have felt similar to someone dropping a large bag of shopping on the floor.Pausing work for 18 hours is the routine response for any tremor over 0.5.Labour’s shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long Bailey, has called for fracking to be banned, saying it causes air and water pollution and contributes to climate change.The environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth said that in 60 days of fracking last year there had been 57 tremors in Lancashire, and it could not be carried out without triggering earthquakes.“Even small vibrations at ground level can be the sign of far more damaging impacts deep underground,” said Jamie Peters, a campaigner for the organisation.The government has said the extraction of shale gas through fracking could support the UK’s transition to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/823c7439505bf8a62120de39188b145cf448bd02/0_0_3746_2247/master/3746.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c45a5643f4ac374fc52882bf4e2bf23","title":"we love fashion fixes for the week ahead in pictures","story":"Chinti \u0026amp Parker bring back a cartoon classic with their Peanuts collaboration, Lucy Williams x Missoma team up again for you perfect everyday jewellery and Clarks partner with Patta to update the desert boot"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1732f3c562841596c47e4b564f8f380d26e6107e/0_287_2363_1418/master/2363.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7cb87bb01fe15fe9428aa1da0e75b758","title":"for sama documentary interview waad al kateab","story":"For Sama, a new documentary from award-winning Syrian journalist Waad al-Kateab, has won global acclaim. She talks about filming and family life on the frontlineThe camera focuses on Sama’s face. She is the sweetest baby and looks, at first glance, as though her life might be ordinary. Her eyes are a transitory newborn colour, greyish green, waiting to turn brown. Her gold earrings look over-large in her tiny ears. Sama means sky in Arabic – a sky, as her mother imagines it, where no bombs fall, with ordinary clouds and sunshine. So far, this is footage that could be the work of any doting parent, but Sama’s mother is journalist Waad al-Kateab and this is her documentary For Sama, filmed during the Syrian war. In the film al-Kateab sings a lullaby that almost lulls us – if not Sama – into a false sense of security. Sama is chewing her toe investigatively, as babies do, when a tank shell explodes. It sounds like a nightmare next-door neighbour heaving heavy furniture about and there is a shout: “Downstairs, downstairs, there’s another one coming…” It is the summer of 2016, the beginning of the siege of Aleppo. The camera loses focus, swerves incoherently. Al-Kateab calmly asks someone to “take Sama”. By now, the shells are deafening.“This is insane – we’re getting this every day,” she goes on in her low, musical voice – her calm as abnormal as her situation (during the siege there were cluster bombs, chlorine gas, barrel bombs and air strikes). There is fire at the end of their corridor and smoke pours in. They live in the hospital that her husband, Hamza, has started from scratch. And now they are moving a baby on life support and Hamza is shouting: “Come on! We need to pump the ventilators by hand.” In the dark, al-Kateab calls out: “Who’s got Sama?”A UN spokesman recently said the world had become “numb to the carnage” in Syria after more than eight years of war and that even the rising death toll in Idlib – the country’s last rebel-held stronghold – was being met by “a collective shrug”. No wonder al-Kateab feared her film – which starts with the peaceful protests against President Bashar Al-Assad in 2011 and goes on through the Arab spring to the sacking of Aleppo by regime forces in 2016 – would be greeted with indifference. But the reaction has been unanimous and overwhelming: audiences in every country in which the film has been shown stand and clap (at Cannes in May, they apparently did so for six minutes).Al-Kateab started out as a citizen journalist for Channel 4 news and has already been acclaimed for her harrowing and human series of reports Inside Aleppo (for which she has won an Emmy and the foreign affairs prize at the British journalism awards). But this film, dedicated to her daughter, is more personal. This is a mother’s film in which the normal rhythms of parenthood become disrupted. Al-Kateab worries that nappies and baby formula will run out. Toddlers use a bombed bus as their playground, painting it all the colours of the rainbow (even little Sama is helped to wield a brush) and al-Kateab’s stoical best friend Afraa never loses the twinkle in her eye as she keeps quiet about weevils she finds in the rice. In the unreality of war, the domesticity startles: an ordinary cooking pot looks outlandish. But this is For Sama’s strength: the tender stuff of family life, often ignored in war reporting, is all there. Already garlanded with awards including best documentary at the Cannes and SXSW film festivals and a special jury prize at Hot Docs, For Sama also shows what it is to destroy a family. We see mothers in fierce, tearless overdrive, like figures from Shakespearean tragedy. One mother searching for her son, Mohammad, gives us the film’s most revealing line. On finding his dead body she postpones the evidence of what she sees, crying hysterically: “It’s Mummy, I’ve got your milk, wake up!” At this moment, she sees al-Kateab filming. What you expect her to say is: “How dare you?” Instead, she screams at the top of her voice: “Film this!”“My lens,” al-Kateab says now, “was, for her, the world outside. She wanted her grief witnessed.”Last week – three years later – a small girl skips along the corridor of a photographic studio in north London, holding the hand of a babysitter. “Where’s Mama?” she calls out. Sama is about to join her mother and have her picture taken. She does several experimental twirls in her flowery frock and puts on her shoes with satisfaction. The moment comes to comb her hair: Mama must do it. Sama prefers not to stand still. Asked how old she is, she holds up three fingers, eyes shining. She is an enchanting child, extraordinarily animated. Her mother, beautiful and immaculately dressed – responding to her daughter at every turn – is still by contrast. Looking at them after having seen the film, one feels a marvelling gratitude that they have survived. It seems bordering on unreal that she and her family have swapped east Aleppo for east London (she is currently employed by Channel 4 NewsITN).The family was compelled to leave Syria on 21 December 2016 (the city’s sixth month under siege). Hamza was recognised – as manager of the only surviving hospital and responsible for civilian healthcare in east Aleppo’s last besieged quarter – to be one of the most significant figures in the civilian administration area and it was he who received the phone call from the UN with a message from the Russians to say that if those remaining in Aleppo wanted to survive, they must surrender and go into exile immediately. Al-Kateab asks in the film: “Sama, will you remember Aleppo? Will you blame me for staying here? Or blame me for leaving now?” They had never intended to leave. And, in one sense al-Kateab (not her real name, she uses the pseudonym to protect her relatives) has never left: she brought Syria with her to the UK, arriving with a dozen hard drives initially cut down to 300 hours of footage – which she then spent two years, with fellow director Edward Watts (an independent film-maker who has made more than 20 documentaries), editing into their 95-minute film.Watching her having her picture taken, she seems professional and aloof – as if elsewhere (as she presumably feels she is). But as she sits down beside me on a small sofa, that changes. Attentive and warm, she pats my arm to emphasise her points. “I filmed everything,” she explains. Selecting material for the film, the challenge was to achieve a balance between “dark and light, life and death”. At first, she had felt adamant that showing the worst was what mattered: her footage was “evidence”. But then, as Watts explains on the phone, they ran an early test screening at Channel 4, for friends and family – “just 15 people or so” – and realised they had “gone too far into the darkness.”Their first cut was in chronological order. It started with hope, descended into despair. This, they realised, did not work. It is hard to imagine more devastating images than those shown in the film, but al-Kateab and Watts insist many were worse – including “a pile of very young children’s dead bodies” abandoned at a hospital. The audience could not cope and sometimes, during editing, Watts had found himself putting his hand in front of the screen. They had to think again. Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in the Syrian war and more than 10 million displaced, and while audiences needed to be aware of “carnage en masse”, this had not to be at the expense of inidual dignity.The collaboration between al-Kateab and Watts started uncertainly because they were in different countries: she was in Turkey (where her family spent a year after fleeing Syria), he was in London. She applied for asylum in the UK on the basis that she and Hamza were targets for reprisals by the regime and on the strength of their work for Channel 4 news and in east Aleppo. Her story had received attention in parliament during the 2016 siege and with the backing of Channel 4 News, her case was swiftly processed. Making the film, al-Kateab had been understandably nervous that a foreigner might falsify or appropriate her emotional copyright. But nowadays, she happily declares that, while most collaborators “start together and end apart”, she and Watts went the opposite way. It was Watts who had the brainwave to make Sama the key to structuring the film and they discovered that, with a flashback format, they could move between dark and light, with Sama as their – and our – lifeline. And, by this stage, the film was becoming a love story.It begins with 18-year-old al-Kateab (she is 26 now) about to study economics at Aleppo university. Hamza is a close friend but married to someone else. She describes him as having the gift of making her feel safe with “a constant smile on his face”. One of the few doctors in Aleppo who is also an activist, his smile is to be tested in the years that follow. East Aleppo lacks schools and emergency and medical services – thus the urgent need for his hospital. We watch him at work: a confidence-inspiring hero – his makeshift hospital run, extraordinarily impressively, partly on willpower. In the weeks before they leave the country, the hospital (Hamza’s second after the first was destroyed by bombs) performed 890 operations in 20 days and received 6,000 wounded people.One scene shows a massacre in east Aleppo. Al-Kateab films the rows of bodies hauled out of a river – like a dormitory for the dead. Heads stick out of the tops of blue sleeping bags, awaiting identification. These civilians have been handcuffed, tortured and executed. Their crime? They lived in “areas opposed to the regime”. Hamza’s smile has gone but his composure is holding. As corpses are thrown in makeshift shrouds into a mass grave, there is high and defiant singing: “Our dead have gone to paradise.”When Hamza’s wife urges him to flee the country, he chooses Syria over his first marriage. Armed rebels by this point have freed the city but retaliation is intensifying. Al-Kateab’s camera repeatedly shows terrible smoke on the horizon, rising above the city’s brick buildings like grey plumage. She explains that she started filming on a mobile, graduated to a camera and even borrowed a drone from a friend (she had trouble learning to use it but eventually got superb results).Hamza has come up with a rule for the two of them: no crying in hospital. “He explained that people saw me as powerful because I was filming and believed in the revolution. If they saw me break down, however strong they might be, it would weaken them. And Hamza felt he had to have strength for everyone. He was a leader.” Hospital staff used to tell her: “We’re very strong because of Hamza – he is very cool.”But one day, watching an attempt to save a boy’s life, al-Kateab cannot help herself. Hamza ticks her off: “You can’t cry in here – get out.” But then he goes after her. It is striking how often in the film people ask one another: “What’s wrong?” It seems a redundant question, the answer everywhere to be seen. Al-Kateab agrees but explains: “It’s about care. Even though I might know you have lost your child, it’s my way of asking what’s going on in your heart.”Hamza told her: “Don’t you realise I’m in love with you? Will you marry me?” The film answers his question with footage of their wedding: Hamza in black suit and lilac tie, Waad in a veil with white silk roses in her hair. Confetti falls through the air, as though there might still be room for a fairytale in Aleppo. It is one of the rare times the camera is not in al-Kateab’s hands. They dance to Willie Nelson’s Crazy and Hamza tells her: “This is the road we’re taking, it is a long road full of danger and fear but freedom waits for us at the end.” The tenderness of the dancing is offset by what is, in a sense, their most dangerous wedding vow: “Come, let’s walk it together.”In the early days, friends would tease: “They’d say: Waad’s playing with her camera again…” This changed after one of their dearest friends, Gaith – a nurse – and his brother Mahmoud were killed in an air raid. “We had lost Gaith,” says al-Kateab. “We knew he was never coming back to this Earth but had this incredible footage of him laughing, working, sad… the life he’d shared was recorded.” Filming was remembering and the people who once mocked now apologised.Sama’s birth is an ordinary – and extraordinary – event, discreetly presented. We see her friends with ears pressed to the door of the hospital room, listening out for the baby’s first cry and jumping for joy when they hear it. Al-Kateab is then seen crying, holding Sama in her arms – and Hamza teasingly tells her to stop upsetting their baby. What was in her mind? “I was crying because this was a room where two of my friends – Gaith and Omar – used to work before they were killed. I was thinking: I’ve brought life to this place. I’d been terrified I’d not live to see Sama born. I was terrified about the future but also so happy. I could see Hamza’s and my story in Sama’s face. Yet I missed Gaith and Omar and wished they were alive.”If filming was remembering, it was also, crucially, about resistance. Al-Kateab emphasises new media’s role in the Arab spring: “Mobiles became the only way to show the world that we were fighting for our freedom.” Early student protests were peaceful and festive with fireworks and dancing in the streets. But by 2015, the security forces were beating up student protesters. “They’d turn up and five minutes later, the place would empty. A presenter from the official channel would ask: ‘Has anything happened here?’ ‘No, nothing,’ the remaining students would reply.” Al-Kateab’s footage would capsize that lie. Similarly, she would later secure evidence that Assad’s regime was using chemical weapons.Eventually, filming became her way of surviving: “It gave me a reason to stay in Aleppo. If I was killed, I’d be leaving something important behind.” Not that it gave her distance on what was happening. It was “doubly harrowing” and “brought everything closer”. But for many people, the camera represented hope. And while on the subject, I tell her that, strangely, it was the moments of hope in the film that undid me – all the more moving for being unexpected. A woman who is nine months pregnant is carried into hospital unconscious. An emergency caesarean is performed. We see the baby pulled out – lifeless. The misery of it is sickening. War has killed him. Capable gloved hands palpitate the little chest to start the lungs – surely in vain. The nurse briskly brushes his body with a sweeping movement. They hold him upside down and shake and slap and, just as we have given up on his slippery, grey body, he opens his eyes and cries – and everyone who sees it will join in. God be praised! His furious frown is a triumph, his cry defies Assad (they save the mother as well). “It is a miracle,” al-Kateab exclaims. “It gives us the strength to stay in the struggle.”But for her, too, hope is hardest to handle: “Whenever I watch the film, it is when everyone else is laughing that I cry. We were creating hope and it was destroyed by the violence of the regime and by the Russians. At the last screening, sitting next to Ed, I started crying as I watched the early days of the revolution. And he was asking me: “What’s the matter?” And I said: “It’s the hope.”But there has been another, more manageable, version of hope too – in people’s reactions to the film: “It’s been amazing – audiences have given me hope, shown me they really care. I’ve been to Nantucket, Washington, Toronto, and even film distributors, who normally sample a film for 10 minutes and then leave, have stayed and been very moved.” When people went “crazy” in Cannes, she says, “I can’t describe how proud and happy it made me.”It will be years before Sama is old enough to see the film made in her name. Al-Kateab addresses her in the film like this: “Sama, I know you understand what is happening. I can see it in your eyes. You never cry like a normal baby would. That’s what breaks my heart.” Now she confirms that, on some level, “Sama understood everything. That time I was looking for her during the bombing, I found her sleeping in a very quiet way”. Her second daughter, Taima (she became pregnant again while still in Aleppo, the baby was born in Turkey) reacts in a “totally different way. If a bottle of milk drops, she cries. Sama used to fall from a high bed and not make a sound. But I’d sometimes sense she was scared.”After leaving Syria, Sama used to wake in the night screaming. They consulted experts – she is doing better now. Better than her mother, who says: “I still suffer from nightmares. And whenever I hear a very loud sound – like a train – I feel it in my body. I tried to seek therapy but it did not work for me.” She has said in the past that her therapist (whom she now wants me to know is “amazing” and says she “loves”) herself needed therapy after their sessions together.The film’s most extraordinary achievement is that, instead of leaving one helpless, it creates resolve. Everyone who sees it feels the same. Al-Kateab says audiences come to her moved and energised and with one question: what can we do? The first step is “understanding”, she says – especially at a point where Idlib’s suffering is starting to resemble Aleppo’s. And she gets out her phone to play the infamous September 2016 interview with US presidential candidate Gary Johnson. Asked about his plans for Aleppo, he replies gormlessly: “What’s Aleppo?” It was this interview that stung Al-Kateab into making the banner seven-month-old Sama holds at the end of the film with their city of ash as a backdrop. It reads: THIS IS ALEPPO. WHAT’S JUSTICE?As well as the need for understanding, she hopes for support for the campaign she and Hamza plan to launch next month on forsamafilm, to “stop bombing hospitals”. She argues that the bombing of hospitals is now a “worldwide” problem. When Hamza’s hospital is bombed, it is observed with sober understatement: “Targeting hospitals breaks people’s spirits.”Meanwhile, Hamza plans to do a master’s degree in public health and has ambitions to reform the UN and World Health Organization’s approach to conflict areas: “He was put under a lot of pressure by the UN, she says, “to evacuate the hospital in a way that was not to the benefit of his patients. He believes the UN was simply implementing what Russia wanted them to do.”The film has now been seen at the UN and, at a recent briefing at the UK mission, with ambassadors in attendance. The issue of the bombing of hospitals (with the film as evidence) has also been raised at a security council meeting. And it is hoped that For Sama will be shown to the Russian government (although Watts is mindful of the risk that the Russian regime might “pirate, re-edit or misrepresent it”). And might not showing it in Russia be dangerous for al-Kateab? “It would but I don’t care. I could have been killed three years ago.”From an outsider’s point of view what seems most striking in the film – bordering on mystifying – is the intensity of the continuing allegiance to Aleppo itself, the wish, expressed repeatedly, to stay no matter what – a vote to put Aleppo before life itself. One of the oldest and most beautiful cities in the world has had its medieval architecture destroyed by barrel bombs. Wouldn’t you run from the wreckage if you could? A boy, with quavering bravado, says he would stay in the city even if his family were to leave. A girl – no more than three – as she is compelled to depart, says in a startlingly adult tone: “Aleppo is gone.” Al-Kateab lets us know: “Saying goodbye is worse than death.”She nods mutely when I ask if the place itself is precious to her. “A journalist visiting Syria can leave any time. I started with Aleppo in my mind and heart.” She speaks eloquently about shared experience in conflict: “The people I lived with in Aleppo became closer to me than my own parents, sister and brother.” And she makes the point that she and Hamza recognised the necessity of their roles as doctor and journalist.“Death was close. We knew we could be killed at any moment but lived as if each minute was our last. That’s why there is so much joy in the film. When death is all around you, life is cheap but very important. A lot of people in the UK don’t know the value of life. Or the value of minutes. If you enjoy doing something, do it. If you love someone, tell them as soon as possible because this life could end at any moment.” The world, she continues, is a “very dark place – with Brexit here, US policy, Russia – and you feel nothing will change.

Gérard Houllier and Rafael Benítez, who preached control, may not recognise this variant of Liverpool but, more than most, Arsenal can testify to the effectiveness of Klopp’s energetic makeover.“They are a fantastic team when they have rhythm,” said David Luiz, before arrowing in on the same word: “They play with intensity. They never stop.” Perhaps Arsenal were not beaten as much as frazzled, their decision-making warped by Liverpool’s relentlessness. Poor choices have pockmarked David Luiz’s career but the two that came in 10 second-half minutes, tugging back Mohamed Salah to concede a penalty and then careering towards the Egyptian only to miss him when he sprinted clear to score his second, may have been the product of Liverpool’s unremitting running. Perhaps physical tiredness brought mental fatigue. Goals were the result of intensity.“The tempo we put from the beginning was incredible, really incredible,” Klopp added. “There was no time to breathe. The opponent of the quality of Arsenal, you have to break somehow: break them physically.” As ever, Arsenal were broken at Anfield: perhaps not as badly as in the 4-0 and 5-1 eviscerations of their last two visits but to such an extent as to call into question Unai Emery’s claim that he feels “positive because the stature of the team is growing”.The concern is whether Liverpool will drain themselves in the process, sapping their strength through the intensity of their industry. “No, no,” Klopp countered. “We are well prepared. We use every second of pre-season to be ready. That is why we were so tired in pre-season. The human body doesn’t need eight weeks to come clear somehow, it’s not like this.”Mané has been a past scourge of Arsenal. On Saturday, Salah assumed that mantle, leaving the Gunners lamenting his spot-kick. “Maybe without that penalty it is different,” Emery added. “It killed the game,” said David Luiz, whose booking for his part in that incident deterred him from stopping Salah when he scored again: “You make a foul and put the team with 10 men, it is even worse.” Perhaps, for an Arsenal defender, Anfield embarrassment is a rite of passage. If the newcomer David Luiz was hired to alter that, he recognises change is needed. Arsenal have conceded 51 league goals in each of the last two campaigns. Brendan Rodgers’ Liverpool are the only team breached 50 times to finish in the top four in the last 17 seasons, though David Luiz suggested his ambitions are set higher than that.“If you concede a lot of goals you cannot fight for the title so this is one main thing we have to think about and try to reduce,” he added. “It is not just about me it is not just about the defenders. Now in modern football everybody defends when they don’t have the ball and everybody attacks when they do have the ball.”That has certainly been Klopp’s ethos, with the gegenpressing Roberto Firmino doubling up as the first line of the defence, the two most creative full-backs in Europe and Joël Matip having scored two goals before the end of August. That intensity has resolved the identity crisis of the Liverpool Klopp inherited. “The intention was to be us,” Klopp added. “Just be us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4be72a72a2b6336ed0964b48e09a9ed8bd786ef4/99_139_2447_1468/master/2447.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d88569e39da49799cd7e1581f0ed5c4b","title":"tottenham lacking unity desire mauricio pochettino","story":"• Manager hits out after his side’s home defeat by Newcastle• Pochettino reluctant to talk about Christian EriksenMauricio Pochettino admitted that Tottenham are “far, far away” from the creation of the required togetherness as he lamented the lack of desire in their 1-0 home defeat by Newcastle.The manager has made plain his unhappiness at how the transfer window continues to be open in Spain and other major European leagues yet closed in England, saying that it leaves Spurs vulnerable to predatory approaches.The situation is most unsettling with regard to Christian Eriksen, who has said he is open to a new challenge – having entered the final year on his Spurs contract. Pochettino is fearful that a leading club could still attempt to prise Eriksen away before 2 September.Pochettino used Eriksen only as a second-half substitute against Newcastle and he was grilled about the player in his post-match press conference. Once again he could offer no assurances as to whether he would remain a Spurs player.“The problem is during the week, not when the competition arrives. This type of situation happens in the Premier League. That is why you need to create a very good dynamic and strong team bonding and, at the moment, that situation in our group is still far, far away. The group is still unsettled and we need to find solutions.Steve Bruce – for whom the win cut through the early season tension – said he had watched the climax to England’s dramatic Ashes victory over Australia before kick-off.“I don’t know what was more nervous – the last 10 minutes of the cricket or this,” the Newcastle manager said. “Ben Stokes can certainly play centre-half for us next week! A lot of the criticism has been unjust but the only thing you can do to quieten the storm is to find a performance and a result. Nobody gave us a hope in hell’s chance but the way we performed was great to see.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d12380c0d4bec6c1e864f1d9e579bc82a2b5f8b/0_895_8748_5251/master/8748.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcfde6be089faf64378c1a26fa0a476b","title":"my concrete jungle home in london","story":"A rundown old school has become a grand home to plants, birds, two dogs – and one artistWhen photographer Steph Wilson first stepped into the south London school that was to become her home, it was a sometime squat, dark and rundown, the walls black with mould. She shudders at the memory. Three years later she has turned it into a grand church to plantlife, an urban conservatory that appears illuminated by stage lights.Wilson moved in when she was 24, after the death of her father – “a bouncer, a drug dealer, an actor – oh, and he was in the SAS”. It was an investment her family bought the place both as a home for Wilson and her many pets, and for the studio space, which she rents out for fashion shoots. The light is extremely soft, the ceilings extremely high – the other potential buyer was a professional trampolinist.When she moved in she ripped up the lino, got rid of the mould, installed heating and a new kitchen, built an aviary for her 12 canaries and four Gouldian finches, another for the parrot, installed a tank for her goldfish and started to accumulate plants. Some came from Conservatory Archives in east London, some from friends, and some from Gumtree, including the cactus that had grown out of its previous home, and which she had to lop a branch off of in order to get it through the door.It’s beneath the hanging baskets, in her living room – “my colonial-style hotel lobby” – that Wilson sits on the antique three-piece suite (“I got everything from Newark antiques fair – all my furniture came to less than the price of my mattress”) with her two dogs, and watches sunlight stream through the glass ceiling. “The grand finale is when the afternoon sun hits the large canvas of cadmium red I hung over the dining table,” she sighs happily. In the back room beside a deep blue sofa, an antique armoire offers a pedestal for her miniature cacti, and some sprout cheekily from the drawers. Every surface contains a jumble of vintage planters containing the next generation of plantlife, pictures and boxes of birdseed.At the other end of the space is the kitchen, where a lone frond of ivy whispers its way towards the hob. Open shelves display a jumble of teapots and cups. The dark green cabinets, made bespoke by Naked Kitchens, reflect her jungle of plantlife, as do the 1970s tiles in the bathroom, laid in the palest of pink walls. A vast studio to the right of the front door is strewn with her canvases and the props from a recent photoshoot.Yet there is not a great deal of art on Wilson’s walls instead, the focus is on the greenery that, as you walk through the cavernous house, feels less like a collection of pot plants and more like pets, or sculptures, or stragglers from a very good party. Beneath the white staircase stands a well-used piano, and the steps above hang with dried flowers. Upstairs are two bedrooms, where leaves tumble from the ceiling. “My most pathetic pleasure was finding a bedspread that matched the plant.”A tea towel-sized private garden is tended sporadically by her mum, and it opens on to a vast communal lawn, shared by a close collection of neighbours, who live in separate buildings that once made up the school. Though a minute’s walk from the front door, the screech and rush of the high street feels far away. Living here, Wilson says, has taught her she’s “good at keeping things alive”. Including, it turns out, herself. She used to suffer badly from anxiety and panic attacks: there was a period, in a previous home, when she couldn’t leave the house. But here, she says: “I’ve created a pod away from anxiety. It’s rooted in escape. All my friends come round and say they’re cured by lying on my rug. The birds are a living lava lamp.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37e330a6f01a0cef623f4bc84eed989b3aa48070/0_136_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc8012ad9050759fa24e08a8bd8b712d","title":"dear mariella frostrup all my friends have babies","story":"It’s hard when you don’t move in unison with your peers. It doesn’t mean abandoning friendships, says Mariella Frostrup, but don’t be afraid to keep a distance when neededThe dilemma I’m 34 and have been in a close friendship group with four other women since university. Our relationship has been a constant comfort, but during the past year I’ve found it incredibly difficult to connect with them as all four have had babies. Suddenly our WhatsApp group looks more like Mumsnet – and I just can’t relate. I don’t know if I want kids or not. My husband puts no pressure on me, but this is bringing out the worst in me. I feel left behind, confused and judgmental as these friends enter motherhood. I feel isolated and incapable of contributing, and when I do I feel disingenuous. I try to widen the conversation, but it always reverts back to babies. I don’t want to lose these people, but I feel marginalised, as if I’m fundamentally missing out on some intensely female purpose. How do I step back without being overly dramatic?Mariella replies It’s definitely a problem. I am sympathetic. But stick with me first, because I have to draw attention to how emotionally over-sensitised we’ve become as a species. Growing up, friends shacking up before we do, marriages and orce, babies born and infidelities committed – they’re all part of life’s rich pageant. Some are profoundly upsetting, some manageably so, and others so natural a part of life’s flow that they should barely bother us at all. Some of these emotional traumas are dumped on us, some committed by us and some are not directed at us at all. In the latter case, it’s generally our own unresolved issues that make us vulnerable to being wounded.Moving in unison with our peer group through formative experiences is something we generally leave behind in late adolescence or, at latest, post-college when we erge on to more inidual paths. In childhood, many of our compulsions are the result of instinct rather than inidual choice. The reason Harry Enfield’s sketch about taciturn Kevin entering his teens is so hilarious is that it’s universal. Each and every child will experience similar antisocial and easy-to-caricature hormonal impulses as they segue from childhood to adulthood.Later, when we “mature”, what we choose, rather than societal expectations, shapes our life as we branch off from friends and family in myriad directions. At a certain point we all have to ersify, embark on independent lives and try to make a good life for ourselves.Having teens, as I do, is a reminder of that early impulse to move as one through the world with our peer group. Everyone is trying to look the same, act the same, they listen to the same music, wear the same clothes and have the same hairstyles. As we become iniduals, with our own ideas and beliefs, insecurities and intolerances, we are released from the bondage of fitting in. You’ve reached just such a stage when adult friends are moving into the next phase of their lives, whether that’s defined by career choices, political beliefs, relationship commitments or, indeed, becoming parents.What you’re entirely right about is that the latter, parenting, initially makes bores of us all. To be in their proximity in the early days requires remarkable tolerance and discipline not to scream out: “Yes it’s a blinking baby… so what!”Becoming a parent is such an all-consuming activity, certainly initially, that most of us do become baby bores – and that’s hard to be around if you haven’t succumbed to procreational impulses. You say you’re not sure whether or not you want children and that’s a choice for you and your husband alone. It may be that you’re just not ready to go down that path, or that parenting simply isn’t for you – so to remain vulnerable to damage from the choices of those around you is unsustainable.My sneaking suspicion is that it’s not your friends’ choices to have babies that’s bothering you but your own lack of clarity on the issue. Bruce Springsteen’s promise in love is equally apt in enduring friendship: “I’ll wait for you, And should I fall behind, Wait for me.” Those we rely on and love will all drift from our immediate grasp at some point and the ebb and flow of friendships and relationships is as natural a cycle as waves on the shore. To fully realise our own lives, we need to branch out and step back, surge forward and move sideways – and for all of us that’s an inidual path complete with distractions and decisions.While your friends are immersed in parenthood and you are trying to decide, don’t be afraid to set your boundaries. Be the occasional voice of reason bringing the wider world into your WhatsApp group, even if you keep yourself at arm’s length. It won’t be long before life leads you back into step, or the road you choose takes you far away into different more stimulating territory.Occupy at least some of the time while your friends are preoccupied by thinking hard about what you want out of your life (and less about what they are doing with theirs). Friends are friends, even when our experiences are at odds, so it’s an imperative life skill to develop resilience and patience for the moments when you slip apart."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7c23a0a1cfa14e14e7580c5976d5ad4d12ba327/0_218_6552_3931/master/6552.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9cdfe5979b990d9625d2e1b051797d6","title":"my life better stopped keeping phone by bed","story":"When I couldn’t sleep, I would turn to my mobile for a portal into another world. But there were definite downsides to scanning Instagram in the early hoursWhen I was a kid, I thought that monsters came out of the dark. Turns out, they actually come out of the light. Like you, I run my life on the supercomputer in my pocket. At night I would place it under the pillow and struggle to put it out of mind, its bright screen a portal to other worlds.Sure, most of Twitter is bile, but social media suits my exhibitionist spirit I want to be front and centre of whatever conversations are happening. As a journalist, I am meant to be. When I said I wanted to get my phone out of my bedroom, a colleague half-jokingly asked : “What if something happens?”So I read when I should have slept. I read funny takes on the latest meme. I read takedowns of Donald Trump’s latest outburst. I read people I thought I respected making excuses for cruelty as casually as cruelty seems to be creeping into public life. I read sombre updates on fresh tragedies. I did not see the link between bingeing on horror and not sleeping.Your 30s are hard, with increasing responsibilities. Everyone else deals with it, why can’t you? These thoughts whirred round my brain as I stared up at the ceiling, sensing my heart rate rising the more I wondered why I was still awake. When deep breathing didn’t work, I would turn to the phone under my pillow. No new emails, hardly any new tweets except from Americans. So I’d go on Instagram, where I felt sad as I followed others living their best lives without me.My first attempts to sleep better meant keeping the phone close. I downloaded an app of soothing noises, listened to a crackling fire through headphones and, when this didn’t work, turned it to full volume, which your phone warns can damage hearing. It makes as much sense as deciding that, because a campfire isn’t warm enough, you should put your face on it.I went into work and felt my eyes drooping at 11am. I took caffeine tablets and got on with it.Soon after, I was sitting in a gallery cafe with my mum and sister, dreading another year when I felt like I hadn’t done a great job of the last one. I explained that I wanted to be rid of the phone but I needed its one unarguably crucial function: the alarm. My sister disappeared to “go to the bathroom” and two days later I unwrapped a retro alarm clock from the gallery shop.At home, I slapped in the AAA battery, set the time and wound the alarm hand round to 6am. That was it. My iPhone is more powerful than Apollo 11 and made things worse: how was this going to help? But the difference was immediate. That night I left the phone on my living room sofa, wondering whether I would last the night without coming to get it. I went to bed. I remember nothing of what happened next. I must have fallen asleep too quickly.Since then, I have slept fine. The phone’s absence is soothing. Despite still feeling stress, I have not yet felt I have to get my phone in the middle of the night and bring the world rushing in to stave off bad thoughts. I have even slept through my triggers for not sleeping, like going to bed less than seven hours before when I have to get up, which used to lead to me lying awake reflecting how I could no longer get seven hours’ sleep.My weekly swim is no longer a desperate attempt to tire myself out. I read a book in a week after reading 12 in seven months. Now the pillow next to mine is strewn with magazines. I love the serendipity of finding something I want to read within something small someone else has curated. You can’t curate the whole internet.The alarm clock, with its single purpose, has started to feel like a neighbour who always helps with that one task you dread. It is familiar, safe – something that my phone never was. Pushing down the big button on top to silence the alarm is more satisfying than any of the millions of times I have tweeted, emailed or Googled. The clock never moves. It just sits there, offering me the smallest gesture of control and stability.I still love my phone. In the mornings, there is more to catch up on after a break and, I hope, less risk of alarming others by watching their Instagram story within seconds of them posting it. One night, Twitter users started joking about “feral hogs”. Seven hours later, they were still going, and I doubt following it live helped anyone understand why. I belatedly joined in and then went to work.The alarm clock helped me learn to accept that the world continues to turn without me. It is not a portal to another world, it is a reminder to wake up and live in this one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83802285cf32c99e68f311fc1ab9f4f32d2fd2c1/1449_62_13122_7873/master/13122.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44d1476f0b0bb3db26d1949977be9f79","title":"taylor swift pop music hunger games gladiators","story":"The singer spills on feuds, fame, failure – and why she’s taking on TrumpTaylor Swift’s Nashville apartment is an Etsy fever dream, a 365-days-a-year Christmas shop, pure teenage girl id. You enter through a vestibule clad in blue velvet and covered in gilt frames bursting with fake flowers. The ceiling is painted like the night sky. Above a koi pond in the living area, a narrow staircase spirals six feet up towards a giant, pillow-lagged birdcage that probably has the best view in the city. Later, Swift will tell me she needs metaphors “to understand anything that happens to me”, and the birdcage defies you not to interpret it as a pointed comment on the contradictions of stardom.Swift, wearing pale jeans and dip-dyed shirt, her sandy hair tied in a blue scrunchie, leads the way up the staircase to show me the view. The decor hasn’t changed since she bought this place in 2009, when she was 19. “All of these high rises are new since then,” she says, gesturing at the squat glass structures and cranes. Meanwhile her oven is still covered in stickers, more teenage diary than adult appliance.Now 29, she has spent much of the past three years living quietly in London with her boyfriend, actor Joe Alwyn, making the penthouse a kind of time capsule, a monument to youthful naivety given an unlimited budget – the years when she sang about Romeo and Juliet and wore ballgowns to awards shows before she moved to New York and honed her slick, self-mythologising pop.It is mid-August. This is Swift’s first UK interview in more than three years, and she seems nervous: neither presidential nor goofy (her usual defaults), but quick with a tongue-out “ugh” of regret or frustration as she picks at her glittery purple nails. We climb down from the birdcage to sit by the pond, and when the conversation turns to 2016, the year the wheels came off for her, Swift stiffens as if driving over a mile of speed bumps. After a series of bruising public spats (with Katy Perry, Nicki Minaj) in 2015, there was a high-profile standoff with Kanye West. The news that she was in a relationship with actor Tom Hiddleston, which leaked soon after, was widely dismissed as a ersionary tactic. Meanwhile, Swift went to court to prosecute a sexual assault claim, and faced a furious backlash when she failed to endorse a candidate in the 2016 presidential election, allowing the alt-right to adopt her as their “Aryan princess”.Her critics assumed she cared only about the bottom line. The reality, Swift says, is that she was totally broken. “Every domino fell,” she says bitterly. “It became really terrifying for anyone to even know where I was. And I felt completely incapable of doing or saying anything publicly, at all. Even about my music. I always said I wouldn’t talk about what was happening personally, because that was a personal time.” She won’t get into specifics. “I just need some things that are mine,” she despairs. “Just some things.”A year later, in 2017, Swift released her album Reputation, half high-camp heel turn, drawing on hip-hop and vaudeville (the brilliantly hammy Look What You Made Me Do), half stunned appreciation that her nascent relationship with Alwyn had weathered the storm (the soft, sensual pop of songs Delicate and Dress).Her new album, Lover, her seventh, was released yesterday. It’s much lighter than Reputation: Swift likens writing it to feeling like “I could take a full deep breath again”. Much of it is about Alwyn: the Galway Girl-ish track London Boy lists their favourite city haunts and her newfound appreciation of watching rugby in the pub with his uni mates on the ruminative Afterglow, she asks him to forgive her anxious tendency to assume the worst.While she has always written about relationships, they were either teenage fantasy or a postmortem on a high-profile breakup, with exes such as Jake Gyllenhaal and Harry Styles. But she and Alwyn have seldom been pictured together, and their relationship is the only other thing she won’t talk about. “I’ve learned that if I do, people think it’s up for discussion, and our relationship isn’t up for discussion,” she says, laughing after I attempt a stealthy angle. “If you and I were having a glass of wine right now, we’d be talking about it – but it’s just that it goes out into the world. That’s where the boundary is, and that’s where my life has become manageable. I really want to keep it feeling manageable.”Meanwhile, her recent single You Need To Calm Down admonished homophobes and namechecked US LGBTQ rights organisation Glaad (which then saw increased donations). Swift filled her video with cameos from queer stars such as Ellen DeGeneres and Queen singer Adam Lambert, and capped it with a call to sign her petition in support of the Equality Act, which if passed would prohibit gender- and sexuality-based discrimination in the US. A video of Polish LGBTQ fans miming the track in defiance of their government’s homophobic agenda went viral. But Swift was accused of “queerbaiting” and bandwagon-jumping. You can see how she might find it hard to work out what, exactly, people want from her.It was girlhood that made Swift a multimillionaire. When country music’s gatekeepers swore that housewives were the only women interested in the genre, she proved them wrong. Her self-titled debut marked the longest stay on the Billboard 200 by any album released in the decade. A potentially cloying image – corkscrew curls, lyrics thick on “daddy” and down-home values – were undercut by the fact she was evidently, endearingly, a bit of a freak, an unusual combination of intensity and artlessness. Also, she was really, really good at what she did, and not just for a teenager: her entirely self-written third album, 2010’s Speak Now, is unmatched in its devastatingly withering dismissals of awful men.She describes the way she burned bridges in 2016 as a kind of obliviousness. “I didn’t realise it was like a classic overthrow of someone in power – where you didn’t realise the whispers behind your back, you didn’t realise the chain reaction of events that was going to make everything fall apart at the exact, perfect time for it to fall apart.”Here’s that chain reaction in full. With her 2014 album 1989 (the year she was born), Swift transcended country stardom, becoming as ubiquitous as Beyoncé. For the first time she vocally embraced feminism, something she had rejected in her teens but, after a while, it seemed to amount to not much more than a lot of pictures of her hanging out with her “squad”, a bevy of supermodels, musicians and Lena Dunham. The squad very much did not include her former friend Katy Perry, whom Swift targeted in her song Bad Blood, as part of what seemed like a painfully overblown dispute about some backing dancers. Then, when Nicki Minaj tweeted that MTV’s 2015 Video Music awards had rewarded white women at the expense of women of colour, multiple-nominee Swift took it personally, responding: “Maybe one of the men took your slot.” For someone prone to talking about the haters, she quickly became her own worst enemy.Her old adversary Kanye West resurfaced in February 2016. In 2009, West had invaded Swift’s stage at the MTV VMAs to protest against her victory over Beyoncé in the female video of the year category. It remains the peak of interest in Swift on Google Trends, and the conflict between them has become such a cornerstone of celebrity journalism that it’s hard to remember it lay dormant for nearly seven years – until West released his song Famous. “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex,” he rapped. “Why? I made that bitch famous.” The video depicted a Swift mannequin naked in bed with men including Trump.Swift loudly condemned both although she had discussed the track with West, she said she had never agreed to the “bitch” lyric or the video. West’s wife, Kim Kardashian, released a heavily edited clip that showed Swift at least agreeing to the “sex” line on the phone with West, if not the “bitch” part. Swift pleaded the technicality, but it made no difference: when Kardashian went on Twitter to describe her as a snake, the comparison stuck and the singer found herself very publicly “cancelled” – the incident taken as “proof” of Swift’s insincerity. So she went away.Swift says she stopped trying to explain herself, even though she “definitely” could have. As she worked on Reputation, she was also writing “a think-piece a day that I knew I would never publish: the stuff I would say, and the different facets of the situation that nobody knew”. If she could exonerate herself, why didn’t she? She leans forward. “Here’s why,” she says conspiratorially. “Because when people are in a hate frenzy and they find something to mutually hate together, it bonds them. And anything you say is in an echo chamber of mockery.”She compares that year to being hit by a tidal wave. “You can either stand there and let the wave crash into you, and you can try as hard as you can to fight something that’s more powerful and bigger than you,” she says. “Or you can e under the water, hold your breath, wait for it to pass and while you’re down there, try to learn something. Why was I in that part of the ocean? There were clearly signs that said: Rip tide! Undertow! Don’t swim! There are no lifeguards!” She’s on a roll. “Why was I there? Why was I trusting people I trusted? Why was I letting people into my life the way I was letting them in? What was I doing that caused this?”After the incident with Minaj, her critics started pointing out a narrative of “white victimhood” in Swift’s career. Speaking slowly and carefully, she says she came to understand “a lot about how my privilege allowed me to not have to learn about white privilege. I didn’t know about it as a kid, and that is privilege itself, you know? And that’s something that I’m still trying to educate myself on every day. How can I see where people are coming from, and understand the pain that comes with the history of our world?” She also accepts some responsibility for her overexposure, and for some of the tabloid drama. If she didn’t wish a friend happy birthday on Instagram, there would be reports about severed friendships, even if they had celebrated together. “Because we didn’t post about it, it didn’t happen – and I realised I had done that,” she says. “I created an expectation that everything in my life that happened, people would see.”But she also says she couldn’t win. “I’m kinda used to being gaslit by now,” she drawls wearily. “And I think it happens to women so often that, as we get older and see how the world works, we’re able to see through what is gaslighting. So I’m able to look at 1989 and go – KITTIES!” She breaks off as an assistant walks in with Swift’s three beloved cats, stars of her Instagram feed, back from the vet before they fly to England this week. Benjamin, Olivia and Meredith haughtily circle our feet (they are scared of the koi) as Swift resumes her train of thought, back to the release of 1989 and the subsequent fallout. “Oh my God, they were mad at me for smiling a lot and quote-unquote acting fake. And then they were mad at me that I was upset and bitter and kicking back.” The rules kept changing.Swift’s new album comes with printed excerpts from her diaries. On 29 August 2016, she wrote in her girlish, bubble writing: “This summer is the apocalypse.” As the incident with West and Kardashian unfolded, she was preparing for her court case against radio DJ David Mueller, who was fired in 2013 after Swift reported him for putting his hand up her dress at a meet-and–greet event. He sued her for defamation she countersued for sexual assault.“Having dealt with a few of them, narcissists basically subscribe to a belief system that they should be able to do and say whatever the hell they want, whenever the hell they want to,” Swift says now, talking at full pelt. “And if we – as anyone else in the world, but specifically women – react to that, well, we’re not allowed to. We’re not allowed to have a reaction to their actions.”In summer 2016 she was in legal depositions, practising her testimony. “You’re supposed to be really polite to everyone,” she says. But by the time she got to court in August 2017, “something snapped, I think”. She laughs. Her testimony was sharp and uncompromising. She refused to allow Mueller’s lawyers to blame her or her security guards when asked if she could see the incident, Swift said no, because “my ass is in the back of my body”. It was a brilliant, rude defence.“You’re supposed to behave yourself in court and say ‘rear end’,” she says with mock politesse. “The other lawyer was saying, ‘When did he touch your backside?’ And I was like, ‘ASS! Call it what it is!’” She claps between each word. But despite the acclaim for her testimony and eventual victory (she asked for one symbolic dollar), she still felt belittled. It was two months prior to the beginning of the #MeToo movement. “Even this case was literally twisted so hard that people were calling it the ‘butt-grab case’. They were saying I sued him because there’s this narrative that I want to sue everyone. That was one of the reasons why the summer was the apocalypse.”She never wanted the assault to be made public. Have there been other instances she has dealt with privately? “Actually, no,” she says soberly. “I’m really lucky that it hadn’t happened to me before. But that was one of the reasons it was so traumatising. I just didn’t know that could happen. It was really brazen, in front of seven people.” She has since had security cameras installed at every meet-and-greet she does, deliberately pointed at her lower half. “If something happens again, we can prove it with video footage from every angle,” she says.The allegations about Harvey Weinstein came out soon after she won her case. The film producer had asked her to write a song for the romantic comedy One Chance, which earned her second Golden Globe nomination. Weinstein also got her a supporting role in the 2014 sci-fi movie The Giver, and attended the launch party for 1989. But she says they were never alone together.“He’d call my management and be like, ‘Does she have a song for this film?’ And I’d be like, ‘Here it is,’” she says dispassionately. “And then I’d be at the Golden Globes. I absolutely never hung out. And I would get a vibe – I would never vouch for him. I believe women who come forward, I believe victims who come forward, I believe men who come forward.” Swift inhales, flustered. She says Weinstein never propositioned her. “If you listen to the stories, he picked people who were vulnerable, in his opinion. It seemed like it was a power thing. So, to me, that doesn’t say anything – that I wasn’t in that situation.”Meanwhile, Donald Trump was more than nine months into his presidency, and still Swift had not taken a position. But the idea that a pop star could ever have impeded his path to the White House seemed increasingly naive. In hindsight, the demand that Swift speak up looks less about politics and more about her identity (white, rich, powerful) and a moralistic need for her to redeem herself – as if nobody else had ever acted on a vindictive instinct, or blundered publicly.But she resisted what might have been an easy return to public favour. Although Reputation contained softer love songs, it was better known for its brittle, vengeful side (see This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things). She describes that side of the album now as a “bit of a persona”, and its hip-hop-influenced production as “a complete defence mechanism”. Personally, I thought she had never been more relatable, trashing the contract of pious relatability that traps young women in the public eye.It was the assault trial, and watching the rights of LGBTQ friends be eroded, that finally politicised her, Swift says. “The things that happen to you in your life are what develop your political opinions. I was living in this Obama eight-year paradise of, you go, you cast your vote, the person you vote for wins, everyone’s happy!” she says. “This whole thing, the last three, four years, it completely blindsided a lot of us, me included.”She recently said she was “dismayed” when a friend pointed out that her position on gay rights wasn’t obvious (what if she had a gay son, he asked), hence this summer’s course correction with the single You Need To Calm Down (“You’re comin’ at my friends like a missileWhy are you mad?When you could be GLAAD?”). Didn’t she feel equally dismayed that her politics weren’t clear? “I did,” she insists, “and I hate to admit this, but I felt that I wasn’t educated enough on it. Because I hadn’t actively tried to learn about politics in a way that I felt was necessary for me, making statements that go out to hundreds of millions of people.”She explains her inner conflict. “I come from country music. The number one thing they absolutely drill into you as a country artist, and you can ask any other country artist this, is ‘Don’t be like the Dixie Chicks!’” In 2003, the Texan country trio denounced the Iraq war, saying they were “ashamed” to share a home state with George W Bush. There was a boycott, and an event where a bulldozer crushed their CDs. “I watched country music snuff that candle out. The most amazing group we had, just because they talked about politics. And they were getting death threats. They were made such an example that basically every country artist that came after that, every label tells you, ‘Just do not get involved, no matter what.’“And then, you know, if there was a time for me to get involved…” Swift pauses. “The worst part of the timing of what happened in 2016 was I felt completely voiceless. I just felt like, oh God, who would want me? Honestly.” She would otherwise have endorsed Hillary Clinton? “Of course,” she says sincerely. “I just felt completely, ugh, just useless. And maybe even like a hindrance.”I suggest that, thinking selfishly, her coming out for Clinton might have made people like her. “I wasn’t thinking like that,” she stresses. “I was just trying to protect my mental health – not read the news very much, go cast my vote, tell people to vote. I just knew what I could handle and I knew what I couldn’t. I was literally about to break. For a while.” Did she seek therapy? “That stuff I just really wanna keep personal, if that’s OK,” she says.She resists blaming anyone else for her political silence. Her emergence as a Democrat came after she left Big Machine, the label she signed to at 15. (They are now at loggerheads after label head Scott Borchetta sold the company, and the rights to Swift’s first six albums, to Kanye West’s manager, Scooter Braun.) Had Borchetta ever advised her against speaking out? She exhales. “It was just me and my life, and also doing a lot of self-reflection about how I did feel really remorseful for not saying anything. I wanted to try and help in any way that I could, the next time I got a chance. I didn’t help, I didn’t feel capable of it – and as soon as I can, I’m going to.”Swift was once known for throwing extravagant 4 July parties at her Rhode Island mansion. The Instagram posts from these star-studded events – at which guests wore matching stars-and-stripes bikinis and onesies – probably supported a significant chunk of the celebrity news industry GDP. But in 2017, they stopped. “The horror!” wrote Cosmopolitan, citing “reasons that remain a mystery” for their disappearance. It wasn’t “squad” strife or the unavailability of matching cozzies that brought the parties to an end, but Swift’s disillusionment with her country, she says.There is a smart song about this on the new album – the track that should have been the first single, instead of the cartoonish ME!. Miss Americana And The Heartbreak Prince is a forlorn, gothic ballad in the vein of Lana Del Rey that uses high-school imagery to dismantle American nationalism: “The whole school is rolling fake diceYou play stupid gamesYou win stupid prizes,” she sings with disdain. “Boys will be boys thenWhere are the wise men?”As an ambitious 11-year-old, she worked out that singing the national anthem at sports games was the quickest way to get in front of a large audience. When did she start feeling conflicted about what America stands for? She gives another emphatic ugh. “It was the fact that all the dirtiest tricks in the book were used and it worked,” she says. “The thing I can’t get over right now is gaslighting the American public into being like” – she adopts a sanctimonious tone – “‘If you hate the president, you hate America.’ We’re a democracy – at least, we’re supposed to be – where you’re allowed to disagree, dissent, debate.” She doesn’t use Trump’s name. “I really think that he thinks this is an autocracy.”As we speak, Tennessee lawmakers are trying to impose a near-total ban on abortion. Swift has staunchly defended her “Tennessee values” in recent months. What’s her position? “I mean, obviously, I’m pro-choice, and I just can’t believe this is happening,” she says. She looks close to tears. “I can’t believe we’re here. It’s really shocking and awful. And I just wanna do everything I can for 2020. I wanna figure out exactly how I can help, what are the most effective ways to help. ’Cause this is just…” She sighs again. “This is not it.”It is easy to forget that the point of all this is that a teenage Taylor Swift wanted to write love songs. Nemeses and negativity are now so entrenched in her public persona that it’s hard to know how she can get back to that, though she seems to want to. At the end of Daylight, the new album’s dreamy final song, there’s a spoken-word section: “I want to be defined by the things that I love,” she says as the music fades. “Not the things that I hate, not the things I’m afraid of, the things that haunt me in the middle of the night.” As well as the songs written for Alwyn, there is one for her mother, who recently experienced a cancer relapse: “You make the best of a bad dealI just pretend it isn’t real,” Swift sings, backed by the Dixie Chicks.How does writing about her personal life work if she’s setting clearer boundaries? “It actually made me feel more free,” she says. “I’ve always had this habit of never really going into detail about exactly what situation inspired what thing, but even more so now.” This is only half true: in the past, Swift wasn’t shy of a level of detail that invited fans to figure out specific truths about her relationships. And when I tell her that Lover feels a more emotionally guarded album, she bristles. “I know the difference between making art and living your life like a reality star,” she says. “And then even if it’s hard for other people to grasp, my definition is really clear.”Even so, Swift begins Lover by addressing an adversary, opening with a song called I Forgot That You Existed (“it isn’t love, it isn’t hate, it’s just indifference”), presumably aimed at Kanye West, a track that slightly defeats its premise by existing. But it sweeps aside old dramas to confront Swift’s real nemesis, herself. “I never grew upIt’s getting so old,” she laments on The Archer. She has had to learn not to pre-empt disaster, nor to run from it. Her life has been defined by relationships, friendships and business relationships that started and ended very publicly (though she and Perry are friends again). At the same time, the rules around celebrity engagement have evolved beyond recognition in her 15 years of fame. Rather than trying to adapt to them, she’s now asking herself: “How do you learn to maintain? How do you learn not to have these phantom disasters in your head that you play out, and how do you stop yourself from sabotage – because the panic mechanism in your brain is telling you that something must go wrong.” For her, this is what growing up is. “You can’t just make cut-and-dry decisions in life. A lot of things are a negotiation and a grey area and a dance of how to figure it out.”And so this time, Swift is sticking around. In December she will turn 30, marking the point after which more than half her life will have been lived in public. She’ll start her new decade with a stronger self-preservationist streak, and a looser grip (as well as a cameo in Cats). “You can’t micromanage life, it turns out,” she says, drily.When Swift finally answered my question about the moment she would choose in the VH1 Behind The Music episode about herself, the one where her career turned, she said she hoped it wouldn’t focus on her “apocalypse” summer of 2016. “Maybe this is wishful thinking,” she said, “but I’d like to think it would be in a couple of years.” It’s funny to hear her hope that the worst is still to come while sitting in her fairytale living room, the cats pacing: a pragmatist at odds with her romantic monument to teenage dreams.

Some have faced disciplinary action and many have been forced to take time off, while others have sold their homes so they can afford to work part-time or stop working altogether.The Labour MP Carolyn Harris said: “You wouldn’t dream of having a workplace where people weren’t entitled to certain things because they were pregnant, and it’s exactly the same for women with the menopause. I firmly believe there should be legislation to make sure every workplace has a menopause policy, just like they have a maternity policy.”The often unspoken impact of menopause on women at work has become a cross-party issue. The Conservative MP Rachel Maclean was the first to speak out about it in the House of Commons and has been campaigning to normalise menopause as a workplace issue.She said she wants women to be able to have time off or change shift patterns or conditions of work when they need relief from symptoms that often go well beyond the stereotypical hot flushes and night sweats.The menopause is a natural part of ageing and usually occurs between 45 and 55 years of age after levels of the hormone oestrogen have declined to the point where ovulation and menstruation stop. It is defined as a woman going 12 months without a period. In the UK, the average age for a woman to reach the menopause is 52. However, about one in 100 women have their menopause before the age of 40.Common symptoms can include hot flushes, night sweats, vaginal dryness and discomfort during sex, a reduced sex drive, low moods or anxiety and difficulty sleeping. Memory and concentration can also be affected.\u0026nbsp“I absolutely agree that employers need to do more. It’s not well understood,” Maclean said. “Employees don’t get the support they need. It is very difficult for women at work often.” She said she had heard many “horrific and heart-rending” accounts.“My central message is: menopause is the last taboo because it is still hidden and it only affects women and it only affects older women. It’s ageism, it’s sexism, all rolled into one.”Harris said she believed that if legislation was required, it would be passed by MPs. There was “tremendous support” across the benches when the house debated the issue recently, “especially from men whose wives have been through it. They understand.”Harris told of going to see a GP in 2010 after she had treatment for a gynaecological condition. “I was having a nervous breakdown,” she said. “I was really depressed and had mental health issues. I think that’s down to the fact I was going through the menopause. So many women end up on antidepressants or being told to pull themselves together.”Amanda Griffiths, a professor of occupational health psychology at the University of Nottingham who has done substantial research on the impact of the menopause on working women, said it had “quite a significant impact” on the personal and professional lives of up to a quarter of women.She said women made up an increasing proportion of the ageing workforce. “For me there is a big issue here, which is not just about women having problems with menopause. It is about managers understanding it is perfectly normal for us to have health problems,” she said.There needed to be an atmosphere at work where people could talk about health, she said, “instead of which we tend to have this fear in some organisations that if we have a health condition there will be some sort of stigma attached to i”.Two separate surveys of women going through the menopause and perimenopause – the time leading up to when ovulation stops – found they were struggling in work and felt unsupported by managers.Just over half had taken time off sick, and one in 10 had missed more than eight weeks of work.A separate survey by the shop workers’ union Usdaw found that one in five women had taken time off work and that more than half did not feel able to approach their managers if they were suffering.In the Newson Health survey, more than a third said their employer did not offer any kind of discussion group, awareness session or training on the subject of menopause, despite there being more than 5 million working women aged between 45 and 60.Dr Rebecca Lewis, a GP who works at Newson Health, said: “Women are suffering quietly for fear of saying ‘it’s the menopause’ and being laughed at and told to get on with it.“A GP might not think to put it down, or the woman might not want it put down because of a feeling that it’s not a ‘proper’ illness.”Sue Hackett, the London regional equality officer at the GMB union, said: “It is high time we stop treating menstruation and menopause as taboo subjects. Women have put up with insulting comments and a woeful lack of provision for far too long for what is a completely natural condition.”She said workplace policies around sickness absence or performance management could unfairly penalise women “because of key symptoms like memory loss or lack of concentration”.Unions said there were examples of good practice in workplaces. In 2017, Nottinghamshire police introduced a menopause policy and issued guidance to managers saying they could consider requests from women who needed to adjust their uniform or their working hours.Among other practical support, it recommended access to private areas where women could “rest temporarily, cry or talk with a colleague before they can return to their workspace”.The Welsh government has put in place guidance for its workers. It said: “All reasonable adjustments will be considered when a health issue may be impacting on a person’s ability to carry out their role – this can include changing working location or conditions for a more comfortable working life.”Last year an employment tribunal judge found in favour of Mandy Davies, a court officer working for the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service who was dismissed after an incident involving medication she was taking.Davies alleged that under the 2010 Equality Act she had been unfairly dismissed and discriminated against as a result of a disability.The tribunal heard how she had been suffering from symptoms including heavy bleeding, memory loss and confusion, and that she had previously had a 20-year unblemished employment record.Her employer accepted that the menopause was a disability, but argued it had not unfairly dismissed her as a consequence, a position the judge did not accept, ruling that she should be reinstated and paid £14,000.The court service is appealing against the decision."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d19df985060b01b2aa77af69e64d0686de3432ab/0_52_5166_3100/master/5166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4c61a12dddafe4eb697a446fdf0307b","title":"helping nine year old eating disorder recovery podcast","story":"We hear about the importance of early intervention in rare cases of pre-teen eating disorders.

So, too, the World Cup final in July, as Ian Botham’s incredible exploits of 38 years ago have been matched, maybe surpassed. But on a day like this who cares about rankings anyway? Ben Stokes produced the innings of a lifetime to snatch a one-wicket victory, which keeps the Ashes alive and the game alive, while threatening to cause multiple heart failures among those lucky enough to witness this contest.A few figures: England, bowled out for 67 in the first innings, achieved their highest-ever winning total by scoring 362 for nine at this unlikely theatre of dreams on the other side of the Pennines from Old Trafford. The last-wicket partnership – somehow unbroken – between Jack Leach and Stokes was worth 76. Stokes finished, most definitely unbeaten, on 135, which included eight sixes he had 61 when Leach made his way to the crease.But beyond the figures was astounding melodrama and we have to start near the end. It defied belief that England had reached 351 for nine when the Australia captain, Tim Paine – who, like his counterpart Kim Hughes all those years ago, had every reason to believe that this match had already been decided – tossed the ball to Nathan Lyon. Stokes was on strike with eight runs needed for victory. He cut the first two deliveries to distant fielders and declined to run, following the pattern of what was already a stunning partnership.The third ball from Lyon was fuller and Stokes swung. He did not quite time it perfectly but he does not have to. At long-off Marnus Labuschagne circled at the bowler’s end Lyon squinted towards the boundary, urging the ball to stay in play. By a metre or so it cleared the rope. For the first time in the match England were rock- solid favourites to win. One run would be sufficient for a tie, two for victory.Now the field came in. This must have felt claustrophobic for Stokes. For the previous hour the vast majority of the fielders had been stationed on the boundary when he was on strike. The next ball was cut by Stokes straight to one of the fielders now close enough to save the single. No matter there were two deliveries left and after his recent pyrotechnics surely Stokes would now deliver the final blow.Lyon fired in the next delivery and Stokes cut again. Leach started scrambling a run Stokes sent him back but it was clear as the throw from Pat Cummins headed towards Lyon that England’s valiant No 11 would be stranded. Home hearts sank until Lyon fumbled the ball, and the images of Australia’s 1999 World Cup semi-final against South Africa flashed past.One ball remained and Stokes decided to explore the legside this time. He slog-swept but missed. Lyon’s appeal was prolonged, suggesting an odd mix of desperation and confidence. Umpire Joel Wilson’s finger failed to appear but the realisation that the Australians were unable to ask for a review did come to light. They had wasted their last review against Leach in the previous over from Cummins (incidentally the solitary area in which England have been consistently superior in this series is in their use of DRS). The subsequent replay demonstrated that Stokes would have been out if it had been possible to review the decision.After that it was relatively plain sailing. Unusually, Leach was left on strike as Cummins ran in at the start of the next over. He ducked the first ball, defended the second and the third saw the ball trickle from his bat on the legside. Leach’s first run in the partnership had levelled the scores. In came Cummins again Stokes crashed the ball to the cover boundary and the most amazing Test match of all was over.There were one or two dramas before those final 10 deliveries. Even the first four overs of the day, which were all maidens, somehow added to the tension. The first single by Root was cheered to the skies and then England’s captain departed, superbly caught by David Warner off the inside edge and pad off the bowling of Lyon as he advanced down the pitch.Paine took the new ball as soon as it became available. It seemed the obvious thing to do yet it led to a sudden acceleration in the run rate. Jonny Bairstow was in skittish mood and two consecutive drives off Josh Hazlewood reached the offside boundary. Gradually, after hours of abstinence, Stokes began to find the odd boundary. The 50 partnership was posted inside 10 overs and as if in celebration Stokes lifted a legside delivery from Cummins into the stands.At lunch England, on 238 for four, might have been favourites, though this realisation did not seem to do them much good. They proceeded to lose five wickets for 48 runs after the interval with only Stokes looking in control – except on a few occasions when he was contemplating what constituted a run.Bairstow was caught in the slips for a very handy 36 then Jos Buttler was probably a victim of poor calling from Stokes. He was sent back too late as Travis Head hit the stumps, so there could be no reprieve of their World Cup final partnership. Chris Woakes, mindful that a bouncer barrage was on its way, was lodged on the back foot when driving at a rare full ball and was caught at mid-off. Jofra Archer swished three boundaries but was then well caught in the deep by Head and Stuart Broad was palpably lbw to his second delivery. 283 for nine. Ah well. It had been a good game.Now Leach, with his unassuming West Country gait, walked out to join Stokes with 73 runs needed for victory. Perhaps one or two despondent punters opted to beat the traffic at this point. Now Stokes switched from Denly mode to d’Artagnan. The fielders were spread far and wide but still he hit Lyon for two consecutive sixes, the second of which was the most preposterous switch-hit into the Western Terrace.He flicked a short ball from Cummins over his left shoulder for another brilliantly improvised six. Upon reaching his 100, the best of his career (he will have to live with that knowledge now – and it was far better than his 258 in Cape Town), he did not celebrate. That was not his goal.Next Stokes took 17 runs from a Hazlewood over, pull shots, drives and legside flicks, which magically just managed to keep finding or clearing the boundary. A half-chance flew to Marcus Harris at third man but he could not quite cling on as he ed forward. This was beyond Roy of the Rovers.Meanwhile, Leach ostensibly remained calm, despite the fact that his glasses kept steaming up. Hardly surprising.Amid the jubilation Leach could ponder that he had now won two matches for England with the bat in the surreal summer of 2019: 92 against Ireland, one not out against Australia. With due respect to Tim Murtagh and co, we all know which innings he will cherish the most."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f0c540eff8ce0e8ddc6c2cdecd83a1187a006fa/0_320_4441_2665/master/4441.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0bfacb49f78f7453a9641be2da4bcc81","title":"novak djokovic us open roger federer rafael nadal dan evans","story":"• Djokovic seeking to add to his 16 major wins • Evans handed tricky draw against MannarinoOnly a third-rate bookmaker or a dim-witted gambler would seriously imagine that Novak Djokovic is not a logical favourite to add a fourth US Open title to his collection of 16 majors this coming fortnight. Standing in his way are the usual suspects – Roger Federer, whom he outlasted in the Wimbledon final six weeks ago, who is on his side of the draw, and Rafael Nadal, perhaps, on the final day – although a lesser Spaniard, Roberto Carballés Baena, the world No 76, is unlikely to detain him long when they meet in the first round on Monday.After dodging questions about his American friend Justin Gimelstob, the world No 1 was in relaxed mood discussing his prospects of retaining his title and closing in on Federer’s 20 majors, as well as Nadal’s 18.“I have been blessed to play well on these courts, especially the Arthur Ashe,” he said when asked if his success against Federer at the tournament (4-2 overall) had anything to do with the surface or the schedule. “I have not lost too many matches in my career playing night sessions – and a lot of matches that I get to play in Arthur Ashe are night sessions. You adapt to it. You accept it. You embrace it.”Unfortunately Djokovic does not take the same attitude to the embarrassment of supporting Gimelstob, who has been eased from the main narrative in tennis after his conviction for misdemeanour assault last year. Both were among the architects of Chris Kermode’s removal as chief executive of the ATP in the spring, although the Londoner’s five-year tenure does not finish until the end of the year. There have been tense meetings here this week, with strong backing for Kermode among the tournament owners and several players, and a mixed response from the players’ council, where Djokovic is president, but which has been bolstered by the recent return of Federer and Nadal. There is mileage yet in a dispute whose real origins are difficult to fathom.Meanwhile the tournament will bring the season to fever pitch over the next two weeks, as it invariably does: noisy, hot and usually full of incident.Dan Evans embarks on his campaign without a coach after splitting with David Felgate recently, although he does not see it as a problem going into his first match, against the gifted French left-hander, Adrian Mannarino.“He’s not one of the top seeds but it’s a difficult draw,” he said, looking past Mannarino, who is one place ahead of him at 57 in the world rankings. “Plays well. Left-hander, obviously makes him a little trickier. I’m pretty happy with it.”As for parting with Felgate, Evans is happy to go it alone until he finds a suitable replacement – preferably a British coach not too far from his native Birmingham. He says they parted amicably after he lost recently in Washington. Leon Smith, who has done much to turn around his career as Great Britain’s Davis Cup captain, will be in his box here.“I definitely need someone,” he agreed, smiling. “If you could give me a list of British coaches who are decent, that would be helpful.”It would take more than a great coach, probably, to help Evans through a tough first week. If he beats Mannarino – who won their only match, on the grass of Queen’s last year – he faces another Frenchman: either the 20-year-old Corentin Moutet, who beat Grigor Dimitrov at Wimbledon and reached the third round of the French Open, or more likely Lucas Pouille, ranked 25.Then there is Federer, who beat him in three tight sets at the Australian Open. When Evans made an impressive run here five years ago, he was one win away from the fourth round, where his conqueror, Tommy Robredo, went on to beat Federer in a significant upset.On his last visit three years ago Evans came desperately close to beating Stan Wawrinka, who went on to beat Djokovic in the final. So success is not out of Evans’s reach – it is just one tough gig, as he acknowledges. “I obviously really like it here,” he says. “But it’s another new tournament. I’ll just try to get through this first round.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebd834ee7815d19a9c15887c3a6d8e9656410f8c/0_110_3296_1977/master/3296.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05436e9097ff527ecf7494e2c4aba313","title":"rory mcilroy tour championship fedex cup","story":"East Lake on Sunday afternoon was witness to something even more notable than delivery of the richest prize in golf. Rory McIlroy’s bounce, Rory McIlroy’s swagger, is back. And with good reason a season featuring recurring success has now seen the Northern Irishman claim the FedEx Cup. McIlroy will insist the value of that win, $15m, is not crucial to him - and at his level it is not - but to the watching world the cheque added ribbons to this triumph. McIlroy joins Tiger Woods as the only multiple winners of the FedEx Cup.“I’m very proud of myself. I’m going to enjoy this one tonight,” said McIlroy while simultaneously delivering a smile which hinted at epic celebration. There will be for McIlroy’s best friend and caddie, Harry Diamond, too, a commonly underestimated influence in this team who now finds himself £1.5m richer. Sometimes the good guys win.The handicapped start afforded to players in the season-ending Tour Championship had caused elements of screaming from afar. McIlroy delivered the last laugh his overall score would have been sufficient to win even if the 30-man field had started level. McIlroy’s closing round of 66 meant a four-stroke success over Xander Schauffele, with the champion’s 18-under-par aggregate requiring the context of a 10-under-par position before a ball was struck. McIlroy’s third round of 68, completed on Sunday morning after the lightning chaos which brought disruption a day earlier, was his highest tally of the week. If missing the cut at the Open Championship hurt McIlroy - and all the evidence suggested it did - he has responded in emphatic fashion. The one downside, if one can be derived from such a lucrative scene, is that the Masters is still more than seven months away.There were various strands of significance attached to McIlroy’s 17th PGA Tour win. The biggest was perhaps that he swatted aside Brooks Koepka, the world No 1 and his final-round playing partner. When the duo entered Sunday battle in Memphis at a World Golf Championship last month, Koepka prevailed pretty comfortably. This time McIlroy outscored Koepka by half a dozen round-four strokes. The 30-year-old did not appear remotely threatened. McIlroy also pointedly referenced 11 months ago at this venue, when he was afforded an unwanted front-row seat for Woods’s first success in five years.“I didn’t enjoy that walk last year like everyone else did,” McIlroy said. “I played terribly. I got myself into the final group and never took the fight to Tiger. Going up against the No 1 player in the world today, he got one over on me in Memphis and I wanted to try to sort of get some revenge. The final round in Memphis hurt a little bit. I didn’t take it to Brooks at all.“To play like that alongside Brooks and get the win, win the FedExCup, yeah, it’s awesome. It’s amazing how different things can be in a year.”Koepka and McIlroy had been embroiled in a tense battle until the 7th, when the former lost a ball from a wayward drive. A first double-bogey in 142 holes, a remarkable statistic, followed. As McIlroy birdied and bravely saved par at the 8th, Koepka needed snookers. The opposite transpired Koepka dropped shots on three holes in a row from the 12th with Schauffele now McIlroy’s biggest danger. Schauffele got within two as McIlroy had three to play but birdies for the winner on the 17th and 18th added gloss to a dominant performance.At thirteen under, Koepka shared third with Justin Thomas. Paul Casey’s 72 left him fifth, with that over-par closing round not impacting on the Englishman’s willingness to wait to congratulate the champion, which was to his credit. Koepka displayed similar sportsmanship. “Rory played great golf, pretty much mistake free,” Koepka said. “It was impressive to watch. Hats off to him.” Next for Koepka, a five-week holiday. “I’m going to enjoy myself.”Much earlier the PGA Tour had confirmed all iniduals hurt after the lightning strike at the course on Saturday had been released from hospital. “We are deeply grateful that the injuries were not more serious,” said the Tour. A happy ending there and another, rich one, for McIlroy. Money does not have to be a key motivator for such huge purses to resonate.. But that distinctive bounce, which set McIlroy apart from all others even in his youth, lingered more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b186c38da51b8c4d96ca8030a8830e529b31e8a/0_31_3636_2182/master/3636.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fc048cc7b327d606e3c7462c38028c7","title":"ben stokes england best since botham ashes andy bull","story":"Oh hell, just call it all off now. Forget the Premier League, cancel the Rugby World Cup, bin the world athletics championship and whatever else we’re supposed to get excited about in the coming weeks and months. And for goodness sake, junk the Hundred too. They’ll all pale after this Headingley Test, when Ben Stokes, that most unlikely saint, worked the second of the two miracles he needs for his canonisation. This was the innings of his lifetime, and everyone else’s too, certainly the best anyone has played for England since Ian Botham overturned odds of 500-1 when he made his unbeaten 149 at this very same ground back in 1981, and, sober judges reckoned, perhaps even better than that.“The most extraordinary innings ever played by an Englishman‚” was all Alastair Cook had to say after Stokes had smacked that last four away. Never mind everyone else, even Stokes found the finish too excruciating to watch.He couldn’t even bring himself to look at most of the final hour of it, when his partner, England’s No 11 batsman Jack Leach, faced up to Australia’s bowlers from behind his foggy spectacles. He kept having to stop play so he could mop them off. Whenever Leach had the strike, Stokes squatted on his haunches and stared at the ground, too scared to look up. Until he decided to steal the single that drew the scores level, he hadn’t even been bothering to stand up when the bowlers ran in. He needn’t have worried so much. Leach saw them all off. “Jack,” Stokes said afterwards, “has got some serious bollocks.”To unravel it all you have to go way back to the very first afternoon of the match, when Stokes bowled poorly, nine overs for 45, and then stop off on the second morning too, when he was caught at first slip playing one of the worst shots he has ever attempted.Something in him snapped when that happened. After the tea break later that same day, Stokes started bowling from the Football Stand End and refused to stop until the Australians were finished off. He flogged himself through 25 overs in a row, breaking only when Jofra Archer replaced him for four balls. Then Archer broke down with cramp, and Stokes came right back into the attack.Stokes bowled on all the next morning, too. It was almost as if he was punishing himself. By the end of the innings he had bowled Travis Head, and bounced out Matthew Wade and Pat Cummins. And even after all that England still needed 359 runs, more than they had ever made to win a Test, more, in fact, than anyone ever has in this country except for the Australians here at Headingley back in 1948. And they had Don Bradman.Stokes came in late on Saturday evening, when England were 141 for three, Joe Root 64 not out at the other end. He played stone sober that night, and barely attempted a scoring shot. There was a clip off his hips for one single, an inside-edge past short leg for another, and that was it. He had made two runs from 50 balls when they drew stumps, had two off 66 when Root was caught behind off Nathan Lyon right before Australia took the new ball on Sunday morning. He was going so slowly then that even Geoff Boycott began to worry that he was being too obdurate. It took him 74 balls to hit his first boundary. No Englishman has taken longer to make it to double figures in more than 25 years.Then Jonny Bairstow blew in, like the wind picking up before a storm. He started belting that new ball all over, and in a crucial spell before lunch, the two of them put on 60-odd runs in just ten overs or so. And all of a sudden the score was travelling so fast that impossible distance between England and victory started to shrink, below 200, 180, 160, 140, 120, until just as it was coming into sight on the horizon, Bairstow was caught at slip. Then Head ran out Jos Buttler, and Chris Woakes thrashed a catch to short extra cover, and England had three wickets left and needed the best part of another 100 runs.Same old England. Everyone who has ever watched them play knew which way the game was going. Not that they’d given up on the Western Terrace, where, after five hours of rounds, they were chanting‚“stand up, if you love Ben Stokes,” and “shoes off, if you love Ben Stokes”, in defiance, rather than celebration, hope rather than expectation. Of course it’s the hope that gets you in the end. By the time Leach arrived, everyone else had given up, England still needed another 73 runs. What happened next made no damn sense. Not by my logic, yours, or anyone else’s but his. The game isn’t supposed to work this way, outside of the daydreams we have when we’re kids first falling in love with it.The first two sixes felt like a last retort to the Australians it was the third, a switch hit over cover, that seemed to cast the spell, and the fourth, scooped over his own head to fine leg, that suggested some powerful magic had taken hold, and the bumbling umpires and fumbling fielders were all caught up in it. So even when he was out, lbw when England needed two more runs, he somehow got away with it. Stokes did not even stop to acknowledge the hundred he made when he cracked four through long-on, but pressed on, sixes were hit deep into the Western Terrace, fours belted so hard they were puncturing gaps in the nine-man cordon Tim Paine had set on the boundary’s edge. Another six, away down the ground, and, at the end of it all, that last match-winning four.At 67 all out England were finished, and the Ashes gone. They had reached the very bottom of the pit. Down there in the black, where people lose their careers, Stokes looked around and found, deep within himself, the resolve to lead his team right back up and out again. So, yes, throw out your whites, burn your bats, scrap your Wisdens. I’m off to smash my laptop. It’ll never be better than it was this sunny Sunday afternoon in Headingley."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4020cbc19bbdaca7a5f7d6667383573120027d3/0_34_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21b7ce87b7e963b0bad54955c49bc126","title":"epsom win aim for jamie codd the coddfather horse racing tips","story":"Jamie Codd and the Yorkshire trainer John Quinn are a formidable force when they team up – either over jumps or on the Flat. One of the highlights of this Bank Holiday Monday’s racing will be watching them try to win the Amateurs’ Derby at Epsom.It was in 2009 that Codd rode his first Cheltenham Festival winner, the Quinn-trained 16-1 shot Character Building in the Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Chase. That day the jockey displayed the ice-cool waiting tactics he has become famed for.Eight more winners at the Cheltenham Festival have followed for the Wexford man since then, for other stables. His reputation as a stealthy assassin in the saddle – perhaps cemented when bringing Cause Of Causes from last to first in the 2016 Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir – earned him the nickname The Coddfather.Then, on August Bank Holiday Monday in 2016, the CoddQuinn partnership struck at a very different venue. They won the Epsom “Derby” for amateur riders with the well-backed 3-1 favourite Hubertas, who had arrived at Epsom with excellent recent form.Codd rides Mistiroc (3.40 Epsom) this time and circumstances are a little different. The attraction of travelling from Ireland to Surrey for one ride – on a horse without a win for a full three years – is not immediately apparent. And the one and only time Mistiroc has run at Epsom previously was 12 months ago – when a well-beaten last of five. That was over 10 furlongs on soft going, however. This time it will be over 12 furlongs on fast ground.On Sunday John Quinn told the  of eight-year-old Mistiroc: “He hasn’t regained his best form yet this year but we are happy with him and we’re hoping he has a good chance.”Codd said: “Yes, it’s one ride. But it is Epsom, where all those famous Derbys have been. You’re riding on the same track as all those brilliant jockeys. It’s only rare you get the opportunity, so you have to take it. John always gives me a call and we go back a long way.”Yet another motivation for Codd to gain a second win in this race is that his great amateur rival in Ireland, Patrick Mullins, has already won this Epsom contest twice – in 2013 and 2015. There will be more at stake than the race’s £7,487 first prize.After finishing a close-up second on debut at Salisbury in July Stoweman (3.45 Chepstow) was made a short-priced favourite for his second run, back at the same track a fortnight ago. Again Stoweman finished the runner-up – but the winner that day, Impressor, has some interesting future entries so the form could be very decent.Over the jumps Connor Farrell has a fine strike rate in the last couple of weeks for the Dianne Sayer stable. Farrell faces strong opposition when riding Tonto’s Spirit (3.15 Cartmel) but the partnership looks worth taking a chance with."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f9eb51e75d905103b888aa852f01b190d248810/0_176_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c0c674686d739d3542d9bf451b822fc","title":"ashes 2019 england v australia third test day four live","story":"A once-in-a-lifetime innings from Ben Stokes, who added 76 for the last wicket with Jack Leach, gave England an amazing victory that kept the Ashes alive Tim Paine reflects on the loss ...I’m going to wrap the blog up, as there’s plenty to do for tomorrow’s paper. Thanks for your company and emails during another staggering Sunday of cricket. Bye!Some more tributes to an astonishing human beingRicky Ponting “I’m not sure I’ve ever seen anything better than that on a Test ground.”Mike Atherton “It has to be right up there with the greatest English Test innings. It was a combination of all kinds of things: craft, skill, versatility, and most of all an over-my-dead-body attitude.”Stokes finished with 135 not out from 219 balls, with 11 fours and nine sixes. At one stage he was three not out from 73 balls. He played with such intelligence, patience and flexibility. And then, when time was running out, he went nuclear. To quote Martin Tyler, I swear you’ll never see anything like this ever again.The Man of the Match is Ben Stokes, and the crowd are giving him his 44341238th ovation of the day“This probably matches the World Cup. Wow. When you’re out there and you know what’s on the line, adrenaline keeps you going. There’s nothing better than getting your team over the line. Today has been incredible… I’m blabbering on here because I don’t quite know what to say. It still hasn’t sunk in.“I didn’t really start to get nervous until the target was in single figures. I didn’t know what to do then! Before that it was pretty obvious. Those are the most crucial deliveries Jack Leach will face in his career, and credit to him for the way he played in such a hig-pressure situation.”Read all about it, again and again and again“We’ve witnessed some freakish things throughout the summer. I didn’t think we’d see something similar in these series! It was an incredible atmosphere in this ground. Test cricket is alive and kicking and the Ashes is alive and kicking.“To try to sum Ben’s innings up in words is impossible. Outrageous batting, it really was. To be able to stay so calm and calculating was incredible. It’s a fabulous lesson that you should never give up. “It’s hard to take. But you’ve got to tip your hat sometimes and Ben Stokes played an unbelievable innings. That’s probably the best Test innings I’ve seen, and he was too good for us. He bats really well with the tail he controls the game. There are always things you can do differently, but cricket is a game of inches. It tests your character.“It’s not the end of the world. We’re here to win the series and we’ve got two opportunities to do that. We’ve spoken a lot about playing on skill, not emotion, and I reiterated it to the boys just then: if we continue to do what we do, we think we’ll be right in the mix in the last two Tests.”Australia should have retained the Ashes today. This will really smart, and it’s probably good for them that they have a break to process it all. They will also have Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne in the next Test.More from Ben Stokes“We had to win this game. We’ve managed to keep our hopes alive of doing the double, and we’ll take a lot of momentum into Manchester. It’s nice that we’ve got a bit of a break to recharge the batteries. I’ll never forget that ovation. I have to take it all in, because I’m not sure that will ever happen again.”Ben Stokes is speaking to Ian Ward on Sky Sports “When we needed 6070, I thought I had to really try and go. Yeah. I think I was just so in the zone of what I had to do. Yeah. Mate, I dunno.”“Can I just say that’s the finest innings of 1 I’ve ever seen,” says Kim Thonger. “Well done Jack Leach!” He was so level-headed, the Penfold to Stokes’s DangerMouse. Apart from that stupid attempted run that almost lost the game, but let’s not dwell on that.Selve, I love you.Ben Stokes bowled like a drain on Thursday and played the worst of many bad shots from the England batsmen on Friday. And then, in the second innings, he bowled 24.2 overs off the reel and smacked the most glorious 135 not out. His Test averages are fairly modest - 36 with the bat, 32 with the ball - but this match, like Headingley 1981 with Sir Ian Botham, is the ultimate proof of his greatness.With two Tests to play, it’s England 1-1 Australia. That last hour was beyond ludicrous. Australia will be haunted by two moments in particular - the missed run-out and the brainless review, which meant they had nowhere to go when, sad to say, Joel Wilson made another poor decision.Justin Langer waits by the boundary, applauding Stokes before shaking his hand. The Aussies know class and ticker when they see it.Stokes has a long embrace with Joe Root. Stokes might have saved his job. Finally he leaves the field to the kind of standing ovation that is reserved for very few sportsmen. Stokes has his hands on his head, trying to take in what he has just achieved. He and Jack Leach - who deserves so much credit - added 76 for the last wicket. The England players all jump on Stokes, who is starting to register what has happened.Stokes slammed a short ball from Cummins through the covers for four and let out a primal roar that seemed to last about a minute. He has played one of the most immense innings in history - and he did it on the back of a 25-over spell with the ball. Never mind 258 in South Africa or even 84 not outin a World Cup final this is and will forever be the innings of his life.Ben Stokes, I adore you.125.3 overs: England 358-9 (need 1 to win Stokes 131, Leach 1) Leach steals a single - England cannot lose the game!125.2 overs: England 357-9 (need 2 to win Stokes 131, Leach 0) Leach ducks under a bumper and works the next ball round the corner to short fine leg. Four balls to go.Amid the mayhem, Stokes was unable to keep the strike, so it’s Cummins to Leach. One to tie, two to win. One wicket to retain the Ashes.125 overs That should have been out. I am sure that was out. He missed a slog sweep at a ball that straightened sharply and would surely have hit leg stump. We haven’t seen a replay yet. We have now: it would have been out on review!Stokes survives a huge LBW shout - and Australia wasted their review a moment ago! That looked so close.Stokes reverse swept to the fielder, Leach set off and was sent back. The fielder threw to Lyon, who let it through his hands.124.4 overs: England 357-9 (target 359 Stokes 131, Leach 0) Stokes cuts, and it’s fielded well at cover point. My goodness.124.3 overs: England 357-9 (target 359 Stokes 131, Leach 0) Stokes goes down the ground - and it’s six more!!!!! Two to win, one to tie.

She talks to Rebecca Nicholson about break-ups, panel shows and why there’s nothing you can’t make a joke aboutSara Pascoe’s ludicrously sweet black-and-white puppy is lounging on the floor in front of her. Fresh from a photo shoot, Pascoe is in a shiny dress that gives her the look of a Disney character, albeit one who wants to talk about whether evolutionary biology will ever allow us, as a society, to move beyond shame. (She doesn’t think so the flush of it teaches children not to do something they shouldn’t, so it serves a purpose.). “Sorry,” she says, breaking off for a second. “I’m just looking at my dog being adorable.” He is being adorable. “He’s just having a little stretch. But I think what’s really interesting about politics and the people who are good politicians – and I don’t say this because I agree with their politics but people like Nigel Farage, who’s been an incredibly influential politician, and Boris Johnson and Donald Trump – is the unapologetic-ness. I mean, we associate power or alpha-ness with, ‘I am right.’ Maybe some people grow up with fathers who were like that, ‘Don’t question me’, so we can’t help but respond to men who behave that way.”Those who know Pascoe’s comedy – and now that it has been given the mainstream approval of a primetime BBC2 special, LadsLadsLads, filmed at the London Palladium, more will be familiar with it than ever before – will recognise the way her mind leaps from point to point, skimming like a stone across water before it splashes into a punchline that wraps it all up. Now 38, she has been doing standup since her late 20s, has popped up in some of the BBC’s funniest sitcoms of the past decade (Twenty Twelve, W1A), written a fascinating sort-of autobiography, Animal, that mixed feminism, memoir and evolutionary biology, and made a name for herself as a panel show regular, reliably stealing the show with her erudite whimsy. But this year, particularly, has been her year. LadsLadsLads won her a coveted comedy solo hour on the BBC. And now there is Sex Power Money, her second non-fiction book, which started life as a desire to find out more about porn – she doesn’t watch it – and ended up as an insightful, sensitive study of modern masculinity and sexual economics.It is not necessarily the most immediate material for a comedian, but Pascoe has a knack for artfully juggling the high and low. Unlike most of her peers, she is not going to the Edinburgh Fringe this year. “No, I’m going to Georgia to film a documentary about jobs that are about to stop existing,” she says, because of course, that’s what she would be doing instead. “My thing is, I am a little bit of a silly billy, but I’m much more of a Hermione,” she says, referring to the Harry Potter nerd. “I will fall over if you want me to fall over, but I’d really like it if we actually learned about Georgia.”It is a neat summary of what she does. She refers to her brain as “fizzy” more than once, and though she is more serious and reflective in conversation than her garrulous on-stage persona, she does tend to fizz. She speaks enthusiastically, in great long paragraphs that hoover up ideas from the air. “Since I was really small, my mum says I wouldn’t talk at breakfast because I would just read the back of the cereal packet,” she remembers. “I used to steal from the library, which is a crime and it’s bad, but I just couldn’t get enough books, and I also didn’t like to give them back once I’d read them. I just read everything. I get a fizzy thing in my brain, like a nice glass of wine, and I want to know facts and I want to understand.”She was born in Dagenham, east London, and grew up in Romford, Essex her parents orced when she was small, and her father moved to Australia, leaving her mother to bring up her and her two younger sisters. They weren’t particularly well off, “but not in any kind of tortured way”. She takes her shoes off and points at her little toe. “When I was little, I wore shoes that were too small for me for years, so my feet grew weird, so my little toenails grow and then they just fall off and then they grow again.” One of her little toes is lacking a nail. She points at it. “That’s the only sign of poverty on my body.”She may do silly billy well, but much of Pascoe’s comedy is personal and revealing, and on stage she often gives the impression of a woman who does not know what a boundary looks like. After watching her standup and reading her books, I feel as if I already know everything about her. “Well you do, in a way,” she says. Often, someone will come up to her after a gig and ask her how her mum is. “I’ll go, ‘All right?’” she says, with mock-suspicion. “I’m thinking: ‘Did this person go to school with my sister?’”In LadsLadsLads, which followed her break-up with fellow comedian John Robins, she talked extensively about sex, being single and the celibate year she imposed upon herself after they split. (Robins gave his side of the story in his own show, The Darkness of Robins.) She met her current boyfriend, Australian comic Steen Raskopoulos, doing comedy, too. “Comedy,” she laughs. “Everyone is comedy. There are horrible terms for women who only sleep with comedians. You’ve heard ‘gag hag’, or my agent once called somebody a ‘clown bike’, which I hadn’t heard. It’s harsh, isn’t it?” she laughs. “But the reason I forgive myself is that I used to do gigs seven days a week, I didn’t have a social life, and what tends to happen is that people have a drink after work, which means you’re up quite late with people…”She says she never fancies anyone straight away. “But then you see them for the third or fourth time, and think, ‘Oh I’m looking forward to seeing that person at the gig tonight.’ And also, you get to hear them do their stuff, and they’re either good at their job, which is sexy, and you get to learn a little bit about them, and then there are some people you might think are sexy and you hear their standup and you’re like, ‘Oh my God, what an awful person.’”As Pascoe’s star has risen, she has come to understand the reach of what she talks about on stage. While she is certain that, “Standup is a place where, as long as it’s funny enough, you can say your most embarrassing things, shameful things and disappointing things,” she has learned that mentioning real people has consequences, particularly when she includes her family. “My dad lives in Australia, and my mum brought us up pretty much by herself, but he’s in my life now and I really love him,” she says. Some of her family have a WhatsApp group, and will talk about her TV appearances on it. “And I have the potential to hugely hurt my dad with tiny little asides. I’ll just say this thing about, ‘My dad didn’t love me,’ and it’s just stupid and then it distills back down to this little jagged thing in the heart that you’re nearly 40 and still not over it.”A couple of years ago Pascoe was on the laddy weekend breakfast show Sunday Brunch. “I’m glad you brought that up,” she says, looking entertained. During a recipe segment, host Tim Lovejoy asked what she would and would not use for material. “People… might think you’re trying to make them look stupid,” she explained, before adding, cheerfully, “Or they don’t want everyone to know about their abortion, so you have to double-check.” You could feel the tension radiating out from the screen. “They acted like I’d said I kill babies,” she says now, laughing but incredulous. “Like, I knife them in the head, like I’ll give anyone an abortion who’s watching. I mean honestly, they acted like I’d said something so crude. Part of having it as a human right is that it’s also possible to talk about it without shame. Even on breakfast TV sometimes.”Pascoe wrote about her own experience of abortion in Animals. “One in three of their female viewers will have had a termination. And I really checked myself afterwards, like, ‘Do I regret it?’ But it was just the worst thing I could think about at the time, as in, in terms of if you were going to expose someone.” She laughs. “I’ve never gone on again.”One of the funniest lines in LadsLadsLads has her explaining that standup comedy is: “Just telling other people things about yourself that you should be very ashamed of and them thinking you’re joking.” She is aware of the contrast between what she does now and her early ambitions, which were notably more earnest. Pascoe had no desire to be a comic. She wanted to be a serious actor. She was studying English at the University of Sussex when she saw a piece of physical theatre about chimps learning sign language, obviously, and had an epiphany. She wanted to do political theatre, she wanted to agitate, she wanted to help change the world through art. She laughs. “And I’ve ended up doing silly billy.”For a while, she didn’t even like comedy, though watching The Mighty Boosh in her 20s cured her of her prejudices. “I really loved the ridiculousness of it and I thought it was so charming. I don’t think I realised that adults could be stupid as well.”It was going out with a standup comedian and then breaking up with him that led her to pick up a microphone. “I went to watch him do a gig and it was boys holding notepads being terrible. And I was like, ‘Oh I can do that. I can be terrible with a notepad!” When they broke up, the pieces fell into place. “A broken heart is a perfect time to do standup, because if it’s been a horrible heartbreak, you’re at the bottom of your own barrel. If you go on stage with nothing to lose, nothing bad can happen, and it actually makes you quite fearless.” She also thought that doing comedy herself would help her understand her ex. “And the second I did standup, I understood everything.”Her first gig was to 12 people in Balham and nobody really laughed. “I had a medium-to-bad time. But you get a physiological reward when you do something that scares you. For me, it was this lightning bolt of, ohhh, this is what I was meant to do.” She had been an actor, a tour guide, a backing singer in a hotel near Nottingham for Robbie Williams’s dad, but finally, she had found her calling.“I’d been writing a diary since I was 14, and standup is your diary. You just work out which bits to tell people, but it is your diary. I was like, ‘This is it, it’s like Shakespeare’s time, you’re a one-man band, you go from town square to town square and you lay out your stall and you tell your stories.’ My dad is a jazz musician, and he must have seen me do a terrible gig, because they were all terrible for years, but maybe three months in he said, ‘You’ve cracked it. You’re just going to be you, aren’t you?’”Pascoe has now entered that rare club of comedians who are household names. Partly, it’s because she’s been a prolific guest on panel shows like 8 Out of 10 Cats and Mock the Week. Contrary to the usual line about how women rarely enjoy doing them, Pascoe absolutely loves doing panel shows. “A panel show is, would you like thousands of pounds? Yes please. Would you like to come and sit with your friends? Yes please. Do you want a wine in a mug? Yes please. Oh, buy yourself a new dress, why don’t you? All you have to do is sit there and talk to your friends and then someone edits your worst bits out. It’s like the best version of you on your night out.”She readily admits that, over the past couple of years, her life has changed completely. “Well, you have much more money, that’s hugely life-changing people don’t talk about it very much because you’re supposed to be really embarrassed.” She says she often talks to other comedians about how much she’s being paid, so they can all negotiate better. “Money is so connected to freedom, autonomy, options, owning property. I just bought a house, I can get a dog, so this is the happiest thing that’s ever happened to me.”Having money means Pascoe has time, too, in a way that she’s never had time before. She wants to do an economics degree and she wants to write a novel. “This is going to sound audacious, but hear me out,” she says. “In terms of long-term ambitions, I really wanted to be an actor until I was 40, and then I wanted to write novels, and then I wanted to be prime minister.” She laughs, but she is totally serious. A few years ago, she appeared to be considering giving up comedy entirely to pursue politics instead. “But I really went off the idea of politics,” she says. She grew frustrated at the system, at how little it would be possible to change.Given how on-track her life has been so far, doesn’t that scupper the big plan? “When Boris got in, I started thinking, ‘Hang on!’ Obviously you say stuff in standup and think, ‘I could never be a politician now. I’ve talked openly about having an abortion, or I’ve had sex with loads of people.’ And then Boris gets in.” She smiles widely. “Do you know what? Just don’t apologise.”Sex Power Money is published by Faber on 29 August at £14.99.

While she prepares breakfast, and her husband Daniel plays with their daughters Brooke and Harper, her son Chase is engrossed in sending an email to his beloved stepgrandfather, “Pops”, his face a study in intense concentration.Nine-year-old Chase, who has the neurological condition cerebral palsy, cannot walk, talk, feed himself or pick up a pen. Yet, thanks to technology that’s widely available, he can communicate, learn and explore the online world from his family’s home in Northfleet, Kent.On his computer, “Chase uses the on-screen keyboard (OSK) tool, because he doesn’t have the fine motor skills to type on a keyboard,” says Nikki. Running on Windows 10, “it displays a visual keyboard with all the standard keys. Using a joystick that he can control with just his thumb, once he switches on the OSK, he can do everything from browse the internet to search for videos on YouTube and write emails. We introduced him to it when he was six and it really has been life-changing for him.“Because he can’t speak or type messages on a phone, being able to write emails to his friends and close family is so important to him – it helps him feel connected.“The keyboard also has a text prediction function, which suggests words for him as he types. It makes it quicker for him, and, because he has learning difficulties too, it helps him with his spelling.“When I see him on his computer, and how its technology empowers him, it fills me with confidence that as he grows up he’ll be able to lead a fulfilling, independent life. That is all I’ve ever wanted for him.”Nikki’s hopes for her son are mirrored by Microsoft’s mission to empower every person through building inclusivity into technology, such as the Windows 10 operating system, which supports the OSK and its Office 365 suite.After a normal, healthy pregnancy, Nikki says she was devastated when Chase was born with brain damage, having been deprived of oxygen during her labour.“The hardest part was the uncertainty. No one knew how severe his level of disability would be, and for the first few years of his life it felt like I was living in limbo watching and waiting to see what milestones he would reach, or not,” says Nikki.“He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was nine months old, but it wasn’t until he was around three that the full extent of his disability was clear. He’s never spoken, he can’t stand unaided, and he suffers from almost constant involuntary movements of his limbs. His reading ability is closer to that of a five-year-old. He’s also incredibly loving, with a wonderful sense of humour and a very determined personality.”While Chase uses an electric wheelchair and requires round-the-clock care, Nikki says technology gives him the independence he craves.“He’s well aware his siblings and other children don’t need the same help he does. But when he’s on his computer, he feels like any other nine-year-old, because he’s in control and he doesn’t need any assistance,” says Nikki. “That means so much to him and it’s vital for his self-confidence.“I see how he puffs up with pride when he shows his little sisters, who are five and three, something he’s discovered online – his current obsession is looking at locations around the world on Google Maps. It gives him the chance to be the big brother and take the lead.”A keen gamer too, Chase uses his Microsoft adaptive controller to access his Xbox console.“We all game together as a family. It can be stressful going out because of the challenges Chase can face with poor disability access and toilet facilities. Sometimes it’s just nice to stay at home and have a relaxed afternoon gaming and cuddling up on the sofa.”Summing up how much the technology means to her son, Nikki says: “It’s no exaggeration to say Chase’s computer is his window to the world. I can’t imagine his life without it and I’m thankful he was born at a time when technology like this exists.“It’s so important to him and, thanks to its emphasis on inclusivity, it’s the one part of his life in which he can be completely independent.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Update your drinking habits with tips from the experts on enjoying rum’s craft revivalWhile gin has had a dramatic rise in popularity over the past five years, bartenders have been quietly getting excited about rum. It offers huge cocktail variety, depending on the style from the unaged white variety to those aged in the tropics, it’s as complex and nuanced as any other spirit. I spoke to some top mixologists about their favourite cocktails.Jack Wallis and Chris Tanner at the VaultRum cocktails range from the super-simple to concoctions worthy of Michelin stars. Jack Wallis, operations manager at the Vault in Soho, is proud of the simplicity of their Captain’s Blood – a twist on a daiquiri, made with rum, fresh lime, sugar syrup and bitters that’s perfect to serve at home. For something a little more complex, Chris Tanner, also of the Vault, makes a version of Planter’s Punch with orange, pineapple, lime juice, grenadine, sugar syrup and Lugger Rum. Unlike some varieties, Lugger Rum is not dominated by vanilla, aiming instead to deliver a full profile of spices, including nutmeg, orange peel and cloves.Liam Cotter of Heads, Hearts and TailsBarman Liam Cotter, of events and consultancy firm Heads, Hearts and Tails, warns not to take shortcuts in rum-based cocktails: “Inexperienced bartenders may swap out a quality rum with an inferior one and wonder why their grog isn’t quite the same.” Cotter’s all-time favourite cocktail is a Jungle Bird not the original 1970s version, created in the Kuala Lumpur Hilton, but the reimagined New York classic, created by way of Giuseppe Gonzales (formerly of New York’s Suffolk Arms and long-standing patron of Milk \u0026amp Honey). He reworked it to become infinitely more balanced and appealing to a refined contemporary palate. It’s part all-night-fun negroni, part complex bitter daiquiri. He thinks this would be great with Lugger Rum.He also has a soft spot for something more straightforward: “There is something lovely about a simple rum and coke.”Mia Johansson at SwiftLondon bar Swift is known for its elegant and inventive cocktails, and one of managing partner Mia Johansson’s favourites is a Praline Flip. First, they make their own hazelnut orgeat – by heating the nuts in water, cooling and re-blending them – then combine with Angostura bitters, egg, Guinness and spiced rum. Their second cocktail is a little less complicated, but still one I wouldn’t try at home. It’s an espresso martini using Mr Black cold-brew coffee liqueur, coffee, vodka, rich demerara sugar and spiced rum.Thom Solberg at Black RockBlack Rock’s bar manager Thom Solberg loves a Mai Tai. Although this award-winning Shoreditch bar primarily focuses on whisky, it also works with rum. Solberg’s take on his retro favourite uses three rums – Jamaican, Lugger spiced and over-proof – along with triple sec and lime juice. All it needs is shaking up, pouring over ice and a garnish of orange and mint. He says spiced rum goes well with anything apple-y, and that a particular favourite rum modifier is pomegranate molasses. He incorporates this mix into a rum punch alongside dry cider, lime, allspice dram and a little vanilla syrup, garnished with cinnamon, nutmeg and apple slices.Kurt Maitland, cocktail authorKurt Maitland, author of Drink, can recommend something simple and something more showy. A Devil’s Kiss won’t tax you: shake up equal parts coffee liqueur, Grand Marnier and Lugger Rum with ice and strain into small glasses.The Kama’aina is a completely different kettle of fish, however. It starts with ginger syrup, almond paste and pimento liqueur, stirred to create a #9. Next add Rhum agricole, Lugger Rum, guava nectar, real cream of coconut, and fresh lime then shake with crushed ice and strain into a tiki glass, adding Angostura bitters and an orange blossom garnish at the end. Maitland describes a Devil’s Kiss as like an aperitif at home before the main drama of a complicated Kama’aina in a specialist bar. The former can easily be made in quantity for parties and the spiced rum balances beautifully with the bitter coffee and sweet Grand Marnier.Featuring fruit, spice and a genuinely fiery twist – careful with those matchesLugger rum 50mlStrawberry and lime syrup 20ml*Angostura bitters, 2 dashesWest country cider 30mlSprig of rosemarySpiced powder**MatchesStrawSugar 50gStrawberries x10Peeled lime skins (x2 whole limes)Juice of 1 whole limeIn a bowl, muddle all ingredients and leave for 10-30 minutes in fridge, then strain through a sieve.Mix equal parts of icing sugar, cinnamon powder and nutmeg powder.Lugger Rum is a Caribbean rum aged in Devon, featuring sophisticated notes of orange peel, nutmeg, cloves and vanilla.

Bisected by the River Mersey, they are home to at least 67 species of birds, and the rare Daubenton’s bat. During the second world war, mock housing and factory buildings were built of plywood on Turn Moss as decoys to distract German bombers from nearby factories.

It was a maternity home during the 1960s and 1970s, and many locals were born there (including me). The house was bequeathed to the people of Dumbarton, but for many years lay in a sad state of disrepair until it was let to a Christian organisation. It runs a tea room on Saturdays (and Thursdays and Fridays in summer). You can walk around the gorgeous grounds or, if you’re feeling more energetic, go up into the Lang Craigs wood for fabulous views. Then relax and enjoy your coffee and cake in the Angel Room watched over by the heavenly frescoes.• visitscotlandCarol Ann RamsayWatchtree Nature Reserve, near Carlisle, offers walks in dense woodland populated with hare and deer, as well as frogs, toads and newts, if you look carefully enough. Sited on a former second world war airfield, it has a number of trails through the woods, as well as smooth track perfect for cycling or skating. It is possible to hire a range of bicycles from Watchtree Wheelers to tour the perimeter, though cyclists aren’t permitted to disturb the peace of the wooded areas. Given that is was once the burial ground for thousands of animals caught up in the foot-and-mouth crisis, its transformation into to a nature reserve, wind farm and disability cycling charity is a serene triumph.• watchtreeJames CartwrightHengistbury Head, just south of Christchurch, is a beautiful, tranquil and constantly changing piece of coastline that has something for everyone. As a newly created dog walker, I can choose from flat grassland tracks that lead to high sand dunes down to the beautiful natural and often deserted beach. Or we can choose to go high on to the head and walk the path through heather and ferns, with views of Christchurch Priory and estuary on one side, and the Dorset coastline on the other. Then, right at the tip, you see Mudeford Spit and its beach huts. There is wildlife and colourful plant life everywhere, and whether it’s sunny or cloudy (it’s always windy!) at the end of a walk you feel better for having been there.• see visithengistburyheadPhilippaBaggeridge Country Park, near Wolverhampton, has always been our family’s favourite place for an afternoon walk. It’s a former colliery with beautiful walks, a play park, a miniature railway, lakes and watercress beds to hop across. It’s often heaving on a warm day, so our best memories are in the drizzle when it’s quiet and we can watch the wildfowl on Bag Pool, or walk to Himley Hall and stop for hot chocolate. You often spot relics of the old mine works and can climb to the toposcope and look across to the old brickworks. A great place to observe all four seasons.• sstaffs.gov.ukColin PearsonBeacon Hill national nature reserve stands above the South Downs in Hampshire. The top of the hill is coated in beech woodland, which provides shady respite from the heat of the summer sun. The chalk downlands are the real attraction though, and you have to be prepared to go slow to appreciate its delights – multitudes of plants, all in flower, just centimetres from each other. The mind boggles at how so many different things can live cheek by jowl. The cherry on the cake isn’t just the song of the skylark, but the clouds of butterflies that erupt with every step. Here I am reminded of Pig-Pen, the character in Charlie Brown, as silver-spotted skipper butterflies surround me in their hundreds.• gov.ukRobFor a slice of serenity in the heart of London, I love Millwall Dock on the Isle of Dogs. Dwarfed by the skyscrapers of Canary Wharf, this expanse of open water is the perfect contrast to fast-paced urban life. Whether it’s observing the mischievous birdlife squabbling over possession of the tern raft in the old graving dock, or partaking in a bracing open-water swim from the Docklands Sailing \u0026amp Watersports Centre, or simply watching the sun set over the City of London with an array of dinghies in the foreground, there’s always something to amuse, refresh or inspire. And for those more interested in llamas, goats and donkeys, Mudchute Farm is just a stone’s throw away.Jack StookesSandwell Valley, near West Bromwich, is a one-of-a-kind place full of hidden gems, with surviving bits of real countryside, open pastures and grass meadows. It also has a nice old farm turned into a museum and two large, well-equipped playgrounds. Or you can visit the priory ruins – said to be haunted – with its Saxon stone coffins, surrounded by old dark woods with hidden medieval ponds. More recent history lies in the second world war ack-ack gun emplacements, still in good shape, but more and more engulfed by the vegetation every year. And an old colliery site has been transformed into a wildlife haven by the RSPB on the river Tame. This is all within a 1.5-mile radius surrounded on all sides by urban sprawl. May it remain undeveloped for ever.• sandwell.gov.ukStanleyMy absolute favourite green space is the Dalston Eastern Curve Garden. This small urban community oasis is set back from the madness of busy Hackney on a disused train line. It’s a beautifully layered garden with a magical wooded area, raised beds with vegetables, and beautiful pots full of seasonal flowers. The main reason I come here is for inspiration – I love the creativity, especially across the seasons. I especially love visiting in October: despite the year growing old, it is transformed into a beautiful autumnal space, using the changing plants, hundreds of carved pumpkins, and coppery red crispy leaf garlands. Sitting in the cold, warmed by a hot chocolate, it is just perfect.• dalstongarden.orgKatherine PhippsWilliamson Park in Lancaster is a gem. Jimmy Williamson (Lord Ashton) commissioned its construction from the remains of the city quarry in the 19th century.

A time for Americans to stand knee-deep in spooling ticker tape and wail “What gives?” A time for Helen McCrory as Aunt Polly to untangle herself from her lover in a Monte Carlo hotel suite, rearrange her furs, pout to emphasise her peerless cheekbones and head back to Small Heath for a family crisis meeting. A time for Arthur Shelby to swig from the bottle and sob over the Detroit wing of the crime mob failing to ditch their stocks before they became worthless.It is time, in other words, for season five of Peaky Blinders (BBC One), the franchise that does what Amy Turtle from Crossroads could never manage – to make fans as unlikely as Snoop Dogg realise that the important Birmingham isn’t the one in Alabama.Good news, Mr Dogg: the formula is the same. Sharp duds that reprove today’s sartorial slobathon? Check. Caps that allow middle-aged chumps like me to feel ancestral connection with their great-grandads? Check. Gaudy, exploitative violence? Sure. The six-abreast Reservoir Dogs strut across cobbles, backlit by factory flames? But of course. Cillian Murphy as mob boss Tommy Shelby in existential crisis like Tony Soprano? Oh, go on then.Like Ronnie Barker in the sequel to Porridge, or Michael Corleone in The Godfather Pt III, Tommy wants to go straight but keeps getting dragged back in to the moral cesspit he dug in the first place.And the accents. My God, the accents. Is there a compulsory Rada course in Brummie for disappointed poshos hoping to spend their careers deploying Jane Austen cleavages and skinny breeches, but instead are forced to watch Timothy Spall in Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, and Harry Enfield as second city parvenu? “Repeat after me,” says the teacher, “Oi am considerably richer than yow”. Let’s be thankful: at least dead horses don’t talk. Not that I’m complaining: the pleasure of watching period drama is pointing out its shortcomings.What can the Peaky Blinders do to avoid catching a cold from Wall Street’s sneeze? That was the question of this series opener. Tommy has a lot of thinking to do. So he saddles up, like a Clint Eastwood who has swapped poncho and Stetson for starched collar and flat cap. He trots moodily on another horse across the wild West Midlands in fetching silhouette to the soundtrack of Nick Cave at his most risibly bleak. He is heading for them thar Lickey Hills. I used to sledge down those hills as a kid and don’t recall a phone box on top, less one that worked. But this one does. What’s more, it’s ringing.Who is on the other end of the line? Tommy gets off his horse to find out. One of his lackeys explains that Limehouse gangsters won’t surrender the compromising poop on a peer of the realm that Tommy has been offered £50,000 to retrieve. So he orders a hit to save face. Cut to the Peaky Blinders blasting their way into the gangsters’ HQ. Limehouse’s error? They expected the Brummies to come though the door. Instead, they shot their way through the walls, emerging covered in plaster, as implacable and savage as escaped lions from West Midlands safari park.Like a Brummie Zelig, Tommy is everywhere. The series creator Steven Knight is heroic, perhaps even heroically misguided, in having no compunctions about making his hero have fingers in every pie going. Ordering hits in Chinatown. Receiving letters from Winston Churchill. Sobbing graveside over a horse interred by Gypsy chums. He has even become a Labour MP, although when it comes to representing Birmingham, he is no Jess Phillips. He is so little a man of principle, in fact, that when Sam Claflin’s Oswald Mosley, who formed the British Union of Fascists in 1932, slimes out of his office in the Palace of Westminster to get Shelby on side (yet another Zelig-like coincidence), we wonder: who would Tommy fight for in the looming battle of Cable Street – for the fascists, or against? All this was daft enough, but then Knight crossed the line. He killed off a reporter in the line of duty. If you have flat caps to doff, doff them now. Michael Levitt was killed for knowing too much. What did Levitt know? That Tommy is a killer by remote control and his dabs are all over the crimes. The Peaky Blinders waste Levitt in his apartment block lift, feathers from the lift’s upholstered walls fancifully fluttering in the air as his corpse slips to the floor.You can put your caps back on now. Clearly Levitt was a phoney. He never worked for the Evening Mail, really. Instead he was an implausible invention, played by a graduate from another Rada course, Telly Journalists 101, that teaches the following: on no account take a shorthand note, stare sweatily at your unused notepad and then get rubbed out for asking the difficult questions. Poor show."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cc1484a60d535b1dc5d82973c8ba99142a037dc/0_192_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ff0a13c605cf62f2adf01f30e57cf42","title":"poldark series five episode seven recap well that was exhausting","story":"Surprise twists, narrative handbrake turns and an assassination attempt on Horace the pug – there’s a lot to tie up before tomorrow’s final ever episodeEggs, ham, partridge, quail and a healthy side order of revenge. Hang on, this wasn’t what we ordered! This episode started with Ross at the bottom of a mine with a very bad headache and, unfortunately, all his clothes on. It ended with Ross basically declaring that he has really been French all along and let there be no mistake, mon ami. Although the only thing that really mattered here, of course, is that Horace did not die. Oh, yes, and also that Geoffrey Charles didn’t die. But more importantly Horace.Well, this was all exhausting, wasn’t it? Despite some good bits. A huge problem for this series surfaced here: Sir Evil George’s evil pales next to the evil of the slave-trading half-brothers. He is no match for them, it turns out. So now it’s basically The Racist Slave-Trading Half-Brothers Versus Ross and the French. (Someone tell JK Rowling about this potentially excellent book title.)I guess this is all fine if you don’t mind narrative handbrake turns, but it all felt very sudden next to the slow burn of the Ned storyline, which we’re supposed to just forget about now. I have some concerns about other plot points, too, seeing as it all needs to be tied up neatly smartish: Jacka and the missing ore Tess and Sam Carne Morwenna and the village school … ’E can’t wrap all that up in a week and foment a cross-Channel revolution at the same time, can ’e?This was a busy episode for Sindy Doll who was dispatched to Hyde Park for a few hours to brazenly accost people about all the evil that is being done. But what’s this? An attack upon Sindy Doll? Fie, fool! She is a finer horsewoman than that! Next came the most distressing incident of the past five series: an attempt on the life of Horace the Pug, who had already distinguished himself early on by barking for the first time. Thank goodness for Dr Enys’s transferable skills. Horace was swiftly revived. I did experience extreme distress at the thought of his demise.Sindy Doll’s finest hour came when she recovered from being a frivolous busybody nosing in her husband’s medical notes and instead put the information to good use, blackmailing Sir Evil George. This occasioned one of the best exchanges ever between George and Cary Warleggan: “Why are we protecting some local lunatic?” “We’re not. We’re protecting you.”Meanwhile, many other incidents piled upon each other, enough to last another five series of Poldark if the BBC budget had stretched. Tess Tregidden be up to some wickedness with Sam the Preacher. (“I have been called by God to bring souls to salvation. Tess be such a soul.” No, Sam, she be not. She be taking you for a ride.) Jacka and his crew continued with their thievin’, swapping the ore for brandy, tea and rum, the ungrateful varmints. Prudie did some great facial expressions. Ursula, the she-bear baby that everyone had forgotten about (and who caused Elizabeth to die) turned out to still be alive and surprisingly recently birthed. And Morwenna and Drake finally had some good news: “We have news to share. A blessed day might soon be coming.” “We do expect.” “A child?” If things continue like this, a replacement pug might be more useful.What’s left in our last hour with Team Nampara? Ross has to avenge himself on all the slave-traders, start a revolution with the help of the French, keep Demelza on side, stop Tess and Jacka from stealing both his ore and his religious brother-in-law, save the King from traitors and finally get his own back on Sir Evil George. Oh, yes, and somehow reclaim Valentine without offending Demelza. Hey, if anyone can do this in an hour, it’s Ross. “Do you think me an idiot?” “Yes. But an idiot I love beyond measure.” Ah, you and the rest of us, Demelza. You and the rest of us.A tankard of ale must be raised to Geoffrey Charles (Freddie Wise) and Cecily (Lily Dodsworth-Evans). They have had a difficult and sometimes irritating story arc where they have nearly escaped and got married about 56 times without ever actually escaping or getting married. In this episode in the “But do you not love me?” scene, they both did wonderfully. And, of course, there’s no avoiding the comparison with the fate of Geoffrey Charles’s mother, Elizabeth, who was also never able to marry the right person at the right time. I didn’t shed a tear but I did have a momentary lapse of cynicism and, frankly, that’s quite impressive at the moment.I’m going to have to replace this section with a Horace the Pug Death Watch, I think.Ross has gone full-on French, as far as I can work out. Our Poldark seems to be playing a dangerous game. Is he a double agent? Or a triple agent? Let’s just hope that, whatever happens, he gets in a bit of scything before it’s all over."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96fd797ae9846fc5c22e80e521aa6e7ed9867372/0_1518_5315_3188/master/5315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ea2bc481533d8a0c54b9e56c7faaa78","title":"sanditon review every period drama box ticked","story":"It’s clear where Andrew Davies takes over from Jane Austen in this adaptation of her unfinished novelIt is a truth recently acknowledged that Andrew Davies, grandfather of the sexed-up British period drama, used all the existing material from Jane Austen’s final novel in the first half hour of his adaptation of Sanditon (ITV). This – the one most of us haven’t read, and which has never before been adapted for the screen – is the fragment Austen abandoned unfinished in March 1817. She died four months later, leaving behind 11 chapters of a strange fiction about encroaching modernity in the industrial age and, more specifically, a seaside resort on the Sussex coast.So for once we slip into the ease and comfort of a Sunday night period drama knowing precisely where the author’s words end and the adaptor’s imagination takes flight. Say 24 minutes in, as our lively and naive heroine Charlotte Heywood (Rose Williams) admires a pair of slippers in a shop window. What happens after this takes place in Davies’s Sanditon, not Austen’s. Really, though, will it come as a surprise to hear that the swoonsome arrival of Sidney Parker (Downton Abbey’s Theo James) storming up the blowy cliffside in a coach bears the naughty mark of Davies? Or the deer-spotting that turns out to be the bounder Sir Edward Denham rutting with a girl of whom he is ruthlessly taking advantage? Or the requisite ball filled with snatched power-play betwixt claps and curtseys? Of course not! Austen switched places with Davies a quarter of a century ago, approximately 44 minutes into episode four of Pride and Prejudice when Colin Firth emerged wet-shirted from a lake. I still remember, a decade later, reading a hilarious Nancy Banks-Smith review of his (also sexy-seasidey) Sense and Sensibility, which observed that Davies’s name was in larger type than Austen’s in the opening credits.As for his Sanditon, it’s good dirty end-of-the-pier fun but about as enduring as an ice-cream cone. It begins, as all period dramas ought to, with a coach accident. This is what’s required for a group of people who would never otherwise meet to be thrown together. In this case Tom and Mary Parker, tunnel-visioned entrepreneurs determined to transform the sleepy fishing village of Sanditon into a modern seaside resort. And the Heywoods, traditional country folk who make it their principle “never to go more than five miles from home”. Mr Parker shows the Heywoods his plans for the hotel, shops, terraces, cliff walk, and assembly rooms where, the following week, Sir Andrew Davies (sorry, he) will be throwing Sanditon’s first ball. Charlotte wants to go, especially when her father warns her “these seaside resorts can be odd places”. Anyone who knows their way round the topography of an Austen novel will hear the ringing of alarm bells (which she was much more into than wedding bells). It was from Brighton, after all, that Lydia Bennet eloped with George Wickham. “I think you’ll come to regret ever setting foot in Sanditon,” warns Esther Denham, who is so dodgy she’s the only one dressed in black at the ball.The seaside may be morally lax but that makes it the ideal location for Davies’s thematic concerns: all bonnet-teasing winds, wildly metaphorical seas, and the opportunity for people to get their kit off. Which the men do, racing for the water bare-bummed, free, and terribly English. This is Davies’s 2019 update: to redress the gender balance by undressing the men. The women, meanwhile, retire to bathing machines where they struggle into red caps and bathing smocks that look like they’ve come off the set of The Handmaid’s Tale and then get rolled into the sea. None of this stops Sir Edward Denham purring to Charlotte of “the ocean bearing itself up as you give yourself to it freely” or “the gentle play of the currents over your naked limbs”. This comes in the first half hour, incidentally, but I’d wager not from Austen’s pen.The rest is exactly as you feel it will be in your waters. Every box is ticked off to great satisfaction or dull predictability depending on where you stand on the period drama tolerance scale. The top-notch ensemble cast including Anne Reid as Lady Denham, the curmudgeonly grande dame presiding over a fortune that her relatives are desperate to get their hands on. The stunning locations, all craggy clifftops and Regency elegance, and similarly chiselled and reserved hero. The problem is, in an era of period dramas with extraordinarily high production values such as The Crown, or exquisitely written and envelope-pushing ones such as Gentleman Jack, Sanditon looks a little tired and conventional. Dare I say it of an Andrew Davies Austen adaptation? It’s not very sexy.And another thing … stumbled upon Jamie Oliver: The Naked Chef Bares All (C4) and although it was a sycophantic tribute dressed up as a documentary it also made me realise … I kind of love him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bed1c93df4ba156d39f7c02e64f27dd1d701b0f/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8dd821a97d4cb67b53f9a5e26fe8bca1","title":"asylum seekers limbo eu countries","story":"Backlog of claims persists despite number of arrivals almost halving in two yearsClose to 900,000 asylum seekers in the EU are waiting to have their claims processed, according to figures from the European statistics office.Women, men and unaccompanied children are living for years in uncertainty, with numbers of pending applications for international protection almost unchanged from two years ago when 1.1 million migrants were “stuck” in the continent.“Living in limbo is now the norm for those seeking protection,” said Karl Kopp of Pro Asyl, Germany’s largest pro-immigration advocacy organisation. “Limbo means living in the miserable Greek EU hotspots, or being trapped and pushed back at the borders. It means living in the desperate search for protection and human dignity.”Factors leading to the continuing backlog include new laws from right-leaning governments and an increase in the number of rejections, leading to lengthy appeals processes.“The vision of governments on the migration crisis has changed and more and more countries are rejecting an increasing number of requests for asylum,” said Fulvio Vassallo, an expert on asylum law from the University of Palermo.The German Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) has in 2019 rejected three-quarters of family reunification requests from Greece, where migrants live in the overcrowded camps of Athens and Lesbos.“If a migrant has his asylum request rejected, in any case, he is entitled to have recourse to appeal, which, however, lengthens the time waiting in limbo by up to four years,” said Vassallo. “There are migrants who arrived in 2015 and had their asylum requests denied. At that point they presented an appeal to a court and are still waiting for an answer on their future.”Experts point out how some governments in recent years, especially in Italy and Germany, have accelerated evaluation procedures for asylum requests, which appears to have caused an increase in rejections because high-speed procedures are not carried out with as much thoughtful evaluation.“The agenda of the rightwing extremists is now the agenda of the mainstream and all that matters is high speed, few or no rights in the procedure, highest possible rejection rates and increasing the deportation figures,” said Kopp. “Many rejected asylum seekers receive protection only through a legal action but years of waiting for the court decision extend the limbo situation in an intolerable way.”According to Eurostat, since 2014 there have been 3.6m requests for asylum in EU countries, only 1.8m of which have resulted in legal protection. Those who stay after rejection are at risk of suddenly becoming illegal immigrants. “This is the worrying part of this phenomenon, with thousands of people exposed to the risk of a difficult life, at the mercy of labour exploitation,” said Carlotta Sami, a spokeswoman for UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, in Italy."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3997042.1566767984!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland facing most significant september since 1922 as brexit looms","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIreland has no option but to continue insist on a backstop in the Brexit withdrawal agreement in order to prevent the return of a hard Irish border, economist Jim Power has said. File photograph: Eric LukeThe .Ireland has no option but to continue insist on a backstop in the Brexit withdrawal agreement in order to prevent the return of a hard Irish border, economist Jim Power has said.He told the annual Michael Collins Commemoration at Béal na Bláth in Co Cork that Ireland was facing into its most “significant September” since 1922 when the fledgling Free State was struggling for survival in a Civil War that claimed the life of Collins a month earlier.Mr Power said that with a no-deal Brexit looking increasingly likely on October 31st, he had recently started to question the wisdom of Ireland’s continued insistence on the backstop but now saw no alternative.“In recent times, I have questioned myself about the dangers inherent in the Irish government’s unfaltering adherence to the backstop and after much soul searching, I reach the conclusion there is no other choice based on what all the parties now find themselves,” he said.“A better solution would have been a border in the Irish Sea and a special EU status for Northern Ireland. That option was ruled out by UK government early in the process, largely at the instigation of the DUP.“Hence we are left with the backstop option- the Irish government must stand its ground and hopefully the EU will continue to back us all the way.” Recalling Collins’s courage in going to London and signing the Treaty because he believed it was in Ireland’s best interests even though he knew he was signing his death warrant, Mr Power lamented a lack of similar strong leadership among the current political generation.‘Lacks’“In any society, strong leadership from people with vision and ambition is essential - while it is easy to be overcritical of our political leaders, because ruling in a democracy is not easy, one does get a sense that Ireland still lacks the strong leadership that a modern and dynamic economy and society should possess.“‘New Politics’ and the ‘confidence and supply’ arrangement does not make it easy and is an impediment to strong leadership and policy formation,” he said, adding Ireland’s political leadership too often abdicates responsibility and decision making to non-elected bodies.He instanced the Citizens Assembly and while it had been universally lauded for what it had achieved in the marriage equality referendum and the referendum on repealing the eighth amendment, it nonetheless provided elected politicians with an excuse to abdicate responsibility.Noting that Collins had very strong views on economics and developing a functioning economy, Mr Power said it was appropriate to begin a debate on whether the current political leadership have created a country that Collins would have been proud ofHe said Collins clearly believed in the necessity of developing an economy in order to generate the resources necessary to make a society function properly and in that regard he recognised the potential of Irish agriculture and the need to develop foreign exports.ProsperityBut Collins also stressed that people should share in that prosperity on the basis of what each contributes to it and while such a view might be considered controversial today but it was a view that modern Irish society would do well not lose sight of.“Society needs to look after the less well off but sections of Irish society today very often ignore the notion that, with rights, come responsibilities. All of us who are able should contribute to society and look after those who are not able, but everybody has responsibilities.”Collins never lived to see his vision of Ireland achieved and it was after years of ruinous protectionism when Seán Lemass implemented the First Programme for Economic Expansion in 1958 that Collins’s vision for Ireland started to be realised, he noted."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3997044.1566769108!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new funding finally confirmed for state mortgage scheme","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Housing Eoghan Murphy said in April all loans approved under the scheme ‘will be honoured’. Photograph: Tom HonanThe Hundreds of millions in funding has been allocated to local authorities to bolster the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan Scheme, which was thrown into doubt following budget over-runs earlier this year.The Government committed €200 million over three years in February of last year to the low-cost mortgage scheme for first-time buyers. However, the allocation to local authorities last year was almost €210 million – more than the entire three-year budget for the programme.The value of loans approved by city and county councils last year even exceeded this figure, with mortgage applications totalling almost €224 million approved across the State, prompting some local authorities to stop accepting applications earlier this year.Following a hiatus of several months in confirming an ongoing budget for the scheme, documents seen by the  show Dublin City Council alone has had its allocation for the State-backed mortgage scheme increased to just under €130 million from the €50 million that was allocated initially. The additional €80 million is to fund the scheme to the end of this year, with additional resources expected next year.Fingal County Council, one of the local authorities which announced earlier this year that is was no longer accepting loan applications, has seen its funding rise from €20 million to more than €81 million to the end of this year.It is understood that similar increases in allocations are being issued to local authorities across the State, indicating that the sums involved will be multiples of the original budget.Low interest ratesUnder the scheme, first time buyers who have had mortgage applications rejected by a bank can borrow up to 90 per cent of the market value of a property at interest rates as low as 2 per cent over 25 years.Maximum purchase prices were set at €320,000 in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow, and €250,000 in the rest of the country. The scheme is open to iniduals with an income of up to €50,000 or couples earning up to €75,000.Several local authorities reported last March that they had run out of money for the scheme as demand had far outstripped initial expectations.He said he was in talks with the Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe and the Central Bank on this year’s allocation and that a decision on this was “imminent”. However, no announcement has since been made.A letter from the Department of Housing to Dublin City Council in recent days stated that it had an allocation of some €129.7 million up to the end of the year.“This overall allocation incorporates loans already issued since the inception of the scheme, loans which will be drawn down on foot of approvals already issued and projected loan demand for the rest of 2019,” the letter said, warning that the lending “may not exceed” the allocated amount.“Where it becomes evident that the level of demand is greater than the amount of the allocation now being notified, local authorities should contact the department before committing themselves to further lending under the scheme.”Similar letters are being sent to local authorities across the State. The funding is provided through the Housing Finance Agency and does not impact the Government’s balance sheet, the department said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3997013.1566767679!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"g7 tensions rise as iranian minister makes surprise appearance","story":"French police fire water cannons and tear gas against G7 protesters in Bayonne, just eight-and-a-half kilometres from the summit venue in Biarritz.

Photograph: AP PhotoAndrew HarnikIran’s foreign minister made a flying visit to the G7 summit for talks with host France on Sunday, as Paris ramped up efforts to ease tensions between Tehran and Washington, a dramatic diplomatic move that the White House said had surprised them.European leaders have struggled to tamp down the brewing confrontation between Iran and the US since US president Trump pulled Washington out of Iran’s internationally-brokered 2015 nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions on the Iranian economy.Mohammad Javad Zarif, who is under US sanctions, flew to the southwest French town of Biarritz where the G7 leaders are meeting. He held more than three hours of talks, including with French president Emmanuel Macron, before heading back to Tehran.“Road ahead is difficult. But worth trying,” Mr Zarif tweeted, adding that in addition to meeting French leaders he had given a joint briefing to officials from Germany and the UK. French officials sought to bill the meeting as important to “refine Iranian propositions” to help defuse the crisis after G7 leaders had discussed Iran over dinner on Saturday night.“The discussions that were held between the president and Zarif were positive and will continue,” a French official said after the meeting, declining to take detailed questionsA French official said earlier that there was no plan for Mr Zarif to meet members of Mr Trump’s delegation at the summit venue, the Basque beachside town of Biarritz.Iranian UN mission spokesman Alireza Miryousefi posted on Twitter: “No meeting with Americans in Biarritz.”Asked about reports of Mr Zarif’s arrival at Biarritz, which had been closed for the Saturday-Monday summit of the seven industrialised nations, Mr Trump said: “No comment.”However, a White House official later said Mr Trump was not forewarned by France that Iran’s foreign minister would make an appearance, saying it was “a surprise”.Other delegations said they had been informed at the last minute. The Élysée said delegations had been informed, but everything had happened very quickly.Raft of issuesThe G7 meeting was already troubled by differences between Mr Trump and western allies over a raft of issues, including Iran.Earlier on Sunday at the summit, Mr Trump appeared to brush aside French efforts to mediate with Iran, saying that while he was happy for Paris to reach out to Tehran to defuse tensions, he would carry on with his own initiatives.France said G7 leaders had agreed Mr Macron should hold talks on the issue and pass on messages to Iran. However, Mr Trump, who has pushed a maximum pressure policy on Iran, distanced himself from the proposal, saying he had not even discussed it.Mr Macron, who has taken the lead in trying to defuse tensions, fearing that a collapse of the nuclear deal could set the Middle East ablaze, had met Mr Zarif on Friday. The aim of the meeting was to discuss plans to ease the crisis, including reducing some US sanctions or providing Iran with an economic compensation mechanism.The US has made no indication it will ease any sanctions, with G7 leaders reportedly unable to persuade Mr Trump to soften his stance on Iran at a dinner on Saturday. It is also unclear what kind of compensation mechanism Mr Macron wants to offer Iran.Mr Macron has said that in return for any concessions he would expect Iran to comply fully with the nuclear deal and for Iran to engage in new negotiations that would cover its ballistic missile programme and regional activities.Highlighting just how difficult it will be to ease tensions, two Iranian officials and one diplomat told Reuters on Sunday that Iran wants to export a minimum of 700,000 barrels per day of its oil and ideally up to 1.5 million barrels per day if the West wants to negotiate with Tehran to save the nuclear deal.One of the Iranian officials also said Iran’s ballistic missile programme was not open for negotiation.Getting alongMr Trump insisted on Sunday that he was getting along well with other leaders of a group that includes the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan as well as the US.Indeed, the US and Japan agreed in principle on Sunday to core elements of a trade deal that Mr Trump and Japan’s prime minister Shinzo Abe said they hoped to sign in New York next month.The agreement, if finalised, would cool a trade dispute between the two allies. The deal reportedly covers agriculture, industrial tariffs and digital trade. Auto tariffs would remain unchanged.But rifts remain between the seven states on other issues, ranging from Mr Trump’s quickening trade war with China to the nuclear ambitions of North Korea, and the question of whether Russia’s president Vladimir Putin should be readmitted to the group.Mr Trump had appeared at odds with Mr Abe earlier in the summit over the seriousness of North Korea’s series of launches of short-range missiles.Mr Trump, who prizes his relationship with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, told reporters the launches did not violate an agreement and were in line with what others were doing. Mr Abe, sitting across from him, said they breached UN resolutions.Russia was excluded from what used to be the G8 in 2014 after it annexed Ukraine’s Crimea and then backed an anti-Kiev rebellion in the industrial region of Donbas in eastern Ukraine.A European official who declined to be named said Russia was the most contentious issue discussed at a dinner on Saturday evening, with Japan neutral and Italy leaning slightly towards the US position.Mr Trump’s argument was that on a number of issues, like Iran and Syria, it made more sense to have Mr Putin involved in the group’s talks, given that Russia is a key player there.Global slowdownThe G7 gathering is taking place against a backdrop of worries that a global economic downturn could be exacerbated by the escalating tariff war between Washington and Beijing.Mr Johnson voiced concern on Saturday about creeping protectionism and said those who support tariffs “are at risk of incurring the blame for the downturn in the global economy”. Sitting across from Mr Trump on Sunday, he said: “We’re in favour of trade peace on the whole, and dialling it down if we can.”Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte warned other leaders of the dangers of protectionism and urged Washington not to follow through on its threat to impose tariffs on German autos.However, the White House doubled down on its aggressive stance towards trade with China.White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham, explaining what Mr Trump meant at a summit news conference when he said he had had second thoughts after he raised tariffs against China last week, said he meant that he wished he had raised them higher.Underlining the multilateral discord, even before the summit began Mr Trump had threatened the meeting’s host, saying Washington would tax French wine “like they’ve never seen before” unless Paris dropped a digital tax affecting US technology companies.Broaden debateLooking to broaden the scope of debate, Mr Macron has invited several African leaders to discuss problems facing their continent at the summit, while leaders from India, Australia, Chile and Spain were due to attend a dinner on Sunday with a focus on the environment and other issues.However, senior US officials accused Mr Macron of looking “to fracture the G7” by focusing on “niche issues” rather than major global concerns.France denied this, pointing to Sunday’s initial session covering the economy, trade and security – areas that used to draw easy consensus but are now sources of great friction.Mr Trump upended last year’s G7 meeting in Canada, walking out early and disassociating himself from the final communique.At the start of the day, Mr Trump said the UK would have a major trade deal with Washington after it leaves the EU. Asked what his advice on Brexit was for Mr Johnson, he replied: “He needs no advice, he is the right man for the job.”While the transatlantic rift is the most stark, there are also deep isions within the European camp, with Mr Johnson making his G7 debut at a time when he is struggling to persuade EU capitals to renegotiate the terms of the UK’s exit from the bloc, which Mr Johnson has said will happen on October 31st come what may. – Reuters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons august 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Order The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Job advert jargon puts off applicants, survey finds, as \u0026#34thought shower\u0026#34 and \u0026#34cloud-first\u0026#34 are declared worst termsFlight delays more than doubled in the past four years, study finds, as millions of passengers suffer holiday woesChildren too busy with their iPads to have an imaginary friend, as nursery workers say the tradition is dying offTransport secretary Grant Shapps refuses to back fuel tax cuts as he vows to deliver electric car revolution 50 towns bid for £1 billion fund to re-invent high streets by turning them into community hubsBoris Johnson goes to war with BBC by demanding it \u0026#39coughs up\u0026#39 for over-75s free TV licence feesOpposition parties in disarray over plans to block Boris Johnson on \u0026#39no-deal\u0026#39 BrexitEmergency services called to Essex seaside after reports of people coughing and struggling to breatheBoris Johnson pledges £10 million to help restore and protect fire-ravaged Amazon Sanditon, episode 1, review: Jane Austen with lashings of sun, sand and sex - but will viewers crave something more?Peaky Blinders, series 5 episode 1, review: The Brummie gangster drama comes back bloody, blazing and bawlingBat poo no longer blights church and interrupts service, as worshippers rejoice over new scheme The tablets that help cure cancellationsComment: A free school army will end the Left’s stranglehold on educationHospital appointments cancelled 10 times in a row amid NHS chaosPoldark, series 5 episode 7, review: What a mess!

And comes at the end of a wet and chilly month. On Saturday, Gogerddan, near Aberystwyth, recorded 81.3F (27.4C) - a new record for the highest late August holiday weekend temperature in Wales.Millions attending events such as the Leeds and Reading Festivals and the Notting Hill Carnival in London were warned to drink plenty of water, stay covered and apply sunscreen to avoid dehydration and sunstroke. Met Office meteorologist Sarah Kent said: It is a bank holiday weekend. There is a lot of sunshine about to be had but people need to exercise some common sense.The Rhyl Air Show was delayed due to the weather, according to North Wales Police.Denbighshire County Council said that unexpected sea fog had hit the event and the visibility levels needed for display flying.Revellers at the Notting Hill Carnival were urged to drink water Motorists were urged to take extra care and expect delays as the hot weather made breakdowns more likely.RAC spokesman Rod Dennis said: As the temperature rises so can the chances of a breakdown - so it\u0027s important drivers check over their vehicle before setting out. Tyre pressure and tread, as well as oil and coolant levels, should all be looked at and doing so can really cut the chances of breaking down.Hungry, thirsty or tired passengers can also be recipes for in-car irritability - and \u0027carguments\u0027 - so pack enough food and water to keep your passengers happy, and plan in enough breaks along the way.A 63-year-old man man died this weekend after swimming at Hell’s Mouth near Gwithian, Cornwall, a section of water known for powerful currents and treacherous rocks.Record heat coupled with wet weather has created the perfect environment for fleas to thrive, according to exterminators Rentokil.Calls about the unwanted visitors to the pest controllers shot up in July compared to the previous month and with the same period last year. Flea inquiries jumped by 415 per cent from June to July.Temperatures are expected to rise even further by Monday, breaking the current August Bank Holiday record of 82.76F (28.2C).The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Mr Macron then told the other leaders during dinner on Saturday night.“There was a very substantial conversation among the G7 leaders,” the source said.  The source added that the French and Iranian foreign ministers were also discussing “regional issues and Iran’s missile programme”.“We are working in total transparency with our US partners,” he said.Angela Merkel said she was only informed shortly before Mr Zarif arrived. A White House official said Donald Trump was not told that Emmanuel Macron had invited Javad ZarifEarlier the French president played down briefings by his aides that the G7 leaders had mandated him to lead talks with Iran, which was quickly denied by Mr Trump who said the idea had not been discussed. Mr Macron said there was no such thing as a “G7 mandate” as the group is a forum for discussion rather than a formal structure.The Iranian foreign ministry said Mr Zarif had flown in for talks on saving the 2015 nuclear deal, but denied that Iran\u0027s missile programme was up for discussion. It said no talks with Mr Trump or the US delegation are planned.Mr Macron is hosting Mr Trump, Boris Johnson, Angela Merkel, Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, Canada’s Justin Trudeau, and Giuseppe Conte, Italy’s caretaker prime minister, at the 45th G7 summit. Britain\u0026#39s Prime Minister Boris Johnson meets U.S. President Donald Trump for bilateral talks during the G7 summit The meeting has exposed deep rifts over everything from the fires in the Amazon rain forest to Mr Trump’s trade war with China, and Mr Macron has warned that it will likely be the first summit in the Group’s 45 year history to end without a joint communique.There were reportedly lively discussions at Saturday night’s dinner of local Basque cuisine when European leaders including Mr Johnson pushed back at Mr Trump\u0027s suggestion that Russian president Vladimir Putin, who was suspended from the G7 after annexing Crimea in 2014, should be readmitted to the forum.Mr Trump and Mr Macron have also clashed over a proposed French digital tax which would hit US tech giants like Google and Amazon. Mr Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on French wine in retaliation. Mr Trump sought to play down reports of ision on Sunday, saying meetings so far have been “very good”.“Before I arrived in France, the Fake and Disgusting News was saying that relations with the 6 others countries in the G-7 are very tense, and that the two days of meetings will be a disaster,” Mr Trump tweeted. An Iranian government plane is seen on the tarmac at Biarritz airport in Anglet on Sunday  “Well, we are having very good meetings, the Leaders are getting along very well, and our Country, economically, is doing great — the talk of the world!”Tensions between the US and Iran have spiralled since Mr Trump last year withdrew from a deal that offered Iran sanctions relief in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear programme.Since then the US has pursued a policy of “maximum pressure” in the hope that economic hardship will force the regime in Tehran to accept a more restrictive deal and end its support for armed groups like Hizbollah.The confrontation has caused tension with European allies including Britain which still support the 2015 nuclear deal.  Iran continues to hold the Stena Impero, a British flagged tanker that it seized in the Gulf in apparent retaliation for the arrest by Royal Marines of an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar in July. Gibraltar released the Adrian Darya 1, formerly the Grace 1, on August 18, despite a US legal bid to impound it. The Royal Navy sent a third warship to the provide maritime security in the Strait of Hormuz on Saturday.  HMS Defender, a type 45 destroyer, will join the type 23 frigates HMS Kent and HMS Montrose.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

It also suggests that search could be more likely to find life on exoplanets than we had thought.This is a surprising conclusion, said lead researcher Dr Stephanie Olson.\u0026nbspIt shows us that conditions on some exoplanets with favourable ocean circulation patterns could be better suited to support life that is more abundant or more active than life on Earth.In recent years, scientists have found huge numbers of exoplanets, or worlds orbiting around stars that are not our own. But they are all very far away – impossible to reach even with the fastest space probes, and difficult even to see in any detail.Researchers are working on a variety of ways to learn about those worlds, including telescopes that will be able to sniff their atmospheres and learn more about what the planets could be made of.

The work was presented at the\u0026nbspGoldschmidt\u0026nbspGeochemistry\u0026nbspCongress in\u0026nbspBarcelona.Nasa watching planet for signs of alien life after discoveryNASA\u0027s search for life in the Universe is focused on so-called Habitable Zone planets, which are worlds that have the potential for liquid water oceans, she said.\u0026nbspBut not all oceans are equally hospitable – and some oceans will be better places to live than others due to their global circulation patterns.To conduct the study, the team made models of those planets using Nasa software, which allows them to simulate the conditions on those exoplanets. Using that Nasa technology, they were able to create models of the possible climates and oceans that could be on those exoplanets.They found that many of them seemed like more hospitable and flourishing places for life than even Earth is. They looked at the process in Earth\u0027s oceans that allows life to take root down here – and considered whether that same process could be happening elsewhere in the universe.Our work has been aimed at identifying the exoplanet oceans which have the greatest capacity to host globally abundant and active life, said Dr Olson in a statement.Life in Earth\u0027s oceans depends on upwelling (upward flow) which returns nutrients from the dark depths of the ocean to the sunlit portions of the ocean where photosynthetic life lives. More upwelling means more nutrient resupply, which means more biological activity.These are the conditions we need to look for on exoplanets.By modelling a variety of different exoplanets, the researchers were able to think about which types would be most likely to develop and then sustain life. And they were surprised to find that Earth is not the best kind – and that there may be other worlds out there that are a far better place for life to begin.We have used an ocean circulation model to identify which planets will have the most efficient upwelling and thus offer particularly hospitable oceans, she said.\u0026nbspWe found that higher atmospheric density, slower rotation rates, and the presence of continents all yield higher upwelling rates.A further implication is that Earth might not be optimally habitable – and life elsewhere may enjoy a planet that is even more hospitable than our own.The work is important because our technology means that we are unable to see everything: there is almost certainly more life than we will ever be able to see, even with the most advanced telescopes and other equipment. That means scientists will need to optimise their search by looking at the planets where life will find it easiest to find a home.We expect oceans to be important in regulating some of the most compelling remotely detectable signs of life on habitable worlds, but our understanding of oceans beyond our solar system is currently very rudimentary, said\u0026nbspChris\u0026nbspReinhard, from the Georgia Institute of Technology, who wasn\u0027t involved in the study.\u0026nbspDr\u0026nbspOlson\u0027s work represents a significant and exciting step forward in our understanding of exoplanet oceanography.The new research could now help inform how new telescopes are built, since we now know what kinds of planets will be best to search for. Now we know what to look for, so we need to start looking, said Dr Olson.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That has to be the cruellest thing in the world.“Babs always recognises me when she sees me but then I don’t know what it would be like the following day. Every time I have seen her, she has given me a big hug and she has these sparkling eyes and she is ‘Allo, sweetheart’. She is lovely.”Richie, who has appeared on EastEnders on and off since 2002, said he hopes his former co-star can attend his new stage show.Created with Sketch.Dame Barbara Windsor: career in pictures Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Barbara Windsor was made Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to charity and entertainment.Practicing her high kicks at Aida Foster School for the role of Red Riding HoodAppearing in the West End Musical \u0027Fings aint what they used to be\u0027During filming of \u0027Crooks in the Cloisters\u0027Windsor sporting her now infamous blonde barnet Windsor playing a hitchhiker in British comedy \u0027San Ferry Ann\u0027Starring in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang With first husband Ronnie Knight Appearing alongside Sid James in Carry On film \u0027Carry On Henry\u0027Barbara Windsor at the Bafta Television AwardsBarbara Windsor as her most famous character, Eastenders\u0027 Peggy MitchellWith Steve McFadden who plays her on-screen son Phil Mitchell in EastEnders at the National Television AwardsWith some of the EastEnders cast at the National Television Awards.

When someone of his standing makes a statement like that, it should give pause for thought.But according to Daniel Pitchford, co-founder of AI Business, this view, while pretty common, is over-egging the situation slightly.Pitchford set up AI Business, an “online content portal for artificial intelligence and its real-world applications” back in 2014 with the intention of demystifying AI for businesses and trying to cut through some of the more hyperbolic beliefs about AI.There is no doubting Musk is not alone in his apocalyptic view of AI so Pitchford clearly has his work cut out in converting the business masses but what, in his view, is behind this rather extreme reaction?\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

What is the ROI and outcome before you start. Is that realistic?\u0026nbsp“A lot of people think AI is going to change the world and if they plug a piece of software or application on top of what they are already doing\u0026nbsptheir business is going to transform overnight, and then end up bitterly disappointed when it isn’t,” he says.The fear stems from change. Whether it is AI or whether it is the industrial revolution – whatever the change is – that is what people fear because humans don’t really like to changeWhich is where he hopes his business can play a crucial role. Starting out as a blog written in his and his business partner’s spare time, AI Business quickly grew to become a trusted source of AI insight for business across the world by producing business-useful content, in contrast to the academic content that dominated at the time.But with his background in business event production, Pitchford was aware that for AI Business to become truly indispensable to the business community, it had to adopt a thoroughly analogue approach and bring vendors and businesses together face to face.From 400 attendees at its\u0026nbspinaugural AI Summit in London in 2016, AI Business is now the leading brand globally hosting events in London, New York, San Francisco, Munich, Hong Kong, Singapore and Cape Town. The 2019 Summit in London alone drew 25,000 AI enthusiasts.So clearly there is an appetite to understand the applications and implications of AI in the business world,\u0026nbspbut what is the destination?\u0026nbsp“Ultimately, the future of AI is about increasing productivity and that’s what politicians and governments get excited about – what can it do for our GDP? That is the big end goal,” Pitchford explains.Elon Musk’s AI project to replicate the human brain just received $1bnA 2017 report from PWC estimated that UK GDP could increase by more than 10 per cent\u0026nbspby 2030 as a result of AI, a cash equivalent of £232bn, which is no small shakes.But the UK is not the only nation eyeing the benefits of AI, with Pitchford outlining a global AI arms race between China and the US, each vying for the position of the world’s AI superpower.“A lot of people are saying China will emerge as the AI superpower. Over the last two years, Asia has overtaken Europe in terms of the amount being invested by enterprises and businesses in the adoption of AI whereas two years ago, Europe was ahead.”He says that China’s rapid emergence can be explained by the level of investment the Chinese government is putting into AI with latest estimates placing it as high as $300bn\u0026nbsp(£240bn): “As you move from innovation to implementation there is a massive opportunity which they are acutely aware of, hence the investment they are pouring in.”Such is the rate of change in AI development and implementation, it would be foolish to bet on any one nation or region becoming the dominant power just yet. But in the meantime, AI Business\u0026nbspintends to build on its own dominance in this space following its recent acquisition by publishing giant Informa.“The future is scale,” Pitchford says. “What we have with Informa is that opportunity of scale. The scale of the events and other acquisitions made by the group help that in terms of collaboration and opportunities.”And as for the allegedly demonic heart of AI? Pitchford says that proponents are acutely aware of the potential dangers and are actively addressing it.“There is a lot being invested by the big players in understanding how AI can support society rather than just generate profit,” he says.\u0026nbspSo perhaps the robot apocalypse might yet be averted by traditional human compassion.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

And I’d enjoyed it.\u0026nbspI couldn’t tell you the last time that happened.\u0026nbspThis led me to ask a question: with the British town centre in crisis –\u0026nbspthe number of vacant premises at its\u0026nbsphighest level for more than four years –\u0026nbspis there anything we could learn from the place?Labour promises free wifi in town centres and scrapping ATM chargesHigh streets propose five-year plan for digital technology sales boostYou have to be a little bit careful at the outset. We’re talking here about a picturesque and historic walled town in the middle of a region that attracts a large number of visitors.You’re not going to be able to replicate what it has across Britain. \u0026nbspBut here’s the thing: similarly\u0026nbsptouristy places\u0026nbspon this side of the channel are struggling in a way that Dinan at least doesn’t appear to be.Nationally, the British Retail Consortium puts the vacancy rate at 10.3 per cent. Footfall declined by 1.9 per cent in July.\u0026nbspIt isn’t just economically deprived areas that are struggling either. Last year it was reported that there were 42 vacant premises in the picturesque city of Bath, for example. It’s a good deal bigger than Dinan, but is a similar tourist trap thanks to the world-famous Roman baths, which have given the city the status of a Unesco\u0026nbspworld heritage site and put it high on the itinerary of visitors to the region.\u0026nbspCampaigner Luke John Emmett successfully drew attention to the city centre’s plight with the aid of a camera. He says while landlords have made efforts to make some of the empty premises look less unsightly since then, and new tenants are promised, the problem continues.\u0026nbspAs retailers continue to close stores, the issue of empty shopfronts looks set to continue to plague the British high street.\u0026nbspSo to Dinan. What made mooching around the place such a pleasure was the sheer variety of what this small town had to offer.\u0026nbspOf course we saw places catering for the tourist euro, but there were also bookshops, a toyshop, bakeries, a place where a bloke was selling lights built out of scrap, an indoor market.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s not that they aren’t there. There was, of course, a Carrefour convenience outlet, broadly equivalent to Tesco . There was also a bookie, in the form of a PMU bar. But they weren’t dominant features in\u0026nbspthe same way that they are in Britain.\u0026nbspThe retreat of the chains could provide an opportunity for small and more specialist outlets to move in, especially in places like Bath which have a ready supply of visitors.But, of course, there are high rents to contend with and the running sore of business rates linked to property values that are far\u0026nbsphigher in town centres than they are on the outskirts where internet retailers like Amazon build their warehouses.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 30. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi’s mother?Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened. But there are plenty of positives to be found, since Pocahontas was such a huge influence in Disney’s later portrayals of strong, independently minded women. The film may be relatively light on story (it’s basically Lady and the Tramp, but there’s an added kidnap element), but who cares, when the film features the hottest party of the entire Disney franchise? It’s true what they say: “Everybody wants to be a cat.” In a way, Robin Hood is the ultimate Disney film of the 1970s. It’s a folksy, low-key entry into the canon that’s all about keeping the peace and spreading good vibes. Just ignore the fact that it recycled several pieces of animation from the likes of Snow White and The Jungle Book.It may not have spawned the same level of craze as Frozen did, but Zootopia doesn’t deserve to become another forgotten Disney film. Although it’s as funny as you’d hope from a film about animals with jobs, it also offers parents an easy entry point to talk to their kids about racism and xenophobia. And that’s something that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Dumbo demonstrates the two gifts of early Disney films. There’s the capacity for moments that are pure and heartwrenching, as seen in “Baby Mine” (a scene that’s almost impossible to watch without welling up). Then there’s the ability to descend into the totally bizarre, as characterised by the downright scary “Pink Elephants on Parade” sequence. Tangled finds fun, humour, and adventure in its reimagining of the Rapunzel tale, but what’s crucial to its success is how it anchors the entire film around a single, showstopping sequence: “I See the Light”, where Rapunzel watches hundreds of paper lanterns float up into the skies. It’s, quite simply, a beautiful piece of filmmaking. 930 22. Princess and the Frog (2009)Disney’s brief return to traditional animation reminded us what had been lost in the switch to 3D animation. There’s a wonderful sense of artistry to how The Princess and the Frog renders New Orleans during the Jazz Age, especially in the Art Deco stylised number “Almost There”. And a Disney princess working hard to make her dreams come true? That’s something to celebrate. Although Cinderella is a central member of the Disney princesses, her film hasn’t aged quite as well as the rest of the early Disney films. There’s an odd amount of time spent on Lucifer the cat, and relatively little time spent at Cinderella’s magical soiree. 1130 20. One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)Cruella de Vil may have committed attempted puppy murder, but there’s still something irresistibly delightful about her “Patsy from Ab Fab” combination of luxury goods and frightening taste. Only Cruella could answer a simple “How are you?” with the line: Miserable darling, as usual, perfectly wretched.”1230 19. Lady and the Tramp (1955)One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn’t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous “Bella Notte” scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime.Disney took the straightfoward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa\u0027i helped create the soundtrack’s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour – more of this in the future please, Disney. The Emperor’s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo \u0026amp Stitch, it’s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor’s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (“Pull the lever, Kronk!”) Disney film that – most importantly – finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. It may be every modern parent’s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you’ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel’s rendition of “Let it Go” is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie’s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and orce don’t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There’s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White’s aid during “Whistle While You Work”, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.”A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy “Zero to Hero”. That said, Megara’s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this” routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Let them deny it all they want, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn’t secretly put “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan’s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince. As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney’s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into “The Bear Necessities”, it feels very much like someone’s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything’s going to be alright. Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams’s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. 2230 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951)Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney’s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn’t get lost in Lewis Caroll’s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there’s no denying its status as a cult classic now. 2330 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There’s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption – take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it’s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film’s PG rating. 2430 7. Lilo and Stitch (2002)Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo \u0026amp Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch’s more unusual characteristics, and you’ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It’s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream. Putting “When You Wish Upon a Star” – the song that best captures Walt Disney’s dream – aside for a moment, let’s remember just how much of a surrealist nightmare the Pleasure Island sequence really is. “Be virtuous or you’ll be turned into a literal donkey,” was quite the threat for an America only recently freed from the grip of Prohibition. It’s a weird and wonderful entry from Disney’s early years. We’re free to question Ariel’s decision to trade her voice so she can chase after a cute guy she met only once, but she will always remain the most loveable dinglehopper-collecting weirdo around. Ariel’s unquenchable curiosity is what makes this aquatic tale so charming, second only to the fact its villain was inspired by the legendary Divine. Plus, “Under the Sea” is such a party tune. Sleeping Beauty is Disney’s most beautiful film, thanks to the fact artists John Hench and Eyvind Earle drew heavily from Medieval tapestries, Renaissance art, and even Japanese prints. It gives the feeling of actually flipping through a storybook, as Aurora wanders a forest that looks as if it’s made entirely of stained glass. And, truly, has there ever been a Disney villain as deviously elegant as Maleficient? One of Disney’s boldest and most avant garde films, Fantasia is simply masterful in its concept. A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey’s appearance in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them – the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. 2930 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991)If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly “a tale as old as time”, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Produced at the height of Disney’s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare’s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to “Circle of Life”, you can’t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time. 130 30. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi’s mother?Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened. But there are plenty of positives to be found, since Pocahontas was such a huge influence in Disney’s later portrayals of strong, independently minded women.

Just ignore the fact that it recycled several pieces of animation from the likes of Snow White and The Jungle Book.It may not have spawned the same level of craze as Frozen did, but Zootopia doesn’t deserve to become another forgotten Disney film. Although it’s as funny as you’d hope from a film about animals with jobs, it also offers parents an easy entry point to talk to their kids about racism and xenophobia. And that’s something that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Dumbo demonstrates the two gifts of early Disney films. There’s the capacity for moments that are pure and heartwrenching, as seen in “Baby Mine” (a scene that’s almost impossible to watch without welling up). Then there’s the ability to descend into the totally bizarre, as characterised by the downright scary “Pink Elephants on Parade” sequence. Tangled finds fun, humour, and adventure in its reimagining of the Rapunzel tale, but what’s crucial to its success is how it anchors the entire film around a single, showstopping sequence: “I See the Light”, where Rapunzel watches hundreds of paper lanterns float up into the skies. It’s, quite simply, a beautiful piece of filmmaking. 930 22. Princess and the Frog (2009)Disney’s brief return to traditional animation reminded us what had been lost in the switch to 3D animation. There’s a wonderful sense of artistry to how The Princess and the Frog renders New Orleans during the Jazz Age, especially in the Art Deco stylised number “Almost There”. And a Disney princess working hard to make her dreams come true? That’s something to celebrate. Although Cinderella is a central member of the Disney princesses, her film hasn’t aged quite as well as the rest of the early Disney films. There’s an odd amount of time spent on Lucifer the cat, and relatively little time spent at Cinderella’s magical soiree. 1130 20. One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)Cruella de Vil may have committed attempted puppy murder, but there’s still something irresistibly delightful about her “Patsy from Ab Fab” combination of luxury goods and frightening taste. Only Cruella could answer a simple “How are you?” with the line: Miserable darling, as usual, perfectly wretched.”1230 19. Lady and the Tramp (1955)One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn’t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous “Bella Notte” scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime.Disney took the straightfoward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa\u0027i helped create the soundtrack’s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour – more of this in the future please, Disney. The Emperor’s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo \u0026amp Stitch, it’s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor’s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (“Pull the lever, Kronk!”) Disney film that – most importantly – finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. It may be every modern parent’s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you’ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel’s rendition of “Let it Go” is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie’s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and orce don’t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There’s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White’s aid during “Whistle While You Work”, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.”A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy “Zero to Hero”. That said, Megara’s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this” routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Let them deny it all they want, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn’t secretly put “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan’s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince. As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney’s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into “The Bear Necessities”, it feels very much like someone’s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything’s going to be alright. Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams’s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. 2230 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951)Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney’s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn’t get lost in Lewis Caroll’s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there’s no denying its status as a cult classic now. 2330 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There’s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption – take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it’s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film’s PG rating. 2430 7. Lilo and Stitch (2002)Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo \u0026amp Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch’s more unusual characteristics, and you’ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It’s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream. Putting “When You Wish Upon a Star” – the song that best captures Walt Disney’s dream – aside for a moment, let’s remember just how much of a surrealist nightmare the Pleasure Island sequence really is. “Be virtuous or you’ll be turned into a literal donkey,” was quite the threat for an America only recently freed from the grip of Prohibition. It’s a weird and wonderful entry from Disney’s early years. We’re free to question Ariel’s decision to trade her voice so she can chase after a cute guy she met only once, but she will always remain the most loveable dinglehopper-collecting weirdo around. Ariel’s unquenchable curiosity is what makes this aquatic tale so charming, second only to the fact its villain was inspired by the legendary Divine. Plus, “Under the Sea” is such a party tune. Sleeping Beauty is Disney’s most beautiful film, thanks to the fact artists John Hench and Eyvind Earle drew heavily from Medieval tapestries, Renaissance art, and even Japanese prints. It gives the feeling of actually flipping through a storybook, as Aurora wanders a forest that looks as if it’s made entirely of stained glass. And, truly, has there ever been a Disney villain as deviously elegant as Maleficient? One of Disney’s boldest and most avant garde films, Fantasia is simply masterful in its concept. A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey’s appearance in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them – the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. 2930 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991)If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly “a tale as old as time”, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Produced at the height of Disney’s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare’s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to “Circle of Life”, you can’t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time. The first of a number of future Star Wars TV series on Disney+,\u0026nbspThe Mandalorian stars Pedro Pascal as a lone bounty hunter roaming the wasteland left behind after the downfall of the Empire at the end of Return of the Jedi.Pascal is surrounded by an eclectic cast that includes Carl Weathers, Giancarlo Esposito, Gina Carano, Nick Nolte and the literal Werner Herzog, who is reliably snarling and menacing in the trailer.Following years of speculation, Ewan McGregor is indeed returning to the Star Wars universe and reprising his role as Obi-Wan Kenobi. According to Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy, the scripts for the series have already been written, with production due to begin in 2020.It was previously reported that the character, played by Alec Guinness in the original trilogy, would be getting his own film, but following the disappointing box office performance of the Han Solo spin-off movie Solo: A Star Wars Story, the studio has decided to proceed with the project on the small screen.Ms Marvel, She-Hulk and Moon KnightWhile we know little about any of these projects\u0026nbspother than the fact that they’re in development, TV series based on comic book characters Ms Marvel, She-Hulk and Moon Knight are in the pipeline. In her current incarnation, Ms Marvel is the first Muslim superhero to headline her own Marvel comic book. Moon Knight is a former US marine who transforms into a costumed vigilante at night, while She-Hulk is historically the cousin of male-Hulk Dr Bruce Banner.According to the Hollywood Reporter, British writer and comedian Bisha K Ali will write the Ms Marvel series.After appearing on stage to perform a rendition of “We’re All In This Together” from the original High School Musical, the cast of the TV series adaptation introduced the show’s first trailer. The new High School Musical is in truth a mockumentary (which explains the convoluted title) that follows a group of high school students auditioning for their school play… which is High School Musical itself.Lady and the TrampThe first trailer for Disney’s live-action remake of the animated classic was also released. The new film finds Tessa Thompson and Justin Theroux voicing the dogs of the title, with real-life rescue dogs supplying their form (though with some CGI assistance to make their mouths move). Kiersey Clemons and Thomas Mann are Lady’s live-action owners, while Janelle Monae, Sam Elliott and Ken Jeong are among the supporting voiceover cast.Disney+ launches on 12 November in the US, Canada,\u0026nbspAustralia and the Netherlands, but a UK launch date remains unannounced so far.Lady and the Tramp\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ricci’s deadpan performance is so gloriously apathetic and mean that she comfortably steals the show from her adult co-stars, and deservedly had her role beefed up for the film’s sequel. (AW)218 Saoirse Ronan in Atonement (2007)Since Atonement, Ronan has become one of the most accomplished actors of her generation. And it’s no surprise, given how convincingly she brought to life, at the age of 13, Ian McEwan’s precocious and stubborn protagonist Briony Tallis, whose misinterpretation of a romantic encounter between her sister and her childhood friend wreaks havoc in the lives of those around her. (EH)318 Quvenzhané Wallis in Beasts of the Southern Wild (2012)Quvenzhané Wallis is proof that lying sometimes gets you places. As a five-year-old, the child star convinced her parents to let her fib about her age so that she could audition for Beasts of the Southern Wild – their minimum age was six. So impressed was director Benh Zeitlin by Wallis that he changed his entire script so that the character of Hushpuppy matched her stubborn personality. At the age of nine, she became the youngest Best Actress nominee in Oscars history. (JS)418 Aleksei Kravchenko in Come and See (1985)Horrific war film Come and See – which depicts Nazism through a child’s eyes – is a nightmarish but essential experience, if only to witness the performance of Aleksei Kravchenko. It would have been tough for an actor of any age to film the scenes asked of him by director Elem Klimov let alone a 14-year old one, but Kravchenko commits so nobly it’s hard to tear your eyes from the screen. He found the shoot so troubling that he reportedly developed grey hair. (JS)518 Jean-Pierre Léaud in The 400 Blows (1959)Jean-Pierre Léaud was one of several hundred boys who François Truffaut auditioned for The 400 Blows and it’s easy to see why he won the role. In Truffaut, Léaud found a mentor –  he took control of the 15-year-old\u0027s upbringing when shooting ended after he was expelled from school and kicked out of his carers’ home – and Léaud would return as the character five more times. (JS)618 Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone (1990)Considering he starts Home Alone as an obnoxious “little jerk”, it’s a testament to Macaulay Culkin’s skill that Kevin McCallister manages to worm his way into viewers’ hearts . Culkin has insane amounts of fun ruling the roost when his family accidentally forget to bring him on their Christmas holiday, and it never fails to be a gleeful experience watching Kevin runs rings around bumbling burglars Harry (Daniel Stern) and Marv (Joe Pesci). (JS)718 Abigail Breslin in Little Miss Sunshine (2006)Breslin became one of the youngest Oscar nominees of all time when she received a nod for Best Supporting Actress for her performance, aged 10, as Olive Hoover in the beloved 2006 road movie. She played an underdog youngster on a mission to win a beauty contest, accompanied by her quirky and dysfunctional family, with real wit and flair. (EH)818 Alex Hibbert in Moonlight (2016)Giving a performance in perfect symmetry to the film around him, Alex Hibbert is one of a number of brilliantly subtle actors in Moonlight. Only on screen for the film’s first third, he mostly inhabits a quiet and devastating yearning, embodying a character buried under the emotional weight of playground bullying and constant domestic upheaval, and desperate for someone to show him compassion and answer his questions. If Hollywood has any sense, Moonlight will be just the first of many incredible opportunities for the young star. (AW)918 Mara Wilson in Mrs Doubtfire (1993)Mara Wilson is one of those great child star success stories, immortalised in at least three classic movies while still in single-digits, retiring early, and now writing, podcasting and saying smart, funny things on Twitter. But while 1996’s Matilda is often talked about as her best work, she was somehow even more brilliant in Mrs Doubtfire three years earlier, where she is adorable and grouchy and seems to possess a beautifully sincere, if today bittersweet, joy over merely being in Robin Williams’s company. (AW)1018 Isabelle Fuhrman in Orphan (2009)Isabelle Fuhrman is scarily convincing in her role as Esther, the sickly-sweet orphan girl turned murderous dwarf asylum escapee. The sexual and violent nature of some scenes may be uncomfortable to watch, but there is no denying Fuhrman executes them perfectly. (MH)1118 Tatum O’Neal in Paper Moon (1973)Tatum O’Neal was, and still is, the youngest person to ever win an Oscar for her role as the sassy, smoking, swindling tomboy Addie in Paper Moon. Addie may or may not be the daughter of con man Moses, who is reluctantly saddled with the youngster before realising she can help him with his scams. Moses is played by O’Neal’s real-life father Ryan O’Neal, and there’s just no faking that kind of chemistry. (AP)1218 Lindsay Lohan in The Parent Trap (1998)Lohan was just 12 when she played identical twins Annie and Hallie in the 1998 classic. While the sisters were of course impossible to distinguish by their looks, their personalities and backgrounds could hardly have been more different: one was a well-to-do Londoner, the other a boisterous American tomboy. The young star impressed audiences with her ability to switch effortlessly and convincingly between the two. (EH)1318 Heather O’Rourke in Poltergeist (1982)Heather O’Rourke tragically died aged just 12 in 1988, but she will long be remembered as the ethereal blonde Carol Anne Freeling. Cast after a chance meeting with Steven Spielberg, she captivates the audience as a little girl who can communicate with “the other side” through the family television set. (MH)1418 Jacob Tremblay in Room (2015)Egregiously overlooked for an Oscar in 2016, Jacob Tremblay\u0027s performance in Room will pull out heartstrings you never knew you had. As Jack, a long-haired five-year-old who has been imprisoned in a garden shed all his life and is oblivious to the outside world, he not only raises the film\u0027s cute quotient, but also brings surprising depth. His is a turn of great maturity, one that scratches away at the fact that Jack has never had any male interaction. Brie Larson, who plays his mum, did win an Oscar for her role here. (PS)1518 Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense (1999)Haley Joel Osment’s performance as Cole Sear, a young boy tormented by his ability to see and talk to the dead, is so strong that he remains the most memorable part of the M Night Shyamalan film, despite a career-best turn from Bruce Willis and one of the most effective twists in cinema history. (JS)1618 River Phoenix in Stand by Me (1986)One of the few comforts to cling onto when thinking of River Phoenix’s tragic death aged 23 is that he was at least able to showcase his vast acting range before he died. The actor, whose brother is Joaquin Phoenix, played everything from tortured teenagers to tough adventurers and street hustlers. But perhaps his finest work came early, in 1986’s Stand by Me, when he played a sensitive pre-teen who masks insecurity and self-loathing beneath a veneer of macho posturing. It’s a staggering bit of acting from someone so young. (AW)1718 Hailee Steinfeld in True Grit (2010)It’s probably not true to say that Hailee Steinfeld is the only person who could have pulled off the role of the fearless Mattie Ross in the Coen brothers’ adaptation of Charles Portis novel True Grit – but from the moment she arrives in Fort Smith with plans to hunt down her father’s killer, she makes you feel like she is. How she didn\u0027t win Best Supporting Actress at the 2011 Oscars will remain a mystery. (JS)1818 Heather Matarazzo in Welcome to the Dollhouse (1995)Generally speaking, children acting in Todd Solondz movies need to have nerves of steel and far more self-confidence than average youngsters. But it takes a child of unusual gutsiness to enact the horrors inflicted upon poor Dawn Wiener in his 1995 film Welcome to the Dollhouse. A yearning, eager loner played to perfection by Heather Matarazzo, Dawn is the recipient of a level of casual cruelty that would feel fetishistic if it weren\u0027t so tragically true to life. When she was killed off before the credits in Solondz’s 2004 film Palindromes, the collective mourning it inspired in his fanbase was only a result of how powerfully Matarazzo’s performance lingered. (AW)118 Christina Ricci in The Addams Family (1991)In the 27 years since she was transferred to the big screen via Christina Ricci, Wednesday Addams has become less a character and more a mood, a religion and a lifestyle. Ricci’s deadpan performance is so gloriously apathetic and mean that she comfortably steals the show from her adult co-stars, and deservedly had her role beefed up for the film’s sequel. (AW)218 Saoirse Ronan in Atonement (2007)Since Atonement, Ronan has become one of the most accomplished actors of her generation. And it’s no surprise, given how convincingly she brought to life, at the age of 13, Ian McEwan’s precocious and stubborn protagonist Briony Tallis, whose misinterpretation of a romantic encounter between her sister and her childhood friend wreaks havoc in the lives of those around her.

As a five-year-old, the child star convinced her parents to let her fib about her age so that she could audition for Beasts of the Southern Wild – their minimum age was six. So impressed was director Benh Zeitlin by Wallis that he changed his entire script so that the character of Hushpuppy matched her stubborn personality.

In Truffaut, Léaud found a mentor –  he took control of the 15-year-old\u0027s upbringing when shooting ended after he was expelled from school and kicked out of his carers’ home – and Léaud would return as the character five more times. (JS)618 Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone (1990)Considering he starts Home Alone as an obnoxious “little jerk”, it’s a testament to Macaulay Culkin’s skill that Kevin McCallister manages to worm his way into viewers’ hearts . Culkin has insane amounts of fun ruling the roost when his family accidentally forget to bring him on their Christmas holiday, and it never fails to be a gleeful experience watching Kevin runs rings around bumbling burglars Harry (Daniel Stern) and Marv (Joe Pesci). (JS)718 Abigail Breslin in Little Miss Sunshine (2006)Breslin became one of the youngest Oscar nominees of all time when she received a nod for Best Supporting Actress for her performance, aged 10, as Olive Hoover in the beloved 2006 road movie. She played an underdog youngster on a mission to win a beauty contest, accompanied by her quirky and dysfunctional family, with real wit and flair. (EH)818 Alex Hibbert in Moonlight (2016)Giving a performance in perfect symmetry to the film around him, Alex Hibbert is one of a number of brilliantly subtle actors in Moonlight. Only on screen for the film’s first third, he mostly inhabits a quiet and devastating yearning, embodying a character buried under the emotional weight of playground bullying and constant domestic upheaval, and desperate for someone to show him compassion and answer his questions. If Hollywood has any sense, Moonlight will be just the first of many incredible opportunities for the young star. (AW)918 Mara Wilson in Mrs Doubtfire (1993)Mara Wilson is one of those great child star success stories, immortalised in at least three classic movies while still in single-digits, retiring early, and now writing, podcasting and saying smart, funny things on Twitter. But while 1996’s Matilda is often talked about as her best work, she was somehow even more brilliant in Mrs Doubtfire three years earlier, where she is adorable and grouchy and seems to possess a beautifully sincere, if today bittersweet, joy over merely being in Robin Williams’s company. (AW)1018 Isabelle Fuhrman in Orphan (2009)Isabelle Fuhrman is scarily convincing in her role as Esther, the sickly-sweet orphan girl turned murderous dwarf asylum escapee. The sexual and violent nature of some scenes may be uncomfortable to watch, but there is no denying Fuhrman executes them perfectly. (MH)1118 Tatum O’Neal in Paper Moon (1973)Tatum O’Neal was, and still is, the youngest person to ever win an Oscar for her role as the sassy, smoking, swindling tomboy Addie in Paper Moon. Addie may or may not be the daughter of con man Moses, who is reluctantly saddled with the youngster before realising she can help him with his scams. Moses is played by O’Neal’s real-life father Ryan O’Neal, and there’s just no faking that kind of chemistry. (AP)1218 Lindsay Lohan in The Parent Trap (1998)Lohan was just 12 when she played identical twins Annie and Hallie in the 1998 classic. While the sisters were of course impossible to distinguish by their looks, their personalities and backgrounds could hardly have been more different: one was a well-to-do Londoner, the other a boisterous American tomboy. The young star impressed audiences with her ability to switch effortlessly and convincingly between the two. (EH)1318 Heather O’Rourke in Poltergeist (1982)Heather O’Rourke tragically died aged just 12 in 1988, but she will long be remembered as the ethereal blonde Carol Anne Freeling. Cast after a chance meeting with Steven Spielberg, she captivates the audience as a little girl who can communicate with “the other side” through the family television set. (MH)1418 Jacob Tremblay in Room (2015)Egregiously overlooked for an Oscar in 2016, Jacob Tremblay\u0027s performance in Room will pull out heartstrings you never knew you had. As Jack, a long-haired five-year-old who has been imprisoned in a garden shed all his life and is oblivious to the outside world, he not only raises the film\u0027s cute quotient, but also brings surprising depth. His is a turn of great maturity, one that scratches away at the fact that Jack has never had any male interaction. Brie Larson, who plays his mum, did win an Oscar for her role here. (PS)1518 Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense (1999)Haley Joel Osment’s performance as Cole Sear, a young boy tormented by his ability to see and talk to the dead, is so strong that he remains the most memorable part of the M Night Shyamalan film, despite a career-best turn from Bruce Willis and one of the most effective twists in cinema history. (JS)1618 River Phoenix in Stand by Me (1986)One of the few comforts to cling onto when thinking of River Phoenix’s tragic death aged 23 is that he was at least able to showcase his vast acting range before he died. The actor, whose brother is Joaquin Phoenix, played everything from tortured teenagers to tough adventurers and street hustlers. But perhaps his finest work came early, in 1986’s Stand by Me, when he played a sensitive pre-teen who masks insecurity and self-loathing beneath a veneer of macho posturing. It’s a staggering bit of acting from someone so young. (AW)1718 Hailee Steinfeld in True Grit (2010)It’s probably not true to say that Hailee Steinfeld is the only person who could have pulled off the role of the fearless Mattie Ross in the Coen brothers’ adaptation of Charles Portis novel True Grit – but from the moment she arrives in Fort Smith with plans to hunt down her father’s killer, she makes you feel like she is. How she didn\u0027t win Best Supporting Actress at the 2011 Oscars will remain a mystery. (JS)1818 Heather Matarazzo in Welcome to the Dollhouse (1995)Generally speaking, children acting in Todd Solondz movies need to have nerves of steel and far more self-confidence than average youngsters. But it takes a child of unusual gutsiness to enact the horrors inflicted upon poor Dawn Wiener in his 1995 film Welcome to the Dollhouse. A yearning, eager loner played to perfection by Heather Matarazzo, Dawn is the recipient of a level of casual cruelty that would feel fetishistic if it weren\u0027t so tragically true to life. When she was killed off before the credits in Solondz’s 2004 film Palindromes, the collective mourning it inspired in his fanbase was only a result of how powerfully Matarazzo’s performance lingered. (AW)Chan, playing a different Marvel character to the one she played in Captain Marvel, appeared on stage at D23 alongside the rest of the star-studded Eternals cast, which includes Jolie, Richard Madden, Salma Hayek, Brian Tyree Henry, Kumail Nanjiani and Barry Keoghan.The film\u0026nbspwill be released in November next year.\u0026nbspGame of Thrones\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But despite her long comic book history, a number of iniduals have taken to Disney’s official Instagram to complain about the series, which was announced yesterday, and what they have interpreted as merely a gender-switched version of The Hulk.Created with Sketch.Marvel films – ranked worst to best Show all 23Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke).

Another added: “You can tell by the comments which people have never picked up a comic book in their lives.” On Twitter, one person wrote in response to the criticism: “Ah yes, because women were only created in 2019.”The forthcoming She-Hulk series will mark the character’s first appearance in live-action. She has previously appeared on numerous animated Marvel series and in video games, however, voiced by actors including Eliza Dushku and Katee Sackhoff.A She-Hulk film that would have starred Brigitte Nielsen was announced in 1990 but never materialised.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And, indeed, the iceberg is also rapidly melting,” Mr Guterres said.“Preventing irreversible climate disruption is the race of our lives, and for our lives.

Clark Mindock reports from IowaClick to followThe Independent USWith the UK facing an uncertain future as Boris Johnson marches the country towards a no-deal Brexit, American farmers can’t help but see something of a golden opportunity to bring their goods into a new market.While many US farmers have historically been turned away from trading with the UK over fears for the implications of practices such as washing chickens in chlorine, or the use of genetically modified crops, Britain’s impending exit from the EU has left some dreaming of a change to that situation.On a blistering summer day in Iowa, the idea is hard to avoid for farmers such as Leon Sheets, a pork producer from the northeast of the state who also maintains 600 acres of row crops.“Hey, let’s have the conversation. Let’s work out a deal,” Sheets says, emulating the kind of language one might expect from Donald Trump.When prodded further, Sheets acknowledges\u0026nbspthat he hopes to see a post-Brexit trade deal that would allow for the introduction of products that have previously been off the table: “That’s what the goal is – no restrictions, so products can move freely back and forth.”It is an issue that has received backing from prominent American farming executives, even if some lip service has been given to having “a conversation” about the US food standards that have worried some in the UK.Currently farming exports to Britain – including wine, nuts and fruit – are worth only about $1.8bn (£1.47bn), a fraction of the total overall sales of $133bn. That means there is potentially massive room for growth, under the right circumstances.With the US saying that the UK will be “first in line” for a trade deal following Brexit, Zippy Duvall, the head of the American Farm Bureau, recently said that they are eagerly watching for ways to begin a trade partnership – but that Britain had to accept US standards.PM warned US trade deal ‘highly unlikely’ if Ireland has hard borderGovernment finally hands firms customs numbers for post-Brexit tradeTrump vows to continue China trade war even if recession hits USAs Britain seeks new trade deals, can we learn a lesson from Poldark?UK told to accept US food standards in any trade deal“You know, here in America we treat our water with chlorine,” Duvall, a poultry farmer himself, told the BBC.He claimed it was not a public health issue, saying: “So there is no scientific basis that says that washing poultry with chlorine wash just to be safe of whatever pathogens might be on that chicken as it was prepared for the market should be taken away. If there was something wrong with it our federal inspection systems would not be allowing us to use that.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Chlorine-washed bagged salads are sold in the UK and other countries in the EU, for instance.But what is of concern is that relying on chlorine washes – which proponents say makes harmful bacteria virtually undetectable – at the end of the process allows farmers to keep unsanitary conditions for the chickens earlier on. And the wash could allow for crowded abattoirs where disease could theoretically spread with greater ease.While it is tricky to compare the rates of food-borne illnesses between two countries, two separate studies would suggest that the US experiences higher rates of salmonella infection. One British government study from 2014 found that there were roughly 55 salmonella infections per 100,000 people, when analysing 2009 data. A separate study of the US found a rate of 350 infections per 100,000 people, using data from 2002-08.When it comes to deaths, the US also reports higher numbers. While the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention reports around 380 deaths a year due to food-borne salmonella, England and Wales had zero such deaths between 2006 and 2015, according to the most recently available data from Public Health England.Gail Soutar, the chief European Union exit and international trade adviser for the National Farmers Union (NFU), says there was a considerable level of anxiety that a hasty and chaotic Brexit could leave UK farmers competing against a flood of international goods coming in, and undermining their prices.Soutar says she is particularly concerned at the prospect of a no-deal outcome, and the impact that subsequently high tariffs on UK agricultural products could have. Farmers, she worries, could be threatened by a flood of new goods being brought in from the US, which could undermine efforts to honour European Union standards – with the EU, for now, a much larger trading partner than the US.“There is a concern that we are going to see an increase of imports coming into the UK under a no-deal situation,” she says. “It remains absolutely key that we get a deal with the EU.”UK politicians have at least paid lip service to the notion that standards will not be abandoned in pursuit of a deal, with former environment secretary Michael Gove telling an NFU conference in\u0026nbspFebruary that they would not abandon those requirements “in pursuit of trade deals”.But thousands of miles away in Iowa, the outcome of negotiations between the UK and EU are understandably less of a concern for farmers. Whereas UK farmers may be feeling some anxiety, American farmers are clearly sensing opportunity.Bill Tenneger, a pig producer in northwest Iowa, says\u0026nbspDonald Trump’s trade war with China had been hurting farmers like him, but he thinks Mr Trump could potentially capitalise on a weak negotiating position following Brexit.But he adds\u0026nbsphe hopes\u0026nbspit would help British people out too: “I think trade agreements are good. Hey, it’s a small world. We’ve all got to get along in the world. I’ve travelled all over the world representing the pork industry.“In the end, I don’t care what culture you go to or you get embedded in, they all just want to feed their families and support their families and have the government leave them alone.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The private jets to climate change summits. The gobsmackingly expensive renovations to their house with wallpaper made of organic kale and goji berries, or something.It was reported this week that the Royal Family’s bill for travel and security has almost doubled since . Much of that is probably Meghan.But I think people are also weary of William seemingly talking about depression every time he opens his mouth.Hell, you’re depressed, Wills  Howja think the rest of us feel I’ve always been marginally in favour of having a royal family.But that’s contingent upon who that royal family actually is. And how they behave.The Queen and Prince Philhave been models of decency and duty. They keep a certain distance from the public and that is perhaps why they are so adored.To her immense credit, Princess Anne has followed that blueprint. She doesn’t emote for the media and lecture us.My worry is that the newer generation of royals will turn the British public against the Windsors.

which s on Sunday - kicked off, the real Peaky Blinders had actually disbanded, and other, more sinister gangsters were running Britains criminal underworld.After decades of vicious battles over gambling and turf boundaries, the Blinders lost control of their patch to the Birmingham Boys, led by Billy Kimber – portrayed in the series by Charlie Creed Miles.And across the rest of the UK, other criminal gangs were establishing themselves in all other major cities - as employment and poverty after the industrial revolution left city dwellers forced to turn to violent crime.One of these was London’s Forty Elephants – an all female gang who struck as much fear into the hearts of the cities as their male counterparts with their violent criminal tactics.Like the Peaky Blinders – who wore tailored suits with bell-bottom trousers and button jackets, leather steel-toed boots, silk scarves and starched collars – most gangs had dress codes which made them instantly recognisable to rivals and terried victims alike.Each had dferent violent tactics, from the Liverpool gangs who beat people with belts in the middle of the street to gangsters who carved a V into the faces of their victims.Here we look at the major gangs that controlled the UK’s criminal underworld in the first decades of the th century – and their vicious battles over each territory.MOst Read in News \" data-srcset\"https:i.wp www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg croppx%Cpx%Cpx%Cpxresize%Cssl\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" HOUSE ABOUT THAT Three-bed detached house goes on sale for just £k -

with members aged between  and  who used violence to take over patches of land.By the s, they had branched out into extortion, bribery, smuggling, hijacking and robbery as well as running gambling syndicates.At the time, the only legal gambling in the UK was at the racecourses – which raked in a £m a year from bets -  but when the Blinders attempted to grab a slice of the pie in , they bit off more than they could chew.According to historian Professor Carl Chinn, rival gang the Birmingham Boys – AKA the Brummagem Boys – were already working the course as a “loose collection of pick-pockets, racecourse thieves and pests who were gaining a lot of power.”Led by -year-old Billy Kimber – who had already served two prison sentences for wounding and assaulting a police officer – the gang launched a violent backlash against the Peaky Blinders.Over the next decade, the Peaky Blinders gradually lost their hold over Birmingham and, frightened, their families began to disperse into the surrounding country.With Birmingham under his spell, Billy expanded his operations to Uttoxeter and Leeds, and throughout the Midlands and the North.But he wanted more – and soon turned his attention to London and the racetracks of the South East.With several gangs operating in the capital already, Kimber formed alliances with smaller gangs, including the Elephant and Castle Gang – led by notorious gangster Charles ‘Wag McDonald.Kimber began to prey on the Jewish bookies of the East End, who turned to rival family the Sabini family – and war broke out.Turf: London and the South EastLeader: Charles Darby SabiniEnemies: The Birmingham Boys, The Elephant and Castle Gang, Cortesi BrothersCriminal tactics: Razors, beatings, hitmen from SicilyPlayed in Peaky Blinders by Noah Taylor, Charles ‘Darby’ Sabini and his four brothers – Harry, George, Joe and Fred - were born in London’s Little Italy.Darby established his reputation as a hard man after knocking out the enforcer of another South London gang in a pub brawl in the East End, and went on to run bookies protection rackets, earning the nickname the “King of the Racecourse Gangs.”His Clerkenwell operation also ran several nightclubs and he had a network of corrupt judges, politicians and police chiefs in his pocket.At its peak, the gang had  members and, although notorious for razor attacks, Sabini also imported Sicilian gunmen to carry out hits on his enemies.In March , the Birmingham boys ambushed Sabini at Greenford Trotting Park.A few days later Billy Kimber went to Sabini’s house in King’s Cross where he was shot and beaten by notorious Jewish hitman Alfie Solomon -played by Tom Hardy in the BBC drama.Solomon was tried for attempted murder but charges were dropped when all witnesses mysteriously “lost their memory” about the attack.The violence escalated into the event that would prove the downfall of the Birmingham Boys – the battle of Epsom Road.On June , , after the Epsom races that day, the Birmingham Boys ambushed a charabanc containing bookmakers from Leeds, ramming it with a taxi.The gang attacked the passengers with hammers, hatchets, bottles and bricks, hospitalising six with head wounds. Of the  gang members arrested,  were jailed, and Billy Kimber’s reign as king of the underworld was over.Billy fled to the US, where he was shielded by the US Mafia, later ing to the UK and working as a bookie himself.Turf: LondonLeader: Augustus Gus CortesiEnemies: The Sabini FamilyCriminal tactics: Knives and gunsWith Billy gone, the Sabinis faced a new challenge from rival Italians ,the Cortesi Brothers.In November ,  Darby and brother Harry met Gus and Paul in a London club, supposedly for peace talks.When tempers boiled over, Paul Cortesi threw a hot cup of coffee in Harrys face and Gus tried to shoot Darby, failing when the club secretarys daughter knocked the gun away.In the following battle, Harry was shot in the stomach and Darby was knocked unconscious with a bottle. The Cortesi brothers were jailed for three years for attempted murder.At the outbreak of the Second World War, Sabini was arrested and jailed as an enemy alien but by then there was a new guy in town.Billy Hill had made his mark in the s with a new brand of violence - marking his enemies with a V for Victim, slashed into their face - and had become the King of the London criminal underworld.The notorious villain, who netted £, in a  postal van robbery, was to inspire a new generation of gangsters, including the Kray Twins.Turf: Sheffield Leaders: George MooneyEnemies: The Parkhill BrigadeCriminal tactics: Street attacks, razors, knives and bricksA popular gambling scam at the turn of the century, was pitch and toss – a simple game where three coins were tossed in the air with punters betting on the number of heads and tails.In Sheffield, gang members would wait outside factory gates on payday to fleece the workers of their hard-earned cash, making an average of £ to £ a day.A prime location for the illegal gambling was Sky Ridge, overlooking the slums of the Park district, which provided a great lookout so gangs could pack up and run should the police show up.Up to , the site was controlled by the notorious Mooney gang, led by George Mooney, and his number two Sam Garvin.But when unemployment rose in the s, profits fell and Garvin broke away to form the rival Park Brigade – sparking a turf war which terrorised the poverty-stricken neighbourhood with tit-for-tat attacks.Street and pub brawls using razors, guns, knives and bricks were an everyday occurrence and even innocent bystanders were not safe.On April   William Plommer, a local man who waded in to a fistfight involving one of Garvin’s followers, was fatally stabbed outside his home in Norfolk Bridge.Sheffield’s Chief Constable John Hall-Dalwood decided to face violence with violence, launching a “Flying Squad” to go out into the streets of Park to stamp out the gangs once and for all.In July that year, the brothers Wilfred and Lawrence Fowler were convicted of Plommer’s murder and sentenced to death at West Riding Assizes in Leeds. They were hanged two months later.Turf: ManchesterLeaders: VariousEnemies: Rival street gangsCriminal tactics: Brass-buckled belt attacksAt the turn of the th Century, violent gangs known as Scuttlers sprang up around Manchester.Described by iNews as the “first youth cult”, the violent gangs of young men cut their hair into distinctive short cuts, wore clogs and bell-bottom trousers, with silk scarves in gang colours.But the heavy leather belts with huge brass buckles were more than a sartorial statement – they were a weapon, used to seriously injure and maim rivals in planned attacks.Gangs were named after the streets they came from -  the most feared being the Bengal Tigers from Bengal Street and the Meadow Lads from Angel Meadow – and the street brawls were dubbed “scuttling”Prison proved little deterrent with one report stating: “their conduct in the dock at the police court was most flippant and callous… the youths laughed and turned round to wink at friends in the gallery.”In , there were more youths in Strangeways for “scuttling” than any other offence.Turf: LiverpoolLeader: UnknownEnemies: The Logwood GangCriminal tactics: Attacking dockers with knives and beating with beltsIn the th century, much of Liverpool’s wealth depended on the docks - and so did a lot of its criminal activity.The most feared of the city’s gangs the High Rip Gang - named after the long knives they called High Rippers - who became infamous after a Spanish sailor was brutally beaten and stabbed to death in , in a botched mugging.Like the Blinders, they were smart dressers, wearing tight-fitting, bell bottoms and a Bucko hat – a flat cap gathered at the top – set at a jaunty angle with a quf of hair poking out.The gang became known for extreme and random violence, vicious robberies and brutal revenge attacks against rival gangs.They targeted dock workers and on their way home from work, viciously beating them to steal their wages, and locals lived in terror.They were deadly rivals with the Logwood Gang, named after the short lumps of wood they used to beat victims.Legend has it that tough policeman called Pins picked up one member up by the ankles and swung him round knocking others down like skittles.After a string of murders in Liverpool, several members were executed. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A disaster. A “catastrophic ­national danger”, according to the feverish .They say Britain is on a “clf edge”. If we leave without a deal it will be a “car crash”.It will bring the “hardship of war” raining down upon us, says one Brexitphobic columnist. These people seem to live in a permanent state of dread.They’re forever fantasising about a desolate post-Brexit world in which there will be “riots, looting and disorder”as zombied Brits fight each other for scraps of food and bottles of medicine.The rest of us, however, have a rather dferent take on No Deal. Across the country, far from the political bubbles and ivory towers inhabited by these anti-Brexit hysterics, people are far more chilled out about the prospect of No Deal.You hear it in everyday ­conversations: “If the EU won’t give us a good deal, let’s leave without one.”You see it on Question Time when the audience applauds a list who says we should walk away from the EUit keeps messing us about. And you see it in opinion polls, too.Much to the horror of the Brexit-bashing elites, polls show that ordinary people do not think No Deal will be the end of the world as we know it.A recent Opinium poll asked people what we should doBoris Johnson fails to wring concessions from the EU and to change the Withdrawal Agreement to make it more palatable to MPs.A whopping  per cent said we should go ahead with Brexit on October  — Boris’s ­promised exit day — evenwe don’t have a deal.Just  per cent said we should cancel Brexit altogether and  per cent said we should continue with negotiations.This echoes a YouGov poll from a few months ago. It asked what we should dothe EU refused to grant an extension to talks on the exit deal.Forty-four per cent said we should say adios without a deal. Forty-two per cent said we should revoke Brexit and stay bound to Brussels.This is all incredibly revealing. No, it does not suggest millions of us are reckless and crazy and hell-bent on jumping off the “clf edge”.Most Brits, including Boris himself, would prefer to leave with a deal,a good one can be struck.No, what the polls show is that there is only so much baloney from the EU that we are willing to take.If Eurocrats carry on behaving stubbornly and arrogantly by refusing to reopen talks about the Withdrawal Agreement, then we should show some self-respect and walk away — that is what people are saying.This captures one of the key ides between the elites and ordinary people today. The political and media classes dread No Deal because they have lost faith in Britain.They view the UK as a tiny, pathetic island that could never possibly cope outside of the EU.They think we need to be looked after by the apparently caring, maternal figure of the Brussels bureaucracy. Andwe do the political equivalent of cutting the apron strings, we will be doomed, apparently.In the rest of the country, meanwhile, people have far more faith in the nation.They believe we are more than capable of being a sovereign, independent country that strikes its own trade deals and writes its own laws.They see the country not as a useless little island, but as a plucky, resourceful nation that should reach out to the world without being beholden to any of it.The ide over No Deal reveals how much disagreement there is between the political elites and the people today.It is hard to remember a time when the chasm between Us and Them was as wide as it is right now.The th Century Prime ­Minister Benjamin Disraeli once said the UK feels like “two nations”. In one nation there are the posh and well-educated, and in the other there are ­ordinary working people.These “two nations” have entirely dferent “habits, thoughts, and feelings”, he wrote. It is asthey are “inhabitants of dferent planets”.It feels like that again today. On the planet of the Remainer elites, No Deal will be terrible, Boris is the worst PM ever, and anyone who ­disagrees is probably a racist.But on the planet inhabited by the rest of us, No Deal will be fine. And support for the Boris-led Conservative Party is rising. Surging, in fact.The latest Britain Elects ­opinion poll shows that  per cent of us would vote for the Tories, compared with just  per cent for Labour.But their shrill cries make no impact on our planet. In our more sane world, we still want Brexit to happen and we think Britain is a good, decent, capable country.The elites should come over to our planet.

I deplore the exploitation of any human being and would not condone, participate in, or encourage any such behaviour.Epsteins inquiry is now focusing on several alleged co-conspirators, believed to include Ghislaine Maxwell, , the daughter of disgraced newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell.At least five women who say they were abused by Epstein have filed lawsuits against his £million estate after the paedo killed himself.All said Epstein used a “vast enterprise” of associates to recruit them, subject them to unwanted sex acts and keep them under his control.He was arrested on July  over claims he was involved in the sex-trafficking of dozens of girls as young as  from at least  until .Epstein had denied the charges and was being held in prison until his trial where he was facing up to  years in prisonconvicted.Andrew is on holiday in Spain with ex-we Sarah Ferguson, , as Buckingham Palace fights to clear his name amid revelations that have surfaced since Epstein’s death.A previous Buckingham Palace statement said: The Duke of York has been appalled by the recent reports of Jeffrey Epsteins alleged crimes.His Royal Highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.The Sun Online contacted Buckingham Palace for comment."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit countdown clock is too stressful for downing street staff who ban it from no10","story":"After Boris became PM a clock was seen being posted into the famous street for his office, and one has been put up in Tory HQ too.It counts down the days until BoJo has promised that Britain will finally leave the EU on October .However, Alex Aiken, the civil service’s executive director of government communications, stepped in after Boris advisers suggested putting one on every computer in No.The Sunday Times reported that he thought it would be “too much pressure” for them to handle.Ministers, key Whitehall staff and advisers have already been told to cancel all planned leave to get us ready to leave the EU, as the PM needs all hands on deck.Chairman James Cleverly posted a snap of himself with the clock in the Torys office with a smile, pointing at the latest addition to the room.There was a sign above it which read: We will have delivered Brexit and left the EU by...MOST READ IN POLITICS\" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" GIVE US A BREAK Govt should create new bank hol before Xmas to help tired working Brits \" data-srcset\"https:i.wp www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg croppx%Cpx%Cpx%Cpxresize%Cssl\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" LEFT IN THE COLD Donald Trump sparks row with G leaders by demanding Putin is readmitted \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   DD-COMPOSITE-DRIVING-BAN-MAP-v-.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" ExclusiveNO DRIVE ZONE Mayors plans to shut down part of capital for a day to cost Londoners £m \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   TM-comp-Bojo-v.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" ExclusiveIN THE PIPELINE Boris weighs up bumper p fuel duty cut in first reduction for eight years \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   TM-comp-Boris-Trump-.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" AIR FORCE JOHN BoJo bounces into Biarritz with blast at Tusk ahead of G Trump trade talks \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" BOJOS BEEB BLAST Boris slams BBC and demands they cough up to fund over-s TV licences \" data-srcset\"https:i.wp www.thesun wp-content uploads   stripper.jpg croppx%Cpx%Cpx%Cpxresize%Cssl\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" BENEFITS BLUNDER Universal Credit chiefs tell claimants they could work as strippers \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" ExclusiveDOWN THOSE BEERS!

She had spent the day in Washington on a fruitless quest to interview former Vice President Spiro Agnew. It was part of a one-month tryout with an American weekly newspaper that paid her extraordinarily well - far more than her usual newspaper could afford thanks to the country’s current economic crisis. Sandy had no plans for the evening and was nervous at the prospect of drinking alone in the South. Atlanta wasn’t London, where the pubs in Soho were so familiar to her they ed as a second home. As she wrote a few years later, years of pulling in pubs and clubs had taught her that, despite being a bit broad in the beam and not exactly a raving beauty, she had a magnetism that drew men asto a pile of iron filings. Sandy was single, in her mid-forties.She could travel, pursue flings with younger men — early to mid-twenties was the ideal range — drink heavily without a hangover and keep her primary focus on her work.  Sandy wasn’t alone at the Holiday Inn bar long. A young man she’d eyed earlier with some disdain for wearing a flowery tie to match his shirt walked towards her. Would you like to dance  he asked. Well, no, thank you She’d been thrown by his advance, but seeing the rejection cross his face, she blurted out: I have only just arrived in town and haven’t had a drink all day….I have to go to work. I am a journalist, you see. He replied: Will you be gone long  Will you come back  Are you staying here  Sandy wasn’t gone long.The Atlanta Constitution office proved disappointing.She came back, and the redheaded six-footer with a classically handsome face topped by hair the colour of scotch and water that complimented her own flaming red hair, was still in the bar when she ed. This time, she accepted his invitation to dance. He told her he was on his way to Miami. That’s funny, said Sandy, I’m going to West Palm Beach tomorrow. “You should let me drive you there,” said the man. “It only takes a day and you could see something of the country.” Sandy mulled over his suggestion. How  would she see America as it was, not the America constrained by tight deadlines and formal interviews  Plus, he seemed to be an experienced traveler. Earlier, the young man rattled off a list of cities and states visited - New Orleans, Houston, Dallas, Kentucky, St. Louis. Alabama. She decided to accept, on one condition. “I’m not going to bed with you. Oh, I know you haven’t asked, but it sure ain’t dficult to read your thoughts!” Besides, Sandy continued: “I don’t know anything about you, you could easily be another Boston Strangler for all I know!”  Both burst out laughing. Within hours, Sandy would take the younger man to bed, though the experience would prove underwhelming. “So you’re not really another Boston Strangler after all,” she said, after. “What a disappointment.” Days later, Sandy would learn how wrong she was, and what danger she’d been in the entire time. An experienced reporter Sandy had found success as a fashion editor and when she grew restless with greater ambition, joined the Daily Mail and the , where she moved into feature journalism. She was a lone woman among throngs of men, and felt it was necessary to outdrink, outlast, and outwit them. She was fun to be with. And that was before what happened in America in November . Sandy wondered why she had agreed to the man’s offer of a ride to West Palm Beach. He was attractive and young, yes. But the sex wasn’t all that great. His conversation revolved around recurring visions of a shortened leI don’t know when, but within a year I shall be dead. I am going to be killed by someone and of audio tapes secreted away in his lawyer’s vault. Was any of it true, or was the man, who had finally given his name as Lester Daryl Golden, putting her on And why on earth was he determined that she write a book about him     Meanwhile, people kept dying with alarming speed. -year-old Alice Curtis, choked to death in her own home in Jacksonville, Florida.Mylette and Lillian Anderson, sisters aged just seven and  whose bodies were never found. A teenage girl whose name wasn’t known for decades. Marjorie Howie, , strangled with her nylon stocking, television set pilfered from her apartment. Women and girls, all dead between August  and , . The spree didn’t stop with those victims. Kathie Sue Pierce, strangled in her Musella, Georgia home on August  in front of her three-year-old son, who escaped harm. William Bates, picked up at a roadside pub in Lima, Ohio on September , his nude body not discovered for another month. By that time Emmett and Lois Johnson were found shot to death at an Ely, Nevada campsite on September  Charlynn Hicks, raped and strangled in Seguin, Texas and Ann Dawson, a beautician missing from Birmingham, Alabama as of September . Worse was still to come in October and November.Karen Wine and her -year-old daughter, Dawn, both raped in their Marlborough, Connecticut home on October , both strangled with a nylon stocking. Doris Hosey, , shot to death two days later in Woodford, Virginia.Edward Hilliard and Debbie Grfin, choosing the wrong car to hitchhike with on November , with him ending up murdered, and her body never recovered. Carswell Carr, befriended by his killer over drinks in Milledgeville, Georgia, only to be stabbed to death on November , after which his -year-old daughter, Mandy, died by strangulation. Sandy knew none of this. Not until she spied the front page of the local paper that Daryl purchased on November , the day they finally left Atlanta. A page devoted entirely to the recent spate of murders. But she wanted to get to Florida. She’d drunk too much the night before. She didn’t much care about Daryl’s assertion that he had friends in Macon, about  miles from Milledgeville. And she certainly didn’t recall saying to him in bed the night before that she didn’t think he was a “maxi-murderer at all, more your mini-murderer. That fleeting look of irritation  No, this was a joke best left alone. Once in West Palm Beach on November , Sandy did find Daryl useful. He drove her to the local office of the paper she was trying out with.He drove her to the house of Florida attorney general William Saxbe so she could conduct an interview, and waited in the car until she was finished. But the next day, after a heart-stopping near-loss of materials, as well as a more pressing looming deadline, Sandy knew it was over. The sex hadn’t been worth much to begin with, but now there was little point keeping on. “I hate saying [the words] but I’m going back to London on Saturday and I have a lot of work to do and people to see before I go.” But before they parted, she had to know - would Daryl tell her what was on the tapes  He would not.    “In that case I have to concentrate on my own business…but it’s been a marvellous week, Daryl, wonderful, truly like a holiday. However, le must take over again.” Couldn’t they spend just one more night together, asked Daryl. “No, darling. No.” Sandy was firm: “Goodbyes are horrible but they’re better over and done with.” She kissed him on the mouth one last time, and felt “free to come and go and please herself again. She spent that evening at a bar with some other American journalists, who teased her about ditching a clearly heartbroken Daryl. The next day, Sandy received an urgent message from West Palm Beach police detective sergeant Gabbard. When she arrived at the station, she thought perhaps Daryl had had an accident. When Gabbard askedshe knew of a Susan MacKenzie, Sandy said she did, vaguely.She was the we of one of the journalists she’d gone out drinking with the prior night. “Your friend attempted to rape her this morning.” Sandy, stunned, blurted out a response she would regret for the rest of her le: “Good God…and he wasn’t even a good poke!”After a beat of silence, she asked Gabbard to fill her in. “Mrs. MacKenzie says that when he was driving her to the hairdresser’s this morning when he pulled the car off the road and asked her to make love to him. When she refused he pulled a gun on her.”  Susan managed to get out of the car, despite Daryl grabbing her by the hair, and called police from a nearby pay phone.Despite being spotted by a squad car, Daryl had escaped, though police now knew the make and model of his car. By the time he was arrested on November , after a shootout involving multiple officers from several law enforcement agencies, helicopters, and dogs, Daryl had killed two more people. Florida Highway Patrol Trooper Charles Campbell, who’d failed in his own attempt at an arrest and ended up a hostage and James Meyer, kidnapped so that the man could swap a police car for a less obtrusive one. By the time the killer and the abducted duo reached a remote, wooded area in Pulaski, Georgia, the hostages’ fate was clear: both were handcuffed to a tree and shot to death. Over the next few days, Sandy learned the gruesome truth about her week-long lover -his real name was Paul John Knowles, and he was suspected in the deaths of at least  people. “Exactly a week ago I had been in his arms,” wrote Sandy.“How could I have made such a mistake  Then, like hot metal flooding my veins, came the memory of that first morning, the sense of evil in the room that had thrust me headlong to the door. Good God, I had known.” Knowles was well-acquainted with Florida’s foster homes and reformatories, given up by his father after a juvenile conviction for petty crime. He married, young and briefly.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man covered in tattoos who is the talk of his town has opened the doors of his home for the first time to reveal the story behind his ink. Paul Kidson has become a familiar face in Newquay, Cornwall, sporting dozens of tattoos across his face and body. He lives in a ground-floor flat on his own, adorned with dozens of red trinkets ranging from clocks, to shoes and wigs stacked on his shelves. Paul refuses to invite people to his home because many had robbed him in the past, he said.In an exclusive interview with Cornwall Live , Paul revealed his adventurous le story - from a broken childhood to travelling the world, and marrying four times along the way.He said: “I don’t have many people in here. In all the time I’ve been here - three years - I’ve only had six or seven people inside. I don’t let people in, because my trust in a lot of people has gone since I got robbed.” Paul is referring to the time he was burgled when he lived in Blackpool around seven years ago. Not only did they take all his money, but he says they also ripped up old photos of his mother, who had recently died. This, on top of mounting solicitor bills from a orce, led Paul to try and take his own le. It was his first suicide attempt, but sadly, not his last. Inside Paul’s flat, it is almost impossible to see where the floor ends, the walls begin and the painted ceiling starts. With every available space filled with colour coordinated red objects, and the room temperature hitting  degrees, his tiny home feels almost womblike. Paul was born in Harrogate Hospital at .am on a very snowy  of January . He says that years later, his mother would tell him that his father’s first words when he came to visit the hospital were: “I didn’t want a boy, I wanted a girl”.  Growing up in a small village near Thirsk in Yorkshire - the home of James Herriot – Paul says that he ‘didn’t have much of a childhood’, spending most of his time caring for his mother who was quite ill and struggled to get out to the shops by herself. Despite describing himself as a ‘proper mammy’s boy’ and not getting on well with his father, Paul did follow in his footsteps and got a job at the Rowntree’s sweet factory in York, where he quickly earned enough money to save up for a deposit on a house. “I left home when I was  or , because my father was an absolutely despicable person. I just could not live with him at all. I won’t go into details of what happened, but a lot happened.” Paul bought his first home just down the road from his mother, so that he could still look after her. Around this time, he got his first tattoos – his name on his right arm and a swallow on his left. This began his lelong obsession with getting tattoos, with more recent ones often covering older ones, except for those first two, which Paul has kept.  His body quickly became covered in ink, but by covering them in make-up, Paul still managed to keep his tattoos hidden from his mother when he went to see her. “She never knew. She’d have gone mental.” In between his time working in the warehouse at Rowntree’s, Paul befriended local tattooists and helped them in their shops infor tattoos. As well as making up the needles, he would help to look after the inks, which had a habit of drying up and getting too thick after a while: “You’d have to water them down a bit, so what you’d have to do is put a little bit of mouthwash in, and shake it up, because then it’s still sterilized.” Aged , Paul married his first we, who at the time was only  years old. But the marriage lasted less than a year: “She wanted family straight away and I said no. So we got orced.” It wasn’t long before Paul met someone , a girl in The Old World Club in York, which he had been going to since he was a teenager. “She was really nice, but she was going out with one of the doormen. All she did was go out with doormen. Anyway, she finished with him to go out with me, which caused a lot of trouble. But eventually we married.”  This time the marriage lasted for years, and other than having a lot of tattoos on his body, from the outside Paul seemed to be living a fairly conventional le through his twenties and into his thirties. He was married, living in a three-bedroom bungalow, and still working at Rowntree’s: “It was good money, so I couldn’t give up that, because I’d just bought a house. But I’d been moving round doing dferent jobs . Then I went into the Smartie Department, making Smarties by hand. That was a hard job. Then putting the holes in Polos. Oh, I’ve done all sorts.” However, admitting that he can be ‘a bit of a handful’, Paul’s marriage eventually turned sour, and after separating from his we, he went to live in Greece, where he says he met and married another woman, despite not being orced from his second we. “We lived togetherfor a long time, but she liked to drink a lot for her breakfast. Then I knew I had to come back home, to do the orce. But I couldn’t fetch the other we home, so I had to do a runner.” Paul began travelling a lot, to the Middle East, to Thailand and around Europe. It was in Benidorm that he got his first tattoo on his face.  “Getting them on your face is a hard decision. You have to know what you want.” Paul got a small tattoo on the side of his left eyebrow, which has since disappeared beneath more recent ink. Paul married for a fourth time and moved to Leeds. But eventually this marriage too broke down, and as he and his we went through the orce, he decided to move to Blackpool, where he had lots of friends in the tattoo industry. In Blackpool, Paul began getting more face tattoos and piercings, sometimes infor doing promotional work for the tattooists which saw him featured in magazines and on television. “‘Then you know, things just got a bit... I got a bit bored with it all. So I just packed it all up, and just cleared off abroad.” What Paul later explains, is that this was when he first attempted to take his own le. “The solicitors were charging me £ an hour and it went on for seven months and it just broke me, just ruined everything. It got that bad, I had to sell my clothes and my furniture just to pay for the solicitor. And I was living on virtually nothing.” These crippling costs, along with the death of his mother and then getting robbed, finally broke Paul. He took a kne to his stomach and cut it open, nine inches, from the bottom of his ribs, through his belly button and down to his waist. “I ripped half of my stomach out and lost a lot of my bladder. I actually died twice.    I was in casualty, I died, and I could actually see them working on me.”Despite this happening seven years ago, Paul is still on medication for the pain in his stomach, cannot eat big meals and struggles to sleep most nights. Paul left Blackpool, and once again went travelling through Europe, making his way through Portugal, Spain and France, before ing to England and moving to Eastbourne. Unsettled there, Paul came to Cornwall, homeless, originally staying in St Ives, and then walking the coast up to Newquay five years ago. Homeless on the streets of Newquay, but not wanting to beg for money, Paul discovered that his unique appearance would be the key to his survival: “I never used to beg. I used to sit out in the centre. I never had a hat on the floor and I never asked for money, but people wanted a photo of me, and I’d say yeah,you want to make a little donation. And that’s how I lived for a long time.” However, as someone who had worked for all of his le, Paul looked to the Job Centre to help him find work and get back on his feet. But frustrated by the system, and spiralling into a deep depression, Paul attempted suicide for a second time, stabbing himself in the stomach once again, and leaving a trail of blood as he staggered to the Job Centre. At rock bottom, Paul went to the local newspaper, the  Newquay Voice , and asked them to issue a plea on his behalf to help him get back on his feet again.In the article that they printed, Paul explained: “I’ve been doing odd jobs over the summer, but I have had no support at all in finding work. I went to the Job Centre, but they put me on courses which didn’t seem to have anything to do with employment and they were not very helpful. I don’t like going on the dole, but even when I tried you have to wait six weeks, and I can’t survive that long without money and there are all sorts of hurdles caused by not having a permanent address. “I’m a genuine person and I refuse to steal from people so I have been living rough and getting by with help from community groups such as Soul Food and kind gts from locals, but without any support or help I feel like I’m reaching the end of what I can take. Living on the streets is just not healthy and I know I just won’t last the winter.” Then, talking about his recent suicide attempt, Paul is quoted as saying “I just couldn’t do it anymore. I have tried so hard to get work and get back on my feet. All I want is a roof over my head and some food and then I will be happy. Newquay’s community is amazing and people here are so friendly and so I’m hoping somebody will give me a chance to work, get some money and get off the streets.” "},{"url":null,"title":"metal detecting couple find one","story":"NewsMetal detecting couple find one of biggest ever treasure hoards worth up to £mAdam Staples and partner Lisa Grace unearthed the ‘once in a letime’ find of almost , ancient coins that date back , yearsShareCommentsByAdam Aspinall:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsLisa Grace, pictured, and partner Adam Staples, unearthed the ‘once in a letime’ find of almost , ancient coins that date back , years. \"Get the biggest money stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

The Sunday People has followed Lisa’s cancer journey from the start and in December told how she wrote a love letter to her two daughters to guide them when she’s gone. Her terminal diagnosis came only weeks after the birth of second daughter Saffia in October .      The bubbly beautician, whose early symptoms were put down to pregnancy, was told she’d be lucky to see her baby’s first birthday.But she battled on for nearly two years, creating a legacy to make Saffia and sister Ava-Lily, six, proud.

I wouldn’t have expected anything less, to be honest. “She was one in a million and had the best sense of humour in any situation. Sleep tight, love you always”. They had been a couple since they were  and last summer they went back to the stately home where they married to renew their vows on their th anniversary. The Sunday People last spoke to Lisa in June. At that point she hoped to live long enough to see the charity support its first family, but the odds were against her.

Believing this choice will not contribute to polluting rivers or end up choking a turtle, you happily put it in your trolley, safe in the knowledge that you’re doing a small, but important, bit in helping to protect the environment. But later in the shower, you notice the ingredients’ list. A quick Google search reveals they aren’t that eco-friendly after all. You’ve sadly fallen for “greenwashing”. The term applies to instances where unsubstantiated or misleading claims are made about the environmental benefits of a product, service, technology or company. The same can be said for well-meaning public figures seeking to promote their green credentials while hopping on gas-guzzling private jets, inevitably opening themselves up to criticism. Prince Harry faced this situation last week after Elton John sought to defend his recent private jet journey to the south of France, saying the flight was “carbon-neutral” as he’d made an appropriate contribution to Carbon Footprint. The firm is a leading player in a rapidly growing industry which seeks to provide a quick option to repair some of the damage caused by modern lestyles by payinga small fee. In turn, this finances a iety of projects to take carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by plantingtrees, or to prevent it frombeing emitted.Yet the industry is also the subject of fierce criticism, particularly among environmentalists, who see it as a highly unethical form of greenwashing. Sceptics also point out that many offsetting schemes take ages to have a signicant effect.

If not for the advice from other mums, Laura said she would have risked losing her babies due to infection.    After being signed off work for six weeks, she went on to give birth to her daughters Cara and Evie, at  weeks pregnant on May . Laura, an accountant, said: If I hadnapost have posted into the group about my concerns, Iaposd have never have known about apospreterm premature rupture of the membranesaposand could have easily lost the girls. My first pregnancy went really smoothly, so I had no idea what to do when things started to go wrong.

PRROM is where the sac, or the amniotic membrane, ruptures before week  of pregnancy.

The billionaire financier was shunned by New York society in  after admitting procuring teenage girls, but the Duke of York remained a friend.

Ruby Seal used the site to send anguished messages to friends saying: “I might as well kill myself in the morning.” Then she committed ­suicide when no one replied. She was found dead by her twin sisters during school half term. Last night devastated mum Julie, , told the Sunday People: “Social media was like a drug to Ruby – she was addicted. “The more obsessed she became the less she engaged with real le.    “She became withdrawn and ­isolated on it – always in her room, looking for likes, ­responses and answers to her problems on her phone from people who could not give them. “It was a place for her to hide from reality while also seeking validation from her peers. “It overrode everything  at a time when she also became ­mentally really unwell. “I tried everything – turning off the wi-fi, confiscating her phone, going through her messages – but she always found a way to access it. “Social media contributed to her death.” Ruby enjoyed skateboarding and Doctor Who before becoming ­obsessed with Snapchat at . She spent up to eight hours a day online after school and began suffering mental health problems.  Ruby started ­self- harming, which her mum believes she learned about on Instagram . Julie, a college lecturer who has three other teenage daughters, said: “She was addicted to the instant communication on Snapchat. “It’s faster-paced than Facebook or Instagram and she loved that.” Julie claimed Snapchat’s “streak” feature, which tallies direct snaps exchanged between friends over consecutive days, encouraged her addiction. Longer streaks are ­rewarded with special emojis but the tally goes back to zeroa day of messaging is missed. Julie, of Carlisle, Cumbria, is now calling for Ruby’s Law – a ban on ­social media sites for under-s. She said: “I’d like to see the Government and social media s take ­responsibility so we never see another child lose their le due to the virtual world before they’ve lived a le in a real world.” Since Ruby’s death in February , Julie has been piecing together her daughter’s online le by speaking to her friends.  She was horried to realise her daughter posted a string of disturbing messages in the lead-up to her death. On the night before she died, Julie quizzed her daughter about a £ phone bill for mobile data. Ruby sent two messages to friends in Newcastle saying: “I think I might as well kill myself in the morning.” Neither replied, though it is ­unclearanyone saw the messages. Next day she killed herself. A string of teenage suicides have been linked to social media including Molly Russell, , who took her le after viewing self-harm content on Instagram. Jessica Scatterson, , killed herself in Warrington in April  after being emotionally overwhelmed by social media without the skills to cope.  Single mum Julie, who also has twins Kitty and Florry, , and Maisy, , added: “Enough is enough. This stuff is accessible to kids all the time. They are tied into it because everyone  is doing it. They don’t want to be left out. “Ruby would show me a photo of someone, going ‘Why don’t I look like that’ and wishing she didn’t wear glasses. “I told her not everything is like you see on there but she didn’t get it. “She got upset when a photo didn’t get as many likes and asked whether it was because of the way she’d done her ­eyebrows or how she was smiling.She came to my room crying, her bicep ­bleeding. She showed me her arms ­covered in marks, telling me she didn’t feel worthy of love. I felt awful.” Ruby was referred to Child  Adult Mental Health Services for treatment and began regular counselling. She was signed off in July  and the family moved from Newcastle upon Tyne to Carlisle for a fresh start. But her addiction to social media was fuelled as she tried to stay in touch with her old friends. Her messages included: “I might pop down to AE and seethey can stitch my le back together.” Another said: “How I sleep at night knowing I’m a disappointment and ­knowing no one cares about me.” "},{"url":null,"title":"tv baker who lived uk","story":"NewsTV baker who has lived in the UK for  years denied settled status by Home OfficeRichard Bertinet, who has appeared on TV shows like Saturday Kitchen, had to apply for settled status under the EU Settlement SchemeShareCommentsByMichael TaylorSarah LumleyAnna Ye:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video tv-baker-who-lived-uk-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Richard Bertinet, who has been acclaimed as a food champion by the BBC and has appeared on shows like Saturday Kitchen, was born in Brittany, France and has lived in the UK for  years. He runs his own bakery classes and has published a number of books. He also has a British we and three British children. Despite the le he has built for himself here, the Home Office has only granted Mr Bertinet pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme. This means he can remain in the UK for five more years, before needing to apply again.  The governmentaposs website states pre-settled status normally applies to EU citizens without five yearsapos continuous residence upon application. Mr Bertinet, of Bath, said he felt betrayed by the decision but is determined to appeal against it. He shared a photo of the Home Office letter on his Instagram account yesterday. Alongside the photo, he wrote:  years living in the UK without a break for more than a few weeks holiday . Originally employed without gaps then started several businesses employing s of others and one that attracts visitors in to the UK from overseas.    Always paid UK taxes. Married to a British woman for  years with three British children. Have NOT spent  days in five years or  days in  months outside the UK. Submitted all evidence requested, as requested. NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR SETTLED STATUS. Speaking about the Home Office decision, he added: I applied as we watched the news about Brexit and we were worried about having to reapply for residency. He continued: You feel like you spend  years of your le living here but it is not your home, said Mr Bertinet.  There is something not right here. It is something of a betrayal. It is a slap in the face. I have paid taxes, I am grateful for the NHS and I have employed hundreds of people for my businesses. I have never had a British passport as I have a French passport. It leaves a very sour taste in the mouth. When people today say they are embarrassed about their country, you know something is not right. Mr Bertinet said messages of support have come flooding in, including from fellow chef Nigella Lawson.  The letter from the Home Office states: You have permission to stay in the UK for five years from the date of this letter. If you wish to apply for settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme, you can do so as soon as you meet the qualying criteria for this. More information on the qualying criteria for the EU Settlement Scheme can be found at:  https:www.gov.uk settled-status-eu-citizens-families when-to-apply . You should make an application when you believe you qualy for settled status and before your pre-settled status experies.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBrutal threats directed at a young woman stuck in a slum like housing complex is a stark illustration of the housing crisis gripping the UK. Katherine Payne is one of hundreds of people housed in Connect House, a converted warehouse in south London. Eighty households, including  children, from across the borough of Mitcham are crammed into the property, with tensions between tenants frayed by the environment. The -year-old blames her recent miscarriage on the stress of living in the converted block, where she moved six months ago with her -year-old partner Scott Wilson.    Unable to afford sky high rents despite his work as a plumber, the couple found themselves homeless. They ended up in Connect House, living in a single room with width of an arm span. There is enough room for a bed which sits next to a kitchenette, toilet and shower. When sheaposs not killing as many as  flies a day she believes are attracted to large bins by the ground floor window, Katherine spends her time in fear of a particular neighbour. She claims a resident of the house threatened to put a hammer throughbelly and killbaby, before claiming he would put it through your head.   “I had to smash my own window to get back into our room three weeks ago when the man threatened to come after me and I didn’t have a key to get back in, Katherine told The Express.“I was terried. This is not a home. It’s depressing and oppressive. I just want to get out.” As well as being a stressful place for an expectant mother, Connect House seems a unsuitable environment for childrnen. Kids find space to play in the car park, next to a busy road filled with lorries and vans that roar past at speed. They are some of the , young people growing up in temporary and often overcrowded accommodation, as recorded in a new report called Bleak House. Sioghan McDonagh, Labour MP for Mitcham and Morden, was critical of the situation children were being forced to live in when she visited the property last week.  She described the set up as an accident waiting to happen and said the council was bleeding money on accommodation bad for peopleaposs health. Others inside Connect House have complained of damp, mould and dirty furnishings, with some evicted by private landlords hiking up rents on the tiny rooms. The rooms are so cramped that some families have been forced to sleep four in a bed. Eleanor , a -year-old caterer, is one tenant suffering from a lack of space. She moved into a room with her -year-old daughter Grace having fled her violent partner. They have no space for cupboards and are forced to pile their clothes up on the floor.    Her -year-old son, who has autism, sleeps in a tiny room next door, with a window looking out at a factory wall behind barbed wire. Another mum also fleeing a partner was sent to London by her council when her daughter was four days old. The -year-old said she was given a train ticket and then made to leave on her own with a buggy and a newborn. She made her daughter a mattress by sewing pillows and blankets together. A spokesman for Connect House managing agents Easy Lettings, said the building complied with all laws. They said Issues,raised, were dealt with swtly, adding: “The building is fully compliant with all the relevant regulations including room sizes, bathroom and kitchen facilities.

The team of paranormal investigators said it also has video footage of growling and screaming noises at Pool Parc asylum in Ruthin, north Wales. Six ghost hunters from the group Spirit Walkers went into the -year-old manor house armed with specialist equipment including night vision cameras and EVPdevices on August . Beth Hopper, , who runs Spirit Walkers, said they only discovered the haunting images once they ed home. She said one image appears to show a shadowy figure standing next to a noose. The mum from Chester, said: We were filming through a broken window and I just canapost explain the growling sound I heard on the film when I got back to the car.    Itaposs about one minute and five seconds into the footage, I thought: aposWhat the hell is that apos I also got those screams on the electronic voice phenomena. It was quite disturbing. People have said to me they can hear the sound of torture. If you picture the mental asylum and what mightaposve happened there, that might explain it. It is just a horrible sound. Iaposve been there several times and have heard voices and footsteps. One girl said she felt a nurse was standing right in front of her in the dark. Weaposd also heard reports of an ex-patient there who thinks heaposs a Roman soldier and who marches up and down the corridor and throws stones at people.  I was glad to get out of there in the end! But then when we did we saw a noose hanging from a window that we hadnapost spotted with our torches before we went in. It wasnapost until I lightened the picture later that we saw what could be a figure in the window. It was pretty creepy. The spirits could be trying to send a signal of the pain they went through there. My team say spirits are drawn to me because of my bubbly personality. They use our energy so maybe they like me for that. The spirits say on Ouija boards that they like me and Iaposm like a mother to them.  The group uses a range of ghost hunting equipment during its visits to haunted places, including cameras, night vision equipment, dowsing rods and Ouija boards. It also uses white sage to purge an area of any malevolent spirits at the end of a visit.Beth set up Spirit Walkers four months ago and the group already has  Facebook followers.She added: Some teams claim every piece of footage they get is paranormal but weaposre not like that.

More than , Italians captured in Libya and Tunisia arrived in Henllan north Wales in  and were held in huts and sheds. Their camp was equipped with a hospital, theatres, football pitches, tennis courts, a bowling green and kitchens.Many of the Italians were deeply religious and asked military bossesthey could build a Roman Catholic church in one of the huts in the camp, Wales Online reported .Stunning images show the inside of the church which is all that remains of the camp and was decorated entirely by the prisoners.    They show stunning religious paintings painted by prisoner, Mario Ferlito, who taught himself to paint when he family were unable to pay for him to go to art school. Also pictured is the painted dome above the altar and murals on ceiling beams, which still look stunning despite being more than  years old. Marioaposs incredible images were painted using whatever materials and supplies he could find around the camp. Boiled fish bones were used as an adhesive to bond and preserve the paint that was pigmented with fruit, vegetables, tobacco and tea leaves to create a range of colours.    Mario left the camp at the end of the war but   years later he was astonished to be told by children the chapel was still there by schoolchildren when he visited the village in . Youmanity.today reported when he saw the chapel again he said: Through the rainbow of my tears, I see the days of my youth opening in front of me like the pages of a book.” John Meirion Jones is an -year-old retired headmaster and author living near Pentregat, Ceredigion, who became lelong friends with Mario after the trip.  Mr Jones said: He didn’t learn about it from books or TV, he learned from -year-old Welsh schoolchildren. “His we said that Mario was in tears for twenty minutes when he found out the church was still there . Mr Jones said the relationship between the Italian prisoners and the local community during the war was “very emotional and friendly situation. Many of them lived with local farmers, tending their land for the five years they spent in Wales. The prisoners didnapost have any money of their own so they made jewellery to trade with the residents of Henllan, some of which Mr Jones has in his home. In ,  of the ex-prisoners came back to Wales.  Members of the community went to greet them at Heathrow Airport in London and brought them back to Henllan.

Every one of our staff has the opportunity to see they are changing lives and that has its own reward.

It’s a case of trying to get our message out there and sell our story.”VSA is preparing to host recruitment days at Broomhill Activity Centre on August  and at Linn Moor School on September .Carol believes these offer a perfect opportunity for people to find out more about the work the charity does in the north-east.She said: “What these events do is allow people to come along and see for themselves what VSA is all about.“It’s a really nice opportunity for people to come and use those skills in a dferent way to see how they can make a dference to an organisation. It’s not just front-line roles. We’ve got all of the support around that.“We can appeal to iniduals who want to work with children, older people or in mental health.

They also make for an excellently contrasting pair.From Mendelssohn’s exuberant opening bars, we are swept through music that is complex yet captivatingly, joyously melodic throughout, while Enescu’s is moody, breathlessly dramatic and, in parts, simply volcanic.Guest directed by Marianne Thorsen, SE will explore the specic charm of seeing a small group of musicians performing live. With fewer instruments, the fabric of the music becomes more tangible, subtle shts in mood may have a new-found presence, and pieces you think you know well might offer surprising new colours when heard live. With fewer musicians on stage, it is easier to follow each inidual path and witness the beautul alchemy of eight artists creating something together.Thorsen is an acclaimed soloist and passionate chamber musician. Former leader of the Nash Ensemble, she regularly performs with Norway’s Trondheim Soloists, one of the founding ensembles of The Bridge network and festival.The first half of the tour, which is called Chamber Notes, will call at Crear Studio, Kilberry, on August , followed by a performance at Mull Theatre, Tobermory, on August  before moving on to Inverness and Dundee.Other Scottish dates, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, are programmed for February .PIC:Marianne Thorsen. no_aMarianne Thorsen"},{"url":null,"title":"kilberry sportive well supported in sunshine","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Kilberry Loop Sportive saw around  cyclists take on a -mile route starting and finishing in Tarbert.All eyes were on the forecast for the non-competitive cycling event on Saturday August .

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean’s goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club’s social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"trailer load of cash raised for marie curie","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOne lucky winner can look forward to a cosy winter after winning a trailer load of logs at Mid Argyll Show.The sticks were donated, as in previous years, by Ardrishaig#s Alan Ryan to the Mid Argyll Marie Curie Fundraising Group for their stand at the show.

are becoming less common, with too much screen time affecting childrenrsquos imaginations.A poll indicates that almost three in four nursery owners, managers and staff think fewer children have imaginary friends now than five years ago.Almost two thirds of those questioned think that screens are making children less imaginative.Children today are often left with little time to be bored or left to their own devices, industry leaders suggested, with time instead filled with screens and activities.The daynurseries poll, which questioned , nursery workers, found that almost halfsay that there are children at their nursery who have imaginary friends.A total of % agreed that fewer children have imaginary friends now than five years ago.And % of those questioned said they think screens are making children less imaginative.David Wright, owner of Paint Pots Nursery group, Southampton, said: ldquoOne or two children in our nursery do have imaginary friends but they mainly come out at home, when children are alone.ldquoLess children have them now than previously.ldquoI think that children are not allowed to be lsquoboredrsquo any more.ldquoWhen children have free time to themselves, they find something creative to do with their mind, such as forming an imaginary friend.He told the PA news agency that there is a ldquogeneral issue with childrenrsquos creativity and development of imagination.--\"--ldquoQuite often these days, children expect to be entertained in some way, so that theyrsquore receiving content either from a tablet or a TV, and I think that diminishes their ability to then use their own imagination to create imaginary friends, to develop language and stories and that kind of thing.Dr Paige Davis, a psychology lecturer at York St John University, said children who make up imaginary friends are typically aged between five and seven, and often do so to help them deal with a situation, or when they are building certain le skills, like talking to others.It is dficult to tell the number of children who have imaginary friends and whether this is changing, she said, as they can be recorded in dferent ways.For example, some may consider only ldquoinvisible characters that a child has made up to be an imaginary friend, while others would count a toy, such as a teddy or doll, that a youngster has created a personality for.Dr Davis said she believes that children are making up invisible friends that are unique as ever, but that the way that children play with imaginary friends could have changed over time.TV and modern technology has changed the way children play in general, she suggested.ldquoBack when you didnrsquot have TV, or kids watched a lot less TV, you would have this spontaneous play that they created, that they were using their minds without any other thing, other than maybe a bolster from a parent or another child, whereas now you have these kids that think lsquooh, we have to play like thisrsquo because thatrsquos the structure of the TV.For example, children may play a game with a storyline they have seen on TV, rather than come up with one themselves.Sue Learner, editor of daynurseries, said: ldquoIt is sad that nursery staff have seen a decline in children having imaginary friends as it seems they are losing the ability to create a magical and fantastical world full of exciting adventures.ldquoParents can tend to fill every hour of a childrsquos day with activities and screens and they are no longer left to get bored.ldquoWhen children are left to their own devices, it

Ryan McConnachie opted to go straight down the middle and evaded the e of the Dunoon keeper.There was a moment of worry at the other end, though, when goalscorer Souden also committed a handball in the Pupils’ box, and referee Peter Laing pointed to the spot. Dunoon halved the Pupils’ advantage, making it -.Then, just  seconds later, the Pupils restored their two-goal lead through Donald McCallum, who met left-sided substitute Kenny Kerr’s low cross to squeeze a shot between the Dunoon defenders and the frame of the goal.Soon after, the Pupils made it -, when Kerr guided another delightful cross onto the head of John McCallum, who guided an effort past the keeper from six yards, but it was the goal creator Kerr who was rightly mobbed by his team-mates.Not content with four, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils scored again, with # stand by # Kerr making it three assists in one match.Played in by McConnachie after some strong play in midfield by fellow substitute Michael McKinlay, Kerr set up young winger Ross Brown, who gladly tucked home goal number five with a close-range finish.With the match drawing to a close, McConnachie sealed his brace # and the Pupils’ sixth goal # with an excellent inidual effort, surging past a defender before rounding the hosts’ keeper and slotting the ball low into an unguarded net, adding gloss to an already emphatic cup win.After a great team performance, the Pupils will be hoping for more of the same tomorrowwhen they welcome a Tarbert side # who last week also defeated Dunoon # in a Kintyre derby.The match is scheduled for a pm kick off at Kintyre Park."},{"url":null,"title":"third round of tarberts golf championship","story":"Former champion Bruce MacNab held a four-shot lead going into the third round but a horror start saw the lead wiped out at the very first hole when Iain Macalister birdied and Bruce had a seven.Iain went on to birdie the second hole as well and despite the windy conditions was very much in control of his game over the first nine holes to be out in .John MacNab was also playing his normal steady game also ing , enjoying birdies at the st and th holes.After nine holes Iain had turned a four-shot deficit into a four-shot lead over Bruce and six ahead of John.Over the next four holes both Iain and John dropped four shots allowing Bruce some breathing space to claw back some of the deficit.When play was complete and all scores checked the totals after round three were as follows: Iain Macalister , Bruce MacNab , John MacNab .In the John Reid Quaich the silverware again headed south to Largieside with Duncan Johnstone retaining the trophy, shooting  nett over the two rounds.

Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year. All these circumstances contributed to the confusion of the lay mind, and encouraged the widespread impression thatthe cards were stamped at the end of the period the duty of a citizen was thereby fulfilled."},{"url":null,"title":"leader august 23 2019","story":"The Courier is honoured to deliver news to the community # during the good times and the bad.This week we were delighted to share the news that Campbeltown now boasts the #whisky bar of the year#, according to judges at the Scottish Bar and Pub Awards , who bestowed the title to the Ardshiel Hotel.Since buying the hotel more than a decade ago, Flora Grant and Marion MacKinnon have more than tripled the number of whiskies on offer, turning the hotel into something of a tourist attraction in itself.However, we also revealed that nine jobs have been lost at Campbeltown Creamery.While it is still hoped that a take-over by local farmers is the future for the site, it is terrible for the iniduals who have lost their jobs, some after many, many years.We know there is a market for Campbeltown cheese, and while the number of farms supplying the creamery has fallen over the years, there are still almost .Here#s hoping the future is bright for both Campbeltown#s whiskies and cheeses."},{"url":null,"title":"filming-taking-place-port-seton-high-street","story":"A short film called Fishing by LS Productions means that a rolling road closure has been created.This is when the road is mainly open, but traffic will be lsquopausedrsquo to clear the road at times.It is a system commonly used in cycling and road events.There will also be parking restrictions in place.When asked, LS Productions marketing team informed the Courier that due to signing non-disclosure agreements, they were unable to say anything more about the film."},{"url":null,"title":"surge-39-struggling-39-families-sees-demand-kids-39-lunch-club-soar","story":"More than  children took part in this summerrsquos club compared to just  when it began in .And Universal Credit has been blamed for the dramatic increase in families who need help providing their children with a healthy meal, during the holidays.Sandra King, from Preston Seton Gosford Area Partnership, who help fund the club, which runs in Prestonpans and Tranent, said there was no doubt the impact of East Lothian being used to pilot the roll-out of Universal Credit was being witnessed.She said: ldquoIt is like being back in the Seventies: the number of families who are struggling and need support is high and the Universal Credit pilot in East Lothian has definitely had an impact.The outward appearance of East Lothian as an affluent county was misleading, she added, with families in all of its town and communities struggling.She said: ldquoEven in places like North Berwick we are seeing families affected.

process to ensure the facilities were up to standard.The report acknowledged the age of some of the older buildings on the site but highlighted missing ceiling tiles and grouting work which needed to be fixed.It also urged operators to have a fire risk assessment carried out for the main grandstand to ensure the fire breaks in its roof space are sufficient.The report was one of a number which were presented to MRAC in private at the end of last year.They have now been released to the public under the Freedom of Information Act.It is understood that local tradespeople are being used to carry out the work detailedin the survey, which is expected to cost substantially less than the independent estimate of pound,.Racecourse general manager Bill Farnsworth said: ldquoWork is in progress to

She met friends she hadnrsquot seen in weeks this morning and smiled as she said hello to George the lollipop man.She seemed slightly anxious as she waited in line in a new place, but the friendly manner of her new teacher visibly lted her mood and she went in with a smile, unknowingly tracing my childhood footsteps and those of her big sister.But then as I walked home, I was suddenly overwhelmed with anxieties: money worries, work worries, deadlines, bills etc. It seemed asduring the holiday period I had consciously decided to put such thoughts aside, to just enjoy the family time. Now was the pay back, we had ed to lsquorealityrsquo.But then I suddenly remembered a tale a fellow storyteller had told me many years ago. It just popped into my head and it spoke to me as I wandered back. And the truth in the story was the antidote I needed in that moment. And so I will share it with you in case you may one day find you need it:There was once a weaver who was weighed down with worries. He had so many things to do, so many responsibilities he looked into the future with dread. His worries kept him awake at night, which of course made his worrying worse during the next day. It was a vicious cycle.Then one day, he was sitting at his loom working and his worries got in the way. He couldnrsquot concentrate and he made mistake after mistake. He cursed and this was heard by an auld guidewe who happened to be passing by his window.ldquoFir whit reason dae ye curse at yer loom son, is there nae joy in yer work  she asked.The weaver looked up, feeling ashamed: ldquoIrsquom sair sorry fir ma words. Itrsquos just that as I work I think aboot orsquo ma troubles.The old woman nodded in understanding. She knew about troubles herself.ldquoAye, she said with an understanding nod, ldquotroubles can fair get ye doon.Then she paused and thought for a moment. She could see in the weaverrsquos face that he was riddled with anxieties.ldquoCan I show ye something that will tak ye awa frae yer work fir only a few minutes The weaver was happy to have a break so he left his loom and came outside.ldquoDae ye hae a bucket  asked the guidewe.ldquoA bucket ldquoAye a bucket, tae put some water in, she explained.The weaver fetched his bucket, wondering what the old woman was going to do with it.She took it to the well and filled it with a little water.ldquoNoo son, I dinnae kenthis will be tae heavy fir ye tae hold up.The weaver laughed: ldquoOrsquo course itrsquos no too heavy, fir ye only put a wee drop orsquo water in it.So the woman asked him to prove this by holding up the bucket with arms outstretched. The weaver had strong arms because of his work and held the bucket before him without any effort.ldquoAh, said the guidewe, ldquosae itrsquos nae tae heavy.ldquoIt isnae heavy at arsquo, replied the weaver.The old woman smiled: ldquoIn that case, keep haudin it afore ye like that fir  minutes. He wondered why she was asking him to do this, andshe was just trying to make a fool of him. But he was also intrigued and knew her to be an honest old soul, and so he did as she asked.After a few minutes of holding the bucket in front of him, it began to feel much heavier. After five minutes, his arms began to ache and soon they began to shake. The pain began to spread to his back as he desperately tried to keep the bucket in position.ldquoIs  minutes no over yet  asked the weaver desperately.ldquoIf the bucket is now tae heavy fir ye, put it doon son.He was reluctant to admit that the bucket was now too heavy to hold and so put it down.ldquoThe water got heavier son, didnrsquot it ldquoThe water wasnae heavier, protested the weaver, ldquoye just made me hold the bucket for tae lang.ldquoSae the water did get heavier, no in itself, but for you!The weaver looked confused and the guidewe continued.ldquoWater can get heavierye haud it ower lang afore ye, evenitrsquos just a wee drop. Yer worries are like that water, son. I am sure that they are many but ye mak them much heavierye try tae haud them in yer thochts arsquo the time.She smiled at him: ldquoTry an put the bucket doon as often as ye can,ye ken whit I mean.

years. While the name of these types of promotions seems to imply that players will be on the receiving end of totally free spins, during which anything won can be kept and withdrawn, the truth is often a bit murkier than that.The UK Gambling Commission has played no small role in attempting to clear up the matter. According to them, to use the term ldquofree spins casinos must genuinely offer free games with no strings attached, such as wagering requirements. The old, standard spins are to be referred to as ldquobonus spins instead.When Free Spins Are Not Truly Free SpinsThere are several occasions when free spinsarenrsquot free. Any spins which come with wagering requirements, for instance, breach the concept of being truly free. Wagering requirements, also known as playthrough rates, denote that a player must wager whatever they win a specic number of times before they can withdraw those funds.Wagering requirements are common in deposit bonusesbut shouldnrsquot be included in any offer which proclaims itself to be free.Free Spins With No Wagering RequirementsFortunately, the new regulation issued by the UK Gambling Commission, Swedish Gaming Authority and others are aiming to fix this issue. True free spin deals should come with no hidden terms and no strings attached. They should be offered to players with a genuine chance to win real money for free, money which can ndasha player desires ndash be withdrawn from the start. This doesnrsquot mean to say that there arenrsquot other terms and conditions.Many top free spin bonuses tend to come with dates attached, only being valid during a predetermined period. Moreover, they may only be valid on select slot machines and could be limited to players in a specic region.Only a Handful of Chances to WinThere is a downside to the new ldquofree spins offers at casinos. They generally tend to provide a limited number of spins, far fewer than the old no deposit bonuses with wagering requirements, and deposit offers. Moreover, they are often only valid on slot games which do not offer substantial cash prizes, including many simple - line games from NetEnt and others.Promos Which Are Ideal for Test Driving CasinosSuch free spin bonuses which come with no wagering requirements at all are hardly going to be appealing for players who fancy landing big wins. As mentioned, they tend to be valid on slots which donrsquot offer such epic wins. However, these promos and deals may make the ideal introduction to slot gaming for new players, or those who wish to test-drive a slot before deciding to wager real money on it.The East Lothian Courierencourages readers to gamble responsibly.

The procedure for iding matrimonial property, which is any money and other assets owned jointly or inidually is that it is to be ided fairly, which may not simply mean equally. If the situation has to be resolved in court that can result in a decision that is far from satisfactory to one ndashor both ndashof the partners.ldquoItrsquos important that we advise clients about the fact that Alternative Dispute Resolution is available. These situations emphatically donrsquot involve an inevitable progress to court ndashwhich should be regarded as very much the last resort, he says.In fact, some % or more of cases are now dealt with through negotiation rather than a court order that determines the ision of assets. People who proceed to court, says Ferry almost inevitably have an urgent issue such as suffering from a serious shortage of money or protection issues resulting from circumstances of domestic abuse.The alternative routes principally involve collaboration or mediation. Mediation, involves an independent mediator guiding the parties toward a solution. The mediator does not usually give them legal advice as to their entitlements though in assisted mediation both parties have their solicitors in the background .ldquoThat is an option that sometimes works out well ndash but many people are looking for veriable answers, and this can be achieved through the collaborative approach which I find is generally a better way to resolve disagreements.Ferry, a trained collaborative lawyer, believes this route is best to minimise conflict and secure financial choices ndashwhile also, importantly, ensuring the best future for the children. He explains that collaborative law involves the parties and their advisers in four-way meetings with discussions around the table, in private and without the delay of correspondence and court proceedings. And this, he says helps to avoid subsequent, and potentially costly, misunderstandings.The problem with pensionsPensions, for example, can become very contentious. ldquoIn our experience pensions are frequently overlooked by clients when considering orce settlements. However, the value of the pensions built up during the marriage or civil partnership is taken into account and can be substantial. Our clientsrsquo settlements often involve pension sharing agreements.ldquoHowever, pensions can be extremely complicated ndashnot only in terms of valuing them and iding them but itrsquos also important to get the best advice on which pensions should be shared and which should not. Some have more benefits attached to them than others. For example, there may be spousersquos benefits attached to them which may be very valuable.In addition, he adds, there are ious types of pensions such as Self Invested Personal Pensionswhich can be convoluted when dealing with them in orce cases as sometimes these can involve multiple underlying property and other assets contained in the pension which may need to be valued too.ldquoYou need to take advice not only about its value at the date of separation but also its type of pension and current value. A failure to identy pension interests or to correctly apportion the value of a pension may have dramatic long-term implications for either spouse and there is a strict timescale involved after orce for implementing the pension share.Business assetsFerry says that clients also need advice about business assets and shareholdings, as to what constitutes matrimonial property as these can, inadvertently, be converted into matrimonial property in the course of, for example, restructuring a company that was founded or bought before marriage.ldquoShareholdings that may be worth several millions can be transferred into the joint matrimonial pot and that possibility is not often considered by the accountant or tax advisor involved, he says.These are just a few of the issues to be considered but despite the obvious vexations that separation and orce involve, Ferry believes in confronting them in a positive, proactive way. The Family LawAct of  was well thought out and is quite flexible, providing for the needs of inidual cases, he says.Divorce, he adds, need not end up in long, drawn out court proceedings. ldquoWhether via a pre-nuptial agreement or a collaborative resolution, with good legal advice parties can deal with separation and orce in way that achieves the solution that works best for them both.Noel specialises in all areas of family law but is particularly noted for acting in high value cases for high net worth iniduals, for example, celebrities, sports personalities, entrepreneurs, business owners, directors, professionals and executives.

following suggestions that he had broken his leg.Ben spoke to the Courier about the injury and said his ankle had gone into ldquoa weird position after the tackle.He added: ldquoI got pins and needles into my knee and I tried to stand up because I had got a fright.ldquoI thought it was broken and stood up but could not put any weight on it and just fell to the floor. That is when the pain went straight up my leg.ldquoThere were about five minutes left and they were going to take me off. I could not stand up because of the pain shooting up my leg and they brought on the stretcher.ldquoThe referee then decided to call it a day.However, that was just the start of an eventful night for Ben who said: ldquoThey tried to phone an ambulance but since my leg was not bleeding and the bone was not sticking out of my leg they could not send one.

We were doing well but we could not really test the goalkeeper as much as we wanted to do. They have got fresh legs and they scored two goals but we never really tested the goalkeeper as much as we wanted.Tranent boss Calvin Shand was pleased it was not as serious an injury as first feared.He said: ldquoI think, at the time, we feared the worst. It looked a sore one and with him getting taken to hospital it was feared it could be long term.ldquoBut, it is not broken, which is a good thing and we will need to reassess it in a couple of days when the swelling goes down.ldquoIrsquom really disappointed for Ben, who has come back off holiday, back to fitness and had a good run of form.ldquoHe is a massive player for us and we are disappointed for us as a club but more for Ben as a player."},{"url":null,"title":"musselburgh-museum-closed-following-ceiling-leak","story":"A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said: ldquoMusselburgh Museum is operated by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with the council.ldquoUnfortunately in the recent bad weather there was a leak from the ceiling.ldquoThe leak has only affected the office and corridor area ndash the museum and the exhibits have not been damaged.ldquoAs the building owners, the council is now organising repairs through our property maintenance team and we will ensure the work is carried out as quickly as possible to allow the museum to reopen as soon as possible.ldquoScaffolding has been erected outside the museum and repair works will shortly commence.

His missionary work took him all over Scotland, including the coastline of the Forth. It is said his arrival at this small natural harbour gave the place its name.Last weekend, artist Andrew Crummy, who lives in the village, organised three lsquosunset eveningsrsquo at the Boat Shore. Local musicians, singers, artists and actors gathered on the beach with an audience of fellow locals to share the sunset.I sadly couldnrsquot attend the first two but was able to make the last evening with some of my children. It was a wonderful mix of music and song, with a very funny short drama, and a setting sun as the backdrop.It was a poignant evening for myself, and I know for some others too a moment of reflection as well as coming together. I had planned to tell a tale about St Kenneth, but I changed my mind just before the event.Instead, I told a tale of a friendship between a tortoise and a butterfly and what sunsets meant to them. In story, anything is possible, and I made this tale to help ease someonersquos sadness in experiencing an ending.I was later askedI could share it, and so here is the story:There was once a tortoise who became friends with a butterfly. On the first day of their friendship, the tortoise invited the butterfly to sit with him on his favourite rock, to watch the sunset.However, Butterfly had no idea what a sunset was, and so when she saw the sun fall gradually from the sky she became concerned.ldquoWhatrsquos happening to the sun  she asked in a worried tone.ldquoItrsquos the sunset, said Tortoise, ldquoitrsquos when the sun goes down and ends the day.ldquoWhat, already! Thatrsquos it  asked Butterfly, horried. ldquoThis is just my first day being a butterfly and my days are over Tortoise smiled: ldquoNo my wee friend, itrsquos not all over. The sun will come back and there will be another day.But Butterfly remained anxious: ldquoHow can you be sure the sun will come back ldquoTrust me, I know. Irsquove seen many sunsets, said Tortoise. ldquoThe sun always comes back. Sometimes it takes longer than others, sometimes you canrsquot see the sun because of clouds, but it always s and makes another day.Butterfly was now reassured and so settled down to watch, as the sun dipped lower, painting the sky. She expected the sun to sizzle and the sea to steam when they touched each other, but of course that didnrsquot happen. The sun slid quietly below the horizon, leaving a trail of bright red and orange.ldquoThat was beautul, wasnrsquot it  Tortoise said.But Butterflyrsquos reply was unexpected: ldquoI think I donrsquot like sunsets very much.Tortoise curled up the wrinkles on his old face in surprise: ldquoWhy not, donrsquot you think it was spectacular, the way it painted the sky ldquoSuppose, but it was sad, really sad, said Butterfly.ldquoSad ldquoYes, because the sunset ends the day and thatrsquos sad. Endings are sad.Tortoise nodded in a way tortoises do when theyrsquore thinking: ldquoYes thatrsquos true, endings can be sad. But everything ends sooner or later. Nothing lasts forever.ldquoBut thatrsquos what I mean Tortoise, itrsquos so sad. I donrsquot want to sit and celebrate the end of something.Tortoise thought for a moment: ldquoAlthough endings can be sad, they also give meaning and value to our time. Without sunsets we would not treasure our days. Our le would become one long blah of sameness.ldquoA blah of sameness ldquoYes, my expression, smiled Tortoise proudly.ldquoBut thatrsquos easy for you to say, Tortoise, because you have more time than me, you will have more days.ldquoPerhaps, but that means your time is more precious than mine. And your sunsets are greater celebrations of your days.Butterfly thought about this. ldquoYou seem quite wise, Tortoise, she said, looking at her friend.ldquoYes, he replied immodestly, ldquoI do have that reputation. I suppose I have a lot of time to think, sitting on this rock.It began to get dark and colder.ldquoNow itrsquos time for our dreams. Soon there will be the sunrise, said Tortoise.ldquoSunrise  Is that when the sun s Tortoise nodded: ldquoYes, you see you donrsquot get a sunrise without a sunset. Although endings can be sad, they open the door to new beginnings. At the other side of a sunset there is a sunrise.Tortoise was indeed wise and Butterfly felt reassured by his wisdom.That summer, the two friends watched many sunsets together. They would share stories about their day as the sun went down. Then one evening, as flocks of geese were flying overhead, Butterfly spoke sadly.ldquoTortoise, I need to go. Itrsquos getting cold. Irsquom off to Africa. Do you think there are sunsets there ldquoIrsquom sure of it, replied Tortoise.ldquoI love sunsets now, said Butterfly. ldquoThey have shown me to treasure and celebrate my days. But I am sad this is our last one together.ldquoMe too, said Tortoise.The two friends sat together on their rock as the sunset commemorated their summer with a blaze of colour. Then they said goodbye.A new dawn now lay ahead for them both, for the end of one story is the beginning of another.And at the other side of a goodbye, there is a hello."},{"url":null,"title":"new-dunbar-grammar-school-head-boy-follows-mum-39-s-example","story":"Thomas Leitch has been named head boy at Dunbar Grammar School, nearly  years after his mum, Karen Leitch, nee MacKay, was named as head girl.Thomas, , is joined by head girl Georgie Cross, with the duo looking to strengthen communication in the school and its eco credentials.Thomas, whose mum was head girl in -, said: ldquoBecoming head boy was always something I have been interested in.ldquoI would not say there was a pressure but I was pushed forward by my mum, who was head girl when she attended the school.ldquoI always wanted to give something back and I have enjoyed my six years and felt it was right for me.Georgie, also , previously planned to leave school and work for a year before looking to go on to university.She said: ldquoI made the decision to stay on towards the end of S.ldquoI was involved in the pupil council and the set-up already within the school.ldquoI made my decision to stay on and decided I was not a person to sit idle or who wanted it nice and easy I want to make a dference while I can, especially when I consider myself quite a confident person.Interested pupils put their names forward to become head boy or head girl and outlined what skills and attributes they possessed which they felt made them suitable.A hustings then took place within the school before speeches were given in front of senior pupils encouraging them to vote for them.An interview in front of Claire Slowther, headteacher at the school, and the outgoing head boy and head girl Ben Dorin and Hannah Dickson, followed before the results were revealed.Now the duo, along with deputes Ben Totten, Niamh Goldie, Alicia Lancaster and Emma Welsh, are looking forward to a busy year ahead.Thomas, who plays scrum-half for the schoolrsquos rugby team, told the Courier that communication had been at the heart of his manesto.He said: ldquoI really focused on communication within the school and making sure it is not just senior management and senior pupils who get a say.ldquoIt is everyone and I got that point across and set up drop-in sessions so we have always got younger pupils to get involved.Similarly, Georgie, of East Linton, was keen to strengthen the schoolrsquos eco profile.She added: ldquoOne issue I would push, which the school is doing, is to make the school as eco as possible.ldquoThere is a lot of buzz around climate change.Mrs Slowther said there was a strong list of candidates for the two roles.She added: ldquoBoth Thomas and Georgie stood out with their confidence, commitment to the school and a real sense of what they wanted to bring to the school."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/10147038.jpg?htype=144\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"gerry-cinnamon-announces-second-glasgow-hydro-gig-popular-demand","story":"The Castlemilk singer recently told how he is to play the SSE Hydro on December  following his insane TRNSMT set.This morning the venue confirmed a second leg of his Glasgow show the next night for December .EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FOR @GerryCinnamon!! #Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW... https:t.co JVHyTY pic yXRWuCIimPosting on social media the Hydro wrote: \"EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FORGerry Cinnamon.\"Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW...\"We told previously howCinnamon, , told fans they had \"lost it\"they didnt think hed soon play in Glasgow and his latest output confirmed two December gigs for lucky punters to get excited about.He will also play Aberdeen in November."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-incredible-moment-karaoke-singer-stuns-hamilton-pub-nessun-dorma-performance","story":"William Boyle had the usually rowdy crowd at Bar West at a hushed silence as he bellowed through Paottis famous tune.The clip was posted on social media by user Ann Robertson who hailed the performer.:Watch boy, , belt out Bohemian Rhapsody on Central Station pianoShe said: \"I love all music but my absolute fave song in the whole world is Nessun Dorma by Luciano Paotti.\"I hope I dont embarass this gentleman but he nailed this in Bar West tonight n should be proud.

The world is a much better place as a result but, unlike with family, the bonds and obligations of friendship are less clear-cut. Sometimes ties wither naturally, at others, rash or destructive relationships have actively to be severed. This is an unpleasant fact of le and one that Prince Andrew is discovering belatedly to his cost.For some time now, speculation has been mounting after the publication of a photo showing the Prince walking in a New York park with his friend, the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was recently found dead in a prison cell, where he awaited trial on charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to engage in sex-trafficking.The headlines must have made the Palace shudder, their insinuations all too clear. After details of a US lawsuit mentioning him were released, a terse statement was issued distancing the Prince from historic accusations made against Epstein, and claiming that ldquoAny suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.:Prince Andrew hosted Jeffrey Epstein at BalmoralClose observers of Buckingham Palace might have noticed a cloud of dust around the flagpole as the house was shaken to its foundations. When the Daily Mail published footage recently showing the Duke of York ushering a young woman out of Epsteinrsquos Manhattan apartment in , a further statement was issued. The Duke, it said, ldquodeplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.Poor Prince Andrew. He is discovering what every child in the playground knows: that you are tarred and feathered with the same brush as those with whom you mix. If one of your gang throws a brick through a window, you are deemed guilty too, evenyou did nothing wrong.In the case of His Royal Highness, letrsquos put aside for a moment the suspicions his closeness to Epstein, following his release from prison, arouse. Bad enough that Andrewrsquos personal contacts are so dodgy they raise serious questions about his judgement, let alone his behaviour.If nothing , these images suggest one of two things: that the Prince was a loyal chum who stuck by Epstein, despite his ruined reputation and the risk it posed to his own. Or that, living as he did in a gilded cage, removed from real le and the consequences of any stupid decisions he made, he was utterly unconcerned about the effect their friendship might have on his prospects. When you are cocooned from birth in a cradle of privilege when you are feted, indulged, and pandered to by sycophants and liggers from the minute you can shake a rattle, it must be easy to believe you are above the normal rules and standards by which society works.Meeting in the park with Epstein was, at best, decidedly odd for someone in Prince Andrewrsquos position. Going to his apartment, however, where a stone satyr presides over the front door, was simply crazy. According to police who raided the property, they seized photos of underage girls. These and the fetishist decor would have led most ordinary visitors to make a swt exit.These images of the Duke of York date from the period when he was acting as British ldquoSpecial Representative for Trade and Investment. A bespoke role for an aimless aristocrat, it gave him licence to roam the globe, meeting fat cats in rich countries and opportunistic states in the hope that some of their wealth would find its way into Britainrsquos Treasury.:In Pictures: Commonwealth leaders gather for state dinnerDuring his deployment as an envoy, Prince Andrew made ious embarrassing ldquomissteps, among them some politically unwise associations. Nothing, however, could compare with being identied as one of Epsteinrsquos cronies, after which revelation he relinquished the post.As the grapevine quivers with anticipation over other high-profile names likely to be found in Epsteinrsquos fat address book, the Dukersquos predicament is increasingly grave. He can hide behind the Palace gates and hope the storm will pass, but this is a story that has been brewing for years. Until certain questions are satisfactorily answered, as far as hersquos concerned it is far from over.Doubtless, it will go against every royal instinct, but would he not be wiser to face the cameras, do an in-depth interview, and silence ndash perhaps even charm ndash his critics  In a situation like this, where unfettered gossip is fuelling supposition, Prince Andrew surely needs to explain his connection with Epstein and help suffocate the scandal. It would, of course, be a historic move. No member of the royal dynasty has ever voluntarily gone on record to put their side of a wildfire story, with the exception of Princess Diana. In her unforgettable, kohl-eyed interview with Martin Bashir, she was more focused on scoring points against Prince Charles than in illuminating her own often dubious actions.Sticklers for Palace protocol might feel sick at the thought of Prince Andrew going public. Even in the hands of the most measured journalist ndash Kirsty Wark, say, or Fiona Bruce ndash it would be viewed as stepping into the lionrsquos den, a suicidally reckless act. Added to which, the Windsors do not explain. They take a long view, recognising that the passage of time usually allows even the most unsavoury episodes to fade into oblivion.In this instance, however, that seems unlikely. So what is worse  Staying schtum, and waiting for more seedy revelations to be added to the blaze, or allowing the Duke to get ahead of the story, and give his version of events By remaining aloof, the Palacersquos response suggests it hopes to avoid further fallout. The implication of this is all too plain: royals might not be above the law, but its arm would have to be very long indeed to winkle one of them out of the front door and into a Black Maria. Inviting a Windsor to a police interview, let alone into a courtroom, would require Herculean effort, and a mountain of cast-iron evidence. By contrast,Andrew were willing to face, refute and defuse the rumours, it would be an act of bravery to restore family pride."},{"url":null,"title":"swathes-rural-western-scotland-struggle-population-decline","story":"Around  per cent of ldquodata zones in the Western Isles and Inverclyde saw the number of people living there drop, adding to concerns around long-term depopulation.Figures show that over the last seven years, rural and island councils had the highest percentage of data zones ndash small areas used to provide local statistics ndash which experienced population falls.In contrast, % of data zones in Edinburgh saw a rise in population, alongside % in Glasgow.:Islands which are not growing in population must be given greater self-determinationChris McEleny, SNP opposition leader at Inverclyde Council, called for part of the Scottish Governmentrsquos next budget to go towards a ldquospecic, targeted fund to help drive repopulation in the worst hit communities.He said it was something the council is ldquoabsolutely concerned about.He added: ldquoWe have had ious guises of repopulation strategy for the last  to  years.ldquoTherersquos been so many dferent things that the council has been trying, and without saying that they have all been a failure, they have not brought the success we were hoping to find.ldquoOne of the main issues is birth rate versus death rate.

There is a byelection next Thursday and the SNP are throwing the kitchen sink at it, hoping to inflict a shock defeat on the Liberal Democrats.A third of the SNPrsquos MSPs have visited so far, including Nicola Sturgeonand a good chunk of her cabinet. There have also been MPs, MEPs, councillors and staffers from HQ.Itrsquos a fascinating contest. For this is no ordinary seat.

The Brexit Party arenrsquot standing on Thursday, although the husk of Ukip are.If a lot of Leavers stay home, put off by a two-horse race between Remainers, the fight between the SNP and LibDems becomes a real one. The fewer the votes in play, the bigger the scope for an upset.:Scotland in Union funds sink to record lowOrkney MP Alistair Carmichael this week sounded the alarm, urging Labour and Tory supporters to back the LibDems. ldquoIf we split the anti-independence vote by voting for other parties or independents, then it is possible the SNP could win this seat, he said.ldquoThere is a reason why, having not set foot in Shetland for three years, the First Minister has now visited three times in one month.Of course, scare tactics to mobilise your vote are standard for elections. But other LibDems say similar things in private. ldquoItrsquoll be close, they frown.There is another factor that can help the SNP. Money. At national elections, candidate spending limits are based on the size of the electorate. In Shetland, the maximum allowed by law in  was pound, over five months. But the spending limit in byelections is a standard pound, that can be spent in five weeks.That kind of money - which the SNP has and the Scottish LibDems donrsquot - lets the SNP blitz every corner of the islands.Motivation is also with the SNP. Winning Shetland would show the party can win anywhere. It would burst Jo Swinsonrsquos bubble. Fighting it hard forces the LibDems to spend cash theyrsquod rather not, drawing in subsidies from the UK party earmarked for the general election.If the LibDems lose, they also lose their seat on Holyroodrsquos business bureau, which deals with chamber and committee work, as membership requires five MSPs.So should we all wait up to the small hours on Friday to catch some Holyrood history  I wouldnrsquot put the cocoa on yet.The SNP is still the under-dog, and it sounds it. ldquoLend me your vote, pleaded candidate Tom Wills this week. Hersquos ldquoasking for just  months until the next election, the First Minister added.The SNPrsquos main message has also been incoherent, hyperbolic nonsense. Unable to play the Remain card against the LibDems, it has tried to make the vote about the Prime Minister. Despite Shetland voting .% Remain in , Ms Sturgeon and Mr Wills are promoting guff about a vote for the SNP sending ldquoa strong message to Boris Johnson that Shetland wonrsquot stand for Brexit.Picture the scene in Downing Street. ldquoIrsquom sorry, Prime Minister, but yoursquove been sent a strong message. Remain voters in a Remain seat in a Remain country have swapped one Remain party for another in a Remain parliament. Nothing in Westminster has changed one jot. However, just to be on the safe side...The SNP sounds like a party trying to talk furiously about national issues because itrsquos running scared of its record on the ground after  years in power.ldquoI know therersquos more work to do to improve local ferry services, says Mr Wills of a key issue. He promises a ldquobrighter futurehe wins. Brighter future is code for an inadequate present.:Shetland byelection turns ugly as SNP graffiti sprayed on war memorialIn contrast, LibDem Beatrice Wishart has focused throughout on local issues like ferry costs, poor broadband, farming, schools and the NHS, putting the blame squarely on the SNP for all shortcomings.As one SNP hand puts it: ldquoThe LibDems are not as toxic as they were. The Brexit thing is not going to work for us up there because theyrsquore as anti-Brexit as we are. Wersquore also getting to the stage where people must feel tired of having their doors banged every night of the week.However byelections do throw up surprises, andthe SNP win, there is an intriguing consequence. It would tie the votes in parliament. There would be  in the Nationalist corner and  for all other parties. The Government could avoid embarrassing defeats. It would not have to watch its laws being repealed again by a united opposition, as happened with the Offensive Behaviour at Football Act.It would also put Ms Sturgeon achingly close to an absolute majority. Another byelection or a defection and she could claim a stronger mandate for Indyref.Well, almost. Only  of those  votes would come from SNP MSPs. The other would rely on Mark McDonald, the former minister who quit in a sleazy text scandal. He currently represents his Aberdeenshire seat as an Independent, but normally votes with his old party.If the SNP win Shetland, his vote would become more valuable to ministers and so give him more leverage. Perhaps, after his two-year penance, the SNP might like to readmit him, for instance  He was never expelled after all, but resigned.If the SNP pull off an upset in Shetland, it would indeed mean a brighter future.

The windfarm industry is not been very forthcoming on the extent of that issue.\"In terms of what is being done by energy companies to offset damage to the peat, the future remains unclear. Mr Lindsay said: \"Maybe theyre restoring some very damaged peatland but what are the long term effects of what theyre doing on the windfarm  Nobody can answer that question because were looking at potential carbon release over decades. There are a whole series of issues that have never really been investigated.\"And its not just an issue in Scotland. On the ridges of Northern Spains Cantabrian Mountains windfarms have been constructed on blanket bog, bisecting almost every one.But there could be an alternative: building onshore windfarms on agricultural land that is currently not being used to its full potential.In America and Europe, some windfarms are built on leased farmland, allowing farming, crops and grazing, to continue around them.Mr Lindsay said: \"There is incredible reluctance to turn agricultural land into multi-use but there is huge potential there.\"Scottish government planning policy now requires the use of a carbon payback calculator, developed by The James Hutton Institute and Aberdeen University, that assesses the carbon impact of windfarm developments by comparing the carbon costs of the developments with the carbon savings made.David Miller, Knowledge Exchange Coordinator for The James Hutton Institute who helped develop the calculator, told the Herald on Sunday: \"The starting point was to rely on modelling of the carbon costs ... after a few years you could begin to refine the models to say the carbon payback would take a certain number of years, originally calculated to be one estimate and then subsequently recalculated today.\"Calculations can y from seven to  years which far exceeds the -year le span of turbines, influencing the carbon calculations when considering the impact of re-turbining or reinstatement of the site.Mr Miller said: \"This is something still being worked on in Scotland because we recognise that protecting our peatland is a core element of Scotlands contribution to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions.\"Onshore wind is playing its part meeting Scotlands climate targets, said Mr Miller, but more questions need to be asked.He said: \"After  years, as each of the developments come up for reconsideration, are there any which might have been put in the wrong place and might not be renewed because other sources [of energy] are becoming effective.\"We have an opportunity in the second half of the next decade for reconsidering whether some of the earlier developments are as efficient for production as originally intended. Hypothetically, it might turn out [that windfarms] are not as negatively impacting to landscapes as feared or there might be other areas where the impacts are greater than has been expected but it does mean that the story is not finished.\"Nothing comes without a cost, said Mr Miller, especially not our energyHe said: \"Energy isnt created, its just transferred. So its hard to imagine that genuinely, there is environmental and cost free energy. Its not just the magnitude but where and the nature of the trade-off. That explains why were felling trees instead of planting them as we did  years ago because of the understanding of the signicance of the peatlands for carbon storage.\""},{"url":null,"title":"green-energy-debate-case-onshore-wind","story":"As our capacity to capture the energy from the gales and breezes which scour Europes windiest country has increased, so too have the numerous benefits which onshore wind farms bring.In , the most recent year for which statistics are available, the onshore wind sector invested pound. billion in Scotland ndash the equivalent of .% of Scotlandrsquos GDP.Read more:The green energy debate: are wind farms really worth it But the real reason the world needs onshore wind is simple: we cannot win the fight against climate changeour energy industry continues to produce carbon at the rate it historically has.The equivalent of around three quarters of the electricity we use in Scotland is delivered by renewables like onshore wind today, up from just a quarter  years ago.Using renewables like onshore wind to generate electricity means we dont have to use fossil fuels, and prevents, according to the most recent figures, . million tonnes of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere each year ndash the equivalent of taking almost every car, bus, lorry and train off Scotlandrsquos roads and rails.But while onshore wind power is more popular today than itrsquos ever been ndash and more popular in Scotland than in the rest of the UK ndash we need to be sure the development of onshore wind projects is as environmentally sound as it can be.Industry works hard with an enormous range of stakeholders to make sure that the very best construction, operations and maintenance practices are followed.Last monthwe worked with our members, Perth and Kinross Council, Historic Environment Scotland, Forestry Commission Scotland, SEPA and Marine Scotland to update a document which has come to symbolise that cooperation: Good Practice during Wind Farm Construction.Read more: The green energy debate: why wind power will never be the answerIt sets out, in detail, best-practice principles on every aspect of wind farm construction, from how to best engage planning authorities as a site is being considered right through to engaging in circular economy concepts like re-using and recovering as much redundant material as possible.Scottish Renewables also sits on Scotlandrsquos National Peatland Group, which is revising a National Peatland Plan to take into account new information on how wind farms and peatland interact.And that brings us to a remarkable but often hidden benefit of onshore wind development: its intrinsic relationship with conservation and restoration of our most valued flora, fauna and landscapes.The Scottish Governmentrsquos carbon calculator plays a key role in ensuring that wind farm developments in Scotland are built in a sustainable way.It compares the carbon costs of wind farm developments with the carbon savings attributable to the wind farm in a comprehensive and consistent way, giving planners the detail they need to consider every application.As an industry which works in remote areasthe onshore wind sector has led the way in restoring hectares of degraded peatland while at the same time installing turbines to tackle climate change and generate local economic benefit.Scotlands rigorous planning system, currently undergoing reform following the PlanningAct and through the formulation of the fourth National Planning Framework, is in place to ensure only good, sustainable projects get built ndash and that all interested parties get their say in the process.We must continue to develop our renewable energy resource to provide the clean energy needed to tackle the climate emergency and meet our net-zero emissions target, and our industry will continue to work with stakeholders across society to make sure we do that in the most sustainable way possible."},{"url":null,"title":"following-money-trail-top-heavy-navy-passing-danish-britain-vietnam","story":"I know almost nothing about Greenland but it is clearly much more than the President of the United States.

Throughout the war the Allies had armed and supplied the independence movement, the Viet Minh under Ho Chi Minh, to fight the Japanese occupying forces on the promise of self-determination after hostilities.However, at the Potsdam Conference in July , when the world was ided into spheres of influence and control by Churchill, Stalin and Truman, it was decided that the French, who had colonised Vietnam, were to , although, after their defeat and occupation by the Nazis, they were in no shape to do so.The Germans had surrendered and after the two atom bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki the Japanese did likewise in early September.So Mountbatten, trying to hold the country for the Frenchand with insufficient Anglo-Indian troops to do so after Ho and the Viet Minh rebelled over the duplicity, allowed the Japanese armies to hold on to their weapons and fight against those who had been promised their freedom.Itrsquos a little-known and deeply shameful episode in Britainrsquos inglorious past.But for the arming of the then enemy, itrsquos safe to say there would have been no Dien Bien Phu, no Vietnam War, , US soldiers would not have died and, more pertinently, more than a million North Vietnamese soldiers and two million civilians would not have perished.This was an episode missing from the hagiographic documentary."},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-39-s-greatest-views-part-2","story":"The second part of our fanastic series, Herald writers reveal their favourite views ... and explain why they should be yours too.Down Gleann an Dubh-Lochain, KnoydartWhat makes it so special  Wild, remote, astounding beauty.Its was late May, , and my friend and I had walked in from Kinlochhourn to the wild Knoydart peninsula .

Shersquos been saying, and the Liberal Democrats and others have been saying for so long, lsquoLook, we need to have a second referendum, and Remain needs to be on the ballot paper.rsquo They are now being offered a fail-safe, parliamentary procedural way of delivering that and they are saying [lapses into Moaning Minnie voice], lsquoOh well wersquore not going to co-operateJeremy Corbyn is going to be the person leading itrsquo.As mood music for tomorrowrsquos meeting it was more thrash metal than easy listening.: Fuel duty cut on cards Donald Trump and Boris Johnson had made it easy for the editors of early news bulletins by holding a breakfast meeting in Biarritz. The President spoke of the UK having an [EU] anchor round its ankle at the moment. A positively buoyant Mr Johnson lost no time in trying to press home an advantage. \"Talking of the anchor, Donald, what we want is for our ships to take freight, say, from New York to Boston, which for the moment theyre not able to do.\" Earlier, he gave a long list of goods the UK was just itching to start shipping to America, including shower trays and Melton Mowbray pork pies. What pictures that conjured up.The president smiled when askedhe had any advice for Mr Johnson on Brexit. ldquoHe needs no advice. Hersquos the right man for the job. Irsquove been saying that for a long time. Didnrsquot make your predecessor very happy but Irsquove been saying it for a long time. A diplomatic silence might have been just the ticket for Mr Johnson at that point, but given the choice between offending Theresa May or telling the President how grateful he was for the compliment, there was no contest.: Brexit and the borderMr Trump used to be as warm towards Canadarsquos Trudeau and the summit host, French premier Macron, as he was with Mr Johnson. The UK PM might ponder how those earlier bromances turned out before he pitches his hopes of a trade deal too high.Mr Johnsonrsquos good mood held throughout a round of interviews with the BBC, ITV and Sky.ITV political editor Robert Peston pressed him on Sunday paper reports that the Government was threatening to slash the ldquoorce settlement with the EU from pound billion. Sounds like a threat, said Peston. ldquoItrsquos not a threat, said the PM. ldquoItrsquos a simple statement of reality.Using the same coastal backdrop for her interview, BBC chief political correspondent Vicky Price extracted from the PM a downgraded assessment of the chances of a no-deal Brexit. From ldquoa million to one the situation was now ldquotouch and go. He also gave a guarantee that medicines would get throughthere was a no deal Brexit.What many were keen to see was how Mr Johnson would be with Channel  News. The channelrsquos head of news and current affairs, Dorothy Byrne, did not exactly miss and hit the wall when she gave the MacTaggart lecture last week at the Edinburgh TV Festival. At one point she called Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn ldquocowards for giving broadcast interviews a body swerve and communicating via social media.In the event the Channel  interview was cancelled. In a tweet, the programme said one senior advisor told producers it was due to Ms Byrnersquos speech. The reason given to Robert Peston when he quizzed Mr Johnson about the no show was that he did not have time. Of all the broadcast interviews in all the world, eh  As another of his predecessors once said, itrsquos a funny old world."},{"url":null,"title":"dads-army-peaky-blinders-series-five-episode-one-sanditon-episode-one-reviews","story":"Peaky Blinders, BBC****Sanditon, ITV****HOW would you like your Sunday evenings served, madam: with bare naked laddies, cuddly nostalgia, or machine guns  Those were the dining options as the main channels attempted to lock viewers in for the autumn.Peaky Blinders made the move from BBC as a reward for its Bafta-winning, young audience-grabbing ways, while ITV was offering Sanditon, which sounds like a DIY product but is in fact an unfinished Austen brought to a close by Andrew Davies, the writer who puts the bonking into bonnet and carriage dramas.But who do you think you are kidding, Mr Scheduler  For a certain vintage of viewer, the main event was Dadrsquos Army: the Lost Episodes.

Fay Vass, the society’s chief executive, said: “We frequently get calls from members of the public who have been watching a hedgehog that’s been lay still in their garden for days.“By the time we get the call and the person gets the hedgehog to rescue, it’s often too late.“Hedgehogs don’t sunbathe. If you see a hedgehog lay still in the open, or with flies round it orit’s struggling to walk properly, it is in urgent need of rescue.”If you find a hedgehog in need of help the society suggest you use gardening gloves or an old towel to collect the animal, placing it inside a high sided cardboard or plastic box with the towel or an old t-shirt in the bottom for it to hide under. Take the box indoors away from flies.If the hedgehog isn’t bleeding, offering a warm wrapped hot water bottle is good first aid, but do make sure there is room for it to get offit gets too warm and ensure the bottle is not allowed to go cold.Offer some meaty cat or dog food and water but don’t force feed it.Once you’ve done that, call a local hedgehog rescue centreyou know of one, or BHPS on    for further advice and local contacts.If it’s a baby, Fay says you should check for siblings.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The exhibition-on-wheels is travelling around Scotland highlighting the importance of remembrance.\"  Poppyscotland’s ‘Bud’ hits the road to tell the poppy’s storyviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"A healthier way to travel...and the government hopes more of us will get back on our bikes or walk for short journeys, rather than taking the car.\"  Have your say on Scotland’s National Transport Strategy viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“Hoglets don’t usually come in ones,” she said. “If a hoglet it is trouble, its brothers and sisters may well need help too, so do look around vicinity for others.” She added: “Acting quickly could literally mean the dference between le and death.

His musical collecting and recordings pre-dates the Folk Revival of the s and s and consequently are unique.David Cook, sub-committee chair of Live Le Aberdeenshire, said: “We are delighted to accept this unique collection of local and national signicance into the permanentcollections of Aberdeenshire Council Museums.“Whilst the recordings are in good condition, they are threatened by physical degradation and some are stored on formats that can no longer be played. Being part of this national initiative will ensure some of our local recordings of Scots music will be digitally preserved and available to folk at home and abroad for future enjoyment and learning.”Alastair Hardie, one of the trustees acting on behalf of the late John Junner, said: “In his will, John Junner asked for his collection to be kept ‘at a suitable location in northeast Scotland’.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.deesidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Rehomed Horse of Year  Tinto and Fiona Bell.\"  Tinto has been so much more than a friend viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"\"Ten years after his death, his wish has finally been fulfilled with this donation.

The additional roles are part of package of improvements agreed by councillors in January.However, a new permit scheme is also being introduced to move business waste away from recycling centres to create more space for new recyclable materials to improve services to householders.While most businesses pay the necessary fees to dispose of their waste and recycling responsibly, the current open access to recycling centres means some business waste is being presented as household waste so that it can be processed free of charge.To tackle this, a new permit scheme is one of the measures being introduced next year to prevent such abuse. Under the new scheme householders using commercial type vehicles - vans, pick-ups, minibuses or trailers - to take materials to recycling centres will require a permit to do so.The permits will be free of charge and can be used at any of the  recycling centres operated by the council.Households will be able to apply for the free permits in advance and a yearrsquos supplywill be issued at one time to minimise inconvenience.Permits can be applied for online or by post at any time of the year and will be valid for  months.Aberdeenshire Council does not expect the new scheme to have an impact on most householders as permits will not be required for cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs or xs, unless they tow a trailer or a horse box.Permits can be obtained for trailers up to  x  ft in size.Certain types of vehicle typically used by businesses will not be permitted at HRCs, specically those over . tonnes gross weight, tippers, tractors, large trailersand vehicles with twin wheels or more than four wheels.Aberdeenshire Councilrsquos Waste Manager, Ros Baxter, said: ldquoThe approval of the new permit system is very good news as it will allow us to make space for more recyclable materials at recycling centres and improve services for householders.ldquoMost households will not be affected by the permit system at all as cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs and xs will continue to have unlimited access to recycling centres.ldquoWe are keen to minimise inconvenience to those householders who use commercial type vehicles or trailers to take materials to recycling centres.\"Only one application is required to get a yearrsquos supply of permits and we have also increased the number of permits to  per year to make sure householders have enough permits to cover the grass cutting season.ldquoWe will be communicating the details of the new permit scheme over the coming months, so there will be plenty of time to apply for the permits before the new scheme starts.ldquoBusinesses will be provided an alternative service at waste transfer stations, and with a lower price for recycling, will be encouraged to segregate and recycle as much of their waste as possible.ldquoWe will be monitoring closely how the new schemes settle in and can tweak them in future based on feedback received.More information about the new recycling permit scheme is available on www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk recyclingcentrepermitsdata-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Aberdeenshire Provost Bill Howatson said armed forces personnel make huge sacrices to keep us all safe\"  Aberdeenshire Council achieves gold award for work with armed forces, families, veterans and cadets viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"August ,  at : amCOMPETITION: WIN A PAIR OF TWEED LAMPSHADES FROM ORKNEY TWEED  The Orcadian has teamed up with Orkney Tweed to offer readers the chance to win a pair of Orkney Tweed lampshades, worth £.

Free parking of up to one hour will apply as usual in metered car parks over the winter period.Tankerness Lane will be closed to vehicles throughout the works, with one-way systems in place at ious times on Broad Street and Palace Road — with Victoria Street closed to vehicles for approximately five weeks from  January . Pedestrian access will be maintained throughout.The council has said the key aspects of the Place and Spaces project are to improve the area at the bottom of the Strynd and top of Castle Street, provide a new path to the war memorial to enhance it as a place to stop and reflect on the signicance of the monument and improve the head of Victoria Street to encourage more people into this part of the town.Depute council leader, councillor Leslie Manson, said: “The works carried out in Kirkwall’s town centre through our Townscape Heritage Initiative Scheme have given our streets and buildings a much-needed new lease of le, whether that be improvements to the shop fronts or the attractive new paving at the head of Broad Street.“This latest phase is aimed at improving the entrance to Victoria Street to encourage more shoppers and visitors to take a wander down this street — a long-held aspiration of the businesses that are situated there.“There will, of course, be some inevitable disruption, but we’ve worked hard to ensure that this is kept to a minimum, including suspending works for the Christmas period. I look forward to seeing the improvements that are made and the effect these have on our historic streets.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The daynurseries poll, which questioned , nursery workers, found that almost halfsay that there are children at their nursery who have imaginary friends.A total of % agreed that fewer children have imaginary friends now than five years ago.And % of those questioned said they think screens are making children less imaginative.David Wright, owner of Paint Pots Nursery group, Southampton, said: ldquoOne or two children in our nursery do have imaginary friends but they mainly come out at home, when children are alone.ldquoLess children have them now than previously.ldquoI think that children are not allowed to be lsquoboredrsquo any more.ldquoWhen children have free time to themselves, they find something creative to do with their mind, such as forming an imaginary friend.He told the PA news agency that there is a ldquogeneral issue with childrenrsquos creativity and development of imagination. --\" --ldquoQuite often these days, children expect to be entertained in some way, so that theyrsquore receiving content either from a tablet or a TV, and I think that diminishes their ability to then use their own imagination to create imaginary friends, to develop language and stories and that kind of thing.Dr Paige Davis, a psychology lecturer at York St John University, said children who make up imaginary friends are typically aged between five and seven, and often do so to help them deal with a situation, or when they are building certain le skills, like talking to others.It is dficult to tell the number of children who have imaginary friends and whether this is changing, she said, as they can be recorded in dferent ways.For example, some may consider only ldquoinvisible characters that a child has made up to be an imaginary friend, while others would count a toy, such as a teddy or doll, that a youngster has created a personality for.Dr Davis said she believes that children are making up invisible friends that are unique as ever, but that the way that children play with imaginary friends could have changed over time.TV and modern technology has changed the way children play in general, she suggested.ldquoBack when you didnrsquot have TV, or kids watched a lot less TV, you would have this spontaneous play that they created, that they were using their minds without any other thing, other than maybe a bolster from a parent or another child, whereas now you have these kids that think lsquooh, we have to play like thisrsquo because thatrsquos the structure of the TV. For example, children may play a game with a storyline they have seen on TV, rather than come up with one themselves.Sue Learner, editor of daynurseries, said: ldquoIt is sad that nursery staff have seen a decline in children having imaginary friends as it seems they are losing the ability to create a magical and fantastical world full of exciting adventures.ldquoParents can tend to fill every hour of a childrsquos day with activities and screens and they are no longer left to get bored.ldquoWhen children are left to their own devices, it forces them to be creative and discover an inner world where they meet fun imaginary friends like Puff the Magic Dragon.ndash The daynurseries poll questioned , nursery owners, managers and staff in April and May.copy -.

Christ, how many times  IT’S RAPE, you troglodytes.However discomfiting these examples may be, they have nothing on the disingenuous coverage of Boris Johnson’s encounters with Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron. I mean, we could all see him sitting beside Merkel as protesters screamed “Liar” and “Stop Brexit” we could all see him stick his feet up on Macron’s side table like a self-entitled brat .The most inexperienced of analysts would have understood that turning up in Berlin with bluster and braggadocio, but no actual plan B was hardly a masterstroke and that Merkel and Macron’s agreement to give him a month to come up with aalternative was just a tactic to keep him occupied while they get on with important affairs of state.And yet the Express and the– cheerleaders for the worst Prime Minister in history – presented his bilateral talks as a triumph. The Express carried a photo of him raising his arms behind a fence with the headline “Brexit Victory Salute”, ashe were Winston Churchill giving his “Finest Hour” speech rather than a floppy-haired fop back from a European jolly. Thewent with the headline “Johnson Demands Fresh Border Plan”while columnists lined up to explain how he had seen off Macron’s attempts to intimidate him and had reset the EU negotiations. Neither paper pointed out that Macron reiterated that the Irish backstop was “indispensable” and that this is the position they have held ever since Theresa May’s withdrawal deal was negotiated.Their spin – or as Byrne would doubtless prefer us to frame it, “lie” – would be troubling at the best of times but as we are hurtling towards a No Deal, it is utterly irresponsible. At a time when journalists should be pointing out the perils of his misplaced ebullience, many are egging him on, feeding his self-delusion.In her MacTaggart Lecture, Byrne called out the inadequacy of much of our current news coverage and scrutinised some of the reasons for it. She blamed our contemporary leaders – May, Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn – for refusing to submit themselves to scrutiny as previous leaders including Margaret Thatcher did, and went on to compare the way Johnson does his own pieces to camera as Vladimir Putin-style politics.But she also castigated news organisations for believing audiences no longer crave forensic investigations and for talking down to young people. Citing Carole Cadwalladr’s Facebook Cambridge Analytica investigation and the popularity of hard-hitting podcasts, she said there was still an appetite for in-depth exposés, although she didn’t point out that they require resources as well as courage – and that such resources are not widely available.Finally, Byrne talked fearlessly about the need for more ersity: for more women, certainly but much more pressingly for more BAME employees. Although she rejected the phrase “pale, male and stale”, pointing out that many middle-aged white men make excellent programmes, she said TV made by a clique of posh boys was never going to challenge the status quo. “When you change who is making TV, you change TV,” she said.Much of what Byrne raised, we see in action every day the cabal of male presenters who revel in their outmoded attitudes . And the courting of a younger demographic with nattily-dressed presenters, bite-sized news items and YouTube influencers when what many of those who are politically engaged want is to be confronted with new perspectives on giant issues such as climate change. There are exceptions, of course: Jon Snow stands out as a journalist willing to challenge the prevailing orthodoxy, and Five Live journalist Emma Barnett has earned a reputation for skewering political interviewees.But time and time again, especially in  shows and radio phone-ins, broadcasters yield to the demand of  balance, treating journalism as a stand-off between two opposing sides rather than a quest for truth. Nor is BBC Scotland immune to these problems though much of the new channel’s output has been admirable, it is still overwhelmingly white. Meanwhile, The Nine has twice invited alt-right mouthpiece Brendan O’Neill to spout his anti-scientic climate change-denying views. Shouldn’t we be better than this As the spectre of a no-deal Brexit casts its increasingly dark shadow, there does appear to be a collective raising of the game. Over the past week or so, the BBC has been running a series of news packages analysing what a no-deal Brexit might mean in terms of the supply of fuel and medicine and the slaughter of animals that can no longer be exported.But as Byrne says, whatever happens with Brexit, our country is undergoing seismic changes and our broadcasters must do much morethey are to play a crucial role in holding those responsible to account. “We must find courage in this time of crisis,” the Scot said. “We must unite to use the power of television to protect democracy because it is being seriously undermined.” The following day, the Express gave its default response, which was to refer to “an online backlash” invisible to all but them.As Johnson engages in some pre-US trade talk willy-waving – insisting he will tell the US president “the NHS is not on the table” – Byrne’s rallying cry could not be more relevant. As men who couldn’t be trusted to tie their own shoelaces set the global agenda, the public is being failed. We need journalists to be less cowed. But we also need broadcasting companies to be willing to take risks, and newspaper owners to be interested in the actual news. And we need this to happen sooner rather than later.

I’m trying to make long term changes and make sure these become habits I’ll stick to for the rest of my le. So far I’ve lost  kg, and my exercise levels have increased signicantly too. My blood sugar levels have decreased, but more importantly I feel better physically and psychologically. “The Diabetes Prevention Programme and the team who deliver it have been amazing. I’m looking forward to seeing a new me at the end of the nine and a half month course.”Thelma was referred onto the Diabetes Prevention Programme by her GP Dr Jean McCaughern, Maine Medical Practice, CullybackeyThe practice serves around , patients that live within a six mile radius of the surgery. Dr Jean McCaughern joined the surgery around  years ago and was placed in charge of the practice’s diabetes clinic.At first she managed this alone, today she heads up this specialist clinic with the help of two practice nurses. She does this alongside her normal GP responsibilities.She said: “When I first started the clinic around % of our patients were diabetic and that included those who had both type  and type  diabetes. Today that figure has more than doubled. In  we have a prevalence rate of .%. That’s how quickly the disease is on the rise. “Often patients don’t realise just how serious the illness is. I have overheard patients saying ‘I just have a touch of diabetes’ or ‘I only have diabetes’, but it’s a serious illness which can cause deterioration of vision, contribute to heart disease, kidney disease, stroke, and vascular problems which at their worst can lead to amputation.“Patients of mine have had all these problems and more. The reality is dferent to the perception and it’s only when dficulties start that people begin to understand what living with diabetes can mean. The longer you have the disease, the more likely you are to have any one of those complications.“Having diabetes presents practical problems too. In some cases the DVLA can revoke people’s drivers licensestheythey believe there is poor management of diabetes. This can include raised sugars, but more importantly sugar levels dropping and causing confusion in patients as is would be unsafe to drive.“For some people having diabetes is out of their control. Those with Type  diabetes have no choice but to manage it using medication. “For others who spot heightened blood sugar levels early, termed pre-diabetic, they have a window of opportunity to reverse or delay a diagnosis of Type  diabetes through healthy eating and exercise. That’s who the Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at and who it can help.“Once higher sugar levels are discovered, the earlier people can make changes and the higher the chance they have of reversing the outcome. Sometimes, it’s not about changing the diagnosis but delaying it by a decade or so. “The longer you can hold it off the longer you can hold off the complications that come with it. “It’s not all bad news though, having diabetes, whether Type  or Type , is largely manageable either by medication, treatment or diet. “Insulin, used primarily for treating type  diabetes, lowers blood sugar levels when diet and exercise alone aren’t sufficient, but the effectiveness of these medications depends on how early the disease is diagnosed and the size of the dose.“I was happy to get involved in the Programme. Having an interest in diabetes I was approached by the Public Health Agency at the operational stage to look at the programme’s viability in my area. I’m a big supporter. “So far I’ve referred around  people from the practice onto the programme which educates and empowers people of the contents of foods, the need to exercise and develop better eating patterns. “Often I’ve heard people say once they have to go on a special diabetes diet but that’s not the case, it’s just healthy eating, it’s the way we should all be eating.“As far as the success of the programme goes, it’s a little early to tell. The first cohort of people started on the programme in May and early results are positive. Certainly weight loss as a group has occurred and people have more knowledge of food, portion control and exercise.“So, there are benefits for all and for some the course is working really well. When you join the programme as a group you bond as a group, you encourage each other, you don’t want to let your group members down. “That shared experience and cohesiveness is a real motivator and works across all ages and all groups. For many the programme offers them a chance to turn a future diagnosis around and gives them the tools to change their future. “That can be le changing and what the programme is designed to do”.KEY FACTSThe Diabetes Prevention Programme is run by the Public Health Agency.It is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor.The Diabetes Prevention Programme is delivered over a nine month period and is free of charge.It is facilitated by health coaches who offer help and assistance to participants, helping them change their lestyle, diet and physical activity with the aim of postponing and even preventing type  diabetes.For more information on the ‘Diabetes Prevention Programmeemail your local Health Trustdiabetespreventionni@northerntrust.hscni.netst  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2094373.jpg--.jpg?1566376242000\n","title":"talent galore at music mania event","story":"Broughshane was alive with the sound of music last weekend when the Music Mania event rolled into the village.Local people were given the chance to take to the stage and show off their musical abilities and talents, both with instruments and voice.Many turned out to not only take part, but also to watch on and support those on stage.Bob Esler was the compare for the evening where there was live music on stage from pm with an open mic session and a BBQ proving popular with everyone.

I watched the tournament on Sunday night and was delighted for him.”Another local amateur golfer Conor Doran said he hopes to meet up with Rory on hishome to congratulate him in person. “He’s so talented and myself and the guys are really happy for him,” said Conor. “This is just the start of his career.”Banbridge club professional Jason Greenaway, a friend of Rory’s, said the young golfer has worked wonders for Northern Ireland sport.“I was glued to the television on Sunday night like everybody ,” said Jason. “To see him and Graeme win it back-to-back is just fantastic. And for Rory to have recovered from Augusta in such a short time is such a great success story.” And Jason said Rory’s personality matches his calm and down-to-earth playing nature. “With Rory what you see is what you get.

Neils grandmother is in the centre of the centre row.He said: “A good friend of mine owned a bar in Dromore, she gave me an old bottle that said ‘ginger beer’ on it. It was meant as a joke because I’m ginger, but it ended up starting a fascination with bottles.“I started looking into where the bottles were made and background to them.“My original intent was to collect a bottle from every county, but soon I found out there are a lot of bottles out there, probably  known bottles. They are very dficult to find. I would hunt through antique shops, flea markets, auctions and that type of thing. You also pick some up by word of mouth or even dig them up from an old dump site.“My collection ranges from Coleraine to Cork, but a number of local bottles have eluded me.

No two bottles are the same due to the processes involved, but the minor flaws are what add to their charm. “Historically stone bottles were gradually replaced by mass produced glass bottles, the result of which is that many of these were buried in landfill sites or dumped in rivers and canals and can be dficult to locate.”Neil added: “I’ve always had a big interest in local social history, these stoneware bottles are part of it. I have been working hard in documenting the past so that it can be preserved for future generations. “I have amassed a collection of local items, everything from clocks to water pumps, but there are a few items that I have struggled to find. I am keen to locate any stoneware bottles from Banbridge and anything relating to the Dunbar McMaster spinning mill in Gilford.”He said: “I was born in Gilford into one of the mill workers houses owned by the Dunbar McMaster company and my family were historically mill workers there.

Whether it’s further education or the world of employment, the important thing is not to panic. There are loads of options available and, as McDonald’s Westwood’s Business Manager Katie McManus can attest, an unexpected road can often be the best one.The -year-old began working in McDonald’s in Glengormley while studying for her A-levels. Aged , Katie had plans of going to University and becoming a Mental Health Nurse, but completely changed direction following her time at the fast food restaurant. “I decided not to go to university and to take a gap year after my exams,” she explained.“I went Crew Member to Sht Manager and then realised that’s what I wanted to do. I got promoted the whole way through to Business Manager. “Personally, I wouldn’t advise anyone to go to university until they know what they want to do. There’s no point wasting the time and money doing it. I would encourage people who are maybe panicking about grades not to worry. There are dferent things out there, and you’re not always taught that in school or given all the options. I never thought I would be working in McDonald’s but the option found me.”She continued: “It’s not what people would assume – it’s very business orientated for me. You’re very driven to work towards targets and it’s competitive. The teamwork and morale is amazing too, you literally feel like you’re with your family away from home.”As well as offering a career, McDonald’s also offers a range of educational and professional development courses to help employees attain everything from GCSE’s to university degree.“There are so many opportunities,” Katie said. “You can constantly get promoted towards Business Manager and then after that you have options to become a franchiser one day, which is a big opportunity butyou really want it you can push for it. “We have people at the minute studying for the GCSEs through our apprenticeship programmes, so they’re getting their Maths and English qualications, which will help them in the future le. Because I didn’t go to university, the option is there for me to do a business degree, which I’m planning on doing next year, so I didn’t miss out on that.”She continued: “I was quite anxious and nervous about making the decision not to go to university. It’s hard to knowyou’re making the right decision at that age. “Looking back, I’m glad it turned out that way. I would say to some of the young ones in here not to panic. Everything happens for a reason and you don’t know what path you’re going to go down until you go down it. GCSE’s and other exams are important, but there are other avenues that you can go down to get dferent jobs.”She added: “McDonald’s don’t really on experience and what you have in your qualications – it’s all about your attitude, your attitude to doing well and how hard you work. “If you are hard working and they really want to make something ofyourself then you should come here.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"glasmullin green standoff continues into second day","story":"PROTESTORS have ed to Glassmullin Green amid a stand off over plans by De La Salle College to build a new sports facility on the site.Work was due to begin the £.million project yesterday, but campaigners moved on to the green in a bid to block the development.Contractors Haffey Sports Grounds left the site yesterday following an intervention from the Friends of Glassmullin Open Green , who have campaigned to protect the space since .Residents resumed their protest this morning.Aithne Kerrigan from FOGOG has accused De La Salle College of acting “in bad faith from the outset”.“They have said that they have tried to engage with residents – they haven’t,” she said.“They held an open night at the start of April and they only managed to get seven people across their doors, four of which were definitely objectors. They told us at a meeting in April that they would keep us informed by email, but we have yet to receive an email from De La Salle to inform us that the work was going to start. They basically think we’re going to go away, but you know what  – we live here, we’re not going to go anywhere.”A spokesperson for De La Salle said the school had engaged in“considerable consultation” and modied plans three time to benefit its pupils and “the whole community”.“The school has kept the community in touch with developments as the contract process drew to a conclusion including leaflet drops and an open evening in April to present and view final design plans. A meeting with residents followed shortly after the open viewing evening. The school also indicated that with tendering administration nearly complete the work would start by the summer. Following notication from the successful contractor the school provided details to residents immediately about the contract start arrangements. We also advised local political representatives.”The spokesperson added: “The school has already invited residents to participate in a Management Committee to minimise the impact of any potential disruption to residents during the construction phase and to oversee the usage of the new facilities which will be available to the whole community next year. During the open viewing evening, at subsequent meetings and in written communications residents have been encouraged to join the Committee.“We remain committed to working with the local residents during the construction phase and thereafter.”FOGOG maintain that the pitch will be detrimental for the people of the area.“There’s going to be a major loss access to open green space,” Ms Kerrigan said.“There’s a covenant on this green. It should be protected for everybody. It shouldn’t be fenced off for exclusive use, not to mention noise pollution, lighting pollution, the additional traffic to this area, but fundamentally the loss of open green space. Glassmullin green is precious to the residents, it’s precious to the community.“We don’t have access to open green space in West Belfast. This is the last open green space in West Belfast and it should be protected for this generation and the next. We lost it before when it was Silver City, and we’re not prepared to lose it again.”She added: “We’ll do what needs to be done to protect Glassmullin Green. We’ve campaigned since  and we’re not going to stop now.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"portrait honour for campaigner raymond","story":"A PORTRAIT of a local victims campaigner has gone on display as part of an exhibition by an artist who believes he embodies the true spirit of the north.The painting of Raymond McCord is among  by artist Shauna Fox that have gone on display at the exhibition in the Sea Holly Gallery in Hill Street.Shaunawas born in Bangor but is now based in London, where she is studying fine art painting at Camberwell College of Arts. She makes paintings, sculptures and installations related to being a woman in st century Britain and, more recently, issues related to the north.Shaunw asked her father to pick someone for a portrait who he believes unites communities here. His answer was Newtownabbey man Raymond, who became well-known for his work as a victims campaigner after his son, Raymond Jnr, was murdered by the UVF in .Shauna explained: “Raymond McCord is a victims’ campaigner and he’s a man I’ve always admired – an archetypal Ulster man, brave, unrelenting and he believes that the only way we can deal with the past and move forward isboth communities deal with it together.“My work focuses a lot on ethical issues and human rights. I have explored the destruction of Aleppo by barrel bombs, the oppression of women in relation to honour and sacrice and the Troubles in Belfast.“I studied Ethics at school and from there I became interested in humanitarian and ethical issues. I knew my peers knew little of the atrocities, injustices and inhumanity being carried out at home and abroad on a daily basis and so I based my artwork around these issues in an attempt to raise awareness and present my thoughts, views and responses to them in an innovative and stimulating way.“This body of work is mainly based on my experience of living in Northern Ireland for  years, moving to London and then looking at it from afar. Moving away has made me interested in finding out more about where I’m from, but the more I discover about where I’m from, the more I question whether it’s somewhere I can be proud of and want to live in again.”Raymond said he was “honoured” to be featured in the exhibition.“It is an honour to have a portrait done. I never ever dreamt something like this would happen to me. Unbelievable. I can#t thank the artist enough.“The portrait itself will be dedicated to my son young Raymond and the rest of the innocent victims and in particular to the many from North Belfast. This is for all of us in both communities.”Shauna’s exhibition runs until August  at the Sea Holly Gallery in Hill Street."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38415041.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/poll.jpg","title":"brexit poll saying majority backs irish sea border rejected by dup","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Brexit.https:www.belfasttelegraph news brexit brexit-poll-saying-majority-backs-irish-sea-border-rejected-by-dup-.htmlhttps:www.belfasttelegraph incoming article.ece d AUTOCROP h poll.jpgEmailA DUP MP has rejected the findings of a poll which revealed that almost three out of five voters in Northern Ireland would prefer a border down the Irish Sea to a hard Brexit.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the idea that more people here would rather remain closely aligned with the EU than the UK is in no way reflective of the community he represents.The survey carried out by Belfast-based polling and market research company LucidTalk asked people how they would vote in a referendum proposing that Northern Irelandremained aligned to the European Union, \"perhaps staying in the single market and the customs union\".Read MoreDire Brexit warnings of no-deal listed in leaked document dismissed by DUPAlex Kane: Boris Johnson could be tempted by Brexit backstop only for Northern IrelandCorbyn: Brexit general election once-in-a-generation chance for changeJohnson under pressure to recall Parliament following no-deal Brexit warningsSome .% of respondents said they would vote in favour of \"a border in the Irish Sea\" and would rather Northern Ireland remained more closely aligned with the EU than Great Britain.Some .% said they would reject the compromise, while .% said they did not know.Within the response, unionist voters were largely opposed to the prospect of breaking away from the United Kingdom in favour of the EU, with some % of Democratic Unionists and % of Ulster Unionists rejecting the idea.However, Sir Jeffrey questioned the level of support for staying aligned with the EU indicated by the LucidTalk poll, saying it contrasts with the views of his constituents in Lagan Valley.\"These polls by LucidTalk I dont think accurately reflect opinion,\" he told the Belfast .\"Their polling methods are not reflective of the wider community, especially on the unionist side.\"In contrast to the  of people that they poll, the people that I talk to in my own constituency do not share that view at all. data-dfpadtargetingSir Jeffrey Donaldson\"A clear majority of them would not support Northern Ireland being separated from the UK.\"As the UK hurtles towards its exit from the European Union, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly said will go ahead with or without a deal on October , experts have warned that at least , jobs could be at risk in Northern Irelandan agreement is not reached.Sir Jeffrey said the survey has no bearing on his partys position of opposing the backstop and protecting links with the United Kingdom. data-dfpadtargetingMartina Anderson\"We believe that it is not in Northern Irelands best interests, economically or in any other way, to be torn away from Great Britain,\" he continued.He said the UK is one of the largest economies in the world.\"We export far more goods to Great Britain than we do to the rest of the world, including the EU combined, so I dont think it is a credible or rational approach that we should create barriers between ourselves and what is by far our biggest market.\" However, nationalist politicians said the poll is an accurate reflection of public opinion in Northern Ireland and comes as no surprise.An overwhelming number of nationalists opted for closer alignment with the EU, with % of Sinn Fein and SDLP voters who responded to the poll backing the Northern Ireland only backstop.Sinn Fein MEP Martina Anderson said the survey reinforces her view that more people would prefer a united Ireland as a means to staying within the EU than a potentially catastrophic crash-out.\"Opinion poll after opinion poll has shown that the majority are in support of a pathway back into the EU,\" she said.\"I think we need to acknowledge that the vast majority of people in the north voted against Brexit.\"If faced with the choice, they would prefer an enhanced border in the Irish Sea.\"Ms Anderson added: \"If unionists are surprised, they dont have their finger on the pulse of the people that they represent,\" she said.\"The majority of the people quite clearly dont want to see a hardened border.\"Also responding to the survey, SDLP Brexit spokesperson Daniel McCrossan said his only surprise is that the number of people who favour a border in the Irish Sea over a potential hard Brexit is not higher.\"Brexit has been an absolute calamity which looks about to end in a disastrous no-deal,\" the West Tyrone MLA said.\"This will be bad for business, trade and commerce.\"It will especially hit people hard along the border.\"A united Ireland has become a reality for many now and not just an aspiration.\"It should be no surprise to anyone that a further majority wants to avoid a hard border on this island that would interrupt integrated supply chains, damage our economy and bring hardship to border communities.\"Its sadly also no surprise that the DUP continues to ignore the wishes of most people.\"The Tory-DUP Government at Westminster has no mandate for a no-deal exit.\"The majority of middle ground voters also supported the compromise, with % of Alliance voters and % Green Party voters backing the proposition."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38421911.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/2008192-_Read-Only_.jpg","title":"1000 children on waiting list yet trust returns half its

Half-a-century on, this week has also seen contention and disturbances surrounding the Apprentice Boys of Derry annual parade in Derry-the very same demonstration that was the focal point for the beginning of serious violence exactly  years ago.But, whilst the events of August  in Derry without doubt played a pivotal role in shaping the following decades, in a wider context it was just one episode amongst many more fraught historical events of the last  years.The decade between - was undoubtedly one of the most consistently eventful in Ireland throughout the twentieth century.Within those ten years the country went through the campaign for Home Rule, World War One, the Easter Rising, the Irish War of Independence, partition, the Irish Civil War and the foundation of the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland. Added to that were campaigns for social change exemplied by the  Lockout and the suffrage movement.In combined effect, each of these hugely momentous events left no strata of Irish society untouched or unscathed by the violence that emanated from them. And, the historical shockwaves of some of these events, most particularly partition, also shaped future events in Northern Ireland that literally exploded onto the streets in the late s.In the Republic of Ireland concerted efforts have been made in recent years to make this decade of centenaries more inclusive and tolerant and respectful. The civic remembrance of those Irish men who fought and died on the British side in WWI has grown for example and the previously unthinkable visit to Dublin by an English monarch has taken place.Republican leaders once sworn to end Queen Elizabeth II’s reign in Northern Ireland by any means necessary have greeted her with handshakes and smiles. Uncomfortable conversations around these events have also taken place.In the North, still three years away from the conclusion of this decade of th anniversaries, there is the looming prospect of how the creation of Northern Ireland will be dealt with by nationalists and republicans.The outward signs at least are of course currently not good, encapsulated as they are by the ongoing absence of Stormont. Overlapping it all is the fact that in the North the events of  years ago are beginning to come full circle into the realm of major time passed milestones.So, half-a-century after the Civil Rights movement rocked the foundations of the Northern state to their core, how have we dealt to date with the commemoration of seminal historical events north of the border Professor Peter Shirlow is Director at the Institute of Irish Studies at University of Liverpool and was formerly Deputy Director of the Institute of Conflict Transformation and Social Justice at Queen’s University. He has undertaken conflict transformation work in Northern Ireland and has used his knowledge to work with former combatants and non-governmental organisations in Yugoslavia, Moldova, Bahrain and Iraq.“I think we have dealt with these issues in ways that have shown a lot of maturity, especially when it came to commemorating .“There was a lot of stretching beyond previously comfortable positions and remembering for example the children and the Royal Irish Constabulary who were killed and a realisation that conflict is just not about the commemoration of those who were on ‘your’ side. We are also beginning to look at women in this period who were made invisible.“There are many ways in which to understand what happened and they are a lot more erse than we have been told, but we haven’t yet built this into ways of how to deal with our past,” Peter Shirlow said.The insistence within each community that their version of the stories of the past are the ‘righteous’ versions has been at the root of inter-communal stre even decades after actual conflict has ceased. Heroic versions of the past are something that Peter Shirlow says that as a society we need to look beyond. He added that his research has indicated that Northern Ireland’s dferent cultures are not necessarily converging on that issue as yet.Professor Shirlow is also the Independent Chair of the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister Employers’ Guidance on Recruiting People with Conflict Related Convictions working Group.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshHe told the Derry News: “I have found a very strong sense in the Protestant Unionist Loyalistcommunity that the conflict is finished and there’s a need to move on. They don’t want to engage because there’s a sense it’s in the past, that it’s over.“More people in the PUL community seem to have drawn a line under it-that it was  years ago, so there’s a reluctance to engage. A lot of loyalist prisoners came out and went back to work and don’t appear to have the same fascination with the Troubles.“The republican view of that is they believe loyalists do not want to engage because they are ashamed. It’s not a practical or a sensible view.“I’ve done a lot of research within Protestant working-class communities and there’s some acknowledgement of history, some reverence for Edward Carson and a degree of asking where we are going, but not a lot of interest in looking back at what happened during the Troubles.”The academic also said that he senses with the nationalist and republican community a need that their narrative of events “must be proven right.”So, the Derry News asked Peter Shirlow about how things will pan out when the centenary of the creation of Northern Ireland arrives It’s an issue he believes which still very much reverberates within the political sphere today.“The issue of partition is part of the inter-party talks at the minute. We will have to decide whether Northern Ireland is a ‘good place’ or a ‘bad place’.“We tend not to concentrate on what we have done well. Culturally we are globally renowned-from Van Morrison right through to Snow Patrol’s Crashing Cars being the most listened to song of the st century so far. In terms of sport we recently hosted The Open and we have names such as Rory McIlroy, Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke, but we don’t use what should symbolise the positive aspects but concentrate on the fractious issue of conflict. It makes us forget how globally regarded we are,” he said.Professor Shirlow also contends that the all invasive aspects of one-sided commemoration also often obscure the stories of human bravery and kindness that took place during the conflict.“There are stories of the Troubles where many people put their own lives in danger to save others. I know someone in Ardoyne who took a policeman into their home and him to stop him being killed. It stops the appreciation of victims being someone’s mother or father, son or daughter. And, I’m sure it’s the same in Derry.“Commemoration doesn’t look at a lot of le experiences or the fact that people on both sides took risks to help protect each other. Commemoration can largely be about the self.”The Derry News also asked Peter Shirlowhe thinks that at specic times, political parties push their ideas of commemoration onto their prospective voters to purposefully polarise communities “There is part of it that is a response to ‘your’ community and that symbolises that these events have power and politicians are sometimes trapped in that. But, of course parties will use that for their own ends.“If we united on issues like the health service, education, employment and the environment perhaps there wouldn’t be such a focus on identity. However, there are signs that people are exploring other ways to move forward,” he said.CAPTION: Professor Peter Shirlow, Director of the Institute of Irish Studies at the University of Liverpool."},{"url":null,"title":"special creggan performance dedicated lyra mckee","story":"A special all-female performance of a play written by esteemed Irish dramatist Brian Friel took place in Creggan yesterday in memory of Lyra McKee.Art Over Borders’ th Lughnasa FrielFest paid tribute to the young writer and journalist who was killed in the city with a free performance of Brian Friel’s  play The Enemy Within.Two performances had been scheduled to take place in two churches, St. Columba’s Church of Ireland in Omagh, Friel’s birthplace, and All Saints Church of Ireland in the Waterside Derry on Saturday.However, festival organiser Arts Over Borders unexpectedly announced the additional free performance in Creggan.The Enemy Within is centred around Columbas room or cell in the Autumn of , on the island of Iona, off the West coast of Scotland.The entire play centres around issues such as ‘Who am I’ and ‘To whom am I connected ’Published in , Friel wrote the play connecting it to the social troubles at the time.Columbas enemies were not only limited to his inner self, but also to his own family. Even though he had left Ireland, presumably for good, his family held an immovable grip which crippled Columba in his work on Iona.This pressure contributes to the inner struggles Columba is forced through in several parts of the play.Yesterdays performance on the last day of the four-week festival was dedicated to the memory of Lyra McKee who was shot dead during rioting in the Creggan area on April  of this year.Her partner Sara Canning was invited along by the organisers. Derry born festival co-curators Sean Doran and Liam Browne felt it was appropriate and timely to honour the memory of Lyra McKee with this all-female world premiere presentation.Speaking to the Derry News, Mr Doran said: “Our international Brian Friel Festival is jointly held in Donegal and Derry, with the Derry location now celebrating the playwright’s more socio-political plays and themes of justice, gender and ethnicity.“To complement the Lughnasa FrielFest Donegal, Here I Come! we have given the title of OVERCOME to Derry’s Lughnasa FrielFest in recognition of Derry’s ability to continually overcome its challenges and to resonate  years on from the Civil Rights marches of  that were directly inspired by the Black American Civil Rights movement.“The Black spiritual singers Ruby Philogene MBE and Tayo Aluko will join the casts of Brian Friel’s The Enemy Within and The Freedom of the City offering sung preludes and interludes to the Omagh and Derry performances.”Mr Browne added: “We had the pleasure of working with Lyra previously when she kindly agreed to be part of a discussion  in our Home of St. Patrick Festival in Armagh in . On that occasion she explored the particular challenges that face young women today, the pressures to reveal, issues around identity, privacy and such.“The subjects which Friel explored throughout his work of gender, poverty, ethnicity, isolation and spirituality mirror the themes which also concerned Lyra and about which she wrote.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"llandrindod man mike complete last ever six marathons birthday","story":"Mike Hodges with one of previous marathon medals.

Then I got a local engineer to sandblast it and paint it so that is was like new and that cost another few thousand.ldquoThe rest of the cost will be spent on the build and the fit out inside. I reckon that even after we live in it for a while, it would still retain some valuewe wanted to sell itwe decide to travel again or rent it out. I see the cost as the equivalent to three yearsrsquo rent and itrsquos money not wasted as we still have something at the end of it.The tiny home concept mdashnormally one bed studio-style homes mdash has become popular for people looking for a simpler way of living in locations that they can change and without tying themselves down to massive mortgage.Michael, who is from Whiterock, and Alex, who is from Saintfield, discovered the concept while travelling and living in a small van in New Zealand for a year.ldquoI had been aware of tiny houses before we went to New Zealand and over there it is really popular, explained Michael. ldquoThey really are everywhere. Seeing how people live in these tiny houses inspired me that it could be done here too.ldquoWe lived in one of them during our time in New Zealand and loved it. It did simply our lives and it was a bit more sustainable which is a big thing is for us.ldquoWe donrsquot like the idea of renting for the next few years or being tied down to a mortgage and this allows us to be flexible, plus it is a bit adventurous.The couple, who first began to date after getting together at their leaving formal at Down High School, have designed their home with a galley kitchen with sitting area, a small shower room and loft bedroom in a building that is six metres long by . metres wide and . metres high.The house should be finished in time for Christmas and is kept near Lisbane where the couple try to work on it every day.Michael, a design engineer graduate, and Alex, who graduated in textile and design, are both working part-time jobs at the moment in order to devote themselves to the build.Michael said: ldquoWersquove done all the work ourselves in order to save money and to gain more skills.

The remaining minutes of the half were played at a hectic pace with some tremendous play on show.Sheila McGrath and Greville handed Westmeath a three-point lead before Mallon and Dowdall swapped points as the game entered added time.However, Down had the bit between their teeth and three inspirational scores from Finnuala Carr, Aoe Keown and Mallon brought the sides level at - to - with time practically up.Westmeath were not to be denied a first half lead and a converted Greville free sent her side in at the break with a hard-earned - to - lead.The second half was every bit as competitive with Down again dominating the share of possession, but they continued to struggle to put that advantage to good use.Frees from Greville and Mairead McCormick and a magical strike from McGrath suddenly had Westmeath - to - ahead after  minutes.Down went for broke and minutes after Mallon and McCormick exchanged points, the predatory Saoirse Sands struck with venom when she netted after taking control of a Fionnuala Carr free.Paula Gribben reduced the deficit to two points before Greville and Mallon again exchanged scores. Mallon was unerring in front of the posts and with four minutes remaining she left a point in it after scoring from play.Unfortunately, McCrossan took advantage of two more Down wides from frees when she gave her side a - to - lead with two minutes of added time played.Sara Louise Carr kept the pot boiling with a th point for Down, but this was the last score of the game as the referee blew the final whistle on the resumption of play.Down: M McNally, N Kelly, A Savage, C McGilligan, C Rocks, D Magee, K McMullan, A Keown , P Gribben , S L Carr , D Savage, S McCartan, N Mallon , C McGourty, F Carr .

John Murray won possession on the half way line and drove through midfield, linking with Neale, who released Healy on a one-on-one with Hynes, but the stopper stayed upright to deny him.Rosario were happy to let the YC play in front of them and hit on the counter and their best chance in the first half fell to Conor Murray after some clever link up play with Michael Johnson. However, his driven shot ended safely in the arms of YC goalkeeper Aaron Carberry.The visitors then had their best chance of the half in the th minute. Neale did well to hold off a defender and release Healy on the edge of the box, but his shot was fired just over.Both teams changed formations in the second half and Rosario really started to create some great opportunities.The game sprang into le when Johnson was put through one-on-one with Carberry, but once again the lsquokeeper stood up and made a smart save, with Murray missing the rebound.In the th minute Rosario were awarded a penalty. A long ball over the top caught the Killyleagh defence out with John Murray conceding a penalty and then seeing red in the resulting melee.Up stepped Ciaran Gillan, who struck a sweet penalty only to see it saved superbly by Carberry.In the th minute Killyleagh reminded Rosario that they were still in the game as Niall Walsh nodded a corner back into the path of Dylan Kelly who just couldnrsquot make contact with the goal at his mercy.It proved not the Gillanrsquos day. In the th minute he had a great chance, but managed to smash it over and in the last minute his shot hit the crossbar.With  minutes of football unable to separate the two teams it went to extra time and it was going to take a special goal to break the deadlock.

Earlier this year, a planning application was submitted to formally designate the area as a car park for council vehicles and staff cars as well.Concerned residents who live nearby and Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran expressed opposition to the move, describing the unofficial parking area in front of the remains of the townrsquos former workhouse as an ldquoeyesore, highlighting the noise created by heavy refuse vehicles starting up in the morning.Council officials say they have sold part of the existing Strangford Road site to the Education Authority to pave the way for the development of Down Highrsquos new multi-million pound campus.They explained that part of the land which has been sold to provide a new main entrance to the school includes an area which is currently used for council staff parking.The local authority is seeking planning approval to develop remaining land at the front and side of the old workhouse to provide parking for staff and its fleet of vehicles.In papers submitted ahead of todayrsquos planning meeting, it is confirmed that  homeowners who live close to the Strangford Road site were informed about the car park proposal, with some expressing concern about the impact it will have on property values.Concern was also raised about vehicle engines starting as early as .am, particularly at weekends, with those opposed to the planning application insisting that commercial vehicles should not be parked close to residential properties.Outlining their reasons for recommending that the planning application should be approved, planners admit that the car park plan will impact on the remains of the former workhouse which is of special architectural and historic importance.However, they confirm that the Department of Communities Historic Environment Division accept the parking plan in principle, provided the scheme respects the character of the area, suggesting that ldquosoft landscaping between banks of spaces with a low wall constructed to the western boundary.ldquoThe site is well established as the former Down Council offices, with a refuse depot to the rear, the planning papers continue.ldquoThe area has been used for staff parking with this application to formalise the arrangement with staff parking to the front and small vans to be parked at the side. The works proposed will aim to upgrade the existing frontage and use hardstanding to provide a more formalised parking arrangement.Planners say the existing land is to be regraded and resurfaced with low walls and have confirmed that external lighting also forms part of the proposal, with the current entrance set to be widened and new gates installed. Hedge planting is also proposed to help screen some of the activities to the rear of the site.Signicantly, the planning papers spell out clearly that the new parking at the front of the site will be laid out for vans and staff vehicles, not refuse vehicles. Planners also insist the application does not represent a change of use to the site.The papers continue: ldquoThe application proposes to relocate staff parking to the site of the formerly demolished council administrative building and use the other side of the car park for some additional fleet vehicle parking, with designated parking spaces marked and circulation routes displayed through the site.ldquoThe proposal will not impact any more signicantly in terms of residential amenity as to what is already there at present.Planning Committee members will also be told today that as part of the sale of council land at the Strangford Road to the Education Authority that there will be a two-hour daily traffic restriction over the use of the existing main fleet access to the site for local authority vehicles.Council vehicles will not be permitted to use the entrance between .am and .am and between .pm and .pm, with planners explaining this clause was ed into the contract of sale with the Education Authority on the grounds of child safety to ensure students could not be injured by council vehicles.In addition, planners say it is anticipated that most council HGVs and bin lorries will be off site by .am, but that a few may not be, requiring the need for an access through the site to the Strangford Road.

However, the businessman agreed to do the work for free.ldquoNo one in Mount Crescent or Bridge Street wants sectarian graffiti. It does not reflect the good people who live at this part of the town, the spokesperson declared.ldquoWe were left disgusted at what happened given that we are working hard to promote our area and secure new investment, just like many other community groups across Downpatrick.

We cannot emphasis enough that what happened was not done on our name and we condemn those behind this. We will not let people tarnish the work that we are doing or the good name of the Mount Crescent and Bridge Street area.ldquoWe hope the fact that we took steps to contact a specialist cleaner when we were made aware of the graffiti speaks volumes about our views on this matter.

They include:bull Little Rock ndash a musical duo playing folk, rock, country and popbull The Cheatinrsquo Hearts ndash a country band playing songs from the likes of Lindisfarne, Bonnie Raitt, Steve Earle and morebull Karmen Field ndash a psychedelic rock band playing funk, blues, rsquos rock and metal influencesbull Maddy Carver ndash Penarth-based singer songwriter performing original and cover songs from a range of styles and genresbull Knitwear Junkees ndash a groove-driven originals band playing jazz, funk soul and groovebull The Snorklers ndash a popular Music in the Park band playing hits from the Cure, Billy Idol and morebull The Woods ndash another old favourite, playing classics from The Beatles and Rolling Stones, to the latest rock and pop favouritesbull Grooveline ndash who will end the festival with classic songs from Heatwave, Earth Wind and Fire, Kool  The Gang, OrsquoJays, and Sam  Dave.Festival-goers are encouraged to bring their own food and drink.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong. We can do what we want when we work hard.Whatrsquos a girl to do  will be distributed to schools across the area and copies from the initial print run, funded by Tarmac Cement and Lime, can be requested by emailing kara.bennett@tarmac article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The daynurseries poll, which questioned , nursery workers, found that almost halfsay that there are children at their nursery who have imaginary friends.A total of % agreed that fewer children have imaginary friends now than five years ago.And % of those questioned said they think screens are making children less imaginative.David Wright, owner of Paint Pots Nursery group, Southampton, said: ldquoOne or two children in our nursery do have imaginary friends but they mainly come out at home, when children are alone.ldquoLess children have them now than previously.ldquoI think that children are not allowed to be lsquoboredrsquo any more.ldquoWhen children have free time to themselves, they find something creative to do with their mind, such as forming an imaginary friend.He told the PA news agency that there is a ldquogeneral issue with childrenrsquos creativity and development of imagination. --\" --ldquoQuite often these days, children expect to be entertained in some way, so that theyrsquore receiving content either from a tablet or a TV, and I think that diminishes their ability to then use their own imagination to create imaginary friends, to develop language and stories and that kind of thing.Dr Paige Davis, a psychology lecturer at York St John University, said children who make up imaginary friends are typically aged between five and seven, and often do so to help them deal with a situation, or when they are building certain le skills, like talking to others.It is dficult to tell the number of children who have imaginary friends and whether this is changing, she said, as they can be recorded in dferent ways.For example, some may consider only ldquoinvisible characters that a child has made up to be an imaginary friend, while others would count a toy, such as a teddy or doll, that a youngster has created a personality for.Dr Davis said she believes that children are making up invisible friends that are unique as ever, but that the way that children play with imaginary friends could have changed over time.TV and modern technology has changed the way children play in general, she suggested.ldquoBack when you didnrsquot have TV, or kids watched a lot less TV, you would have this spontaneous play that they created, that they were using their minds without any other thing, other than maybe a bolster from a parent or another child, whereas now you have these kids that think lsquooh, we have to play like thisrsquo because thatrsquos the structure of the TV. For example, children may play a game with a storyline they have seen on TV, rather than come up with one themselves.Sue Learner, editor of daynurseries, said: ldquoIt is sad that nursery staff have seen a decline in children having imaginary friends as it seems they are losing the ability to create a magical and fantastical world full of exciting adventures.ldquoParents can tend to fill every hour of a childrsquos day with activities and screens and they are no longer left to get bored.ldquoWhen children are left to their own devices, it forces them to be creative and discover an inner world where they meet fun imaginary friends like Puff the Magic Dragon.ndash The daynurseries poll questioned , nursery owners, managers and staff in April and May..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Screens banishing imaginary friends, say nursery workers article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

has joined forces with Councils in Northern Ireland in a bid to prevent dogs dying in hot cars this summer and to raise awareness on summer safety for our canine friends.Just a few minutes in a hot car can prove fatal for dogs and yet every year animal welfare charities and the police receive thousands of reports of animals being left alone in cars on warm days.That’s why together with Dogs Trust, Councils across Northern Ireland are running ‘Summer Fun for Cool Canines’ events as part of the Dogs Die in Hot Cars campaign, to raise awareness about the dangers of leaving dogs in hot cars and to provide dog owners with practical tips to keep their dog cool and safe this summer.Laura McAnea, Campaigns Manager at Dogs Trust, said: “Many people still believe that it’s OK to leave a dog in a car on a warm daythe windows are left open or they’re parked in the shade, but the truth is, it’s not.“A car can become as hot as an oven very quickly, even when it doesn’t feel that warm and a dog can die in a hot car in  minutes. When it’s  degrees outside, in a car it can reach an unbearable  degrees within the hour.“We are delighted to be working with Local Authorities to raise awareness of the dangers of this and to try and prevent the heartbreak and distress caused when a much-loved family pet suffers, or dies, because they have been left in a car on a summer’s day.”Dogs Trust advise thatyou see a dog in distress in a hot car, call your local Animal Welfare Officer who will liaise with the PSNI to organise the rescue of the dog. This will help ensure the dogs can be removed from the car as quickly as possible, in a safe and legal manner.Signs of heat stroke in dogs include heavy panting, excessive drooling, vomiting, being drowsy and uncoordinated and collapsing. Dogs Trust advise that to help a dog in this condition, place them in the shade, pour small amounts of tepid, not cold, water onto their body, help them to drink small amounts of tepid water and once their breathing has settled, call the nearest vet.You can find out more about caring for dogs in the hot weather on the Dogs Trust website at https:www.dogstrust.org.uk news-events issues-campaigns

Now in its st year, the region’s longest established listing of company performance provides insight on the accomplishments of Northern Ireland based companies, either Northern Ireland registered or where a signicant proportion of their business is transacted in the province. The  edition of the Top  incorporates analysis of figures filed at each companies year end and posted at Companies House and primarily relate to financial periods ending in late ,  and . SUMMARY Sales have grown to £.bn from £.bnwhich is a growth of .%. While extremely encouraging this result needs to be tempered with the fact that profits for the top companies decreased by nearly % to £.m. Shareholder value for the Top  companies increased by .%. Revenue sales Sales revenue is the income received by a company from its sales of goods or the provision of services. The performance of the Top  showing a .% sales growth to £.bn is exceptional in what is a dficult trading environment and period of uncertainty for the provinces businesses. The Brexit question came to the fore on June ,  so all the financial figures shown in the listing have come post the referendum and in essence since the suspension of the Assembly in January . Moy Park continues to hold sway with the highest turnover, currently £.bn, up from £.bn previously – snapping close at their heels is WR Barnett Ltd . Next in the listing are a number of high fliers, LCC Group Ltd and John Graham Holdings Ltd. John Graham Holdings Ltd, which trades as Graham, is another privately owned company based in Hillsborough and specialising in building and civil engineering projects – Graham posted annual sales of £.m in its latest financial accounts up from £.m – an increase of some .% year on year. One of the perennial high performers of the Top  showed a signicant decrease in sales dropping it from a position last year of  to a position this year of . Fane Valley Co-Operative‘s sales decreased from £m to £.m – this is a result of their change in ownership of Linden Foods. Linden Foods is now a joint venture and has entered the list at number  with sales of £.m. Another indicator of strong performance within the listing is that turnover figure required to gain access to the Ulster Business Top  is at its highest ever, with Heron Bros Ltd posting year end sales results for    of £.m. Last year’s number  was Cranswick Country Foodswith sales of £.m. This represents a rise in sales required of .%, to make the Top . Cranswick Country Foodshas risen to  in the listing posting impressive sales growth of %. Profitability Since the Ulster Business Top ’s inception in , we have identied the top companies by measuring turnover, while also accepting that both profitability and tangible shareholder value are also key measures of performance. This year has seen a drop in profit margin for the Top  companies from a margin of .% to .% with total profits now sitting at £.m compared to £.bn for the corresponding companies in their prior year. Northern Ireland Water Ltd has retained its position as the most profitable business within the listing, posting pre tax profits of £.m on a turnover of £.m a margin of .%. Northern Ireland Electricity Networks Ltd is second most profitable with pre tax figures of £m against a turnover of £.m . While the reduction in profitability of the Top  is disappointing this can be tempered by the fact that a number of the companies made signicant losses during the last filed figures recorded for the compilation of the listing. Short Bros PLC after currency adjustments filed losses of £.m, CaterpillarLtd posted losses of £.m, Northern Ireland Transport Holding Companyfiled losses of £.m, EP Kilroot Power losses of £m and Dunnes Stores Bangor Ltd losses of £m. The level of losses across the Top  listing is unprecedented with the  companies that posted losses amounting to £.m. Tangible net worth Tangible net worth is most commonly a calculation of the net worth of a company that excludes any value derived from intangible assets such as s, patents, goodwill and intellectual property. Tangible net worth is a simple calculation of a company’s total tangible assets minus the company’s total liabilities. A business’s tangible net worth provides a snapshot of your financial situation at this point in time. The current tangible net worth of the Ulster Business Top  currently sits at £.bn – as the Top  listing is fluid with companies entering and leaving the list any comparison with previous listing can be distorted, however compared to the  listing tangible net worth has increased by £m. Six of the companies within the Top  have liabilities that outweigh their assets. Increasing the tangible net worth shareholder value is of prime importance for the management of a company. So the management must have the interests of shareholders in mind while making decisions. The higher the shareholder value, the better it is for the company and management. The shareholdersfor the Ulster Business Top  equates to profit tangible net worth and as a percentage sits at % The sales to equity ratio defined as turnover tangible net worth provides an indicator of how much money are generated by the business with each pound invested, for the current Top  this amounts to .. Employees A total of , people are employed by Northern Ireland’s Top  Companies, a decrease from , employed by the companies in the  listing. Moy Park Ltd , Almac Group , Short Brothers PLC , Queen’s University , and Northern Ireland Transport Holding Companymake up the top five employers within the listing. Each employee within the Top  accounted for £, turnover – sales employee and accounted for £, profit – profit employee. Location Since the inception of the Top  we have periodically looked at the geographic location of the companies within Northern Ireland – historically the east of the province has held sway over the west – however, we are beginning to see a sht with currently  businesses based in Belfast, Co Antrim and Co Down, with Co Tyrone being a major recipient of Top  activity. Breaking down the sectors As would be expected when looking at the line of business activity of the Top , both the wholesale retail and manufacturing sectors dominate, accounting for some  of the companies. NOTES A date of the June ,  has been used as the cut-off for the filing of accounts for the inclusion in this year’s Ulster Business Top .
