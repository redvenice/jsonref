If there was, say, a Sickert show in Manchester, in 20 years’ time you could look back and see that show.”With so many art exhibitions being cancelled, the new tool will allow galleries to put on display the shows they wanted the public to see.The tool will be ready by May. “We are really excited,” said Ellis. “We’re sad that it isn’t ready now, but going forward it will be one of the critical ways we can help collections.”People who curate their own shows will be able to choose if they want the whole world to see it or just their friends.If someone wanted to curate a show devoted to the artist with more paintings in British collections than any other, they would alight on the unlikely figure of John Everett.The Dorset-born artist was, in the early 20th century, a prolific painter of boats, decks, harbours and seascapes. Relatively unknown today, an astonishing 1,058 of his works are in public collections, the vast majority owned by the National Maritime Museum but also five in the Laing art gallery collection in Newcastle.The database already has lots of tags and stories to make searching easier. The parrot enthusiast, for example, could find 61 works, from Tiepolo’s A Young Woman with a Macaw in the Ashmolean’s collection in Oxford, to Maggi Hambling’s untitled portrait of a man and his parrot owned by Southampton city art gallery.Ellis said they might also ask artists and celebrities to create online shows. “We could, for example, ask Jarvis Cocker to choose his favourite paintings in Sheffield.”The curation tool is being funded by the Ampersand Foundation and is the latest step for a small charity with big ambitions.Art from 3,300 collection venues by 45,000 artists is on the database. The current big project is adding every sculpture, with around 16,000 already on it, and Ellis hopes to have all 80,000 by the end of the year. Fortunately, most of the photography has already been done.The exercise has allowed Art UK to highlight fascinating stories behind many artworks.For example, this week there was the centenary of the public unveiling of a sculpture of a woman who was a hugely well known in her day, less so now.The sculpture of nurse Edith Cavell stands opposite the National Portrait Gallery in London, made by the leading British sculptor Sir George Frampton, and bears her famous words: “Patriotism is not enough. I must have no hatred or bitterness for anyone.”Cavell was a nurse during the first world war who cared for countless soldiers regardless of their nationality. While helping allied soldiers flee occupied Belgium she was captured by the Germans. Despite an international outcry for her release, Cavell was shot at dawn by a firing squad.It provoked outrage in Britain, with the Manchester  headlining the story: “Merciless Execution of Nurse Cavell.” Her story was used in British propaganda to galvanise public opinion, with the recruitment of soldiers rising from 5,000 a week to 10,000 after her death.It also inspired numerous artworks, with paintings in the Wellcome Collection and the Imperial War Museum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c72f12ff90f42d94cf88a5968f9e9c1067a34454/0_591_1643_986/master/1643.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0217563d9bf7ee1307089a7488f919cb","title":"build bulldoze rebuild chinas dizzying changes in pictures teresa eng","story":"From bridges to flowers, from cities to gorges, Teresa Eng spent four years exploring her ancestral roots in China, capturing a country modernising at breakneck speed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/889454e3f88cc3c24fccc318396ef7ae2eccb94a/0_132_2021_1213/master/2021.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e83bc9e784a3da5c501101aa7a3bace5","title":"food retailers urge government to relax regulations coronavirus","story":"Competition regulations put on hold so shops can share depots, vans and stock data The government is relaxing competition regulations to allow retailers to work together more closely to help feed the UK during the coronavirus outbreak.Supermarkets will be allowed to cooperate to keep shops open, to share distribution depots and delivery vans and to share data with each other on stock levels under the temporary waiver approved on Thursday evening. The move will also allow retailers to share staff to help meet demand.The government is also temporarily lifting the plastic bag tax for online deliveries, to help retailers deliver groceries to those self-isolating at home without cross-contamination from delivery crates.Environment secretary George Eustice, who approved the change in the rules after more than a week of discussions with retailers, said: “We’ve listened to the powerful arguments of our leading supermarkets and will do whatever it takes to help them feed the nation.“By relaxing elements of competition laws temporarily, our retailers can work together on their contingency plans and share the resources they need with each other during these unprecedented circumstances.The latest relaxation in rules came after Defra said it would work with local authorities to extend the hours that deliveries can be made to food stores to help keep supplies on the shelves. In many built-up areas, heavy vehicles cannot normally operate during antisocial hours such as late at night or early in the morning.This week, the Department for Transport has also agreed to ease restrictions on delivery drivers’ working hours during the crisis. Drivers can now work for 11 hours in one stint, up from nine, and can work up to 96 hours in a fortnight, up from 90. Daily rest limits have also been reduced from 11 hours to nine. The new rules will come into effect on Friday.The big grocers, however, are calling for the suspension of some competition rules so supermarkets can work together on securing the supply and distribution of essentials.Eustice has the power to temporarily exclude the Competition Act prohibition on “agreements between businesses that prevent, restrict or distort competition” for a limited period.

From automated systems that monitor cashflow, to software that sends out emails, there’s a plethora of online tools available to help small firms growSelf-driving cars, surgery carried out by robots, facial recognition software – the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and its implications for the world of work have rarely been out of the headlines in recent years. “Everything we assume about work, jobs, training and education – and being human – is being challenged by exponential scientific and technological progress,” futurist author Gerd Leonhard says. “Humanity will change more in the next 20 years than in the previous 300.”Considering the magnitude and scale of this fourth industrial revolution, it’s understandable that many small business owners feel left behind. Few will have the teams of data scientists, money and know-how to create their own bespoke solutions, unless they’re operating in the AI sector themselves. Yet many will be using platforms and tools that already incorporate AI – anyone doing a Google search, for example, is experiencing it in action. “You can be sure there isn’t a human sitting in a cubicle, sifting by hand through the entire internet to decide which search result to serve you,” says Cassie Kozyrkov, chief decision scientist at Google.This technology is most often used by businesses in three different ways: automating processes (such as timed newsletter sends, or bank account reconciliation), data analysis to gain insights (and then performing tasks such as recommending products to customers), and engaging with the public (via customer service chatbots, for example). Much of this has been made possible by cloud computing (a way of storing data remotely), which has given smart platforms powered by the cloud millions of anonymised users’ data to learn from and adapt accordingly. It’s rapidly accelerated the development of tools that are simple for small business owners to use but highly effective in terms of eliminating repetitive tasks, streamlining operations, and enabling sustainable growth.‘It’s important to have a clear mind’“What beekeepers really like is the 88-million-year-old technology that bees use to do all sorts of smart things, like organise their hives, and produce wax and royal jelly from their bodies,” Dale Gibson, co-founder of Bermondsey Street Bees, says about introducing the art of beekeeping to technology. “The last real technological discovery in beekeeping was in America in 1852.”While respecting that heritage, Gibson has been able to incorporate technological development into his business in a number of ways, since installing his first hives on his London roof in 2007. “I do start off with a proper, gummed up, sticky with honey notebook, where the data is gathered in the field,” he says. “But when I come home, I enter that information into a system on the cloud where my associate beekeeper can look it up.” He’s also working on a pilot programme with the World Bee Project to test remote monitors that track the health of hives, such as their weight. That data is then fed back into a central system, shared by 32,000 beekeepers across more than 150 countries. The project hopes this information will help to create more sustainable ecosystems and improve global food security.Gibson is also exploring the potential of tracking his honey via a blockchain system, first trialled by the technology company Oracle at the 2019 OpenWorld show in Dubai. “Anything that can help us distinguish between real, raw local honey and the manufactured commodity that’s come from halfway around the world and been blended, heated and mashed up, then that’s a good thing,” says Gibson, adding that honey is the third most tampered with product in the world, after milk and olive oil.While technology can sometimes be daunting for SME owners to incorporate, he says it’s given him more time to focus on the bees. “We’re massively assisted by having Xero on our phones too so we can use it for inventory record keeping, invoicing and statements at any time and anywhere,” he says. He finds the automatic reminders to customers that an invoice is due (or late) particularly helpful, as is the functionality that automatically reconciles his bank statements. “Even though you’re running a small business and lots of things can happen, it’s really important to have a clear mind.”‘We’re trying very hard to make online successful’Since starting in 2011, Papersmiths has grown from a two-employee interior design studio in Bridport, to launching an additional chain of five stationary shops. The company now employs 25 staff and has a presence in some of the UK’s most desirable retail locations (including Bristol, Brighton, and Chelsea in London).Smart technology has played a clear role in the business’s growth, co-founder Sidonie Warren says. The majority of their data is tracked using point-of-sale software Vend, which integrates with Xero. “That’s excellent because it allows us to track what we’re selling, right down to a specific product or colour,” says Warren. “When we open a new store we use that data to figure out what it is we need to buy, and also planning the fit out of the store.” Shop managers also use it to identify that week’s top five products, and arrange displays accordingly.Building the e-commerce arm of the business has been a key focus for Warren recently. “Our challenge is translating that thing of testing a pen or feeling the paper of a notebook into the digital realm,” she says. Automating email sends via Mailchimp has enabled her to engage new customers via discount codes, and she can target people known to be top spenders at certain times of the year using sales data from Shopify.She uses Xero weekly to plan cashflow, as well as process payroll and track all of her staff expenses. She still uses the personal touch – if a customer is late paying an invoice for example, she’d rather call than send an automatic reminder – but is open to integrating new technology in the future, including an online customer service chatbot, and some sort of retail mapping system. “With online you can see how many times a product gets viewed but it’s very hard to do that in store,” she adds.‘We’ve grown substantially and it’s all down to being in control of our finances’Richard Fishenden worked as a farrier fitting horseshoes before he started Made by the Forge in 2006. “My wife went into a local shop that sold curtain poles and I was horrified at the prices. I said bollocks to that, I’m going to make them myself,” he says. The range has since extended beyond bespoke curtain poles, to other wrought iron homeware items.Fishenden says he used to be “archaic with technology”, but has managed to automate processes in various areas. “Xero seems to be the central part of the spider’s web that everything else feeds from,” he says. That includes an order system, where delivery notes and worksheets are generated so staff know what products to make a customer relationship management system for customer data that Fishenden uses to send quotes via Xero, and then follow up on leads that were once buried in paperwork and Receipt Bank for invoices and receipts that he says has saved hours of data inputting.Sign up to Xero here with a free trial"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91a0df3445c401f4e5e18e03f7988407f6998588/0_168_5040_3024/master/5040.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc5e70dd78088d6b5c99add45af82da6","title":"coronavirus head medical school doctors frontline","story":"It will be tough, but this is what medical staff are trained to do. Now is our time to step up There has been a lot of public debate over the last few weeks over the role scientists are playing during the coronavirus crisis. In the space of just a few weeks, the likes of Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, and Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, have become household names.As Covid-19 spreads around the world, scientists are taking a prominent role in advancing public knowledge about the virus by advising world leaders, providing expert comment in the media and urgently researching new ways of tackling the pandemic. We are lucky here in the UK: the scientists we have at the moment are as good as it gets. Whitty is a professor of epidemiology – this is what he does.But as this crisis deepens the role of researchers will become even more fundamental as many are now being called upon to join the NHS frontline. Thankfully, we understand within the community that research can go on hold. What’s more, much of it has to because of social distancing.We have taken the decision to release all our clinical staff from academic and research responsibilities at UCL, where I am head of the medical school, as part of a national effort to staff hospitals. These are medically trained staff, who work across the faculties of population health, medical, life, brain and engineering sciences. I expect we will see the same measures enacted soon nationwide. The medical community needs to do everything possible in response to this epidemic.In nearly 35 years as a doctor, the coronavirus pandemic is like nothing I have witnessed – a global crisis, which will likely overload the health service in every country – if it hasn’t already done so. By this, I mean, health services will be overwhelmed by the demand put on them by the number of patients requiring treatment. I fear we have to see doctors and nurses working double, or even triple shifts. Many, themselves, will of course get sick, and will have to self-isolate, further compounding the problem.My work at UCL requires me to look after the largest group of biomedical scientists in Europe. Two weeks ago, I started a regular, albeit occasional, clinical service as a consultant respiratory physician at London’s University College hospital alongside this. I always enjoy leaving the desk work behind and returning to my roots as a clinician. As things progress, I am in no doubt that I will spend more and more time on the frontline.My first week working in the wards was unremarkable. But by week two – last week – everything had changed. The ward became eerily quiet. Very few patients were referred to the respiratory team as we prepared for the expected influx of patients infected with the Covid-19 virus. Patients were moved to different wards or different hospitals, personal protective equipment arrived and the infectious diseases team grew overnight.Then, the patients with Covid-19 started to arrive. As expected some were well, some poorly and new unexpected challenges emerged. Can a patient who is a contact of a patient with Covid-19 have an MRI scan? How can we get a patient home if their carer(s) are unwilling to look after them?We live in unprecedented times, at least for my generation of 50-something doctors. We are three-four weeks behind Italy and the full force of the pandemic is about to break in the UK – which it is thought will not peak until mid-June. The horrific images that we see from Italy are likely to play out here. Of course I might get ill myself, but this is a challenge faced by everybody. Ideally, I hope I will be fine, but if I get it, I get it. I will self-isolate and hope I am fine.The demand for beds and intensive care facilities, the difficult decisions with limited resources and the pressure on staff, will all build over the coming weeks and months. I have heard that many colleagues have offered to volunteer and have received numerous positive messages from our hospital colleagues. The government has said it will provide training for anyone who feels it is necessary.Our senior students will also be given the opportunity to help and dozens of other highly skilled scientists working in our labs with relevant transferable skills will also be freed up. But UCL is not mandating this, it will be down to inidual choice.Whatever may happen over the coming weeks and months, I have never been so pleased that we have a “joined-up” public health structure, a “top down” NHS, dedicated and loyal staff from across the clinical field and the brightest and best-informed people advising the government on the way forward. Everyone is now stepping up in this new healthcare environment: health professionals doing what they do best. We are professionals, this is what we do. This is our moment. We have to step up and deliver.• Prof David Lomas is vice provost (health), UCL and head of UCL medical school"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34d746fefe62c28d9879bc7f9af74096cdf8f660/591_0_7583_4554/master/7583.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5722e40954b36410e96afa97d4f87f2e","title":"festival of britain fund save our culture now","story":"As one venue after another goes dark, the creative sector and its low-paid employees are in desperate need of supportSaving lives comes first, then saving livelihoods, and after that, saving everything that makes life worth living.

A million people work in arts and entertainment. Most of all these are low-paid and being shed in vast numbers by businesses desperate to survive.What will they live on? £73.10 a week jobseeker’s allowance? £94.25 sick pay if they catch the virus? When it comes to saving livelihoods, take no reassuring cant from Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak unless they announce at once that universal credit becomes universal immediately, paid from day one, not five weeks too late, and without its savageries such as the two-child limit.After easing personal hardship, what of the long-term survival of all the creative teams being disbanded right now? The 830 organisations part-funded by Arts Council England rely mainly on £80m a month from ticket, bar and cafe sales: with outgoings and no income, how are they to survive? The puny £336m government subsidy to the council, cut brutally during the last decade, was always a fraction of what similar countries give to their arts. But beyond those subsidies is an entire ecology of smaller organisations that incubate creativity. They feed an industry that is a better long-term bet than the car industry, let alone airlines, from a booming film studio industry to video gaming and design.The Association of Leading Visitor Attractions, Alva, has with the Museums Association one instant solution. You may have put it out of your mind, but Theresa May announced a Festival of Britain for 2022 to parade the best of Britain and its culture defiantly after Brexit. Bernard Donoghue, Alva’s director, calls for that £120m to be used right now to rescue arts, heritage and entertainment. That’s not nearly enough to stop vital organisations going under, but it’s an easy fund to raid right now. “Otherwise there may be no culture to display,” he says.Yesterday the Brighton festival, second only in size to Edinburgh, of which I was chair for many years until December, cancelled its 120 events in May. I know the fragile tightrope of financing, the precarious balance between Arts Council England and local council funds, donations and ticket sales. £1m in ticket sales will be lost, alongside all the free events for the city.Nothing replaces live events and music, visits, but the BBC has come to the rescue, drawing up plans to broadcast myriad missing things. Its Culture in quarantine, announced yesterday, plans to stream from behind closed doors the missing performances and broadcast virtual tours of museums and galleries. .Over-optimistically, Jonty Claypole, director of BBC Arts, says: “Historically, artists thrive on periods of isolation, and it seems certain that the current period will result in new plays, poems, books, films, paintings, sculptures and all other forms of art.” But starving cultural organisations mean there will be lfew places to showcase creative output in future. Keep them going through now, and maybe there could be a great Restoration after this Cromwellian closure of all public pleasure."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a6e16025c0678a6e7281de1d8e38f8c0109e5f6/0_524_4986_2993/master/4986.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92be588550109380a730cb457cfa4053","title":"after coronavirus well be poorer and more broken but we might be more tender too","story":"It’s been a surreal week, but under all the stress and fear something good is rising to the topFor those of us that have only known history to unfold in a mostly orderly manner, this week has scrambled the synapses and caused deep shock.All week I’ve been feeling like a computer with too many tabs open in the browser. The information and news coming at us is almost too much to bear, our systems stalling then crashing as we try to take it all in.Just one of these events would be of global significance for weeks – but on the morning news, the presenter reels them off, speaking slightly faster than usual, because there’s so much to get through.Then there’s the change to our physical way of being in the world. This is the week our cities died. Offices around the country emptying out. Many people have started a form of isolation, an experience that will be entirely novel and unfamiliar to them. Shops, cafes, gyms, yoga studios and pubs have closed or are being forced to close. Some may never reopen. Only the casino seems to be immune to the carnage.Empty streets mean fear. People, with the same stultified look on their faces, step over empty pallets in denuded supermarkets. There’s a strange tension in the air. Nobody knows what’s going on. On Monday my local IGA looked like it had been ransacked and the supermarket workers were friendly but tired.“You would not believe some of the things I’ve seen this week,” one cashier told me on the Wednesday of the world’s longest week.At night it’s hard to sleep. Across time zones, from the southern night to the northern day, I follow the progress of the virus as it makes its way around the world, mass graves in Iran, cruise ships turned back from all ports, Glastonbury festival cancelled, schools to be closed indefinitely across the UK, people on trains wearing gas masks, the vitality of New York drained in days as people shelter in their apartments.But something else happened this week.In the shock, confusion and sheer disbelief of world events, we all want to talk to each other. We babble incessantly to each other on the phone, Whatsapp, Facebook, Facetime, Instagram DMs and text messages.“Are you OK?” we want to know. That is the main thing.Twitter has transformed in a week from a grim cesspit of death threats and egos to a place of funny jokes and good science widely shared. Social isolation has never felt so social.For all the years we have spent demonising the internet and social media, it will be our lifebuoy in these times of social isolation. There’s a new sweetness and kindness to life online. Under stress something good is rising to the top.On Twitter I’ve seen doctors from all over the world provide real time advice to physicians in rural America trying to incubate Covid-19 patients. I’ve read more science than I did in six years of science classes, and I’ve seen concerts streamed on Instagram by Chris Martin and John Legend.These performers are human and warm in a way they could never really be on stage, in an auditorium. Now as they sit at their pianos in their comfortable clothes, you can see the pores on their faces. People’s messages of fear, joy and gratitude scroll down the screen as they play.The messages pour in from all over the world. We’re all watching this together, as we isolate at home.This is a global story like no other. Every single person in the world is affected. If we didn’t know it then, we know it now - we are all in this together.Our shared vulnerability is bringing out our tenderness - if we relax and let it. Three people I had rifts with got in touch this week. “Let’s not fight,” one said. Sometimes we didn’t even say that – we just asked if each other was OK and all the petty animus fell away. Festering hurt just vanished.Why couldn’t it have been like this before? Why did it take this to put down our weapons?A friend came by my house with groceries. We stood a metre apart and looked at the sky. The air was sweet and mild. There was a flock of birds overhead, making their screams. “The world’s still a beautiful place,” he said.Yesterday, in town to buy a tennis racquet from a sports store that has margins so tight, they wouldn’t even survive a fortnight of closure, the owner didn’t seem afraid. She wanted to tell me about her bush walk this morning, before dawn. She was exultant, her face bright and full of joy. She saw the sunrise and said: “It was soft this morning, the sky was grey and pink – and then suddenly the gold came out around the clouds.”There’s been so many other conversations like this with strangers this week – interactions that have had a peculiar and magical quality. The quality is gentleness, full of care and charged with an authenticity that’s done something good to my heart.This will change us. There’ll be a before and after – and things will be different on the other side. We’ll be more broken. We’ll be poorer. We may lose kin. But I suspect we might be kinder and more tender too.Just like a serious medical diagnosis can cause all that is false or unimportant in your life to fall away, this too is having a similar effect. What’s important to people? What’s important to you? We’re going to find out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ec845c4b44195a4179ebb7d56c8d87ba4889d4e/0_485_5760_3457/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b30a9b68ed8dd319e404245ed241b224","title":"coronavirus anxiety nature","story":"Reconnecting with the natural world – however we can – is a wonderful medicine against anxiety and fearThe National Trust has announced that it is opening as many of its parklands and gardens as possible for free during the coronavirus outbreak. The South Downs National Park, Forestry England and others have reminded people that our forests and grasslands, woodlands and commons are open for business. With constrained options for leisure and restoration and heightened stress and anxiety levels, this is good news.If you were in any doubt that it was OK to go outside, while keeping at least two metres away from others, the chief medical officer Chris Whitty told the BBC on Wednesday: “Being outside in the park is a very good thing to do.”He would know. In the past decade, the scientific evidence that connection with nature has important therapeutic benefits for human mental health has mushroomed. Robust studies from disciplines across the world are demystifying what many intuitively know – that we often feel restored when we spend time in nature.For a number of years I’ve been researching this mechanism for my book, Losing Eden. I was astounded by the variety and range of the evidence. Time spent in nature is linked to lower stress, restored attention, a balanced nervous system, increased levels of cancer-fighting “natural killer cells”, the activation of neural pathways associated with calm, and decreased levels of anxiety and depression. Phytoncides (compounds emitted from trees and plants), relaxation, stress reduction and awe are known to enhance immune function.And there is an abundance of awe outside right now. The leaves are starting to erupt vivid lemon green. We are at the moment just before the natural world really lets rip.Birds are busy making their nests. The baby-skin softness of an unfurling chestnut bud breaks through Bumblebees potter sleepily. The blues and pinks of lungwort are as psychedelic as a Los Angeles sunset.In this new world of uncertainty, nature can be transportive. Get down on to the earth and you can find a new reality. Spring is legal, free LSD.It’s also a symbol of renewal and regeneration that we need at the moment. In February Afternoon, by the poet Edward Thomas, birds symbolise constancy, a reassuring sign that the globe is still working: “When one, like me, dreamed how  A thousand years might dust lie on his brow  Yet thus would birds do between hedge and shaw.” Nature is a common element in war poetry.Can spending time in nature help people deal with death and dying today? Over the past few years as I’ve talked to people about their psychological relationship with the Earth, I have been moved by the stories of people who have encountered desperate loss and grief and found a solace in the rest of nature.For those faced with the spectre of the death and suffering of loved ones (and, let’s be honest, that is the fear we are living with), the natural world, with its seasons and changes and weather, reminds us of the facts: death and disease are part of life on Earth, but life goes on. On a run around my local cemetery before dusk yesterday, the sky was glowing and the trees were still winter-stark. The birds were piping up, indifferent to the quieter streets and the panic. Rabbits hopped around the daffodils. Obscene, almost, the sublime-meets-Basingstoke, but also grounding.For the religious who are unable to meet for fellowship, or indeed for those who normally find spiritual solace in pubs, recovery meetings or therapy rooms, the natural world could provide a connection with the numinous that it has done for humans over centuries.What about the most vulnerable in our society, the disabled and chronically ill? National Parks have been doing important work improving access to open spaces for people with limited mobility. The South Downs, for instance, is creating new routes in an aim to become the most accessible park in Britain.And for those who can’t get outdoors at all? Studies have shown that just looking at a picture of the natural world can give stress reduction and wellbeing benefits. But those who looked through glass window at real nature saw a quicker decrease in heart rate than those who looked at a technological nature window. Pot plants, too, are no small thing. GPs in Manchester have even started to prescribe them. Much of nature is fractal – a self-repeating pattern of a shape that varies in scale, rather than repeats exactly. The leaves on a pancake plant (Pilea peperomioides), for instance, which start small and grow in size but repeat the same shape. Richard Taylor, professor of physics at the University of Oregon, found that these fractals provoked brain waves suggesting a relaxed state which could reduce stress levels.Thankfully, the dawn chorus has started across the country. At 4.30 this morning, on the busy urban street where I live, there was a magical wall of sound. Crack open a window if you’re sleepless in the early morning, or first thing.In the interwar years and second world war, bird song was early public sonic therapy. In 1924, the BBC recorded the cellist Beatrice Harrison playing in her garden accompanied by a nightingale. It became a cult hit, and the recording was repeated every spring until 1942. It represented something that we all “unconsciously crave and urgently need” as the BBC’s first director general, Lord Reith, wrote.Of course, the natural world isn’t there to make us feel better. It doesn’t exist for mankind. (Nor is it going to be the panacea for our loneliness, stress and worry.) Are there ways, then, that the relationship can be reciprocal, instead of a one-way street? Perhaps by making our gardens nature-led and more habitable for other species. Supporting initiatives that improve access to nature and bioersity. Ceremonies, rituals, gratitude. Could reconnecting with nature help us see our environment and origins with new eyes? Could we start to see the trees in our stockpiled loo roll?In Boccaccio’s Decameron, the 14th-century novellas about Florence during the Black Death, some people lived temperately, hoping it would protect their health, secluding themselves from society. Others got plastered round the clock: “seeing death imminent they became reckless with their lives”.But there was a third group who kept a middle course. They carried flowers or fragrant herbs, which they “frequently raised to their noses, deeming it an excellent thing thus to comfort the brain with such perfumes”. More than 600 years later, we would be wise to take a leaf out of their book, and seek joy in spring.• Lucy Jones is a journalist and the author of Foxes Unearthed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae281168a165b059ea59c24d15a355fdd232958e/0_0_4763_2862/master/4763.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc491287e8319bbf7df96cde4c131aa5","title":"volunteers mobilise to ensure children get fed during school closures","story":"Fears 1.3m children entitled to free school meals will go hungry during coronavirus crisisAn army of parents, teachers and volunteers will mobilise next week to try to ensure that children who rely on free school meals do not go hungry while schools are closed as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.The government has said that low-income families whose children are ordinarily eligible for the meals will be offered vouchers, food or meals, even if they are no longer attending school because of coronavirus closures coming into force from Friday.Around 1.3 million children in England who come from the most disadvantaged families currently benefit from a free school lunch. Feeding Britain, an independent charity working to combat hunger and food poverty in the UK, is working with local authorities, schools, caterers and voluntary organisations on contingency planning. In some areas, a core group of schools will aim to offer hot meals for parents to collect and take home, while others will offer a cold food service.Where schools cannot offer a collection service, food will be transported to a community centre as an alternative collection point. For the most vulnerable families who might not be able to collect their own food, Feeding Britain is trying to initiate a home delivery service.Proposals are also being developed to include the following day’s breakfast ingredients in food parcels as additional support for struggling families.Andrew Forsey, national director of Feeding Britain, said he was “very concerned” about the potential impact of school closures on the most vulnerable children, and called on schools to continue to play a prominent role in ensuring children get fed during the crisis.“Where much of the public concern has been directed towards what will happen to free school lunches, we know that large numbers of children also rely on a school breakfast. When schools do have to close that’s two separate meals a day which they will lose.”Elsewhere, parents are volunteering to help feed children in need. Agnes Eisenberg, a dentist and mother-of-two whose children go to school in Finchley, north-west London, has offered to help support six families, cooking and delivering two meals a day, twice a week, to children who would ordinarily get free school meals.“These people need it the most,” she said. “It’s important to give back to society. I can afford it. I’m happy that I can do it.” Elsewhere parents are contributing to food banks in schools and distributing food parcels to those in need.Vic Goddard, principal of Passmores Academy in Harlow, Essex, has already drawn up plans to provide weekly £25 Tesco vouchers for families whose children rely on free school meals and there will be daily contact with vulnerable children and their families during the course of the closure.On Thursday, the government confirmed that the total value of vouchers offered to each eligible child per week would exceed the rate it normally pays to schools for free school meals, recognising that families would not be buying food in bulk and equivalent meals could therefore cost more.The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, said: “No child who would ordinarily receive a free school meal should go without this while their school is closed or while they are having to self-isolate at home.“By giving headteachers flexibility on how they can get meals or shop vouchers to these children, they can make the most appropriate decisions for families in their communities, and provide immediate reassurance that this important support will continue.”The Local Government Association, which represents more than 350 English and Welsh councils, said plans were already under way to support children who would ordinarily receive free school meals. “Council staff are doing an amazing job in hugely difficult and fast-moving circumstances to help cope with coronavirus and will continue to do all they can to support residents, including vulnerable children and their families,” a spokesperson said.Experts in food poverty expressed concern that the government offer was restricted to children on free school meals and there were no plans to support schools who provide the universal infant free school meal available to children up to the age of seven.Greta Defeyter, a professor in developmental psychology and director of the healthy living lab at Northumbria University, said this should continue, “especially during a time when many families are facing increased hardship and uncertainty”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b703da36be210a25c2771621c0af345097e45994/0_0_2953_1772/master/2953.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2018bda5aacc35fba82f16c8a460fe13","title":"chinese students racism coronavirus","story":"The international students I instruct in Los Angeles are in a country that’s increasingly hostile toward them. We should be spreading kindness insteadLong before most of the US population, it seems the coronavirus was in my proverbial backyard.An urgent knock came on my office door in mid-February. I opened the door to find one of my students with tears pouring down her face. Just moments before, she had been told that her parents, who lived in China, had succumbed to Covid-19. She would not be able to return for their funerals. She’s an only child.As I would soon learn, this was only the beginning of how this virus has impacted my students, most of whom are from east Asia. They now feel stuck in an environment where they often feel unwanted, with nowhere to go anytime soon.When our own president injects such blatant racism into the Covid-19 conversation by calling it the “Chinese virus” – it’s no surprise that my students are having to deal with xenophobia.I instruct and develop classes for international students at the Claremont Colleges in Los Angeles. Over eight weeks, we help them improve their American English skills and teach them how to manage pressure and survive graduate school in the US Most of the students are only here for this program while their families stay behind in China.Many of them are isolated here – they’re in the US alone and they won’t be able to return to their home countries anytime soon, they are worried about loved ones back home, and on top of all of that, they are experiencing renewed racism.It started before the school closed, with my students sharing stories in class about how some people on campus were giving them dirty looks, whispering, sitting as far away as possible from them. I wanted to believe these incidents were the result of college student immaturity, despite the reports that had come out about similar racist behavior. Clearly, I was in denial. Then suddenly, it was in my face.After our final face-to-face class before, 20 or so of my students and I decided to have one last hurrah at a local pizza parlor since we wouldn’t be seeing each other again for a while. At the time, restaurants were still open and we were still allowed to gather in groups of 100 or less. I had taken students to this restaurant many times before without incident for end-of-the-term celebrations – parties for completing milestones in our program, and simply for them to get a sense of US dining culture.This time was different. The host asked us to wait, though only a couple tables were occupied. Then the manager – who is also the owner – came out, gave our group the once-over, and said that I (a Caucasian woman) could stay, but the others had to leave. I could not understand why, and asked over and over what the problem was I thought maybe the restaurant’s safety or sanitation had been compromised in some way. My students understood the true reason why before I did. It was one of those moments where my white privilege was obvious to everyone but me.I began to argue with the manager, so angry I could hardly get the words out, until one of my students gently pulled me back and said it wasn’t worth it.Rather than making a scene, my students suggested we try another restaurant. Again, we were denied service even though there were only a few people in the place. This happened four times before we finally found a Chinese restaurant that would seat us. This place was actually quite full, with other east Asian diners. I couldn’t help but wonder if the same injustice had happened to them at other restaurants in town, but regardless, I was glad these diners had a safe place to go.The owner, who’s from Shanghai, stopped by the table to thank us for coming in. We thanked him in return and told him what had happened at the other restaurants.He shared that business started tanking back in January when people learned where Covid-19 originated. He was even being denied service at local grocery stores, gas stations, car washes, cafes and farmers’ markets because workers either assumed he was a carrier or blamed him for the pandemic because of what he looks like.To this day, I’m still hearing stories from my students – we have been Skyping regularly – about how people walk in the other direction when they see them. Sometimes strangers get aggressive and say things to them like: “This is your people’s fault.” They’re afraid to walk into places like Walmart or Target because of this. I fear for their safety beyond the coronavirus itself.One student, whose husband and kids are here in the US with her, just told me a story about going to a PTA meeting at her son’s elementary school. She and her husband sat in the back corner of the room so as not to upset or alarm other parents – it has happened so often, they have come to expect it. She told me other parents approached the person running the meeting and asked for “that Chinese couple in the back” to be asked to leave. Thankfully the request was not granted, but my student was still deeply upset by it, understandably.We are all having to go into isolation because of Covid-19, through no fault of our own. But many of us have family, friends, co-workers and other members of our community to lean on as we approach the unknown. Now, simple human interactions like visiting the grocery store or even driving down the street and seeing another human face are a treat.My international students are even more isolated and vulnerable than the rest of us. They are in a country that’s becoming increasingly hostile toward them. Everyone in every part of the world is fearful of this infection and how far it will spread, of how many people it will affect. The one thing we have control over right now is how we behave and how we treat other people. Basic compassion, empathy and kindness for our fellow human beings – right now, this is what we can and should be spreading."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/587cd58783794ce520fc729ff7e604c83f3562a4/63_52_1613_968/master/1613.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7872702e318abdab904e6489780df11","title":"tip of the iceberg is our destruction of nature responsible for covid 19 aoe","story":"As habitat and bioersity loss increase globally, the coronavirus outbreak may be just the beginning of mass pandemicsMayibout 2 is not a healthy place. The 150 or so people who live in the village, which sits on the south bank of the Ivindo River, deep in the great Minkebe Forest in northern Gabon, are used to occasional bouts of diseases such as malaria, dengue, yellow fever and sleeping sickness. Mostly they shrug them off.But in January 1996, Ebola, a deadly virus then barely known to humans, unexpectedly spilled out of the forest in a wave of small epidemics. The disease killed 21 of 37 villagers who were reported to have been infected, including a number who had carried, skinned, chopped or eaten a chimpanzee from the nearby forest.I travelled to Mayibout 2 in 2004 to investigate why deadly diseases new to humans were emerging from bioersity “hotspots” such as tropical rainforests and bushmeat markets in African and Asian cities.Villagers told me how children had gone into the forest with dogs that had killed the chimp. They said that everyone who cooked or ate it got a terrible fever within a few hours. Some died immediately, while others were taken down the river to hospital. A few, like Nesto Bematsick, recovered. “We used to love the forest, now we fear it,” he told me. Many of Bematsick’s family members died.Only a decade or two ago it was widely thought that tropical forests and intact natural environments teeming with exotic wildlife threatened humans by harbouring the viruses and pathogens that lead to new diseases in humans such as Ebola, HIV and dengue.But a number of researchers today think that it is actually humanity’s destruction of bioersity that creates the conditions for new viruses and diseases such as Covid-19, the viral disease that emerged in China in December 2019, to arise – with profound health and economic impacts in rich and poor countries alike. In fact, a new discipline, planetary health, is emerging that focuses on the increasingly visible connections between the wellbeing of humans, other living things and entire ecosystems.Is it possible, then, that it was human activity, such as road building, mining, hunting and logging, that triggered the Ebola epidemics in Mayibout 2 and elsewhere in the 1990s and that is unleashing new terrors today?“We invade tropical forests and other wild landscapes, which harbour so many species of animals and plants – and within those creatures, so many unknown viruses,” David Quammen, author of Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Pandemic, recently wrote in the New York Times. “We cut the trees we kill the animals or cage them and send them to markets. We disrupt ecosystems, and we shake viruses loose from their natural hosts. When that happens, they need a new host. Often, we are it.”Research suggests that outbreaks of animal-borne and other infectious diseases such as Ebola, Sars, bird flu and now Covid-19, caused by a novel coronavirus, are on the rise. Pathogens are crossing from animals to humans, and many are able to spread quickly to new places. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that three-quarters of new or emerging diseases that infect humans originate in animals.Some, like rabies and plague, crossed from animals centuries ago. Others, such as Marburg, which is thought to be transmitted by bats, are still rare. A few, like Covid-19, which emerged last year in Wuhan, China, and Mers, which is linked to camels in the Middle East, are new to humans and spreading globally.Other diseases that have crossed into humans include Lassa fever, which was first identified in 1969 in Nigeria Nipah from Malaysia and Sars from China, which killed more than 700 people and travelled to 30 countries in 2002–03. Some, like Zika and West Nile virus, which emerged in Africa, have mutated and become established on other continents.Kate Jones, chair of ecology and bioersity at UCL, calls emerging animal-borne infectious diseases an “increasing and very significant threat to global health, security and economies”.Increasingly, says Jones, these zoonotic diseases are linked to environmental change and human behaviour. The disruption of pristine forests driven by logging, mining, road building through remote places, rapid urbanisation and population growth is bringing people into closer contact with animal species they may never have been near before, she says.The resulting transmission of disease from wildlife to humans, she says, is now “a hidden cost of human economic development. There are just so many more of us, in every environment. We are going into largely undisturbed places and being exposed more and more. We are creating habitats where viruses are transmitted more easily, and then we are surprised that we have new ones.”Jones studies how changes in land use contribute to the risk. “We are researching how species in degraded habitats are likely to carry more viruses which can infect humans,” she says. “Simpler systems get an amplification effect. Destroy landscapes, and the species you are left with are the ones humans get the diseases from.”The difference between now and a few decades ago, Fevre says, is that diseases are likely to spring up in both urban and natural environments. “We have created densely packed populations where alongside us are bats and rodents and birds, pets and other living things. That creates intense interaction and opportunities for things to move from species to species,” he says.“Pathogens do not respect species boundaries,” says disease ecologist Thomas Gillespie, an associate professor in Emory University’s  department of  environmental  sciences, who studies how shrinking natural habitats and changing behaviour add to the risk of diseases spilling over from animals to humans.“I am not at all surprised about the coronavirus outbreak,” he says. “The majority of pathogens are still to be discovered. We are at the very tip of the iceberg.”Humans, says Gillespie, are creating the conditions for the spread of diseases by reducing the natural barriers between host animals – in which the virus is naturally circulating – and themselves. “We fully expect the arrival of pandemic influenza we can expect large-scale human mortalities we can expect other pathogens with other impacts. A disease like Ebola is not easily spread. But something with a mortality rate of Ebola spread by something like measles would be catastrophic,” Gillespie says.Wildlife everywhere is being put under more stress, he says. “Major landscape changes are causing animals to lose habitats, which means species become crowded together and also come into greater contact with humans. Species that survive change are now moving and mixing with different animals and with humans.”Gillespie sees this in the US, where suburbs fragment forests and raise the risk of humans contracting Lyme disease. “Altering the ecosystem affects the complex cycle of the Lyme pathogen. People living close by are more likely to get bitten by a tick carrying Lyme bacteria,” he says.Yet human health research seldom considers the surrounding natural ecosystems, says Richard Ostfeld, distinguished senior scientist at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, New York. He and others are developing the emerging discipline of planetary health, which looks at the links between human and ecosystem health.“There’s misapprehension among scientists and the public that natural ecosystems are the source of threats to ourselves. It’s a mistake. Nature poses threats, it is true, but it’s human activities that do the real damage. The health risks in a natural environment can be made much worse when we interfere with it,” he says.Felicia Keesing, professor of biology at Bard College, New York, studies how environmental changes influence the probability that humans will be exposed to infectious diseases. “When we erode bioersity, we see a proliferation of the species most likely to transmit new diseases to us, but there’s also good evidence that those same species are the best hosts for existing diseases,” she wrote in an email to Ensia, the nonprofit media outlet that reports on our changing planet.Disease ecologists argue that viruses and other pathogens are also likely to move from animals to humans in the many informal markets that have sprung up to provide fresh meat to fast-growing urban populations around the world. Here, animals are slaughtered, cut up and sold on the spot.The “wet market” (one that sells fresh produce and meat) in Wuhan, thought by the Chinese government to be the starting point of the current Covid-19 pandemic, was known to sell numerous wild animals, including live wolf pups, salamanders, crocodiles, scorpions, rats, squirrels, foxes, civets and turtles.Equally, urban markets in west and central Africa sell monkeys, bats, rats, and dozens of species of bird, mammal, insect and rodent slaughtered and sold close to open refuse dumps and with no drainage.“Wet markets make a perfect storm for cross-species transmission of pathogens,” says Gillespie. “Whenever you have novel interactions with a range of species in one place, whether that is in a natural environment like a forest or a wet market, you can have a spillover event.”The Wuhan market, along with others that sell live animals, has been shut by the Chinese authorities, and last month Beijing outlawed the trading and eating of wild animals except for fish and seafood. But bans on live animals being sold in urban areas or informal markets are not the answer, say some scientists.“The wet market in Lagos is notorious. It’s like a nuclear bomb waiting to happen. But it’s not fair to demonise places which do not have fridges. These traditional markets provide much of the food for Africa and Asia,” says Jones.“These markets are essential sources of food for hundreds of millions of poor people, and getting rid of them is impossible,” says Delia Grace, a senior epidemiologist and veterinarian with the International Livestock Research Institute, which is based in Nairobi, Kenya. She argues that bans force traders underground, where they may pay less attention to hygiene.Fevre and colleague Cecilia Tacoli, principal researcher in the human settlements research group at the International Institute of Environment and Development (IIED), argue in a blog post that rather than pointing the finger at wet markets, we should look at the burgeoning trade in wild animals.“It is wild animals rather than farmed animals that are the natural hosts of many viruses,” they write. “Wet markets are considered part of the informal food trade that is often blamed for contributing to spreading disease. But … evidence shows the link between informal markets and disease is not always so clear cut.”So what, if anything, can we do about all of this?Jones says that change must come from both rich and poor societies. Demand for wood, minerals and resources from the global north leads to the degraded landscapes and ecological disruption that drives disease, she says. “We must think about global biosecurity, find the weak points and bolster the provision of health care in developing countries. Otherwise we can expect more of the same,” she adds.“The risks are greater now. They were always present and have been there for generations. It is our interactions with that risk which must be changed,” says Brian Bird, a research virologist at the University of California, Davis School of Veterinary Medicine One Health Institute, where he leads Ebola-related surveillance activities in Sierra Leone and elsewhere.“We are in an era now of chronic emergency,” Bird says. “Diseases are more likely to travel further and faster than before, which means we must be faster in our responses. It needs investments, change in human behaviour, and it means we must listen to people at community levels.”Getting the message about pathogens and disease to hunters, loggers, market traders and consumers is key, Bird says. “These spillovers start with one or two people. The solutions start with education and awareness. We must make people aware things are different now. I have learned from working in Sierra Leone with Ebola-affected people that local communities have the hunger and desire to have information,” he says. “They want to know what to do. They want to learn.”Fevre and Tacoli advocate rethinking urban infrastructure, particularly within low-income and informal settlements. “Short-term efforts are focused on containing the spread of infection,” they write. “The longer term – given that new infectious diseases will likely continue to spread rapidly into and within cities – calls for an overhaul of current approaches to urban planning and development.”The bottom line, Bird says, is to be prepared. “We can’t predict where the next pandemic will come from, so we need mitigation plans to take into account the worst possible scenarios,” he says. “The only certain thing is that the next one will certainly come.”• This piece is jointly published with Ensia"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bb10647abfc3c3790468d409377ce681b788a08/0_20_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8d9044d8a7ea3114e600929f799f308","title":"win for conservation as african black rhino numbers rise","story":"Slow recovery due to relocating groups and stronger protection through law enforcementNumbers of African black rhinos in the wild have risen by several hundred, a rare boost in the conservation of a species driven to near extinction by poaching.The painstaking attempts to save the black rhino have included moving some iniduals from established groups to new locations, increasing the species’ range and ensuring viable breeding populations, as well as protecting them through stronger law enforcement efforts. Numbers of all of the three subspecies of black rhino are now improving.“The continued slow recovery is a testament to the immense efforts made in the countries and a powerful reminder that conservation works,” said Grethel Aguilar, acting director general of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which compiles the global red list of species under threat.The outlook for the other African rhino species is still troubled, according to the update to the red list published on Thursday.White rhinos are more numerous in Africa but categorised by the IUCN as near-threatened. The outlook for them has worsened in recent years, driven by high levels of poaching in South Africa’s Kruger national park. White rhinos have larger horns than their black counterparts, making them more attractive to poachers, and they are easier to find as they prefer more open habitats.Poaching levels appear to have declined again in the last few years, down from a peak in 2015 when an average of 3.7 rhinos were killed every day. Estimates for 2019 suggest poaching has declined further, owing to governments taking stronger measures against the organised crime gangs behind poaching.“With the involvement of transnational organised crime in poaching, rhino crimes are not just wildlife crimes,” said Richard Emslie, a coordinator for African rhinos at IUCN. “If the encouraging declines in poaching can continue, this should positively impact rhino numbers. Continued expenditure and efforts will be necessary to maintain this trend.”The impacts of the coronavirus crisis are also worrying experts, as the halt to tourism will reduce resources for conservation. “The impact of Covid-19 on global tourism is likely to have significant negative impacts on private commercial wildlife operations and state national parks and game reserves that conserve rhino,” said Emslie. “Those in the field paying for all the conservation work on the ground may need more financial support so that they can maintain current efforts despite the virus.”Thursday’s update to the red list showed tha more than 31,000 species around the world are threatened with extinction. The red list is likely to be updated at least three more times this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9eed3cd03bdbbaeb5c347dd03ec3a3b9d407489/245_0_6011_3608/master/6011.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7c9bccce31cd3f989225df421bcad56","title":"in a spectacular fashion the escapist world of karl lagerfelds chanel in pictures","story":"From a rocket in flight to a life-sized recreation of a ski chalet, the late designer will go down in history as the creator of epic moments of visual fantasy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14599bd46249dab7dd7e46336626825a6c4bd0fa/0_0_2496_2497/master/2496.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19b1d07160ad0b51ba48dd67866ecfbd 1010w","title":"cannes film festival postpones 2020 edition over coronavirus restrictions","story":"France’s premier event will not go ahead in its traditional May slot after government measures forced its handThe Cannes film festival has postponed this year’s edition, it has announced.The festival made the news public on Thursday, saying that “several options are considered in order to preserve its running” – its preferred one being a shift of the festival to the end of June. The festival’s management added: “As soon as the development of the French and international health situation will allow us to assess the real possibility, we will make our decision known.”The move follows increasing pressure from a new set of government restrictions announced on Friday to combat the coronavirus outbreak, banning public gatherings of more than 100 people.

MIPTV, the international television market and TV festival CanneSeries, both scheduled for the end of March, were cancelled two weeks ago. Leading figures in the industry have already started organising a “virtual market” in the assumption that a cancellation would happen.Last Wednesday festival president Pierre Lescure had said he was “reasonably optimistic” the 2020 event would go ahead, after suggesting the coronavirus pandemic would peak “at the end of March and that we will breathe a little better in April”.

After seeing how that went down and for other reasons sporting, human and pragmatic, the English game expressed a determination to get the season played if at all possible and in any available circumstances.On 3 March at the Uefa congress in Amsterdam, the European governing body’s president, Aleksander Ceferin, made an odd, rambling speech that purported to be an affirmation of football’s best values – “purpose over profit,” he said. But it was widely taken by followers of all the dismal politics in the past two years to be a veiled attack on the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, although he was not named, for his expansionist Club World Cup plans, which Ceferin saw as a tank-parking threat on the manicured lawns of the Champions League’s own expansion plans.Exactly two weeks later, there was Ceferin on Tuesday, holding a tele-conference with all of Europe’s 55 national associations including the FAs of England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland, at which they agreed to vacate the month scheduled for the Euros in the hope of helping some normality to return, at least to the world’s most popular sport, by the summer. And there was Ceferin in the statement sent out by Uefa, the silly turf wars set aside for now, thanking everybody involved in making the necessary decision quickly, including Infantino by name.“I would like to thank Fifa and its president, Gianni Infantino, who has indicated it will do whatever is required to make this new calendar work,” Ceferin said. “In the face of this crisis, football has shown its best side with openness, solidarity and tolerance.”Ceferin, asked in an interview with Rob Harris of the Associated Press whether this crisis would provide “a pause” to consider the future structure of football in a more collaborative way, seemed to speak honestly when answering that he and others had been jolted out of their habitual political terrain and on to a recognition of their sport’s basic virtues.Infantino followed that with a statement which included a $10m contribution to the World Health Organization Covid‑19 solidarity response fund, sensible administrative moves and another statement of values: “unity, solidarity, a shared sense of responsibility.”Peanuts, some might scoff, but it seemed like leadership in a time when Boris Johnson’s government was still not following WHO advice to tackle the pandemic with a mass testing strategy to identify carriers of the virus.Many of those involved in the crisis talks at international level and in the emergency conference calls held from empty offices in England have said the mood of cooperation is genuine, not just words set out for show in public statements.All of this has a terribly long way to go but some leadership was shown this week and that was actually surprisingly heartening."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52e345e0c67d7040127400f5d19d2c14d3e36973/0_236_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef194df6c8075115cab19a3884aa5ecc","title":"netflix to slow europe transmissions to avoid broadband overload","story":"Streaming service reducing bit rate for 30 days, freeing up bandwidth for home-workersNetflix chief executive Reed Hastings agreed to slow the bit rate at which it delivers programming, which determines the size and quality of video and audio files, across Europe and the UK for 30 days. Netflix has 51 million users across Europe, including 11 million in the UK.The agreement comes after talks with Thierry Breton, the industry commissioner of the EU’s executive arm, the European commission.“Following the discussions between commissioner Thierry Breton and Reed Hastings – and given the extraordinary challenges raised by the coronavirus – Netflix has decided to begin reducing bit rates across all our streams in Europe for 30 days,” said a Netflix spokesman.Netflix expects that some customers will see a reduction in picture quality, although many will not. The small number getting its most expensive package with Ultra High Definition (4K), priced at £11.99 a month, will be the most likely to notice the difference. The majority of customers pay £8.99 a month for Netflix’s standard package, which comes with high-definition quality. Breton applauded Netflix’s decision, which will free up more bandwidth across Europe for home working and other activities as more families stay indoors due to movement restrictions and school closures.“Social distancing measures to fight the coronavirus have led to increased demand for internet capacity be it for teleworking, e-learning or entertainment purposes,” said Breton. “I welcome the very prompt action that Netflix has taken to preserve the smooth functioning of the internet during the Covid-19 crisis while maintaining a good experience for users.

On Twitter, @mattdechine was more upbeat than others. “Managed to sort out the mortgage payment holiday for 3 months. Felt so anxious doing it and has made things all the more real. The adviser at Lloyds Bank was excellent. Took a while to get through (over an hour) but worth it. We’ll get through this.” It is important to note that not everyone who contacts their lender will be granted a payment holiday. Any unpaid interest will still need to be paid back, although credit ratings should not be affected.It is likely the lender will spread outstanding payments out over the remaining term of your mortgage so borrowers will see an increase in their monthly mortgage payments.There is a useful mortgage payment holiday calculator at this site.It may be possible that some lenders will consider increasing the remaining term of a mortgage, which will have the effect of keeping repayments the same."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0f039a1aa8ab7a8befd0b4b9bb65cf7579a99cf/0_60_4564_2739/master/4564.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ce1f5bebffb66d7a2297bf5bff48044","title":"how coronavirus infected the global economy podcast","story":"’s economics editor, Larry Elliott, says the global economy was already in poor shape when the coronavirus crisis struck.

Provided that it goes smoothly, they will move directly into a larger trial to assess how effective the vaccine is at protecting against the infection.The same vaccine will start animal trials next week at the Public Health England (PHE) laboratory at Porton Down near Salisbury. Normally, animal work must be completed before human trials can start, but because similar vaccines have worked safely in trials for other diseases, the work has been accelerated.“We are conscious that a vaccine is needed as soon as possible and certainly by June–July, when we expect a big peak in mortality,” said Prof Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute at Oxford.Symptoms are defined as either:NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u0026nbspEven if it means they\u0027re at home for longer than 14 days.Information: If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.“This is not a normal situation. We will follow all standard trial safety requirements, but as soon as we have a vaccine that’s working, we anticipate there will be an accelerated pathway to get it deployed to save lives. The more vaccine we can provide sooner, the better.”This month, Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of Donald Trump’s taskforce, said a vaccine was 12 to 18 months away – an expectation echoed by the UK chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance – but Hill said the Oxford team and others were “aiming for much earlier”.Covid-19 was confirmed to have claimed a further 33 lives on Thursday, bringing the UK death toll to 137. The latest victims were aged between 47 and 96, and all had underlying health conditions. Confirmed cases stood at 3,269.Boris Johnson claimed that the next 12 weeks could “turn the tide of this disease”, telling the daily Downing Street press conference on Thursday he was “absolutely confident that we can send coronavirus packing in this country, but only if we all take the steps we have outlined”.A British patient has entered a randomised trial for coronavirus for the first time, the prime minister said. The patient, who had Covid-19, is being tested to check whether they have immunity.He added that the government was in negotiations to buy an antibody test “as simple as a pregnancy test, which can tell whether you have had the disease. It’s early days, but if it works as its proponents claim, then we will buy literally hundreds of thousands of these kits as soon as practicable.”The vaccine being developed at Porton Down is an intramuscular injection that uses a harmless, non-replicating virus to smuggle DNA from the coronavirus into the body’s cells.Once inside, the body’s cells use the coronavirus DNA to churn out copies of the “spike proteins” that dot the germ’s surface. It is these that should marshal the immune response against coronavirus infection. Previous studies suggest the vaccine should work with only a single shot.Vaccines that operate the same way have been used safely in thousands of people, aged from one week old to 90 years, for diseases ranging from malaria and TB to Mers, another coronavirus, and Ebola, for which it is now being deployed in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.The Oxford trial is expected to recruit people from a range of ages, but scientists will be particularly keen to see how it performs in older people. They are most vulnerable to the virus, but tend to respond less well to vaccinations because of their weaker immune systems.The Oxford team have a small manufacturing capability to make the vaccine for trials but will need to work with a full-scale vaccine manufacturer to produce enough shots if the trials demonstrate that they can protect people. That is one hurdle the researchers need to overcome.“There’s massive challenge. You can’t go to a manufacturing facility today and say, ‘We’d like you to take this on and spend tens of millions gearing up,’” Hill said. “But we are working our way around that.”The hope is to have the vaccine available for use in an emergency response setting where the usual licensing rules are relaxed. Once Ebola vaccines were ready, they were approved and used very swiftly, even though they only received formal licences from regulators late last year.The Oxford vaccine, known as ChAdOx1, is one of five frontrunner vaccines in development around the world. The US biotech Moderna gave its first vaccine shot to a person in Seattle earlier this week. Another US firm, Inovio, will soon start trials on its own coronavirus vaccine, which requires a special device to administer through the skin. In Germany, CureVac is working on a vaccine, while others are in development in China.Public Health England will run “challenge” trials with the Oxford vaccine, with ferrets and macaques having the jab before receiving a controlled dose of coronavirus intra-nasally. The researchers will then check whether the vaccine prevents the buildup of virus in the animals and protects their lungs from damage.Miles Carroll, head of research at PHE’s National Infection Service in Porton Down, said there was an “aggressive campaign” to get the vaccine evaluated during the peak of the UK outbreak. That would mean giving it to people as part of a trial in the summer. The Porton Down lab is one of a small handful in the country that is licensed to store samples of the coronavirus.“We know from the Ebola outbreak that even before a vaccine is licensed, it can have a significant impact on disease,” he said.“If this looks good at protecting and we see no safety issues at all then, theoretically, after April, going into May or June, they could expand the number of people they are vaccinating and that could be into the thousands.“Then, several months later, if it’s working, I imagine there will be a process to massively ramp up manufacture.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0678e21a941295523a6d150f4f1afb47d653475d/0_162_4463_2679/master/4463.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf91432e0c35fdabb8c9584c216b091d","title":"happiness is contagious too caring for each other makes us feel better experts","story":"World Happiness Report names Finland the happiest country and shows us how to move forward after the coronavirus outbreakThe coronavirus crisis is giving the planet opportunities for positive change that it cannot afford to waste, according to experts involved in the eighth annual World Happiness Report, out today.The report, which ranks countries according to happiness, will throw up crucial clues to wellbeing that will help in the weeks and months of the coronavirus crisis to come, says Prof Richard Layard, co-director of the Wellbeing programme at the LSE’s Centre for Economic Performance.Finland remains at number one for the third year running, while the UK has edged up the table, rising from 15th place to 13th. Threport – compiled by a group of independent experts and produced by the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network – uses six variables to measure the quality of life in more than 150 countries across the globe: GDP per capita social support healthy life expectancy freedom generosity and absence of corruption.Research has long shown that co-operation and social support are fundamental to happiness Layard believes the coronavirus crisis will speed up changes that he and others have advocated for decades. “To get through this we’re going to have to develop a much higher level of social responsibility. Some people are going to have to stay in quarantine, and others are going to have to support them to do that. My hope is that it will encourage a move from an atomised society to a much more caring one.”Vanessa King, lead psychologist for Action for Happiness which is the UK partner organisation to the World Happiness Report, said: “What we know is that social factors and trust are at least as important as income and being healthy – and also they’re particularly buffering to the psychological welfare of those who are hardest hit. In this crisis, the more we can create social trust and support and connect with others, despite being isolated, the better we will be – and the rosier a future we’ll build.”So looking out for others is key, not only to their welfare but also to our own, said King. “You might think you’re doing it for others but you’re also doing it for yourself: it’s win-win.” Setting up a neighbourhood What’sApp group to ensure isolated people get help with the shopping, looking out for others and being outward-facing were some of the most psychologically healthy ways forward.Coronavirus, according to King, brings home something essential that has never before been quite this tangible: that there is no “us” and “them” in the world, but only “us”. “This is a worldwide epidemic it’s not us against them, it’s all of us against this virus. It’s a moment when we have to say: ‘we, as a world, are fighting this’.”Powerlessness doesn’t make people happy, but taking control – even in chaotic circumstances like a pandemic – goes a long way to help us cope. “People are finding it hard to focus and that’s entirely understandable. What I’d suggest is that you try to be really clear about your intentions. Don’t get sucked into a continual stream of news: decide at what points in the day you’re going to update yourself. Think about who you need to in touch with, who you need to support – both in your immediate family, and the community around you.”Active coping is vital. “Trying to do something rather than doing nothing is extremely important for resilience. This is a real opportunity, and we need to recognise it as such. And don’t forget that coronavirus isn’t the only thing that’s contagious: happiness is contagious too, as well as fear. If you go outside, smile at people. Be really friendly. It can and will make a huge difference.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca881ffed03c04deb5b2359a464f6dfcade6fa07/0_67_3174_1904/master/3174.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73070ef2ee1fdac07bf3a90a56d65b9e","title":"dee caffari tips for self isolation coronavirus sailor","story":"Dee Caffari has been alone at sea for as long as six months.

Travel restrictions between our territories are lifted. No forced isolation or quarantine orders are in force when visiting our territories. Player welfare is safeguarded, including requirement for a suitable pre-recommencement training period.“Due to the evolving situation, unfortunately the board had to take the further decision to cancel the Pro14 Final at Cardiff City Stadium, set to take place on June 20. Refunds will be made automatically to all who have already purchased tickets.“Should any final be played as part of the 201920 season, it will be hosted by the team with highest ranking based upon league records from this campaign.”Meanwhile, Wales, Scotland and Italy will be able to select full-strength teams if their Six Nations matches are rearranged later this year with the Premiership clubs set to relax their ban on releasing non-England players for Tests outside the official window.Wales’s match against Scotland at the Principality Stadium was called off last week. The home side’s 23 included six players who were based in England. The injured Exeter prop Tomas Francis will be fit again if the game is rescheduled for next season, while the Gloucester wing Louis Rees-Zammit may come into contention.Scotland’s squad had four who earn their livings in England. Under the Premiership rule on the release of players, any club who unilaterally permits a player to appear for any other union faces disciplinary action: Northampton were find £60,000 at the end of 2013 for allowing George North to appear for Wales in a Test arranged outside World Rugby’s window.The rule was introduced after countries, Wales especially, arranged a fourth international every November, and occasionally in the summer. The Rugby Football Union’s deal with the clubs over the release of players for national duty includes financial provision for a fourth international at Twickenham every two years and the Premiership did not want to let them go to other countries for nothing.Italy, whose last two matches in Ireland and at home to England were postponed because of coronavirus, have three players at Premiership clubs, Matteo Minozzi, who plays for Wasps, and the Gloucester duo Jake Polledri and Callum Braley, although the latter will be playing for Treviso next season.Wayne Pivac warned his Wales players during the Six Nations that their international prospects were not enhanced by joining a Premiership club.Rees-Zammit was ruled out of the opening match against Italy because he had missed training sessions to be with Gloucester, while the experienced No 8 Taulupe Faletau was dropped to the bench at Twickenham having appeared for Bath against Bristol six days before.The Six Nations are hoping to complete the championship later this year with October pencilled in but it may be months before they are in a position to make a decision.The Welsh Rugby Union, which earlier this week warned that the resumption of rugby in Europe would come in months rather than weeks, has postponed an emergency general committee meeting called by its clubs in a dispute over the funding of the community game, scheduled for 29 March, until further notice. Two former Wales internationals, Ieuan Evans and Nigel Davies, are standing for a vacant position on the union’s board.While European unions and clubs hope to be able to resume this season, even if in the summer, Major League Rugby in the United States has cancelled the remainder of its campaign, which had not reached its halfway point, and will resume next year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8de71b9ea8e316621e768e022bdc3fca4f0bd80/205_474_5067_3041/master/5067.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=591267d37ed03b52b5e92c928dfd288d","title":"iditarod 2020 the worlds most famous sled dog race in pictures","story":"Thomas Waerner of Norway won the nearly 1,000-mile sled dog race in Alaska, of the few sporting events not canceled amid the coronavirus outbreak"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63e33044ab9b431f127257bd580d320579797bdd/20_0_5158_3095/master/5158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39d03faa2c22f2c0f21d37f16fab0497","title":"readers tips visit wildlife nature reserve uk sawdays stay","story":"Whether it’s a wetlands, mountainside, coastal fringe, forest or heath … share details of your favourite UK nature reserveAs with all attractions, some wildlife reserves may be closed during the coronavirus outbreak.

Well, guess what? You are out of excuses. Start watching Lost straight away. Watch the early seasons, where it was a tightly wound mystery series starring a small band of compelling characters. Watch the middle bit, where the show treaded water with episodes that had no larger bearing on the overall series. Watch the end, where the wheels came off and it turned into a genuinely absurd sci-fi about time travel and nuclear explosions. Then watch the finale, and tell me that you didn’t enjoy it. Stuart HeritageThis is regularly lauded as one of the finest serial dramas in TV history. Plenty of shows have tried to do what this one did, but none have come close. Beginning in 1964, Peter Flannery’s series follows four friends (sublimely played by Christopher Eccleston, Gina McKee, Daniel Craig and Mark Strong) as they navigate lives in the context of the British political upheavals of the late 20th century. But while their personal dramas are punctuated by the economic crises of the 70s, the dawning of Thatcher in 1979 and the miners’ strike of the mid-80s, the political elements never feel heavy-handed. Instead, they feel like functions of the inidual personalities, part of the accumulation of their lived experiences, their hopes and dreams. The politics matter. But not as much as the people. Phil HarrisonThis devastating docu-series is not an obvious binge, with its themes of murder, sexual abuse and a potential decades-long coverup by the Catholic church. However, its hugely intimate portraits of a group of retired women hunting for justice for their former schoolteacher is completely absorbing. Over seven episodes, we discover the rumours and suspicions that abound regarding Sister Cathy Cesnik’s disappearance in Baltimore in 1969. The bravery that the women display, combined with the chilling nature of the case and the care in its presentation – devoid of voyeurism – combine to make something that is extraordinarily moving and troubling. Unlike so many other true-crime tales, this is one series where its victims are treated as people. Hannah J DaviesSkyNow TV AmazonWhat better way to spend your time at home than watching a set of people going out of their way to help each other and improve their community? Focusing on local government workers in the fictional town of Pawnee, Indiana, Parks and Rec (as it is known by fans) began as a kind of faux documentary, an Office rip-off – but swiftly developed into so much more. It is the sheer, radiant positivity of its main character, Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler), that enables the ensemble of quirky, likable faces to shine. It is also funny as hell, launching the careers of Chris Pratt (nearly unrecognisable from the action hero he has become), Aubrey Plaza and Nick Offerman. Scott BryanRemember the 00s, when we smoked in the office, wore sleek double-breasted suits and were constantly half-cut after downing a bottle of bourbon before lunch? No, wait, that was TV – when half the world was caught up in Mad Men fever and the abusive, adulterous, drunkard Don Draper (Jon Hamm in a career-best performance) somehow became the man every woman wanted to bed and the lothario every man wanted to be. This slice of mid-century nostalgia set in the advertising industry perhaps has not retained the same sense of awe as other TV greats of that era – but it is littered with acting talent (Elisabeth Moss! John Slattery! Christina Hendricks!) and, in his examination of Draper’s descent, Matthew Weiner wrote one of the most fascinating character studies ever put to screen. The clothes are fabulous, too. Toby MosesAll4Along with The Simpsons, Seinfeld is patient zero of modern comedy. If you were to watch it for the first time now, you might not get a sense of how revolutionary it was at the time, but that is because every other comedy made in the past two decades has absorbed its sensibility. Even if you have not seen it, you talk the way you talk because of Seinfeld. In one sense, bingeing Seinfeld in 2020 is an act of historical exploration. Then again, it remains one of the funniest shows ever made. Watch the shaky beginning, before it perfected its tone. Watch the locomotive years, when nothing else on television could touch it. It is just a shame about the finale. Stuart HeritageNetflixSure, Ricky Gervais now spends his days making sub-par jokes about how the world has gone PC mad and only he – a very wealthy, successful comedian – can see the light, but the world has much to thank him for. Not least The Office, a titan of a mockumentary, which plumbed new depths of cringe. As David Brent, Gervais was a trailblazer of the self-obsessed, megalomaniacal boss before such people ended up on reality TV (see: The Apprentice) and even running the world. As a progenitor of the sadcom that has, from Fleabag to Transparent, dominated TV ever since, in many ways The Office is one of the saddest shows you can watch. But it is also a total joy to behold – especially those Christmas specials. Hannah J DaviesNetflixBuckle in for a riot of showbiz ego in this French comedy about the disastrous personal lives and glittering careers of the staff of one of Paris’s leading talent agencies. As they struggle to keep afloat amid various financial and creative crises, the agents veer through personal melodramas from ill-advised trysts to infidelities, paternity tests and even – if you stick with it – a birth on the office floor. Such is the show’s genius, and genuine adoration for the art of film, that many stars – even Juliette Binoche – play themselves in it. An additional bonus is that it is a great way to brush up on your rusty French. I started dreaming in French after ploughing through all three series in a matter of days. Jenny StevensNetflixRyan Murphy had already established himself as the king of the anthology series with American Horror Story by the time this strand of the series, American Crime Story, rolled around. His shows worked on a brilliant formula – hire a bunch of actors too tremendous to agree to multiple seasons, tell a single story and then get out again. With The People vs OJ Simpson, the formula hit paydirt. Cuba Gooding Jr was electric as Simpson John Travolta was an excellent Robert Shapiro and David Schwimmer was a surprisingly convincing Robert Kardashian. Its greatest trick, though, was how it walked the line between journalism and flashy exploitation with such incredible ease. This is the perfect way to set yourself up for Impeachment, the American Crime Story series about the ClintonLewinsky affair, coming whenever we are allowed out of the house again. Stuart HeritageSally Wainwright’s pitch-black police drama puts Sarah Lancashire front and centre – which is always a good thing. She excels as a plain-speaking sergeant, grieving over the suicide of her daughter while patrolling her West Yorkshire town – a hotspot of rape, murder and drug dealing. It had a star-making turn from James Norton, now one of the favourites to be the next Bond, but here playing a thoroughly nasty piece of work. It is certainly not an easy watch, and Lancashire’s brutal assault in the first series leaves its mark – on both the character and the viewer – but there are few British dramas of the past decade than can match this. Toby MosesAvailable to buy on AmazonHere is the original Scandi drama, or “Nordic noir”, for anyone still wondering what all the fuss was about. Copenhagen-based detective inspector Sarah Lund (Sofie Gråbøl) is finishing her final days on the job before joining her fiance in Sweden, when a 19-year-old woman is found raped and murdered. Lund delays her transfer and gets to work, eventually teaming up with her replacement, Jan Meyer (Søren Malling), for an investigation that moves slowly by comparison with traditional case-of-the-week crime dramas. Each episode represents 24 hours of police work, but the series also explores a family’s grief and political corruption to gripping effect. You will come for the famous knitwear, but stay for the peerless storytelling. Ellen E JonesBBC iPlayerThe upbeat and moving account of a group of budding lawyers living in a houseshare just south of the Thames in London has recently been fondly re-appreciated thanks to its arrival on BBC iPlayer. Although at first it looks quite different from the precarious lives of today’s twentysomethings, themes of entering the world of work, figuring out who you are and getting trashed still resonate. As do the lovably flawed characters, particularly Anna (Daniela Nardini) and Miles (Jack Davenport). The sexual tension is so electrifying it is amazing that the house did not burn down. A backdrop of 90s club culture (most memorably when Anna takes Egg’s dad clubbing) and a soundtrack deeply ingrained in the era only adds to the nostalgia. Sarah PhillipsThis may sound a little too close to home, given current events, but the joy in Charlie Covell’s graphic novel adaptation is how it spins away from its dark premise and your initial expectations towards a modern, youthful take on Bonnie and Clyde. Student and social outcast James (Alex Lawther) is convinced that he is a psychopath with a hunger to kill, setting his sights on fellow oddball Alyssa (Jessica Barden). It may not seem like the ideal start point for a touching romance, but the road trip that ensues offers a tender and thought-provoking exploration of adolescence, a rallying cry for anyone who has ever felt like an outsider. Its minimalist style and stark, western-inspired visuals are immediately striking – but the sparkling dialogue is what will keep you coming back. The response of Alyssa to a shopkeeper who is dissatisfied with his life stays with me to this day: “Then do something.” Scott BryanAll4Best known as Arrested Development’s plucky Maeby, Alia Shawkat came into her own in this full-throttle black comedy about a young woman who goes missing and the egotistical Brooklynites who have to find her (among them, the dangerously narcissistic Elliott (John Early) and Portia (Meredith Hagner), who is entirely devoid of self-awareness. While the first run is a perfect, self-contained whodunnit, a couple of huge twists allowed it to stretch into a second series, with another on the way. A show that is as scary as it is entirely ludicrous (watch out for the cult operating from under a luxe jewellery store), Search Party has a way of hooking you in, even if, invariably, you will end up in a lovehate relationship with its central clique and Shawkat’s backbone-free Dory. Hannah J DaviesAvailable to buy on AmazonOnce upon a time, a same-sex storyline on a TV show was such a rarity that even a hint of gayish subtext was enough to guarantee a queer audience. These days, it does not feel like the unicorn rarity it once did. In part, that is thanks to The L Word, which arrived in 2004 (and was recently rebooted). Elements of this brilliantly soapy saga have aged about as well as you would expect of a show that asked questions about gender and sexuality more than 15 years ago, but it remains a total hoot, offering high-stakes drama with a campy flair that becomes more pronounced as it progresses. You can have a ball just wondering exactly how any key character’s personality is going to be dramatically overhauled from one season to the next. Rebecca NicholsonNetflixWhat you need now, more than anything, is warmth. And The Royle Family has warmth in spades. This is a show so warm that, in one episode, two adults sing No Surprises by Radiohead to a sleeping baby and it seems like the most tender act in all of history. Let The Royle Family act as your surrogate family in the coming weeks. A bunch of familiar faces, sitting on well-worn sofas, aimlessly trading affectionate insults for half an hour at a time sounds like an absolute balm at the minute. This is comfort TV at its most comfortable. Stuart HeritageA raucously funny romantic comedy for grownups. Over four snappy seasons, Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney depict how messy relationships can be with unflinching honesty. The show follows the romance between a middle-aged couple played by the co-creators. What starts as a holiday fling moves into a long-term relationship when Horgan gets pregnant. What follows is a poignant, hilarious look at the difficulties facing all couples. Each episode is crammed with brilliantly filthy and at times downright savage one-liners that get to the heart of sex, marriage, parenthood and the sheer hard work it takes to stay in love, especially when life and all its troubles get in the way. This is a believable love story between two very likable but flawed iniduals portrayed with warmth and acidic charm. Ann LeeBBC iPlayerAlthough she has been in showbiz since childhood, Pamela Adlon was once best known for her Louis CK collaborations (she played a love interest on his sitcom, Louie, and he co-wrote Better Things’ first season). But while Louis CK’s reputation took a #MeToo-related e (Adlon described his behaviour as “abhorrent”), her star has continued her rise. She stars here as Sam Fox, a working actress and single mother to three teenage daughters, living in a languid, sometimes dreamlike Los Angeles. Sure, everyone has their own semi-autobiographical comedy-drama these days, but Better Things has undersold itself. This is the best of all possible things: a feminist Curb Your Enthusiasm with more heart – and more womb – than all the other pretenders put together. Ellen E JonesAll4The word “iconic” is too often thrown around, but never has it felt more apt than to describe Queer as Folk. The series did not just introduce the British public to queerness it confidently bludgeoned them with it – with the opening episode alone featuring underage sex, threesomes and rimming. Try explaining that to your mum. As well as being unapologetic, it was joyful, explicit – euphoric, even – in its depiction of queer (male) life. Written and created by Russell T Davies, it follows three gay men living and loving on Manchester’s gay scene. It launched the careers of Charlie Hunnam (now of sub-par Hollywood fare) and Aidan Gillen from The Wire and Game of Thrones, but more importantly it put gay sex on terrestrial TV – and for that a whole generation of teenage boys will be for ever grateful. Dylan B JonesAmazonBased on the HG Bissinger book about Texan high-school football culture, the show begins with an accident that paralyses Dillon High’s star quarterback, Jason Street (Scott Porter). It is left to eager new coach Eric Taylor (Kyle Chandler) and his wife, Tami Taylor (Connie Britton), a guidance counsellor, to pick up the pieces, while handling other crises – from absent parents to addiction – that afflict the town’s teenagers. You need not like (or even understand) American football to enjoy the show in no time at all, the wonderfully captured drama on the field will captivate you just as much as the drama off it. Through five seasons of agonising twists and turns – perhaps most dramatically with Tyra and Landry’s devastating storyline in the second (even if the ramifications were quickly brushed under the carpet) – the team’s motto burns brightly: “Clear eyes, full hearts, can’t lose.” Sarah PhillipsNetflixBBC iPlayerYou shouldn’t need an opportunity to rewatch The Thick of It. You could watch it a million times in a row and Armando Iannucci’s political satire would still maintain its bite. If you haven’t seen it since the altogether more slick Veep, you might be taken aback by how joyously ramshackle this cheap little no-risk BBC Four sitcom feels. But that is part of its charm. When Malcolm Tucker bares his teeth for the first time in the first scene of the first episode, it is like stumbling across a found-footage horror film. It’s nightmarish. You might not think now is a good time to watch a show about the incompetent failings of national government. But, if you have the stomach for it, there’s nothing better. Stuart HeritageThey’re here, they’re queer, and they’re about to get you a whole new wardrobe (and house!). The Queer Eye reboot – helmed by the fab five of Jonathan, Antoni, Karamo, Tan and Bobby – saw the 00s makeover show get a whole new lease of life, via questionable avocado recipes and incredible interior design. By focusing more closely on the inner struggles of its participants, helping people who had seemingly fallen through the cracks to regain their confidence, and rectify the areas which needed fixing in their lives – from broken relationships to coming out – it became “more than a makeover”. If the Japanese spinoff felt like overkill, there are still four other series to blitz through. Hannah J DaviesSkyNow TV Given what it was – a mystery show with no real intention of answering its own mystery, made by a figure who specialises in deliberately oblique storytelling – the original Twin Peaks was a blockbuster of a show, with an old-school riddle at its heart. A girl died. A good-hearted stranger comes to town to investigate. Then weirdness ensues. But, at least to my mind, the 2017 sequel has now become the definitive Twin Peaks. Aggressively avant garde in places, and truly terrifying in others, it is like nothing else that has ever been on television. It is not an easy watch by any means. In fact, sometimes it is downright maddening. But nevertheless, it will affect you in ways you didn’t think you could be affected. Stuart HeritageEver wanted to see Lovejoy scream “cocksucker” at a procession of bemused cowboys? Then this is the show for you. Set in the “hey!”-day of the wild west, with a host of real-life historical figures such as Wyatt Earp and Calamity Jane popping in and out of its small South Dakota town, Deadwood’s stellar reputation never translated into viewing figures, leading to its premature cancellation after three seasons. Luckily, the storylines were rounded out in a feature-length special last year, making now the perfect time to appreciate this thoroughly modern western. Ian McShane chews the scenery as the saloon owner Al Swearengen, but it is Timothy Olyphant, playing the long-suffering sheriff, who holds it all together. If you are not hooked after the first four episodes, culminating in the depiction of the real-life murder of Wild Bill Hickok (an all-too-brief turn from Keith Carradine), there is something wrong with you. And if all else fails, just count the F-bombs there are 43 in the first hour alone. Toby MosesNetflix It may have been created for a pre-streaming world, but there are few sitcoms as binge-friendly as the Bluth family’s madcap saga. Stuffed to the gills with callbacks and inter-show references, Arrested Development benefits hugely from back-to-back (and repeat) viewing – and the impressive gag-rate and endlessly ridiculous narrative accelerations mean the episodes simply fly by. Masterminded by The Ellen Show co-creator Mitchell Hurwitz, Arrested Development began airing in 2003, with three near-peerless seasons before it was cancelled, only to be resurrected for two more disappointing outings on Netflix. Nonetheless, we will always have those early years tracing the many trials (sometimes literally) of the extremely rich, extremely entitled and extremely eccentric Newport Beach crew. Cue layers of cartoonish plotlines, catchphrases galore and a veritable labyrinth of addictively quotable in-jokes not to mention some of greatest slapstick that television comedy has ever seen. Rachel AroestiNetflix A true millennial phenomenon. The idea of a feminist musical sitcom that majors on mental health issues might cause eyes to roll. But don’t switch over to Friends just yet. Crazy Ex-Girlfriend is hilarious, pioneering and eminently watchable. It has caused controversy since first being aired in 2015, chronicling the life struggles of its main character Rebecca (played wonderfully by its writer-creator Rachel Bloom) – from her obsessive fixations and borderline personality disorder, to suicide attempts and abortions – all with a sunny musical theatre soundtrack. What could be heavy, dramatic fare, is dealt with confidently, accompanied by a righteous wink the Cats special is a thing to behold, and Period Sex will be stuck in your head for weeks. Bloom has been nominated for multiple Emmies, Glaad awards and Golden Globes for her performance, and rightly so – she shines. But the supporting cast are beautifully played, too, with one of the most authentic portrayals of bisexuality ever put to screen in Pete Gardner’s Darryl Whitefeather. Dylan B JonesAll dressed up with nowhere to go? Then try Next in Fashion, the Netflix reality show in which already competent and semi-established designers, stuck in the shadows of their big-name bosses, get to compete in front of an impressive array of fashion insiders, from Christopher Kane to Phillip Lim. Better still, its focus on bringing people up rather than putting them down offers a welcome reprieve from the more typically brutal world of TV talent competitions, and presenters Alexa Chung and Tan France provide warm, supportive, well-tailored shoulders to cry on. Plus, you don’t have to wait 10 weeks to find out who the winner will be the duo very much urge you to binge this, with a reminder to press “next episode” at the end of every episode. Rebecca NicholsonAll4 Between 2004 and 2013 the writer Paul Abbott embedded us in Manchester’s Chatsworth council estate, with the sprawling, chaotic Gallagher family, headed up – nominally – by their drunkard dad Frank (David Threlfall) and, actually, by his eldest daughter Fiona (Anne-Marie Duff). So much good came from the Gallaghers: Fiona’s unutterably sweet on-screen romance with Steve led to the real-life marriage of Duff and co-star James McAvoy Maxine Peake built her reputation as fearsome neighbour Veronica, and stories were told about British working-class life without condescension or judgment. Are the Gallaghers the type of family to have a coat of arms? Probably not. But if they were, its motto would read: “Honi soit qui mal y pense” – Shame on those who see shame in it. Ellen E JonesThere are so many things about Sex Education that may irritate at first. Why does the school look so American – right down to the lettered bomber jackets – despite being set (and filmed) in rural Britain? For that matter, why film in Wales yet feature no one with a Welsh accent? And let’s not forget that hardy perennial: why do most of its teenagers look about 30? (Answer: because they are.) But be patient get past that. The show may attempt to lure you in with Inbetweeners-style crudeness, but it unfolds into a thoughtful, well-paced comedy drama, with an almost public-service zeal for exploring the issues around sex and relationships with sensitivity and warmth. There is, of course, the show’s breakout star too, Ncuti Gatwa (real age 27). He has become a meme as lead character Otis’s out-and-proud gay best friend, Eric, and is now a rather unexpected spokesperson for the coronavirus pandemic, with his line after spotting another character leaving the toilets without washing their hands doing more to stop the spread of the virus than any Boris Johnson press conference: “Wash your hands, you detty pig.” Scott BryaniPlayer There are few voices more soothing than David Attenborough’s, and here he narrates what must be one of the greatest nature documentaries of all time, and certainly the most visually stunning. While its 2017 sequel (also on iPlayer) played a vital role in shifting attitudes towards plastic pollution around the world, it started here, with the the original Blue Planet in 2001, which took five years to make and is still one of Attenborough’s career highlights. The sheer beauty of all that it uncovered is wonderfully escapist in itself (episode two, The Deep, is a psychedelic wonder), and at a pinch, it may also provide just a little of what’s needed in times like these: travel without travelling, education without crowds, and a reminder of the respect we must have for the unforgiving power of nature. Rebecca NicholsonMalorie Blackman’s hit young adult series arrived earlier this month, its tale of star-crossed lovers separated because of their races and backgrounds seeming more urgent as bigotry continues its worrying resurgence. Over six episodes – all of which are available to stream now – this Romeo and Juliet in a race-reversed society draws you into a world where the microagressions and discrimination frequently suffered by people of colour are drawn into sharp relief, and the lines between rich and poor are more pronounced than ever. Besides this, it is also a gripping tale of families with hidden secrets, changing allegiances and, of course, love. Peaky Blinders’ Jack Rowan and newcomer Masali Baduza are captivating as the leads, while Paterson Joseph is among its strong ensemble. Hannah J DaviesSky GoNowTVAmazon Prime Video Modern Family is a show you can bond with, settling into and going the distance with its 10 series. Those 200-plus episodes, along with the ongoing 11th and final series, make the story of various factions of the Pritchett clan – including a gay couple with a daughter, introduced to a mainstream American audience as part of the happy warp and weft of normal suburban life – one of the longest running sitcoms in television history. Of course there have been peaks and troughs in that time, but it has always been of standout quality, with laugh-a-line scenes, some of which are so light and fleet that you barely catch them skimming past you, making every episode ripe for rewatching. Lucy ManganAs podcasts become ever more popular, so the number of pods that have been made into TV series continues to grow, from Homecoming (Amazon Prime Video) to Limetown (Facebook Watch). Chief among them is Dirty John, adapted from the hit Wondery show about a devious, bedraggled conman who wormed his way into the life of a moneyed businesswoman, Debra Newell, by posing as a successful anaesthesiologist (he was in fact a former nurse anaesthetist who had spent time in prison for fraud). The total gall displayed by John Meehan – as he attempted a Parasite-esque takeover of Newell’s life – would be enough to stun most people. But, combined with a helping of Netflix melodrama, it makes for a particularly shocking, if knowingly cheesy, watch. Hannah J DaviesAmazon Prime VideoThis Zooey Deschanel vehicle has two main things going for it. First, it is funny. Second, there are a lot of episodes. I adopted New Girl as my back-up binge show a couple of years ago, dropping in and out when there wasn’t anything exciting on, and I still haven’t made it to the finale. The best thing about an ensemble sitcom such as New Girl is that – if you hang in there for long enough – all the characters have their time to shine. Schmidt is the breakout character, but then he is eclipsed by the ornery Nick. And then, out of nowhere, Winston becomes the absurdist one who holds the whole show together. This is a series so egalitarian that even Megan Fox is able to become its funniest thing for a decent stretch of episodes. Stuart HeritageIncreasingly, you can just stroll down to your local supermarket to achieve an effect comparable to watching Russell T Davies’s 2019 future-shock family saga. With its grim projections about rampant populism, accelerating climate crisis, the madness of crowds and the bewildering pace of technological change, Years and Years felt worryingly on the nose when it aired last year. Suffice to say, its vision hasn’t got much more comforting in the meantime. But as horrifying – and frequently plausible – as the travails of the Lyons family were, the show does, eventually, speak to resilience and continuity. By the skin of their teeth, and not without a couple of casualties, the family keeps it together. And so, just about, does the country. Phil HarrisonNetflixThe sitcom previously known as Scrotal Recall was always far better than a show with that painful pun as a name had any right to be. But with a new moniker, and a shift to Netflix, fresh life was breathed into the tale of four twentysomethings navigating friendship, relationships and STIs post university. The laughs may be gentle, but the writing by Tom Edge is subtle and the characters well drawn, with Johnny Flynn (brother of Jerome) leading the cast as the chlamydia-infected Dylan tracking down his previous conquests to break the news. It’s a neat conceit, and the will theywon’t they romance with Antonia Thomas’s Evie is in the greatest of sitcom traditions – and far less frustrating when watched in one go. Toby MosesAll4The cop comedy Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a feelgood proposition on every level. It is a properly funny comedy. It is undemanding moreish fare. It has charm, it has warmth, it has heart. Its characters are fundamentally united, chafing and rubbing together enough to strike comic sparks but essentially hanging together in the fight against the villainry. True antipathy or hostility has no place here. But best of all, and most valuably perhaps in our current times, it also shows every sign of the ensemble cast being free of it, too. It is impossible to know for sure, of course – the set may be a hotbed of hatred and warring egos – but one feels that the easy camaraderie on display is impossible to fake entirely. Add to that the joy of seeing Andre Braugher – Frank freaking Pembleton from Homicide: Life on the Streets, people! – in a light comic role and all that it left to say is, of course, NOICE! Lucy ManganAmazon Prime VideoBritBoxThey don’t, in so many senses, make them like this any more. ITV’s 1981 version of Evelyn Waugh’s 1945 novel was, with its 11-hour running time, not far off granting the wish of those viewers who like dramatisations to include every word of the book. That meant the world Waugh conjured – fading nobility, eccentric inter-war hedonism and grassy afternoons at a perfectly proper Oxford University – could be allowed to completely envelop the viewer. In the days before the big US box-set beasts, Brideshead Revisited was routinely cited as the best TV show of all time. In part, that was due to the exquisite score, the sky-high production values and the brilliant cast. But its appeal has always been mainly as a door to a fantasy of a bygone world. That’s now perhaps more valuable than ever. Jack SealeMaking a followup to Peep Show was always going to be tough for its writers Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain, and shorn of the natural comedic chemistry of Mitchell and Webb you might find yourself wondering where all the laughs have gone. But this is not a sitcom – it sits in that weird half-space, not quite a drama, not quite a comedy – where so many TV shows flounder. Yet Fresh Meat pulls through with a hugely talented young cast bringing to life a collection of university misfits adjusting to house-sharing – and hinted at the drama chops of Armstrong, who would go on to write Succession without his long-time collaborator. Jack Whitehall impresses as the posh dimwit best avoided in the uni bar, while Zawe Ashton’s beautifully surreal turn as Vod never fails to entertain, even if the thrill is somewhat diminished in the latter series when the character is pushed to the emotional forefront. Across four series, we see the characters mature, regress and mature again – before it reaches its natural endpoint with graduation.

They will be fronted by Grylls and scout ambassadors, including the TV naturalist Steve Backshall and Helen Glover, the double Olympic rowing champion.The activities include making lolly-stick catapults, becoming a “black-out poet”, investigating local heraldry, tackling origami and designing and making hot-air balloons. All the activities can be carried out in the house or garden. They have been drawn from a back catalogue of activities devised over the years by scout leaders across the country.“Young people have such huge energy and that needs channelling in a positive way,” said Grylls. “Whether you’re climbing Everest, or just trying to make it through to bedtime, a little planning and positive spirit will make all the difference. It’s not often you’ll find me talking about the great indoors – but this is the exception. Try them out, look after each other and, most of all, make this challenging time a safe and positive time.”The erging approaches to school closures may stem from the considerable uncertainty around the extent to which children are playing a role in spreading Covid-19.“It seems most plausible to me that they are being infected but are at low risk of developing disease,” said Prof Peter Smith, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “We know that for flu, children are important transmitters of infection, which is the basis for the flu vaccination programme directed at children, but we do not know yet how important they are as transmitters of coronavirus. So closing schools would be based on the assumption that they do make an important contribution to transmission.”Rates of various illnesses are seen to rise and fall at the start and end of school terms. School holidays were thought to have led to a plateau in the 2009 swine flu pandemic. Also advised hygiene and social distancing measures, such as hand washing and reduced physical contact, just aren’t very effective in a primary school playground setting. So there is the potential for schools to act as a local fountain of infection for the surrounding area.“Every mother and father knows that when kids go back to school they’re going to get hammered by colds and flus and sore throats,” said Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia.This uncertain science has to be carefully weighed against the certain disruption and cost of school closures, including taking large numbers of doctors and nurses out of the workplace, and unintended consequences such as grandparents, who are among the most vulnerable, taking on childcare and facing greater exposure.The Scouts movement said the 100 activities were designed to have clear outcomes, such as developing communication skills or learning how to problem solve, which will also support schools in their aim to keep young people learning in their homes.“If young people’s minds aren’t occupied by doing something interesting and creative their ability to learn drops off,” said a spokesman for the Scouts. “We are trying to keep this going because all this is going to end one day and children will go back to school.”Psychologists have advised families in isolation to structure their day and try to avoid conflict with a key strategy being spending brief periods of time away from each other.Other parents have posted their own strategies online, ranging from the low-energy option of putting the television on, to more elaborate initiatives such as buying toys from charity shops to revitalise children’s play time. Several people stress that children should still get fresh air in the garden, but that will be harder for those who live in flats and want to maintain social distancing by not going outside.The game leader should give everyone a postcard and ideas for how far in the future they’d like to send their postcard.

Decorate the border of the frame with pens, stamps, stickers and other photos you have taken.“This activity is a chance to get creative, but it also reminds everyone how to look after books,” the Scouts say. “Bookmarks help people remember where they’ve got to without damaging the book. What other materials could bookmarks be made from?”“Every time the diary owner does something nice or something good happens, they should make a note of it,” say the Scouts. “Each week the group should gather and each person should say as much or as little as they like about how many or how few wins they had that week.”Look at an existing coat of arms and choose different colours and animals to design your own shield.

We’re here. We occupy this area. We have a culture and we proudly say that we’re Mexicans,” he said.The Afro-Mexican population has long struggled for recognition in an overwhelmingly mestizo country where the indigenous past is lionized but lighter skin colour is often reflected in social advancement and higher incomes.This year’s census – which is being collected throughout March – marks the first time the country is counting its Afro-Mexican population, providing official recognition for a people often overlooked in the Mexican cultural mosaic.A 2015 survey from Mexico’s statistics institute estimated the Afro-Mexican population at 1.3 million. Observers expect the census to put the current total at around 2 million – mostly in Guerrero, Oaxaca and Veracruz states.“It’s extremely important that they count us as Afro-Mexicans,” said García, an engineer in the community of Cuajinicuilapa. “We’re of African descent – but we’re Mexicans because we were born here and we built this country.”From the very start of conquest of what is now Mexico, Africans arrived alongside the Spanish, both voluntarily as conquistadores – and as slaves.Many intermarried with indigenous people and some Afro-Mexicans have played prominent roles in the country’s history – including the independence hero José María Morelos and early president Vicente Guerrero.More recently, however, their history has been one of marginalisation and neglect in underdeveloped regions such as the Costa Chica, a dry, tropical zone to the south-east of Acapulco.When President Andrés Manuel López Obrador visited the region recently, a local politician complained of inadequate roads, a lack of hospitals and schools and recurring blackouts.“Our history was erased for centuries, so people think we don’t exist,” Abad Campos Rodríguez told the president.Locals say the struggle for recognition started to gain momentum ahead of the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus’s arrival in the Americas.Indigenous groups saw nothing to celebrate – and García said many Afro-Mexican communities felt the same since “we, too were mistreated by the Spanish because they brought us here by force.“We knew we were different from the indigenous people, and we were different from mestizos – so we started to struggle for recognition.”Many Afro-Mexican communities have “leaned into” their identity for social and cultural reasons, said Jayson M Porter, a PhD candidate in environmental history at Northwestern University, who has studied the Costa Chica.“The question is: how much they should lean in to their identity for political reasons?” he said, adding that it is unclear who counts as Afro-Mexican – and what benefits that will bring.Afro-Mexican identity is not straightforward: many self-identify as negro (black) though others dislike the term and prefer Afro-Mexican or Afro-descendant.“There are people who say they don’t mind being called negro – but it depends on how they say it,” says Yolanda Camacho, a member of the Colectiva de la Costa de Oaxaca Ñaa ‘Tunda – with ñaa ‘tunda meaning “black woman” in the Mixtec language.“In the word ‘Afro-Mexican’ are all the names of self-descriptions that we give ourselves.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/110065117a9cf3f154b0dd976cd75aefbb779767/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44eaa9b2fc8f25348865dbee9401c30f","title":"anywhere but westminster we need your help covering the coronavirus","story":"Become part of our new video project documenting the impact of the outbreak across the UKFor 10 years, the ’s Anywhere but Westminster video series has been about getting out into communities, giving voice to ordinary people, and trying to find a new way of covering politics and current affairs.

Forty-six opposition MPs and peers also wrote to Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak demanding a basic income payment for all citizens to see them through this crisis.Symptoms are defined as either:NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u0026nbspEven if it means they\u0027re at home for longer than 14 days.Information: If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.Citizens Advice proposed a “crisis minimum income” of at least £180 a week so everyone has enough money “to protect their own health and the health of others”, and economists at the Resolution Foundation thinktank called for the government to pay two-thirds of wages if employees are left without work to do, at a cost of £8bn for a million workers over six months.Denmark, Ireland, Sweden and Germany are among the European countries which have already taken action to shore up workers’ incomes directly.Clark, who resigned as business secretary rather than serve under Boris Johnson, raised an urgent question in the House of Commons. He said the £330bn loan scheme the chancellor announced on Tuesday would not prevent firms from sacking their staff.“These businesses have no idea when they would be able to pay back the debt that they would incur. It provides no reason to keep staff employed. In fact the reverse, because the smaller the wage bill, the less would have to be borrowed,” he said.He pointed out instead that HMRC already knew the wage bill of all companies that pay their workers through the PAYE system. “That flow should now be reversed, with the nation paying the wages of people for the next few weeks, if and only if they continue to employ their staff,” he said.“If the government does not act immediately, large numbers of people will be unemployed. Registering them will put huge pressure on the welfare system. Vital skills will be lost, and good businesses will cease trading.”The junior Treasury minister, John Glen, replied by repeated the mantra that the government was ready to do “whatever it takes” to deal with the crisis.He said the chancellor was holding discussions with unions and business groups on Thursday and “this will be with a view to urgently developing new forms of employment support to help support peoples jobs and incomes.”Sunak made clear on Tuesday that his preference was for such a scheme, which could operate through employers, rather than the creation of an entirely new system such as universal basic income, though the prime minister said on Wednesday that had not been ruled out.Citizens Advice said single-person households needed £960 a month to avoid getting into difficulty, and a couple with children £1,700. Millions stand to lose earnings as a result of social distancing measures. The charity predicted people would typically be spending £27 less a week on transport and £19 less on leisure, but that food and energy bills would rise.“The government must set a crisis minimum income of at least £180 a week so that people can afford the basics while they are unable to work,” said Dame Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice. “Increasing sick pay and support from the benefits system will mean people don’t have to face the impossible choice of working while unwell or ignoring guidance to self-isolate or socially distance.”Opposition MPs and peers calling for the introduction of a minimum basic income included Jon Cruddas, Lord Dubs and Chris Bryant for Labour, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, the Liberal Democrat Layla Moran, 33 of the Scottish National Party’s Westminster parliamentarians and representatives of Plaid Cymru.The Resolution Foundation said that with less than one-in-ten of those in the bottom half of earners saying they were able work from home, it would be harder for them to protect their incomes in the face of social distancing measures.It also proposes that the 2 million lowest-earning employees currently ineligible for statutory sick pay are granted the benefit and that it be increased for everyone from £95.85 to £160 a week to ensure it covered half the earnings of employees that rely on it, up from the current third. The government should meet £800m cost of the increase over six months for small and medium-sized businesses, it said.The foundation also said ministers should increase the basic out-of-work universal credit payment by a third to £100.In Ireland, employers who have to temporarily shut businesses have been asked to continue paying staff €203 a week, again reimbursed by the government. Sick pay will also rise to €305 a week and will be available for those asked to self-isolate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a9fc8346f679313d127d9b6e921e8d494257510/0_187_5421_3254/master/5421.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65188447c57cd7988e571b06a78114ea","title":"children to attend school if one parent classed as key worker","story":"Downing Street finalises key worker jobs with skeleton network of schools to stay openChildren are expected to continue to attend school from Monday if they have one parent classified by the government as a key worker. Amid the first nationwide school closure in modern British history, Downing Street has said it wants to keep parents in work who are doing vital jobs – from NHS staff to social workers and delivery drivers – to support crucial sectors that ensure the country continues to function amid the coronavirus pandemic.A skeleton network of schools and nurseries is set to remain open for the children of key workers.

All exams have been cancelled.Children of eligible parents will be supervised in school but not taught the national curriculum. School staff have been concerned about having little time to prepare for the new system and work out which children they will care for.Confusion over what parents should expect led some workers to ask the Department for Education for clarity on Twitter. A teacher in the north-west tweeted: “Today we were expecting a list of key workers. A list that would mean we could collate numbers of students, create a staff rota \u0026amp plan the structure of the school day. At a time of huge stress for both staff and parents this was the least you should have done.”One nursery provider tweeted on Thursday that they urgently needed the list of key workers so they could offer nursery places to the right people.There remained confusion over the offer, with some schools still under the impression that both parents had to be key workers for children to be allowed to keep attending classes. The chair of the Labour party, Ian Lavery MP, said: “The government needs to urgently release this list and start giving much clearer guidance to the public. The more confusion and lack of clarity over official guidance and support for people’s incomes, the more difficult it is to keep people safe and healthy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a007da13339edb1005ce5217610d77f705521b3/0_300_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=477db637312f5a8195a7e9cab1cd912a","title":"chinas coronavirus lockdown strategy brutal but effective","story":"The world was astonished by the Wuhan quarantine but it seems to have workedWhen China announced it was shutting down Wuhan, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, in a bid to prevent further spread of the disease, the world was stunned and experts sceptical.Beijing’s decision was a vast experiment, epidemiologists warned, that might not work despite its huge human and economic cost. Quarantine had never been tried on such an enormous scale in the modern world.Wuhan alone has a population of 11 million, and tens of millions more people in nearby cities were soon brought under lockdown as well, as the scale of the crisis became apparent. Questions about the policy lingered for weeks.But nearly two months on, Beijing’s approach appears vindicated. China has reported its first day with no domestic transmissions of the disease all newly identified cases had been imported from abroad, health authorities say.Countries with their own exponentially-growing outbreaks are imposing similar measures, from Italy and Spain to Germany and California, though none are as strict as Wuhan’s.Starting within hours of the announcement, transport into and out of the city was closed, with no exceptions even for personal and medical emergencies. Schools and universities were already on holiday, but that was extended indefinitely.All shops shut except those selling food or medicine. Private vehicles were barred from the roads without special permission, and most public transport stopped, leaving the streets empty and silent.Initially people were allowed out of their homes, but restrictions soon tightened. Some areas limited outings to one family member every two days to buy necessities. Others barred residents from leaving, requiring them to order in food and other supplies from couriers.Later the policy became even more aggressive, with officials going door to door for health checks, and forcing anyone ill into isolation. A disabled boy reportedly died after he was left without food, water or help when his his father and brother were quarantined.Controls were stepped up elsewhere across China soon after Wuhan was locked down, in part because of fears that people racing to escape the city before it was closed off could have turbo-charged the spread of Covid-19.Most buildings have security guards monitoring temperatures of anyone going in. Residential compounds are closed to all but their inhabitants.Masks became ubiquitous across the country, and in many places required the state-owned tabloid Global Times shared footage of authorities using drones to scold people in Inner Mongolia - more than 1,000km from Wuhan - who had gone out without masks.Wuhan-style measures are not a requirement to contain the disease. Countries with strong links to China that acted early and decisively – including Taiwan and Singapore – have so far managed to contain the disease through thorough screening, testing and contact tracing programmes, as well as bringing in early social distancing.Chen Xi, an assistant professor at the Yale School of Public Health, said that while he believed China had successfully contained the virus, not all methods adopted were necessary. “I don’t think massive lockdown is so far necessary and feasible. Hubei took the lockdown strategy because they covered up for so long that the scale of the crisis was beyond their capacity.” Of successful measures that other countries could follow, he said: “Mitigation strategies like social distancing, early diagnosis, early isolation, and early treatment are necessary for other countries to seriously consider.”Nor has China entirely relaxed its guard. Wuhan is still largely in lockdown, though some people are being allowed back to work, and nationwide there are still strict controls, for fear the virus might roar back.Many restaurants and shops require patrons to have their temperatures checked and their information logged before entering, or there are quotas for entry. Some buildings will only let in those who have got the go-ahead from a software called “Health code” that gives iniduals one of three colours, based on their recent travel history.Officials are especially wary of imported cases erasing earlier gains, with Beijing and Anhui province are requiring travellers from abroad to quarantine in centralised observation areas.Other places such as Shanghai and Guangdong province are ordering all travellers from heavily affected countries – including the UK and Italy – to quarantine at home or in government-mandated centres for 14 days. At a hotel in Shanghai, all guests have their temperatures checked in the evening."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92f851ac7ac36789e0b5591d9579398b3e145662/1500_449_2033_1220/master/2033.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ba5891f9f6a6b75d8183fb47a369b32","title":"church of england restricts wedding ceremonies to five people","story":"Coronavirus crisis means baptisms will also have to be scaled back, says C of EWedding ceremonies should be restricted to five people because of the coronavirus crisis, the Church of England has said. The bride and groom will be permitted to stand close together, but others present should observe social distancing.The legal minimum for wedding ceremonies is the person officiating, the couple, and two witnesses.The numbers attending baptisms should also be limited to single figures, the church said.Weddings and baptisms need to be “very significantly scaled back to meet the need for social distancing”, according to the new guidance published on Thursday. It said it would help families who choose to rearrange ceremonies to a future date, or proceed now but hold a public blessing at a later date.The move came as thousands of couples are being forced to postpone wedding ceremonies, with some facing huge bills if they have not taken out insurance. Wedding venues are facing cancellations for months ahead.Buckingham Palace announced this week that Princess Beatrice, the Queen’s granddaughter, was “reviewing” her wedding plans. She was due to marry Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi at the Chapel Royal, St James’s Palace in London, on 29 May.The couple’s reception in the gardens of Buckingham Palace, hosted by the Queen, has already been cancelled. Mapelli Mozzi comes from the Lombardy region of Italy, where there have been almost 500 deaths from the virus.A palace spokesperson said: “The couple will carefully consider government advice before deciding whether a private marriage may take place among a small group of family and friends.”However, the C of E’s new advice puts even such a scaled-back ceremony in doubt. It says: “Where family relatives or friends are unable to attend given the restrictions on numbering, churches will be happy to explore ways to allow others to join the service, either through platforms such as Skype, or recording the service to send at a later date to anyone unable to attend.“Where no audio link can be achieved, an order of service could be sent either by email or post. Apart from the bride and groom, the physical distance should be observed as far as possible.“No additional church personnel will attend the service, for example organists, vergers or sound system operator etc.”Couples cancelling their church wedding would be refunded any fees or deposit in full.Baptisms should be limited to the candidate, their parents, s or carers, plus the godparents and minister, the church said. The priest should not hold the child and the water should be administered with an appropriate implement such as a shell.David Walker, the bishop of Manchester, said: “Couples and parents, friends and families will have been planning for months, even years for their special moment, whether a wedding or a christening.“Now it can go ahead – but with only the minimum required in attendance. You may need to cancel or postpone.“Whatever decision is made, God’s love and blessing will still surround all those who would have been there that day.”The guidance on weddings and baptisms came a day after the C of E advised that funerals should be limited to immediate family, and livestreamed to others wishing to pay their respects, with those attending in person observing social distancing.“Those over the age of 70 and those with an underlying health condition are strongly discouraged from attending in the present circumstances,” the guidance said.“While naturally those present may wish to shake hands or hug, all present should refrain from doing so in light of guidance on physical distancing.”There should be no wakes or other gatherings after the funeral, it added. “Consider whether a memorial service could be held at some point in the future,” it suggests.The C of E, the Catholic church, mosques, synagogues, and other faiths and religious institutions have all ceased routine services of worship."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/112c57784b6e76f3657b8c1636dd9f9366e31cb1/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08492c9c948b9416432194314728fc43","title":"coronavirus suspects may be detained under uk emergency powers","story":"Bill allows police and officials to order anyone believed to be infected to undergo testingPolice, public health and immigration officers will be able to detain people suspected of having Covid-19 and exact £1,000 fines for refusing tests under emergency powers rolled out by the UK government.The guidance detailed in the coronavirus bill allows public health officers to order someone believed to be infected to undergo screening and testing within 14 days. They will be required to provide biological samples and disclose their travel history.Alongside the police, they will also have the power to force potentially infected people to isolate, restrict their travel and activities and contact with other people.Immigration officers and police will also be handed powers to send people for screening and testing and hold them for a period of time before a public health officer can be consulted.These measures will be enforced and fines exacted only if there is a risk of a serious and imminent threat to public health.This would include anyone who absconds while being moved to be tested, providing false information or obstructing someone trying to implement the restrictions.The bill states: “We assume the vast majority of people will comply with relevant public health advice. The policy aim of these provisions is to ensure that proportionate measures can be enforced if and when necessary.“The proposals will provide public health officers, constables and (in some circumstances) immigration officers with the means to enforce sensible public health restrictions, including returning people to places that they have been required to stay.”The bill also gives the government stronger powers to intervene if it suspects anyone is disrupting the distribution of food.Industry insiders said new clauses will give ministers the power to demand information at short notice if they suspect food has been acquired on the black market.Funeral directors will be able to register deaths and cause of death certificates to registrars electronically and will also “remove need for second confirmatory medical certificate in order for cremation to take place”.While Labour has called for the powers to be reviewed every six months, the bill instead only requires the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to prepare a report on its operation every two months, with a motion put before parliament after every sixth report – ie once a year.This motion would be a so-called motion in neutral terms, put before the Commons and Lords, saying that MPs and peers had considered the report. Such motions are not usually amendable.Before the emergency powers were proposed by the government on Thursday, a cross-party group of MPs and peers warned that any measures it takes to curb the spread of coronavirus must not breach human rights provisions.The intervention by parliament’s joint committee on human rights comes after Jeremy Corbyn wrote to Boris Johnson asking that the powers in the new coronavirus bill, which will last for two years, are reviewed every six months.Opposition parties are not expected to seek votes on the emergency legislation, which is expected to complete all stages of the Commons on Monday, and then pass through the Lords on Wednesday and Thursday.However, both party leaderships and MPs are lobbying hard to try to ensure safeguards, with the new powers set to include the potential ability of police to ban all gatherings, and to detain people with the virus and move them to quarantine.In a letter to Johnson, Corbyn said people understood the need for temporary restrictions. He added: “But given how far-reaching these are proposed to be, people’s elected representatives must be able to decide whether to renew the legislation at least every six months, up to its expiration after two years.”The human rights committee has published a 12-page interim report into potential civil liberties issues that could arise because of the powers in the legislation.It stresses that all measures should comply with the UK’s obligations under both the UN and European conventions on human rights. Harriet Harman, the Labour MP who chairs the human rights committee, said: “Times of national crisis call for strong and decisive leadership. However, at this time, it is also vitally important that checks and balances are in place to ensure that human rights are not disregarded, and that people remain fully protected under the law.“The committee will be thoroughly scrutinising the measures taken and any proposed legislation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/057ccb905652fc199bbe89ddd264a1f166cbd876/0_122_3494_2096/master/3494.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e365851c8fd3db801be5a1c9b9cd5f3","title":"coronavirus symptoms should i see doctor cough covid 19","story":"What are the symptoms caused by the new coronavirus, how does it spread, and should you call a doctor?It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organisation has declared it a pandemic.The virus can cause pneumonia-like symptoms. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the symptoms as experiencing either:No. In the UK, the NHS advice is now that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. This applies to everyone, regardless of whether they have travelled abroad.In the UK, you should look on the dedicated coronavirus NHS 111 website for information. If you get worse or your symptoms last longer than seven days, you should call NHS 111. People will no longer be tested for the virus unless they are in hospital.Many countries have imposed travel bans and lockdown conditions in order to try and halt the spread of the virus. You should check with your local authorities for the latest advice on seeking medical assistance.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 19 March, more than 219,000 people have been infected in more than 150 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have been over 8,900 deaths globally. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.More than 84,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk cases how many in your area","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 across the United Kingdom.

Ministers earlier said the rules might be tightened to include a complete ban on all outdoor activities after 47,000 people across the country were fined in one week for going out “without good reason”.Italy has reported soaring rates of cases and deaths, including a record daily high of 475 on Wednesday. An army spokesman confirmed on Thursday that soldiers had removed bodies from the northern town of Bergamo, where funeral services are overwhelmed.In France, which on Monday closed all shops except food stores and pharmacies and ordered people not go out unless to buy provisions, travel to work if it cannot be done from home, visit the doctor or take brief exercise, the interior minister, Christophe Castaner, described those breaking the rules as “imbeciles”.The government on Thursday closed Mediterranean and Atlantic beaches, banned cycling, and asked people to keep their walks and runs as short as possible – just “a few minutes to stretch the legs” – and no longer than 1km-2km.President Emmanuel Macron said an extension of the lockdown was likely, while Geneviève Chêne, the head of France’s public health agency, said up to four weeks of confinement would be needed for the outbreak to be adequately contained, depending on how closely people conformed with the restrictions. So far the country has seen 9,134 confirmed cases and 264 deaths.The French prime minister, Édouard Philippe, earlier warned that France “would have difficulty” allowing travellers from Britain to enter unless the UK adopted similar restrictions soon. While its schools will close from Friday, Britain has yet to bring in mandatory social-distancing measures, with people urged – but not ordered – to avoid “non-essential contact”.There are nearly 228,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, and more than 9,300 people have died.In Germany, where non-essential shops have been shut, public gatherings cancelled and citizens advised to stay at home as much as possible, authorities were considering imposing mandatory lockdowns after the chancellor, Angela Merkel, called the epidemic the country’s “biggest challenge since the second world war”.Concerns are mounting in Berlin, Bavaria and elsewhere that people are continuing to socialise outside. “If people do not voluntarily follow restrictions, the only measure that remains is a state-wide confinement in order to react to that. Everybody needs to realise that,” the Bavarian state premier, Markus Söder, said on Thursday.The mayor of Berlin, Michael Müller, said he was appalled by the lack of consideration that many Berliners were showing. “People do not understand. It is unacceptable that people are actually inviting each other to corona parties. It is terrible,” he said.Germany, which has reported 12,853 cases and 34 deaths, is also readying the army to help tackle the crisis should other civil servants become overwhelmed, the defence minister, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, said. “We are preparing for a worst-case scenario where a very large number of people will become infected and we have the human resources to help,” she said.In Spain, where a mandatory lockdown has failed to stop the death toll climbing to 767, including 169 new fatalities on Thursday, with 17,147 confirmed cases, alarm is increasing at the spread of the virus in the country’s care homes.The death toll in care homes in the Madrid region has exceeded 50, authorities said, while as many as 25 outbreaks have been confirmed in care homes in the Castilla La Mancha region.“These are difficult days,” said Fernando Simón, the head of the country’s health emergency centre. “These are the days where we will continue to see the number of cases rise.”As economies across the continent went into nosee, the European Central Bank announced a €750bn economic stimulus programme lasting until the end of 2020. “Extraordinary times require extraordinary action,” the bank’s chief, Christine Lagarde, said.In other developments:One major milestone came in China, where the virus originated, and where authorities on Thursday reported no new cases of Covid-19 acquired inside the country for the first time – although there was a rise in imported infections.If no more cases are reported in Wuhan, the centre of the global outbreak, for 14 consecutive days, the city’s lockdown – in place since 23 January – could be lifted, local media said. Quarantine rules have already been slightly eased, allowing people to walk around their compounds rather than staying confined to living quarters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94c85dd0702c42564355691585178fb2606ec778/155_822_2489_1494/master/2489.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96d9ee5ac4882e79a009457e461e3ac6","title":"pakistan coronavirus camp no facilities no humanity","story":"More than 1,000 remain there as thousands more are released into impoverished BalochistanIt was the smell that was the worst. In this dusty camp on Pakistan’s border with Iran, which at one stage held more than 6,000 people, the stench of sweat, rubbish and human excrement hung in the air. There was no real housing, just five people to a ragged tent, and no bathrooms, towels or blankets.The camp, in the town of Taftan in Balochistan province, was supposed to function as a sanitary quarantine location, preventing the spread of the coronavirus from Iran, which has had one of the worst outbreaks globally.Instead, according to Mohammed Bakir, who was held there for two weeks, it was no more than “a prison … the dirtiest place I have ever stayed in my life”.“These were the hardest days and nights of my life,” said Bakir. “We were treated like animals. There were no facilities but also no humanity and everything was in disarray. They were not prepared there was nothing for us to sleep in except some dilapidated tents.”Thousands of people have been kept in close quarters in hot, squalid conditions in Taftan, with not even basic precautionary measures to prevent the spread of the virus. According to doctors at the camp, even those who presented with symptoms were not tested or even isolated, and there was a severe shortage of doctors and nurses. There was such a lack of medical facilities, the few doctors on site took to paying for necessary medicines themselves. Things got so bad that protests broke out among those quarantined.“There were patients with diabetes, hepatitis and other diseases who were quarantined for 14 days without any proper medication. Their conditions were really bad there and they were treated like animals.”The border between Pakistan and Iran is more than 600 miles and movement between the two countries is extremely common, especially among minority Shia Muslims in Pakistan who travel to Iran on religious pilgrimages. It is also a crucial trade route.But over the past two weeks, it has become a hotbed of coronavirus, with infections going up by the dozen every day. There are 302 reported cases of coronavirus in Pakistan, the highest number of cases in south Asia.Even though infections in Iran began to rise rapidly weeks ago, the Pakistan government only officially shut the border less than a week ago. And the border is still porous on Tuesday night at least 100 pilgrims crossed from Iran into Balochistan, reportedly after bribing border guards.Among those held in Taftan was Abid Hussain, who is from Nagar in Gilgit-Baltistan, and was quarantined for two weeks after returning from Iran. “It’s like I have been released from prison,” said Hussain. “They call it a quarantine but we didn’t get hand wash, face masks or any other sanitary facilities. The only check was that in the morning a doctor used to come round taking everyone’s temperature. That was it for 13 days. Everyone was desperate to leave.” Many of those in Taftan have been released or transferred to other facilities, but 1,200 remain.Hussain also described lax regulations on movement for those in the camp, with many going to shops in the town, walking around the vicinity and having regular social gatherings. No guidelines were issued for how those in quarantine could protect themselves from getting the disease, and there was no running water for people to wash their hands.Hundreds of people supposedly under lockdown left the camp to shop at local markets and stores, buying food and returning to the camp without any checks. “Around these fruit stalls it was more like a scene from a busy Friday bazaar which was run by people who should have been quarantine camp in lockdown,” said one eyewitness.The situation was equally bad in the hospitals in Balochistan, the least developed and most impoverished province of Pakistan, which were tasked with dealing with the outbreak. A doctor at one hospital in Quetta claimed that medical staff had refused to treat or even examine a young girl with all the symptoms of coronavirus, whose father had recently returned from China for work. The girl reportedly died days later without being tested.Pakistan’s mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak, said the doctor, was “depressing and disturbing”.Pakistan has a notoriously poor track record for containing disease outbreaks and is one of only two countries in the world that have failed to eliminate polio. The government’s fear of a coronavirus outbreak meant it even refused to evacuate the 600 Pakistani students stranded in Wuhan province in China, where the pandemic began."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26d81562295659f004cb14408702ab2c9b0cd3ba/0_247_5600_3360/master/5600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=181a5750b5110281228a596f7699e785","title":"plan phone location data assist uk coronavirus effort","story":"Exclusive: BT in talks with government about mapping phone users’ movementsBT, owner of UK mobile operator EE, is in talks with the government about using its phone location and usage data to monitor whether coronavirus limitation measures such as asking the public to stay at home are working.The ability to create movement maps of anonymised data, meaning iniduals could not be identified, could prove invaluable in evaluating and shaping the state response to the spread of the virus.The information provided on geographical movement would be delayed by 12 to 24 hours rather than arrive in real time, but would still be able to show patterns such as whether people were avoiding the high street and heeding government advice to stay away from pubs, bars and restaurants.It could also be used to send health alerts to the public in specific locations, such as a city or town under lockdown, and would feed into decisions being made by health services.The UK is not the only country considering exploiting such data to tackle the spread of the virus. Israel and Austria are enlisting location data from mobile phone networks and the US is reportedly seeking to follow their lead.Donald Trump’s administration is in “active talks” with a number of tech companies on the issue, according to a report by the Washington Post on Thursday, exploring various options for how best to use location data.In the UK, mobile companies already know that government guidance to work from home is being heeded, as the commuter-hour spike in data usage of workers heading to and from their jobs is “dead”, according to one senior telecoms executive.“We are talking with the government about a number of areas in which we may be able to assist with the national public health effort,” said a spokesman for BT.“In relation to the use of mobile data, we are still actively exploring possibilities. As always, we are mindful of the privacy of our customers, while making sure we do everything that might help the medical authorities in the fight against coronavirus.”EE is the largest of the UK’s big mobile companies – which include O2, Vodafone and Three UK – with more than 20 million customers.Vodafone has already helped the Italian government mapping out the movements of people in Lombardy, the centre of an outbreak that has seen large parts of the country put on lockdown. The UK’s other major mobile operators say they have not yet engaged with the government over using customer data to fight the coronavirus. “We have not been asked,” said a spokesman for Vodafone.An O2 spokesperson said the networks were helping model the spread of coronavirus, but were not handing over user data.“We are fully engaged in helping in the fight against Covid-19,” said an O2 spokesperson. “Using our mobile technology, we have the potential to build models that help to predict broadly how the virus might move. This would in no way be able to identify or map iniduals, and operates within strict privacy guidelines.”It is understood that the possibility of UK mobile companies helping the government effort came up at a meeting of tech companies at Downing Street last week and BT and EE executives met Cabinet Office representatives on Thursday to expand on the discussions.As well as assessing the effectiveness of social distancing measures, mobile data can be used to track the movements of asymptomatic carriers of the disease, enabling authorities to more precisely focus testing on members of the community who may have been exposed.However, privacy campaigners worry that handing over such personally identifying information in large quantities crosses a line that may be hard to step back from when things return to normality.The Washington Post reported that the US government spoke to tech companies about using a “track and trace” model of surveillance, which would involve sharing highly inidualised and privacy-invading data, as well as the possibility of using the same information in aggregate form.That could mean tracking whether people are abiding by social distancing advice, for instance, or mapping larger population flows between cities or neighbourhoods.Facebook was named as being involved in the talks, but in a press call on Wednesday evening, its chief executive officer, Mark Zuckerberg, said he had heard nothing about the topic until the Post’s report, and that the company would not offer up user location data even if asked.“At a high level, the answer is no,” Zuckerberg said, “but I think it’s probably a hypothetical, because no one is asking for this.”He theorised that there had been confusion with a Facebook tool that already exists, Disaster Maps, which helps share real-time information on stricken communities with response teams. In the UK, the chief medical officer, Sir Patrick Vallance, told a press conference on Tuesday that the most useful period of time for location tracking had already passed. The concept “would have been a good idea in January”, he said.But Prof Jon Crowcroft, Turing Fellow at the Alan Turing Institute, said the data could yet be useful. “There could be significant benefit in having a nationally implemented app tracking not only who is getting Covid-19, but also who has recovered from infection,” he said.But, he added: “Inevitably, there are caveats to producing this sort of technology, and limitations. Privacy is a big one. Any app system and accompanying database must be designed with comprehensive, user-centric privacy policies built in.” The Israeli approach, which relies on technology developed for counterterrorism purposes, was approved on Tuesday morning.“Israel is a democracy and we must maintain the balance between civil rights and the public’s needs,” said Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister. “These tools will very much assist us in locating the sick and stopping the virus from spreading.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e30e9f48b5ca70c29386a7bdf0b54c69025d2fe/0_362_5464_3278/master/5464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be7d2442f55f0a5201f665ec46aa3827","title":"pregnant cow swam hurricane dorian gives birth calf","story":"Mother cow swam to shore after being swept away by Hurricane Dorian in SeptemberA pregnant cow who swam four miles to shore after being swept away by Hurricane Dorian in September has given birth to a “miracle” calf.A photo of the “sea calf” was posted on Monday on Facebook by Ranch Solutions, a group hired to return the pregnant cow home to North Carolina’s Cedar Island, 350 miles east of Charlotte. The cow, Dori, was one of three swept away by Dorian that were found in the state’s Outer Banks, the Charlotte Observer reported.The calf has one brown and one blue eye, Ranch Solutions said. Having differently colored eyes is a rare condition shared by various animals, including some wild horses.Getting close to the mother and calf for a photo has been difficult, because they run at the sight of humans, a Cedar Island resident, Woody Hancock, told McClatchy News group. “The wild cattle that lived on Cedar Island were not used to seeing humans or having them approach them,” the state’s National Park Service said.When Hurricane Dorian generated an 8ft (2-meter) “mini tsunami”, it washed the calf’s mother and dozens of other animals away, including 28 wild horses that died."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efa26b8ca06783f152c6266548a264824441b3c7/62_278_3376_2026/master/3376.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b65f491e2f533eb03a4f61168238933","title":"queen urges nation to work together as one","story":"Nation’s history was forged by people ‘coming together to work as one’, monarch saysThe Queen has urged the country to unite and said every inidual has an important role to play in the coming days and months to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.She said the UK is “entering a period of great concern and uncertainty”, but added that the country’s “history has been forged by people and communities coming together to work as one”.Her message to the nation came as the total number of people who died from coronavirus rose to 137 on Wednesday afternoon. Around four in 10 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK so far have been in London.The statement was released after the Queen and Prince Philip left Buckingham Palace for Windsor Castle.The message follows extraordinary advice from the UK government that the public avoid all unnecessary contact and travel and stay away from pubs and theatres. That was issued after expert modelling suggested the approach could cut the estimated coronavirus death toll from 260,000 to 20,000.“We are all being advised to change our normal routines and regular patterns of life for the greater good of the communities we live in and, in particular, to protect the most vulnerable within them,” the Queen said.The guidance for social distancing was followed by more stringent measures to tackle the epidemic, which include the closure of all UK schools to staff and most pupils from Friday afternoon until further notice. Wales was first to announce the measure, followed closely by Scotland and Northern Ireland, before the prime minister confirmed the move would be nationwide.The Queen added: “At times such as these, I am reminded that our nation’s history has been forged by people and communities coming together to work as one, concentrating our combined efforts with a focus on the common goal.”The Queen praised the work of scientists, medical practitioners and emergency and public services staff, but she warned that everyone now had a vitally important part to play in the coming months.“Many of us will need to find new ways of staying in touch with each other and making sure that loved ones are safe,” she said. “I am certain we are up to that challenge. You can be assured that my family and I stand ready to play our part.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53c1188bfbb332a917b56024cb976ab4ff02c8a3/0_41_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13cc26c208e12756cc4161b05edafbfd","title":"southern italy braces for tsunami of conronavirus cases","story":"Hospitals in poorer south say they are unprepared for expected number of patientsHospitals in Italy’s central and southern regions are bracing themselves as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases grows daily.The rise, which has been particularly steep in Lazio, Campania and Puglia, is believed to be largely the result of the thousands of people who fled south after Lombardy, where the outbreak in Italy began, was quarantined on 8 March. The entire country was put under lockdown on 9 March and rules were tightened on 11 March.The number of deaths across Italy rose to 3,405 on Thursday, overtaking China as the country with most fatalities in the pandemic.“Looking at the situation in central and southern Italy, you see cases increasing, especially over the last few days,” said Giorgio Sestili, a physicist who is collating studies from Italian scientists and sharing them on the Facebook page Coronavirus – Data and Scientific Analysis.“We think this could be due to the many people from the north who travelled south after the 9 March lockdown, and who might have transferred the virus.”According to data from Italy’s civil protection authority, there were 823 cases of Covid-19 in Lazio as of Thursday night, compared with 102 on 9 March. In Campania, cases rose from 120 to 652 in 10 days, in Puglia from 50 to 478, in Sicily from 54 to 340, in Calabria from 11 to 169, and in the central Abruzzo region from 30 to 385.Governors of several southern regions have asked for their borders to be closed off. Soldiers will patrol the streets in Sicily and Naples to ensure citizens comply with the quarantine rules. The Sicilian government has stopped all flights, with the exception of two daily between Rome and the cities of Palermo and Catania, after 30,000 people landed from the north in the space of a week. Some 15,000 also fled to their families in Puglia.Compared with better equipped hospitals in the richer north, there are fears that those in the south will struggle to cope with an escalation in cases. The health system in the south has been blighted by cost-cutting, and more than 40 hospitals have closed in recent years.Authorities in Campania have converted two hospitals between Naples and Salerno to treat patients with Covid-19, which will increase the number of intensive care beds in the region to more than the current 600.“But the problem is that Campania could become a point of reference for other regions in the south that don’t have much capacity,” said Dr Serena Masino, a lecturer in economics and international development at the University of Westminster in London who has spoken to doctors in the south as part of her research.“Doctors there are very concerned about a lack of equipment. As of Wednesday, we still had doctors in the main Covid-19 hospitals in Naples without face masks. One doctor had been using the same one for three days. The other concern is family doctors. In Calabria they received masks and goggles last week, but in Campania, as of Wednesday, they had nothing.”Doctors have also called for testing to be increased in the south, especially among medical workers, after aggressive testing in Vo’ Euganeo, a town in Veneto where the first person in Italy died of coronavirus, halted the illness.Giuseppe Craparo, a doctor in Palermo, said hospitals in the south were bracing themselves for a “massive tsunami” of coronavirus patients. “We live in a state of perpetual anticipation, tension and fear,” he said. “Our goal is to attempt to spread the number of cases over time. In recent days, we’ve only been carrying out emergency operations and were asked not to perform any routine surgical operations in order to leave the intensive care ward as open as possible.”Pasquale Gallerano, a physician at a hospital in Sciacca, a town in the Sicilian province of Agrigento, said about a dozen cases had so far emerged. “But if we experience an outbreak of the magnitude in the north, we will face enormous pressures,” he said. “We currently have no space in intensive care and are already sending Covid-19 patients to Palermo.”Cases of the virus rose across Italy to 41,035 on Thursday, including 4,440 people who have recovered.“The next few days will still be very difficult,” said Sestili. “But the fundamental thing over the next few weeks will be how the regions in the centre-south perform, because if we succeed in keeping it under control there, we can hope for a positive outcome.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b431e69cb7df7854984025620445b262c5c7b22a/0_176_5221_3133/master/5221.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82f3b0deffaac5494a9b89956aef5c2d","title":"teachers share your tips for working at home","story":"We would like to hear from teachers about the things they do to help them work efficiently at homeMost pupils in the UK will remain at home from Friday with schools in England only staying open to supervise vulnerable children and those of key workers.If you are a teacher we would like to hear your suggestions and advice for how parents and carers should teach children at home.What apps and platforms are you using to teach from home?

He said he had asked for daily updates on the numbers working at the call centre to bring waiting times down.Pressed on whether British people were being charged £1.80 a minute waiting to get through to the call centre, he said that was a new figure to him. He said in some countries staff had been unable to reach their embassy, given the advice issued to FCO staff on self-isolation.He said specific repatriation problems were focused in Morocco, Peru and Vietnam, adding he was working with other countries to see if special flights could be commissioned to bring British nationals home.He said the UK was working with host countries to help stranded British nationals and even asking airlines to send planes to destinations to where they might not ordinarily fly. He denied claims the British embassy in Lima was in effect closed, but said at present no flights were leaving the country.Raab said: “We are striving every sinew in these less accessible routes to do everything we can.”Foreign affairs select committee member Royston Smith said he had seen emails suggesting one airline, Avianca, was willing to offer flights back from Lima to Europe at a cost of $3,500 (£3,000 ) per passenger.The embassy in Kuwait on Twitter has advised: “If you are stuck in Kuwait and you don’t have enough money, please seek assistance through friendsfamily or local charities in Kuwait like Bait Alzakat or Salvation Army.”Raab said there there were no plans to change the UK government’s travel advice at this stage. This leaves the UK in a more liberal position than the EU Schengen countries that have closed their external borders completely.He said: “If we introduced these measures it would have knock-on effects,” adding the UK was at a different epidemiological stage to some countries in Europe. Raab insisted the UK was actively cooperating at G7 and G20 levelsbut admitted there were differences in national approaches.He said he could not give a “cast-iron guarantee” that Cop26, the pivotal UN climate change conference scheduled to take place in Glasgow in November would go ahead, saying it depended on the trajectory of the virus. “We would want it to go ahead,” he said, adding the coronavirus had shown the need to step up to the plate on some of these global challenges.He said: “It’s even possible as of today it might be doable, but we face a greater challenge in pulling it off.”He said 114 countries had promised to present more plans on emissions at the conference.The chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Tom Tugendhat, suggested a bold postponement of a year might be necessary given the energy all countries were applying to fighting the virus.He revealed that he had tried to hold the select committee session by video conference, but had been told it was not permissible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/661adc5fcda851a70a9a759fac9fd81a844f20cf/0_343_5142_3085/master/5142.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d2421b4624cceac9451f5d9097a4b8b","title":"africas fragile health systems rush to contain coronavirus","story":"With limited intensive care beds, governments are putting their hopes in preventing and detecting the outbreak Governments across Africa are rushing to reinforce measures to contain the spread of coronavirus, fearing that fragile health systems will be swiftly overwhelmed if the disease spreads beyond a small number of cases on the continent.World Health Organization (WHO) officials have called for a strong response to a “tremendously fast rise in the number of countries with cases being confirmed”.“We have to ratchet up what is being done,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO’s regional director for Africa.“It is what is done at this point that will determine the numbers who will become very ill … I still think it is possible that we will prevent large numbers of people dying but it needs coordination, a huge effort and huge resources.”Most infections involve people who have recently been in Europe or other disease hot spots, but the number of cases of internal transmission are rising every day.Tedros Ghebreyesus, the director general of the WHO, has warned that official numbers may underestimate the extent of the spread of the disease.“Probably we have undetected cases or unreported cases,” he said. “In other countries we have seen how the virus actually accelerates after a certain tipping point, so the best advice for Africa is to prepare for the worst and prepare today.”Health officials across Africa know that hospitals can deal with only a fraction of those needing care if the virus spreads through overcrowded cities, remote villages and among vulnerable populations such as refugees, the malnourished or those suffering from HIV and other chronic conditions.South Africa, which has one of Africa’s best public health systems, has fewer than 1,000 intensive care unit (ICU) beds, of which 160 are in the private sector, for a population of 56m. In Malawi, there are about 25 ICU beds in public hospitals, serving 17 million people. The main infectious diseases hospital in Zimbabwe’s capital, Harare, has none, Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights said.Nigeria, Africa’s most populous state, is scrambling to add isolation beds and provide more specialised medical training and equipment at state hospitals.“Our health system is not as strong as we’d like it to be,” said Chikwe Ihekweazu, the head of Nigeria’s Centre for Disease Control. “It is because we are a bit worried about our capacity to deal with a large outbreak that we are focused so intensively on prevention and early detection.”Many states have suspended flights and other transport links with badly hit zones in Europe and Asia, or are strictly controlling entry. Restrictions have also been placed on public gatherings, schools and religious services, and mass events have been cancelled across the continent.Uganda’s new coronavirus tsar, Atel Kagirita, said the virus “will not be a big problem ... if we can effectively stop local transmission.”Though Aceng said she was confident Uganda has “enough capacity beds, some ICU units and ventilation to handle a possible outbreak”, some fear this is too optimistic. Uganda – population 44m – is relying primarily on the 1,500-bed Mulago National Referral Hospital. Its ICU can currently accommodate 60 patients.There are also limited facilities for isolation. In South Sudan, devastated by a five-year civil war, the government has just 24 isolation beds, said Dr. Angok Gordon Kuol, incident manager for the outbreak at the ministry of health.In Somalia, health minister Dr Fawziya Abikar said the government has established a quarantine facility at Mogadishu airport and was equipping a hospital to deal with Covid-19 cases. “We are still waiting for more equipment for the hospital to arrive,” he said.Dr Ali Yusuf, one of a team of health officials preventing and controlling the Coronavirus, told the  that facilities were extremely limited. “We only have 15 tents, with one bed each for quarantine and isolation of suspected cases. Our hospital can accommodate only 100 beds,” Dr Yusuf said.Many African countries have extensive experience in controlling highly infectious and potentially lethal diseases. Preparations for an outbreak of Ebola, which killed more than 11,000 people in west Africa between 2013 and 2016, mean that Uganda has already stockpiled protective equipment, drugs and tents, as well as developing a capacity of moving samples around the country to a central laboratory or using mobile testing laboratories.Also, the delayed arrival of the virus has allowed governments to work with the WHO to strengthen emergency coordination, improve surveillance, and begin equipping treatment centres.But few doubt that if the virus starts to take hold the consequences could be very serious, with health systems rapidly overwhelmed.“They are about five or six people in a house with one or two windows. Before you know it the whole household is going to be sick,” she said.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns.\u0026nbspIn the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.“We are at this very early phase where it is critically important that we contain the virus,” said Richard Friedland, the head of South Africa’s largest private healthcare provider Netcare. “The key issue is with people living in informal settlements, in shacks … that (are) very difficult to self isolate.” Many countries in Africa already face huge challenges from war or natural disasters or both. “The worst is yet to come on the continent … I fear it will be impossible to stop the spread of the virus in a refugee camp,” said Patrick Youssef, the deputy director for Africa at the International Committee of the Red Cross.A 2016 analysis by the Rand Corporation, the US think-tank, found that of the 25 countries in the world that were most vulnerable to infectious outbreaks, 22 were in Africa. The others were Afghanistan, Yemen and Haiti.“Were a communicable disease to emerge within this chain of countries, it could easily spread across borders in all directions, abetted by high overall vulnerability and a string of weak national health systems along the way,” the report warned.Additional reporting by Abdalle Ahmed Mumin in Mogadishu and Charles Pensulo, Lilongwe"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85dbe1bee6b53a084e2e113cb150757304c6d091/0_2_3271_1963/master/3271.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41589251172754de67753bb6a2f3ef5d","title":"cambodia scraps plans for mekong hydropower dams","story":"Campaigners welcome decision which allays fears for fragile bioersity and communities dependent on river for livelihoodA Cambodian government decision to postpone building new hydropower dams on the Mekong river has been welcomed by campaigners, who say it will provide welcome relief to the tens of thousands of people whose livelihood depend upon its rich resources.Cambodia announced on Wednesday that it would not build any new hydropower dams on the mainstream Mekong for the next decade, allaying fears that the river’s fragile bioersity could be further devastated by development projects.Mak Bunthoeurn, project coordinator of the NGO Forum in Cambodia, said many communities alongside the river feared they would be forced to abandon their homes and livelihoods if previous plans to develop a dam went ahead. “They have time to enjoy the river. For their livelihood they depend on the fish they receive from the Mekong river and the ecosystem,” he said. He hoped the 10-year suspension would give campaigners time to encourage officials to abandon dam projects entirely.The Mekong, which supports the world’s largest inland fishery, flows from the Tibetan plateau down to the South China Sea, passing through or by Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.Across the region at least 60 million people depend on its resources but it is increasingly threatened by hydropower development as well as climate change and the illegal wildlife trade.Cambodia had announced plans for two dams at Sambor and Stung Treng but both are now on hold.Victor Jona, the director general of energy at Cambodia’s energy ministry, told Reuters the decision came after a Japanese consultant recommended Cambodia seek energy elsewhere.“According to the study we need to develop coal, LNG, imports from neighbouring countries and solar energy,” he said, adding that he could not give details contained in a government master plan.“In this 10-year plan, from 2020 to 2030, we have no plans to develop a mainstream dam,” he said. The country has not ruled out constructing dams on Mekong tributaries.Cambodia’s decision means that neighbouring Laos, which has opened two new dams on the mainstream Mekong in the past six months, is the only country in the Lower Mekong Basin planning hydropower on the river.Marc Goichot, who leads the World Wide Fund for Nature’s work on freshwater in the Asia Pacific region, said Cambodia had set an example for other countries.He described the decision as “the best possible news for the sustainable future of the tens of millions of people living alongside it and for the amazing bioersity that depends on it, especially the world’s largest population of Irrawaddy river dolphins.“The science clearly shows that those dams would significantly reduce wild fisheries and block sediment flows, speeding up the sinking and shrinking of the delta and threatening the future of Vietnam’s major rice basket, countless fishing communities and long-term economic sustainability.”Bunthoeurn called on Laos to take abandon dam projects and said Mekong governments should focus instead on generating energy from solar and wind.Reuters contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus latest at glance mar 20","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:Matt Hancock admitted he could not survive on statutory sick pay, £94.25 per week, but went on to raise the prospect of further help for some of the most disadvantaged as the economic consequences of the coronavirus took effect.

The illness caused by the virus is Covid-19.Now declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the majority of people who contract Covid-19 suffer only mild, cold-like symptoms.So how can Covid-19 develop into a more serious illness featuring pneumonia, and what does that do to our lungs and the rest of our body? Australia spoke with Prof John Wilson, president-elect of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and a respiratory physician.He says almost all serious consequences of Covid-19 feature pneumonia.Wilson says people who catch Covid-19 can be placed into four broad categories.The least serious are those people who are “sub-clinical” and who have the virus but have no symptoms.Next are those who get an infection in the upper respiratory tract, which, Wilson says, “means a person has a fever and a cough and maybe milder symptoms like headache or conjunctivitis”.He says: “Those people with minor symptoms are still able to transmit the virus but may not be aware of it.”The largest group of those who would be positive for Covid-19, and the people most likely to present to hospitals and surgeries, are those who develop the same flu-like symptoms that would usually keep them off work.A fourth group, Wilson says, will develop severe illness that features pneumonia.The WHO says the elderly and people with underlying problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.When people with Covid-19 develop a cough and fever, Wilson says this is a result of the infection reaching the respiratory tree – the air passages that conduct air between the lungs and the outside.He says: “The lining of the respiratory tree becomes injured, causing inflammation. This in turn irritates the nerves in the lining of the airway. Just a speck of dust can stimulate a cough.“But if this gets worse, it goes past just the lining of the airway and goes to the gas exchange units, which are at the end of the air passages.“If they become infected they respond by pouring out inflammatory material into the air sacs that are at the bottom of our lungs.”He says lungs that become filled with inflammatory material are unable to get enough oxygen to the bloodstream, reducing the body’s ability to take on oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide.“That’s the usual cause of death with severe pneumonia,” he says.Prof Christine Jenkins, chair of Lung Foundation Australia and a leading respiratory physician, told  Australia: “Unfortunately, so far we don’t have anything that can stop people getting Covid-19 pneumonia.“People are already trialling all sorts of medications and we’re hopeful that we might discover that there are various combinations of viral and anti-viral medications that could be effective. At the moment there isn’t any established treatment apart from supportive treatment, which is what we give people in intensive care.“We ventilate them and maintain high oxygen levels until their lungs are able to function in a normal way again as they recover.”Wilson says patients with viral pneumonia are also at risk of developing secondary infections, so they would also be treated with anti-viral medication and antibiotics.“In some situations that isn’t enough,” he says of the current outbreak. “The pneumonia went unabated and the patients did not survive.”Jenkins says Covid-19 pneumonia is different from the most common cases that people are admitted to hospitals for.“Most types of pneumonia that we know of and that we admit people to hospital for are bacterial and they respond to an antibiotic.Wilson says there is evidence that pneumonia caused by Covid-19 may be particularly severe. Wilson says cases of coronavirus pneumonia tend to affect all of the lungs, instead of just small parts.But Wilson says this “first responder mechanism” can be impaired in some groups, including people with underlying heart and lung conditions, diabetes and the elderly.Jenkins says that, generally, people aged 65 and over are at risk of getting pneumonia, as well as people with medical conditions such as diabetes, cancer or a chronic disease affecting the lungs, heart, kidney or liver, smokers, Indigenous Australians, and infants aged 12 months and under.“Age is the major predictor of risk of death from pneumonia. Pneumonia is always serious for an older person and in fact it used to be one of the main causes of death in the elderly. Now we have very good treatments for pneumonia.“It’s important to remember that no matter how healthy and active you are, your risk for getting pneumonia increases with age. This is because our immune system naturally weakens with age, making it harder for our bodies to fight off infections and diseases.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07590c99d7e662f3c899ad6e2970b376d66b4109/458_466_5110_3066/master/5110.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1dc6f001e1b98785721096105bde97c9","title":"friday briefing key workers schooling list released","story":"Government outlines qualifying occupations … four hanged in India over rape and murder on bus … and a doctor on clearing the decks for coronavirusHello, I’m Warren Murray, glad to report that this service remains broadly on schedule.The pandemic continues to tighten its grip on the US while China claims it has had the second day in a row of no new domestic cases.

The case led to a global outcry with India shamed for its appalling record on crimes against women. India’s president, Ram Nath Kovind, rejected pleas for clemency from the condemned men. Attacked on a moving bus and dumped on the roadside, the victim, 23, clung to life for two weeks in a hospital in Singapore where she was transferred. Outrage over her death led to India passing tough new laws against sexual violence, including the death penalty for rape in some cases.Far-right raids across Germany – Police have rounded up members of the United German Peoples and Tribes group, a newly banned faction of Germany’s armed and dangerous Citizens of the Reich (Reichsbürger) movement. Members of the far-right movement refuse to recognise German laws, evade taxes and fines and have their own currency. They mix Holocaust denial with conspiracy theories. Police seized computers, weapons and ammunition, baseball bats, propaganda literature and drugs during the dawn raids, officers said.

Most of the small number of infections so far involve people who have recently been in Europe or other hotspots. But cases of internal transmission emerge every day – and health officials across Africa know that hospitals can deal with only a fraction of those needing care if the virus spreads. Tedros Ghebreyesus, the director general of the WHO, said: “In other countries we have seen how the virus actually accelerates after a certain tipping point, so the best advice for Africa is to prepare for the worst and prepare today.”Columnist Zoe Williams has spent the week researching tips for life under a new regime of social distancing and self-isolation.

The Express and the  are more or less the same: “We can turn the tide in 12 weeks”. The Mail decides to look different with “We can beat virus in 12 weeks” – it also praises the Queen’s “blitz spirit” and hails the “two cheering messages” from the sovereign and her government. The i goes with “12 weeks to turn tide in UK”, which could be misread as meaning that if we don’t “send it packing” within that time limit we will be in even more serious trouble.

By  Gavin FrancisOn 13 January, a bulletin from Health Protection Scotland was sent to all GP practices in the country describing a “novel Wuhan coronavirus”. I work in a small clinic in central Edinburgh with four doctors, two nurses and six admin staff. It was the first time I’d heard of the virus. “Current reports describe no evidence of significant human to human transmission, including no infections of healthcare workers,” it said reassuringly.I cast my mind back to the Sars coronavirus of almost two decades ago, and briefly wondered how quickly the spread of this coronavirus would be stopped, as Sars was. A seafood market had been closed and sanitised. The bulletin said that although Wuhan was a city of 19 million people, there were only three flights per week from there to the UK, and the likely impact was “very low”. I shrugged, and carried on with my work.Scientists had already discovered that the new virus was fundamentally different from Sars, though still within the family of coronaviruses. “Corona” refers to the spiky little packets of sugared protein stuck all over the surface of the spherical virus, like fleurs-de-lys sprouting from the band of a crown. Under an electron microscope they look like tiny planets, each one buzzing with angry satellites. They’re a similar size to flu viruses – 0.1 microns – and are widespread among many different mammals. Sars came to humans from the Asian civet Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) came via dromedary camels. It seems likely that the new virus has its origin in bats, but whether there was another mammalian intermediary between bats and humans is still uncertain.That evening I met up with a friend, a consultant physician who had recently come back to work after a period of time doing research. She had been stationed at a general hospital around 30 miles from Edinburgh, and was enjoying being back in the thick of clinical work, though startled at how stretched her medical colleagues were. “It’s the same every year,” she said. “I wonder when health boards will realise how many winter beds we actually need.”A week later, Chinese infections stood at 550, and the death toll was 17. A new bulletin arrived reassuring me that the risk of infection was still low, but attaching a specific form to be completed should I suspect someone of having the virus – specifically anyone flying in from Wuhan. I was disgruntled but not alarmed when one university asked worried Chinese students to seek GP attention. “By phone!” I wanted them to add, “tell them to seek attention by phone!”On 30 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a global health emergency. The death toll in China reached 170, and the cases that had tested positive there reached almost 8,000. Further cases were reported in India and the Philippines.Coronavirus infects and irritates the lungs. Most cases are mild. In severe cases it leads to breathlessness as the lungs struggle to do their job of oxygenating the blood – something that can be relieved with oxygen delivered by mask. A proportion of those patients who require oxygen will go on to need ventilation in intensive treatment units. In these early days of the outbreak, I still thought of the virus as something that, like Mers and Sars, would be contained. As GPs we are accustomed to dealing with an annual spike in flu – the “swine flu” of 2009 turned out to be not much more dangerous than seasonal winter flu – though in its severity and prevalence, this new virus seemed worse.That same day, another message came in, this time from Lothian health board. It instructed me that masks “and other personal protective equipment” would be sent to the practice shortly, prompting the usual jokes among the staff that we would be sent a paper bag and some of those clingfilm gloves you get at petrol stations. Surgical masks did arrive later that week, along with a roll of tear-off plastic aprons.During the week, I work at my small Edinburgh practice, but at the weekend I sometimes work evening GP shifts at an “out of hours” (OOH) centre in the city, covering a much larger population, with a team of other doctors and nurses. I had an email from the clinical director of the centre advising me to tell any patients from mainland China that they would only need to self-isolate if they had symptoms, adding that those symptoms did not include a sore throat. Until then, I’d been assuming that a dripping nose and a sore throat would be the herald of coronavirus infection, the way they are for most respiratory viruses. My practice started a WhatsApp group to keep one another updated. It proved as good for sharing joke videos as for the latest governmental advice.On 4 February, I flew to the US to give a talk at the New York Academy of Sciences about science, medicine and wonder. United Airlines warned me I would be turned back at the US border if I had been through China. There were a few face masks in use at the airport, but I still thought of this as a problem that the Chinese lockdown and the Wuhan flight ban would address.Radio New Zealand had also been in touch to ask if I would do an interview. The absurd levels to which we are all now interconnected came home to me as I sat down, cross-legged and jet-lagged, in a New York hotel room to talk, via Skype, to a presenter 17 hours into tomorrow. He asked me for predictions on how far this epidemic would spread. I remember saying that I had no crystal ball, but what I’d seen of infection control measures in China seemed impressive – I hoped very much it would be contained as Sars had been contained, and that isolation measures would be effective. That day it was reported that 425 Chinese patients had died, and infection rates, for those who’d been tested, stood at just over 20,000.Flying out of Newark, I found myself in a departure terminal where every table was festooned with tablet computers on stalks. They flashed like gambling machines, entertainment as well as shopping opportunities. To speak to a companion it was necessary to peer over these screens. All food and all payment was to be ordered by touching the tablets. Maybe they wipe them clean regularly, I thought, as I watched a kid pick his nose then start playing with the screen.When I got home from New York, in early February, the threat began to feel real. That weekend the number of deaths in China surpassed those of the Sars epidemic of 2002-2003, at 811. Half-term holidays followed. Along with my wife and kids, I drove north to Orkney to see friends and take up a locum position as a GP on one of the islands for a week. At Kirkwall, on my way to the ferry, a message pinged from one of the NHS Orkney staff. Did I have time to drop by the hospital and be measured up for a “face-fitting mask”? These masks are effective at blocking the droplets of coughs or sneezes that carry viruses. It disturbed me that the request came in such haste – did they know something I didn’t about the imminence of the outbreak? In Orkney? I had time if I dropped by the hospital right now, I replied, but had only an hour until my ferry was leaving. “It won’t be necessary,” came the reply, and it wasn’t.By the time I got back to Edinburgh eight days later, things were changing fast. The OOH service asked if I could come by and be assessed for a face-fitting mask. But when I tried to set up an appointment, stocks had run out. New guidance appeared that, for the kind of examinations I perform as a GP, it would be enough to wear a “fluid resistant” mask and follow the usual infection control procedures – aprons, gloves, eye protection. The face-fitted masks were to be preserved for those performing the kind of procedures – such as intubations and endoscopies – during which you might be sprayed with saliva, or worse. Some were finding governmental advice infuriatingly inconsistent, but it was clear that tough decisions were having to be made with limited resources, and time was running out. As GPs we were being urged to avoid suspected cases in case we spread it inadvertently to others, though the virus was undoubtedly circulating among our patients at higher levels than were evident in official figures.On 21 February, Lombardy reported its first cases resulting from spread within Italy, rather than among people who had flown in with the virus. They still had only a handful of confirmed cases. My wife is from Lombardy, not far from Pavia, and her parents went into isolation. Italy reported its first deaths the following day, but several patients of mine were still relaxed enough about the virus to fly there for skiing.In the next four days, Italy’s number of reported cases leapt from single figures to 229, and China’s approached 80,000. But China’s were slowing while Italy’s appeared to be gathering momentum: on 25 February, a new bulletin from the public health specialists of NHS Lothian asked me to tell anyone who had been in Lombardy or Veneto within the last 14 days, and who had symptoms, to self-isolate. “First of all, for reassurance,” it stated, “with regards to Italy, the area of concern is only for northern Italy – north of Pisa, Florence or Rimini.” I was not reassured.I spoke that day with a patient who had returned from Milan, but who had no symptoms other than a slight sore throat, common enough for anyone just off a plane. According to the rules I’d been given, he didn’t have to isolate himself. “Have you got a thermometer?” I asked him, and toyed with the idea of dropping round to see if he had a fever, but then more calls and demands came through, and I didn’t. (He subsequently recovered.)At the OOH centre in West Lothian, in the first week of March, it was evident just how thick the weekly traffic is between Italy and the UK. One among several calls: a man who had flown in a day earlier, from south of Pisa, and who had a cough with a fever. According to the guidance I’d been given, he’d been too far south to be considered as a potential case – I informed him there was no official need for self-isolation. But the advice made me uneasy, and I asked him, if he could, to stay at home and off work for at least a week.Another call was to a family just back from skiing according to the location of their resort they were at risk, and they were referred to the public health board for testing. This is done by sending away an official form – we GPs don’t get to hear who turns out positive and who doesn’t.In early March, the computer system with which GPs read all medical records, make notes on each consultation and refer patients for specialist care, had new coronavirus codes added. The idea is that anyone registered in the system with Covid-19 is tagged with a special code that will keep track of the spread of the disease, as well as our Covid-19 workload as GPs. At this point, “Advice given about 2019-nCoV” was the only code that I had much opportunity to use.To carry on with “containment” of the virus, it felt like we would need hundreds of call-handlers to decide who should stay put and self-isolate, and who should be tested – and then hundreds more workers to trace every contact. Drive-through testing was happening now in Edinburgh, though there was only one mention of the virus today among the 30 or so patients I saw face to face.By now, fear was spreading, with some justification, and the situation was beginning to feel extremely serious. One elderly lady requested a letter for her insurance company, to get her out of her package holiday I explained that until the government changed its advice, my letter wouldn’t make any difference, and she left, dejected.Watching the news, the measures Italy was taking seemed extraordinary, though necessary. Once, when I worked as an Antarctic expedition doctor, I studied with military medics for a diploma in the medical care of catastrophes. We learned about building makeshift hospitals, about iding clinics into “clean” and “dirty” zones, about planning urgent mass vaccination, about emergency medical supply chains. It felt surreal that those kinds of measures were now being discussed so close to home.The gravity of the crisis was only just starting to be felt. It seems incredible now that I was so blase, but on Saturday 6 March, I was out with friends, jokes aplenty about nudging elbows instead of shaking hands. I stood in the corner of a pub packed with people watching the rugby. (England were victorious over Wales.) A GP friend in Fife told me that she was convinced the disease was already widespread among her own patients – she was seeing more viral breathlessness than usual, but none from people who had travelled to the “at risk” areas, and none who fulfilled the criteria for testing. We went together to a sold-out concert at Edinburgh’s Usher Hall – capacity 2,200 – crowds singing, people hugging, everyone pretending to forget about Covid-19 for a night.Another friend, a hospital specialist, told me in a crowded pub that night that what we needed urgently was to slow its spread – allow the government to buy time, get in more ventilators and prepare the hospitals. But he wondered if we were doing too little too late. “We could run out of ventilators by May,” he said. Evidence from China was showing that if you buy ventilators early and deploy them in new and cleared-out hospitals, you save lives.The following day, Italy went into lockdown, but Britons were still being allowed to fly home. The supermarkets there started offering free delivery to the over-65s. My parents-in-law at least have a garden a neighbour is passing fresh bread over the fence. They have their chickens, their vegetable patch and a well-stocked garage. There are frightening stories from Lombardy hospitals of insufficient ventilators, and operating rooms used as intensive-care units.I woke up on 10 March to a WhatsApp message from a colleague – the first few Covid-19 cases from our patch of Edinburgh had been confirmed, all in people returning from Italy. They had a fever, a frontal headache and a dry cough. We were all expecting the news, but it still came like a cold slap. Everything about the way we work would have to change. Planes were still flying in from Italy and France. Websites were telling worried people to phone their GP, while each morning we GPs were picking through emails from local and national health boards for the latest advice. Protective suits were to be saved for hospital staff and paramedics at the bedsides of sick people shedding the virus.There were plenty of nervous jokes among my patients that day about the coming “coronageddon”, but only one who phoned in, drenched in sweat, with a dry cough and a fever of 39C. He hadn’t been abroad for months, and I told him to stay home for at least a week. That evening, my GP colleagues and I had a meeting in the pub that felt like a boozy council of war. We shared stories we’d heard of patients in hospital with the virus, and ideas for how to protect the practice, should we, one-by-one, end up catching it. I remembered planning meetings for the swine flu of 2009, but they were nothing like this, and the threat had felt nowhere near as real.On 11 March, the WHO declared Covid-19 to be a pandemic. Events were moving at unprecedented speed. The UK budget was delivered and the NHS was told it would have whatever it needed. We’ll see. Deaths in China continued to drop – just 19 new infections.A helpful message signed by all the government health departments, health boards, royal colleges and the General Medical Council also arrived on 11 March. It said that I’ll be expected, in the coming weeks, to go beyond what I’m accustomed to dealing with, but that I can be reassured that the GMC and health board will support me and my decisions through the crisis. “Clinicians may need to depart, possibly significantly, from established procedures in order to care for patients in the highly challenging but time-bound circumstances of the peak of an epidemic.” It’s good to feel the GMC is at my back, rather than on my back, for a change.Among my worried patients were a grandmother with full parental responsibility for all her grandchildren. A mother of a seven-year-old daughter who has a fever and cough asked whether that means she should also be self-isolating. According to official guidance, the answer was still a disquieting “no” – we were still in the “containment” phase – but I asked people to be pragmatic. If they felt at all unwell, stay in and minimise contact with others. The only unconcerned patient was a man with advanced cancer, spread to the liver, who thought we were all overreacting.By this point, we GPs were doing almost everything over the phone, even if it meant prescribing antibiotics without seeing patients, and making guesses about non-urgent diagnoses – shunting anything that wasn’t an emergency into an imagined future of normality. Over morning coffee, my colleague joked about getting us beekeeper outfits, visiting only the most seriously ill in their homes while hermetically sealed in our own isolation suits. As jokes go, it wasn’t very funny.I spent the afternoon doing a men’s clinic for the city’s rough sleepers and those with no fixed address, some of whom sleep in Bethany Trust dormitories. In my morning surgery, everyone had asked me about the virus my homeless patients had, it seems, more pressing concerns. About half went to shake my hand, and thought me cowardly for bumping elbows instead.By the time I emerged from the clinic, Boris Johnson had told everyone with cough and cold symptoms to stay home for a week. “At last!” I thought. Maybe people will take it seriously. We were again informed that more protective equipment was coming, but the droplet-resistant masks still won’t be available. Everyone with a beard who works with Covid-19 patients has been asked to shave it off, as the masks don’t work if there’s hair between them and the skin. Anyone with religious or cultural objections was told to speak with their line manager.Friday the 13th, and an atmosphere of dread in morning meeting at the news from Italy. There aren’t enough ventilators to go round, or nurses, and people are being buried without funerals. The practice WhatsApp group has been renamed “Dream Team CoronaCombat” in an attempt at levity. There was an air of quiet resignation at what’s coming, but an edge of bunker humour, too. One of the clinic thermometers broke, and I went online to buy another – £30 versions are changing hands for £125. But virologists are learning about Covid-19 all the time, and for all their horrors, the Chinese and Italian experiences mean that we’re better prepared in the UK than we might have been.One of my patients that day, a man in his late 80s, told me that the virus is mother nature getting back at us. “Too many people!” he said, and chuckled. “All us oldies need clearing out!” I didn’t share his glee. Some who have had coughs for weeks, but that have worsened, asked me if they’d got it – but there’s no way of knowing, and I told them all to stay home for a further week. The lab had stopped accepting viral swabs from GPs, so unless someone is admitted to hospital, they aren’t tested. And also on the 13th, the first death in Scotland, in Ediburgh, was announced.Spain followed Italy into lockdown, planes turning back halfway. The UK attitude of allowing schools to stay open came under attack. It was obvious we needed new ways to slow the spread, particularly among the over-65s – they’re the ones most at risk from this disease. One of my colleagues has purchased us hazmat suits from eBay for home visiting, just in case. The medical students of Edinburgh University have set up a pet-and-babysitting service for NHS staff.On Tuesday 17 March, the practice was oddly quiet – there was a hush on the streets, a sense of anxious anticipation, and my days now feel like a prelude to what is to come. People were stunned by the implications of the guidance delivered by the prime minister on Monday night – to avoid going out, to avoid restaurants and theatres, to self-isolate for 14 days if anyone in the family has symptoms. Unprecedented, necessary, belated advice. Of the 20 people I spoke to on the phone, a couple almost certainly had the virus – a new headache, fever, cough, malaise and exhaustion. I coded them “suspected coronavirus infection” and gave advice to stay in with their whole families, and call us if they get worsening breathlessness.As healthcare workers, we’ve been told to follow the same advice as everyone else: stay off for 14 days if anyone in our homes has a cough or fever. Practices adjacent to my own are already losing staff, and we’re clamouring for testing. If I develop a cough but test negative, I can go on working. Even better will be some future test that can show if I’ve had the virus, and developed immunity – then I’ll be able to work overtime through the coming weeks without fear. Hospital clinics are being cancelled wherever possible, all elective surgery postponed. We’re clearing the decks for an onslaught. Yes, it would have been nice to have been better prepared for this pandemic, but though it’s frightening, it could also be worse, and I don’t feel the same anger as some of my colleagues towards the government for its prevarication over such immense and unprecedented decisions.On Wednesday I heard that schools are closing, and so my wife and I will be contending with the competing necessities of the kids, the virus and the NHS. My wife contacted her GP in Lombardy. The situation is, he said, very grave, and he wished us luck with what is to come. I messaged a medical contact in Beijing, the Chinese translator of my books, who said things are improving, with few new cases. “As you know, isolation is the only effective method to stop the virus,” he added, and asked that I give thought to the mental health of my patients as much as to their physical needs. He ended on a sanguine note: “People will have to change their habits for a while. The spring is coming.”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcc069902b69ef57621e1205fd5f772a288700fc/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d4f658fd78993d7b2822efcb11c9f4f","title":"wine cooler global heating helps swedens vineyards to success","story":"As climate change makes winemaking a torrid business in southern Europe, viniculture is taking off in ScandinaviaIn a corner of his whitewashed 18th-century homestead, Håkan Hansson – the fifth generation of his family to farm this gently undulating stretch of land in southern Sweden – keeps a worn set of diaries, but not just for sentimental reasons.From the early 1950s, Hansson’s mother, a keen amateur meteorologist, meticulously wrote down every detail of the weather in Skåne county. Her records show why, 70 years later, her son is now one of a fast-growing band of increasingly successful – and award-winning – Swedish winemakers.“It’s really quite clear,” said Hansson, 68, a former financier who planted his first vines on the south-facing slopes of what is now the Hällåkra vineyard in 2003, and today has about 22,000 on 6.5 hectares.“We have an extra month of summer now. And winters are not like what they used to be. That’s why we can make wine, and why 50 years ago, we couldn’t.”September, Hansson said, used to be the month when temperatures would plummet, but not any more: “Now we’re seeing daytime temperatures of 24 or 25C, even at the end of the month, with perfect, cool nights. Impossible when I was a kid, and not very different from Burgundy.”Denmark now has about 90 commercial vineyards, compared with two in 2005, while Sweden has 50. A handful of bold pioneers are growing grapes in Finland, and the world’s most northerly functioning vineyard overlooks Norway’s largest fjord.They are, of course, infinitesimally small beer compared with the more established winemakers of southern and central Europe: according to Sveneric Svensson of the Swedish Wine Association, Sweden has barely 125 hectares of land under vine, against an estimated EU total – mostly in France, Italy and Spain – of 3.3m.Output is tiny: Sweden produced less than 450,000 litres of wine in 2019 France alone made more than 4.5bn. “We are still very much in our infancy,” Svensson said. “But commercial production is now serious. And the quality of the wine is very encouraging. There’s excellent feedback, from around the world.”Scandinavia’s combination of longer daylight hours – up to 25 hours a week in high summer – and lower temperatures make for white and sparkling wines with “a really fresh, crisp acidity that is becoming harder and harder to achieve further south in Europe”, Svensson said, where increasingly fierce summer highs greatly increase the sugar content in the ripening grapes.Early Scandinavian wine pioneers searched long for varieties that would suit this nascent Nordic terroir, and had to learn on the job how to turn them into something drinkable, said Murre Sofrakis, who first planted an experimental half-hectare of vines in his father’s market garden in Klagshamn, just outside Malmö, in 2001.“Growing is one thing, but producing something decent is very much another,” Sofrakis said in the small but spotless winery of the Flädie vineyard, where – on top of the two hectares of his own that he now has under vine at Klagshamn – he looks after a further three for the estate’s owner.The grape variety most Swedish winemakers have settled on is solaris, a hardy hybrid developed from riesling and pinot gris, for their whites. Created in 1975 in Freiburg in southern Germany, the variety is “particularly suited to Scandinavian conditions”, Sofrakis said. “It just really seems to like it here. It’s our insurance policy: even in a bad year, it will make a good wine.”The most common variety for reds is rondo, created in 1964 in the former Czechoslovakia by cross-breeding St Laurent, a classic grape more usually seen in the European Alps – although several growers, including Hansson, have now also begun successfully producing pinot noir.“Up here, it’s a constant and necessary process of trial and error,” Hansson said. “Each year, we try something new in a small part of the vineyard. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. We now know, for example, that merlot isn’t possible here. Very nice leaves, totally lousy grapes.”One advantage that Scandinavia’s neophyte winemakers have over southern European producers is that their more recently developed grape varieties, grown in a cooler climate make for markedly more disease-resistant vines.“The wine industry, as a whole, uses a lot of chemicals,” said Sofrakis. “It’s common practice in France, for example, to spray your vines between 14 and 18 times. Here, I haven’t sprayed once in 18 years.”Hansson, along with several Swedish winemakers, now sells to top restaurants in Sweden as well as exporting to sommeliers and specialist wine merchants in cities such as Berlin, Amsterdam and Paris. But it has not always been easy. In the early days, he said, finding a customer was as hard as producing a good wine.“Wine drinkers here were used to a big, classic, southern European flavour profile, which we obviously didn’t match,” he said.But 15 years on, said Mick Daly, an Australian former engineer who now works with Hansson, the fact that the wine “is local, the product of a terroir, of our specific climate and conditions in Skåne … it used to be a negative it’s now a positive. We’re no longer just a novelty. People who used to take a glass now take a bottle.”Cracking the Swedish retail market was doubly hard because low production volumes mean prices are necessarily high – typically €25-30 (£23-28) a bottle – and, unlike in Denmark, only the state-run monopoly, Systembolaget, is allowed to sell alcohol in Sweden. Winemakers cannot sell their product on-site or by mail order.But as the quality of Swedish wines has improved, more official stores have begun selling them. “The quality is really getting there,” said Joel, an assistant manager at Systembolaget’s central Malmö outlet, which now offers a dozen different Swedish white, sparkling, red and dessert wines. “There’s quite a buzz.”At Bloom in the Park, his Michelin-starred restaurant overlooking the lake in the city’s Pildammarna park, Igi Vidal said he was “proud to introduce diners to Swedish wines as objectively fine as these”. Of the five glasses Vidal serves blind with his chef’s much-lauded five-course tasting menu, at least two will be Swedish.“Some early vintages,” he confesses, “I wouldn’t have brushed my teeth with. But over the last five years or so, the quality has soared. People who really know something about wine are gobsmacked. You give them a glass, they love it, then you tell them where it comes from they say, ‘You’re kidding. That’s from Sweden?’”Vidal has a special fondness for the wines produced by Göran Amnegård of the Blaxsta estate near Stockholm, whose dessert ice wine – hailed as “glorious … a golden treasure” by the wine critic Jancis Robinson – first put Swedish wine on the map in 2007 when it collected a raft of international awards.“The guy’s a genius,” Vidal said, appreciatively nursing a glass of Amnegård’s 2016 chardonnay. “Who would have thought someone would ever produce something like this in Sweden? Round, creamy, golden … Comparable with some of the world’s best.”Scientists say the world’s wine map could be fundamentally changed by global heating, with traditional winemaking regions in southern Europe, as well as Australia, California and Latin America, becoming simply too hot while more northerly areas such as the UK, the Netherlands and Scandinavia boom.That does not mean northern vineyards will find life easy. Rising temperatures may have improved growing conditions, but global heating also means more extreme and unpredictable weather: heavy rain, violent storms and hail. “It’s not just an advantage,” said Hansson. “It’s a challenge, too. We will need to be very good growers.”The challenges in southern Europe, however, look daunting. In Spain and Italy, winemakers are moving to higher altitudes and planting on north-facing slopes to prevent record temperatures ripening grapes too fast, boosting their sugar and alcohol content to unacceptable levels and irreversibly altering their flavour.In France, scientists at the Institut des Sciences de la Vigne et du Vin in Bordeaux are exploring how more heat- and drought-resistant grape varieties from countries such as Georgia, Portugal and Tunisia fare in south-west France against traditional Bordeaux varieties such as merlot, which is thought to be unlikely to survive the coming decades.Faced with global heating, producers in the chateaux of the Bordeaux region are hampered by strict rules governing how their wine must be made if it is to qualify for the Bordeaux appellation: irrigation is not allowed and a true Bordeaux wine can be made from just six authorised grape varieties.Nordic growers, meanwhile, see mostly upside to the changes ahead. “Serious money” was now being invested in Swedish vineyards, Sofrakis said, the largest of which now have up to 20 hectares under vine. What was once a retirement hobby has become a career option: ambitious young Swedes are studying winemaking in France and California before returning to work in the industry at home.“There’s a critical mass now, a momentum,” he said. “We have the conditions to produce quality wines there aren’t many places in the world like this. We’re winning prizes – and we’re still learning. I reckon it’s a 30-year curve: 10 years to indulge your passion, 10 to gain experience, 10 to professionalise. I’m very confident.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2eee0d6d94242e42d0cc6794f83b6581d1d91de9/0_521_7868_4724/master/7868.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72a509083764b85f51cafc433cf61949","title":"increasingly powerful xis china believes it no longer needs washington or its foreign reporters","story":"The ruling party and its leaders have long wanted to avoid the scrutiny of the foreign press. The expulsions show Beijing is confident in its growing mightBeijing’s decision to throw out correspondents from America’s most influential newspapers is, on one level, just part of a muscular tit-for-tat between the US and China over how to manage journalists stationed in each country.In an announcement that caught the newspapers by surprise, the Foreign Ministry said US journalists at the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and the Washington Post whose press cards ran out this year would be expelled.Beijing was retaliating, the ministry said, for Washington’s decision earlier this year to cut the number of Chinese journalists working for state media outlets in the US and force them to register as government entities.But the expulsions are much more than the tit-for-tat actions that have characterised the crumbling superpower relationship over the past two years, over everything from tariffs to military exercises and now the media.Rather, they are a sign of an increasingly assertive China, confident that it is gaining the upper hand in the contest with the US that will define geopolitics in coming decades.A month ago, with hundreds of millions of Chinese in residential lockdown, the opposite seemed true. The ruling Communist party looked to be on its knees, battling a wave of internal and foreign criticism over its handling of the outbreak of the coronavirus in Wuhan, a city of 11 million in central China.Barely a few weeks later, with homegrown infections trailing off, Beijing is revelling in the chaos in the US and the Trump administration’s serial missteps in handling the spread of the disease.It has responded to this reversal of fortunes with alarming speed and a brazenness that few governments could match, donating masks and other medical equipment to first-world European countries, accompanied by maximum publicity about China’s selfless generosity.Chinese diplomats have also promoted conspiracy theories on Twitter about the origin of the virus, suggesting it had been planted by the US military rather than coming from the live animal markets of Wuhan.The party’s messages are all aimed at restoring its battered image in the eyes of its people. Not only did their brutal lockdown tactics work, they say, but also foreigners are now drawing on the China playbook on how to beat the virus.“This is, of course, a standard framing,” according to the Australia-based Chinese newsletter, Neican. “Everything in China is going well, people are happy, while everywhere outside China is chaotic.”The party was furious at foreign coverage of the virus lockdown, but that alone does not explain why the correspondents from the three US papers are being ejected. By and large, the party has tolerated foreign reporters for decades, as a necessary evil to allow it to get on with Washington and to sell its economy to foreign investors.But Xi Jinping’s China no longer needs them. The country is rich and powerful compared to a few decades ago and is happy to use foreign reporters as a plaything in great power politics instead.Not only that, senior leaders bear a deep grudge against the papers, especially the New York Times, over their detailed exposés of the personal wealth of Politburo leaders and their families.The New York Times chronicled the wealth of former Premier Wen Jiabao’s family in 2012. Bloomberg reporters in China and Hong Kong followed later with an explosive report on Xi’s family’s holdings.The Wall Street Journal’s writings on Xi and his family have also angered the leadership, as have their opinion pages.What has puzzled many about this controversy is not that the US and China are at loggerheads over the press. That has long been the case. However, many have wondered why Washington gave Beijing the opportunity to take their revenge, by targeting Chinese reporters in the US.The work of Chinese state reporters overseas adds little to what is already known about the countries they are reporting on. Foreign reporters in China however, especially those at the well-resourced big US dailies, are vital at getting under the skin of a habitually secretive and opaque regime.Many of their journalists have spent decades learning the language and building up expertise and contacts. In one fell swoop, their vast intellectual capital has been banished, not just from China, but from Hong Kong as well.While no one will notice that there are fewer Chinese state journalists working overseas, the absence of detailed reporting on China from the three US outlets will be palpable.The ruling party and its leaders have long wanted to avoid the scrutiny of the foreign press. As they emerged from the worst of Covid-19, Chinese leaders were confident enough to do something they have long wanted to do, to throw a large number of reporters out.The proximate cause of the expulsions was retaliation, but make no mistake, the underlying driver is Beijing’s perception of its own growing might."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62d67f59c500479627a825a774964e9b1f3e208c/0_26_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66121c1d7be5ebf9f144a00440232d5d","title":"balconies sites hope coronavirus in pictures","story":"Across Europe and around the world, as people are confined to their apartments, they gather on balconies to applaud medical staff working on the frontline against the virus, as well as perform music, take part in spontaneous flash mobs, or just make the most of the sunshine"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

All in, some informed sources believe that the total cost could be as much as €10 billion – and that is if the crisis lasts only a number of months, and not, as some fear, into next year.Like other countries, Ireland will fund the costs principally through a dramatic increase in borrowing, which will lead to a large deficit this year, and consequent growth in the national debt. However, senior officials have been briefed by the National Treasury Management Agency – which manages the national debt – that Ireland is in a good position to borrow on the bond markets. A reasonably prudent fiscal position in recent years, allied to strong economic growth, has put the Government in a comparatively healthy position entering the crisis.In addition, the announcement by the European Central Bank after an emergency meeting of its governing council on Wednesday night that it would launch a €750 billion bond-buying programme to shore up the European economy and stand behind the public financing needs of its member governments, was greeted with relief in Government circles, with one source describing it as an effective backstop for whatever the costs of the crisis turn out to be.The move also calmed bond markets yesterday and was taken as a signal that the ECB was especially prepared to stand behind Italy, where the large national debt and turbulent politics have often made the country vulnerable to bond market jitters. The ECB’s commitment to buy the country’s bonds led to a sharp fall in the price of borrowing for Italy on Thursday following recent increases in borrowing costs.The ECB move came after announcements in London and Washington that the British and US governments were also preparing huge fiscal provisions to deal with the costs of the public health crisis and to limit the economic damage. All over the EU, governments have been announcing massive increases in public spending to respond to the crisis, which will see a huge economic hit to the world economy. Irish Government sources are hopeful of a strong rebound in the economy when the crisis ends – though few are prepared to estimate when that will be.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4206213.1584564281!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu sets out proposals for close uk ties after brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and the British prime minister’s Europe adviser David Frost in Brussels on March 2nd.

This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4207200.1584641229!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"i realised no virus was strong enough to overcome our mutual loathing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t A painter paints a scene of Horse Guards Parade in central London.

Trafalgar Square was empty apart from a kilted piper among the pigeons outside the National Gallery and a handful of skateboarders below having the time of their lives.Some of the clubs along Pall Mall were closed but others remained open for now, confident that their vast rooms could accommodate all the social distancing their members needed. Inside one of them, two young men in expensively cut suits were passing the afternoon in a couple of armchairs, eating sandwiches and crisps and drinking espresso martinis.The kiosks selling coffee in St James’s Park were still in business but with all the tourists gone, there was no business to be done. Office buildings close to the park were dark now that everyone was working from home and the House of Fraser department store on Victoria Street was deserted – but then it usually is.On the other side of Victoria Station, the toy shop appeared to be thriving, with a stream of well-heeled children walking in past a sign saying “Warning: Children left unattended will be sold to the circus”. The flower shop, which has been in the same spot for almost a century, was also open but the florist said her stock was limited because so little was available at the flower market.Barber shopThe man at the dry cleaners said business was “down, down, down” because people working from home “don’t care what they look like”. Mohammed, the Egyptian barber around the corner, was shaving a customer in the chair by the window but his brother Ahmed told me he was following the advice their father, also a barber, gave them when they were growing up in Alexandria.“You have to be good at cutting hair fast and slow because when it’s busy you need to be quick so nobody has to wait too long but when it’s slow you’ve got to keep them in the chair for as long as you can because nobody likes going into an empty barber shop,” he said.The chemist is the most cheerful shopkeeper in the neighbourhood, boasting of his fresh supply of face masks (five for £10 or a box of 50 for £75) and hand sanitiser (£12 for a small bottle).\u0026nbspThe local newsagent and I have always disliked one another and although my rudeness was originally a response to his, it’s no longer easy to say which of us is worse. We have not made eye contact or exchanged a word for years, instead going through a bad-tempered daily ritual in which I put the newspapers on the counter and he pretends not to notice for a while before grunting out the price, which I pretend at first not to hear.As I thought the other day about keeping him guessing about whether I would pay cash or contactless, I saw how silly and inappropriate this silent feuding was at a time like this. But when I looked up and saw him, his hands wrapped in blue latex gloves and his face in a greasy, malevolent smirk, I realised that no virus was strong enough to overcome our mutual loathing.Italian restaurantOne street over, Wafae was smoking a cigarette outside her Italian restaurant as her chef stood next to her in his whites, his head bowed, shoulders slumped and hands deep in his pockets.\u0026nbsp“We’re like Boris, we want everything to stay open. But look,” she said, waving towards the empty tables inside.Earlier that day, I had met a waiter with a permanent job at a big West End restaurant who was planning to take three weeks’ unpaid leave in the hope that some of his freelance colleagues would be kept on for longer. His impulse was heroic in its generosity but it was already clear that almost all of London’s restaurants would be closed by the weekend, and two days later, I saw a notice on the door of Wafae’s restaurant.“To all our lovely costumers: given the exceptional of the situation caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the most sensible and responsible thing is that we all stay at home…we will reopen on 27th\u0026nbspmars if everything will be fine for all,” it said.The fishmonger at his stall in the weekly market saw no chance that everything will be fine for all, telling me he felt sure things would get much worse.“I have a bad foreboding,” he said.I felt it myself as I passed the Westminster morgue on Horseferry Road, which is being expanded in anticipation of what is to come.

But within four pages, the reader knows its Blackie.The character, who was played by Liam Neeson in an Emmy-nominated television series, is introduced in the original books as “an exceptionally handsome young” Irishman, with thick hair “as black as ebony” and eyes which “resembled great chunks of glittering coal”.He introduces himself to Emma as: “Shane O’Neill’s the name, but the whole world calls me Blackie.”The book will be published by HarperCollins this year, more than 40 years after the original.The publisher said it would open with a “13-year-old Blackie O’Neill facing an uncertain future in rural County Kerry”, orphaned, alone, and preparing to seek a better life in Yorkshire.“There, he learns his trade as a navvy, amid the grand buildings and engineering triumphs of one of England’s most prosperous cities, and starts to dream of greater things,” the synopsis continued.“And then, high on the Yorkshire moors, in the mists of a winter morning he meets a kitchen maid called Emma Harte.”Quoted in the press release for the book in November, Bradford said: “After my beloved husband, Bob Bradford, died in the summer, Blackie O’Neill came back into my head. Bob was by my side at the beginning when I wrote A Woman of Substance and I felt compelled to tell Blackie’s story. “The true Blackie O’Neill will be revealed and fans of Emma Harte will be able to live his tumultuous life with him.”A spokesman for HarperCollins declined to comment. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"front line lewisham gets ventilator","story":"In normal times, it might seem a no-brainer.All five patients being reviewed for potential admission to the intensive care unit - with its precious ventilators - are experiencing difficulty breathing.Having failed to fight off Covid-19 naturally, their immune systems are now beginning to overreact, heralding the possibility of dangerous respiratory complications such as pneumonia, which, if they can’t be controlled, could lead to multiple organ failure.According to one eyewitness, however, on that occasion only one patient was selected.It is not known the basis for the decision at Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust, and bosses insist that all Covid-19 patients who required a ventilator and intensive care have received it.But such are the harrowing decisions now allegedly being faced by the staff as coronavirus spreads around the capital.In common with others across London, what, only a handful of days ago was a normal acute trust, is increasingly resembling into a field hospital in the war against the disease“Very, very difficult choices are having to be made,” said one clinician, a veteran of many NHS winter crises.“Sometimes five new people are being intubated every 12 hours, but not all Covid patients are getting access.The management strongly disputes that patients with Covid-19 have so far been denied access to ventilators.This view from the front line comes in the week NHS leaders revealed they are embarked in a frantic drive to boost their capacity of the life-preserving kits - currently at 8,175 - by nearly 50 per cent.Despite this “war footing effort”, as Boris Johnson phrased it, on Tuesday NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens stopped short of guaranteeing the extra machines would be sufficient to cope with a surge of cases.“We are running out of beds and running out of space,” the staff member said.“It’s got so bad that we’ve had to ship Covid patients out to other trusts.”“The A\u0026ampE department is increasingly resembling a Covid waiting room, so patients with normal emergency problems are being sent to minor injuries.”The problem is not just an apparent lack of space.Boris Johnson’s announcement on Monday that anyone living with a person displaying symptoms of Covid-19 should self-isolate for 14 days is having a dramatic impact on staff numbers.“The moment the announcement was made we started losing more people - they just went home,” said the clinician.“That’s why the fact that we can’t get tested for the disease is so devastating, because we’ve got doctors and nurses who are totally fit and well sitting at home where they can’t help anyone.”Those Covid-19 patients not immediately selected for intensive care treatment are sent to other hastily erected isolation zones within the Lewisham and Woolwich hospitals that comprise the trust, where medics try to control their symptoms using drugs and simple oxygen masks.The pattern allegedly starting to emerge in South East London was chillingly presaged last week, when the Intensive Care Society revealed it was drawing up new guidelines giving doctors greater flexibility to ration lifesaving care to those with the best chance of survival.This was amplified on Tuesday by the medical director for NHS England, Professor Stephen Powis, who indicated that he would be prepared to issue new guidance to doctors giving them extra cover in crisis situations such as being suffered in Northern Italy.As if the responsibility of making these potentially life and death decisions were not a heavy enough burden, the staff at Lewisham and Greenwich say they are fighting coronavirus without appropriate protection from Covid-19.“We don’t feel protected at all,” the clinician said.“Lots and lots of staff don’t have access to the proper FFP3 face masks that are actually fitted, we feel extremely vulnerable and rotas are being hit with people coming down with symptoms.”The experience was echoed yesterday by one of the most senior doctors in the capital, the London director of major trauma, Professor Karin Brohi.“Not a single one of us working in the NHS isn’t a bit scared to go to work,” he said.Although many doctors and nurses at Greenwich and Lewisham are deeply worried about their own safety and their capacity to cope with the tide of patients, some were yesterday trying to stay up-beat.Annie Anderson, a critical care sister posted a picture of staff in protective gear, saying: “This is today’s team this morning just before they entered the isolation zone.“These guys are so amazing and I am so lucky to be part of such an amazing team.“This is real. It’s happening. We don’t know what the next few months will bring but we know we are the best people for the job.”She added: “Follow the advice, stay at home.”Others staff were keen to promote the government’s social distancing strategy - for delaying the peak of cases and allowing the NHS to cope.They tweeted pictures of themselves holding cards reading: “I stayed at work for you. Please stay at home for me!”The stress of adapting hospitals from their day-to-day roles to a pandemic crisis centre is not only taking its toll on clinical staff.It is understood that more than one manager at Lewisham and Greenwich has called in sick with stress in recent days.“The situation is placing extraordinary demands on people,” the staff member said.On Thursday night, the nation’s medical leaders began to acknowledge the pressure faced by London.Professor Chirs Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer, told reporters: “At the moment London from the coronavirus is under pressure but indirectly, but that\u0027s going to go up, he said.The first thing that will get under the greatest pressure will be intensive care and respiratory care system, that\u0027s the first point of real pressure on the NHS that\u0027s going to be happen.”And to be clear: even if everybody does all the things we hope and really, really would ask that they will do, the numbers will continue to go up over the next two weeks because there\u0027s a lag until things start to improve. A spokesman for Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust told The  that Covid-19 patients who required a ventilator and intensive care had received it.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"kids delighted closing schools may not right choice","story":"My six-year-old daughter looked thrilled when I arrived home on Wednesday evening. “Boris Johnson has said there’s no school for months,” she informed me. “I like him.” Her two brothers had worked out that these closures were not good news. One has important exams coming up – and, now, no decent teacher. But we’re all healthy, in a comfortable house and under no threat of eviction: we’re the lucky ones. For a great many others, life in this country has just got a lot harder.Whitehall officials have been war-gaming the response to a pandemic for years. Teams of civil servants are sent into exercises with scenarios ranging from the mild to the terrifying. One of the first questions is whether to close the schools. The arguments are easy to understand: kids are germ sponges, so keeping them apart could stop them infecting others. But then again, school closures are only useful if they last for several weeks: and this has huge social and economic consequences. They should be a last resort.The knock-on effects are huge. One in five British pupils is looked after by a single parent, most of whom work. What do they do when schools close? How many of them will now likely lose the jobs they’ll have balanced with parenthood? Half of NHS hospital doctors and nurses have a school-age child at home. The Prime Minister says he’ll make special arrangements for “key” workers, but we’ll have to see how that works out. A primary in my neighbourhood has told parents not to expect to be sending their pupils back in September, let alone after Easter.History is full of examples of schools closing to thwart the onset of flu, so academics have plenty of evidence to pore over to see whether the harm outweighs the good. One French study suggested that school closures could cut the number of flu cases by 17 per cent and reduce the peak infection by 45 per cent. But studies differ. When Hong Kong closed schools in response to flu deaths in 2008 there was no difference to the flu outbreak there a year before, when classes stayed open. When the NHS pandemic planners surveyed the dozens of studies, they found very mixed messages.No one, however, doubts the harm inflicted by denying children an education – or the unfairness of what will happen now. The wealthier schools are bound to turn their hand to remote learning better than schools from tougher neighbourhoods. Judging by the number of adverts from online tutors flying around yesterday, there is likely to be a boom in digital private education (for those who can afford it). Universities might now offer places to students based on predicted grades, given the absence of actual exams. This will hurt pupils from more disadvantaged schools, who tend to be given more pessimistic grade predictions.Even if the children of “key workers” are kept in school, there’s the rest of the economy to think about. One in six British workers is also the main caregiver at home. If they now give up work, as well you might if your child’s education collapses, it might double the economic damage inflicted by the pandemic. School closures, after all, hurt millions of families, not just those with the virus. Some studies put the cost of school closure at 4 per cent of GDP, or £88 billion. But it isn’t just about money: economic wealth translates into health, fairness and opportunity.That’s why Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, was resisting school closures until a few days ago: the harm they cause is certain, the benefits are not. And given that Covid-19 seems uninterested in children, they’re at no risk to each other. But with countries world over going into the sort of lockdown never imagined in any government pandemic plan – and world markets crashing – the Prime Minister has had to take each hour as it comes. He perhaps didn’t have much choice.No pandemic sticks to a script – which explains the terrifying scenes in Lombardy, with patients left to die because hospitals are overwhelmed. This is precisely what British ministers fear now. The NHS has just 4,100 critical care beds, of which about 3,300 are used at any one time. With such little spare capacity, it wouldn’t take much for an Italian-style overflow. Then NHS hospital managers need to decide their ethical criteria: should the 45-year-old be saved, and the 75-year-old left in the corridor to perish? Such horrific choices might not be far away, especially in London.This is what led to the Prime Minister’s change of tactics earlier this week. The old approach – a careful weighing of the risks and balances – has been replaced by an all-out attempt to slow the flow of cases into hospitals. Hence the city lockdowns, the pensioner quarantines and the school closures: anything like to make a bit of difference is, now, being done. Anything that might save Britain from a Lombardy scenario.Fewer than 200 British lives have (so far) been taken by Covid-19. This compares to the 26,000 Brits who died of flu the year before last and 1,500 who die of respiratory diseases each week. But it’s the trajectory that terrifies ministers: a final British death toll in low six figures would be at the milder end of their expectations. “It’s our job to assume the worst,” says one architect of the UK pandemic response plan. “But we need to be humble about what we still don’t know.”Every day, they look at data from the UK and around the world to see how our future might look: are we on a more modest epidemic curve, or two weeks behind Italy? A Warwick University study last month showed Italy most at risk, given its elderly population. Almost a third of Italian adults live with their parents, with grandparents often looking after children. This solidarity between the generations, a beautiful part of Italian life, might have become a vulnerability – especially when Italy closed its schools.I once tried to take my son out of his primary school a day early. The headmistress refused, telling me in a letter that no airfare saving was worth “a single, irreplaceable day” of his education. She was right. The value of education is incalculable, as is the value of what millions of children will have just lost. In this way, the virus keeps taking its toll.Department for EducationCoronavirus latest news: Everyone in California told to stay at homeComment: Singapore shows how to limit coronavirus without resorting to draconian measuresUS Senator Richard Burr \u0026#39dumped stocks worth $1.6m despite reassuring public about coronavirus\u0026#39India hangs four over \u0026#39Nirbhaya\u0026#39 gang rape on Delhi bus in 2012Coronavirus school closures: when will they close in England, Wales and Scotland - and what does it mean for parents?UK coronavirus lockdown plans: What the Government advice means for youWhere in the UK have cases of coronavirus been detected - and how many are there?What is coronavirus, how did it start and could the outbreak grow bigger?Boris Johnson and Donald Trump talk up potential \u0026#39game-changer\u0026#39 scientific advances on coronavirusFour in 10 Americans struck down by coronavirus are under 55Coronavirus vaccine trials could start in UK within a monthScouts help parents to be prepared for \u0026#39great indoors\u0026#39 during coronavirus lockdownExclusive: London hospital trust becomes first to admit it is turning away coronavirus patientsCoronavirus front line in Lewisham... but who gets the ventilator?Coronavirus: Boris Johnson says \u0026#39we can turn tide in 12 weeks\u0026#39 as UK deaths and cases surgeSurge in migrants crossing channel as French police ert to enforcing coronavirus lockdown, says unionChancellor to unveil wage bailout to help millions through coronavirus crisisHow Boris Johnson will have to sacrifice his liberal principles to save Britain from coronavirusLondon lockdown: City dwellers told to stop going out or elseWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"predicted a level grades wrong four times five","story":"Universities now face a “near impossible” task of deciding which students to offer a place to, vice-chancellors say as they warn that predicted A-level grades are wrong “four out of five times”.The decision to cancel A-levels and GCSEs is a “mistake” and puts students in an unfair position, according to Professor Anthony Seldon, vice-chancellor of Buckingham University and former headmaster of Wellington College.Gavin Williamson, the Education Secretary, insisted that no child would be unfairly penalised as a result and that they will be awarded the grades they “need and deserve”.But vice-chancellors warned on Thursday night that axing A-levels will throw the university admissions system into chaos.“Predicted A-level grades are wrong four times out of five,” said Professor Seldon. “I know this from heading schools for 20 years, and I know from running a university now the dismay that it will cause students, and the disruption to university life.“Have the implications of this really been thought through fully, or is an over-stretched government taking decisions of massive proportions on the wing?”A Conservative Party source said that the most likely outcome is that teachers will be asked to come up with a grade based on mock exam results, coursework and the huge amount of data that is collected by schools on each child.You would expect that the final grade won\u0027t be too far off their predicted grade, but teachers will be able to factor in their knowledge of whether a child has, for example, been working really hard after getting a disappointing result in their mocks,” the source added.Professor Sir Steve Smith, vice-chancellor of Exeter University, said that relying on predicted grades rather than actual exam marks creates “winners and losers”.The “biggest single problem” is that A-level grades are often over-predicted by schools, meaning that universities make more offers than they have places.“We might make around 30,000 offers for 6,000 places. Of course not everyone accepts the place and not everyone who accepts gets the grades,” he said.“This year we won’t have the normal sifting process after results day. How will we deal with that? There is quite a lot to play for.”It is understood that universities are preparing to expand the number of students they admit this year and that the inevitable shortfall in international students this year will ease pressure on places.An Oxford University admissions source agreed that predicted grades are “not deemed to be very useful”.“It is said the independent schools tend to over predict to make the fee paying parents happy and the state schools might under predict,” he said.“For us we are in the happy position that we have interviewed, we know them a bit better and we may just have to live by that. But for other universities it is much more problematic, all they have is the paper candidate.”A study from 2016 found that just one in six (16 per cent) of university applicants achieve the exam grade points that they were predicted to achieve by teachers or lecturers, based on their best three A-level results.The study, by University College London’s Institute of Education, found that students are likely to receive more generous estimates on their performance.Overall, 75 per cent of applicants were over-predicted - meaning their results were predicted to be higher than they actually achieved. Researchers also concluded that around nine per cent of applicants had results under-predicted.A separate study from 2017 found that bright students from poorer backgrounds are more likely than their wealthier peers to be given predicted A-level grades lower than they actually achieve.The former Ucas chief Mary Curnock Cook has previously suggested that teachers are intentionally bumping up students\u0027 predicted A-level grades to help them win places at top universities.Professor Paul Boyle, vice-chancellor at Swansea University urged ministers to “put some thought into this as soon as possible.”“We are going to have to think carefully about all the implications of this,” he said. “How we will manage the large number of students we have made offers to? This is such a radical change compared to what we are used to.”Alistair Jarvis, the chief executive of the vice-chancellor membership group Universities UK, warned that no students should miss out on places at university because of the challenges posed by the pandemic.He added: We await further information following the announcement that school exams will not go ahead.We are committed to working closely with the government, Ucas, examination regulators and school leaders on the practical implications of this and hope there will be clarity on this for students, parents, teachers and university admissions staff as soon as possible.Clare Marchant, chief executive of Ucas, said that “flexibility” in university admissions will be “enhanced and extended to deal with the coronavirus outbreak”.She added: “We are confident that our team and systems are ready to adapt throughout the spring and summer.“As soon as any changes are confirmed, students will be emailed to explain how this might affect them, so it’s important they keep their email address up to date in Track.”Schools have been ordered to shut on Friday for all but the most vulnerable and the children of “key workers”, which will include NHS workers, delivery drivers and the police.But on Thursday evening headteachers were still waiting to be told by the Government exactly which professions will be classed as “key workers” and how the system will work in practise.Schools have started to send out surveys to parents asking them what their job is and whether they would like to take up the offer of a school place. But there was confusion among families about whether one or both parents needed to be a key worker to qualify for a school place, and no official advice has been published on this so far.The Daily  understands that school places will operate on a priority system. Children who have both parents classed as “key workers” or those from a single-parent family where their one parent is a key worker will be at the top of the list. Lower down will be children who have one parent classed as a key worker, and another parent who could look after them.“If seems likely the situation goes on for many weeks, we will be able to take a more strategic look at evening it out and refine the processes,” said Julie McCulloch of the Association of School and College Leaders. “But getting things up and running for next week, there will inevitably be some compromises.”She said that school are “to an extent doing this blind” until they are given more detailed official advice, adding that headteachers “urgently” need a definition of key workers.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"private jets pour marthas vineyard rich flee coronavirus","story":"Residents of the elite US holiday hideaways Martha\u0027s Vineyard and Nantucket have complained they are facing a wave of wealthy coronavirus refugees arriving in private jets.Amid the influx there were fears of tiny local hospitals being overwhelmed by an outbreak, and shortages in local shops where food has to be delivered by ferry.The two islands off Cape Cod, Massachusetts, are summer colonies where rich Americans from New York and elsewhere have second homes.Barack Obama bought a house on Martha\u0027s Vineyard last year and Bill Clinton has regularly holidayed there.

Kennedy Jr died in a small plane crash off the island\u0027s coast.Brian Packish, a local councillor, said private jets had been pouring in to the small airport on Martha\u0027s Vineyard in recent days.Gordon Healy, an assistant manager at the local animal shelter, told the Boston Globe: If you don’t need to be here, if you don’t have a reason to be here, it doesn’t make sense for you to be here. I don’t speak for everyone on the island, but I think it’s a pretty common belief.John Christensen, a local official, added: I’ve never seen grocery carts so full.Officials warned that the island\u0027s population was mostly elderly, and vulnerable to the virus.Those on Nantucket asked the Massachusetts emergency management agency to reduce the number of people allowed to travel there.The local hospital said it only had 14 beds and no intensive care unit, meaning victims would have to be airlifted to Boston if there was an outbreak.However, wealthy people who have second homes on the islands rejected suggestions they should stay on the mainland, and said they would practice proper social distancing.One former US ambassador heading to Nantucket, told the Boston Globe: A lot of people are retreating, whether they’re going to the Cape or New Hampshire or some more isolated place that’s off the beaten path.It’s hard to know to do the right thing in these times, but this feels like the right thing.Further north in Maine, the island of North Haven 12 miles off the coast, voted to ban visitors and seasonal residents, who spend the winter in warmer states like Florida.The ruling, which has since been watered down, was intended to put a brake on the traditional summer invasion which adds around 2,000 to the year-round population of 355.Gordon Bubar, 74, who runs the local grocery, said: We don’t have a hospital.

Mr King claims almost every unionist he knows agreed with his argument, although they were unwilling to say so publicly.“We are moving inexorably to a united Ireland position. Unionists should not be burying their heads in the sand about this,” Mr King tells The  in one of Belfast’s most famous watering holes, The Garrick, close to the city centre.Unionism has suffered a number of setbacks over the past few months. The Brexit Withdrawal Agreement has put a de facto regulatory and customs border down the Irish sea and Sinn Fein, the former political wing of the IRA, won the popular vote in the recent general election in the south of Ireland. Both of these have put question marks over the future place of Northern Ireland as part of the UK.Most unionists, whether publicly or privately, are in agreement that it is not a question of if but when a border poll takes place.In the next few weeks the Belfast Court of Appeal will deliver a judgement in a potentially landmark case. If Raymond McCord, a victims’ rights activist prevails, then he will force the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to publish the exact criteria that will trigger a border poll. There is a growing consensus on both parts of the island that it will happen within the next five-to-ten years.Unionism is split on what to do next. Mr King is on one end of the spectrum. He has joined the SDLP, a moderate nationalist party, and warns that unionists must engage with discussions on unity or risk getting swept away by the tide of history.His argument is that the rationale for loyalism has been undermined by the British government. “What is the point of being a loyalist if that loyalty isn’t reciprocated.” He cites the Irish protocol in the withdrawal agreement as evidence the London would sell out the province if it is in its interests.He adds that the £10bn subvention from the exchequer every year need to keep the “the most troublesome part of the empire” afloat will strengthen the British government’s resolve to sever ties with the province. He says that unionists should engage now with events such as ‘Future Ireland’ - a forum set up to discuss in what circumstances unity would make sense – to ensure that “Northern Ireland’s rich culture and traditions” are fully protected in a new dispensation.On the opposite end of the spectrum is the Reverend Mervyn Gibson, a Presbyterian minister and the current grand secretary of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland. Speaking at the Orange museum in the heart of loyalist east Belfast, Mr Gibson, 62, says there will be a border poll in his lifetime but it has no chance of passing. He says his commitment to the union is not about economics, although that is a compelling argument, it is about cultural identity. “I am British and there is no place for me or people like me in a united Ireland.”Mr Gibson says that he has no intention of engaging with any discussions on a united Ireland.“If the future is a pre-determined outcome of a united Ireland, then that is not engagement. That is working out the terms of surrender.”He adds that unionism has to broaden its appeal and reach out to Catholics and ethnic minorities who want to remain part of the UK.Underlining the pace of change in Northern Ireland, Mr Gibson says that even though he is a Christian and “my moral values would be seen as outdated these days but they are still my moral values but we need members of the LGBT community to support the union as well. We need a range of people to support union. We don’t always need to agree on moral issues, but we can agree on supporting the union.”The threat of dissident paramilitary violence is ever present in the province. Last month it emerged that the Real IRA had tried to explode a bomb on a ferry going from Belfast to Stranraer to coincide with Brexit day on January 30th.Mr King warns that if a border poll is rushed and the result is a crude majority in favour of unification, but the complex constitutional, economic, cultural and security issues remain unresolved, then it threatens to plunge the province back into armed conflict. This is a view that is shared widely in politicians on both sides of the border.Northern Ireland’s troubled past is very evident on the streets of Belfast. People are willing to give their views on a united Ireland, but not their names and background. The issue is too sensitive.“I was against Brexit. I want to be part of Europe. Freedom to travel is a big thing for me. That is one thing that would make me favour a united Ireland. I don’t think it would happen for a long time though,” a female in her late twenties says.A middle aged man who worked as a lawyer says a united Ireland won’t happen in his lifetime. “I think what Sinn Fein is doing is very dangerous. Too many people don’t want a united Ireland. All this talk of a border poll is going to be very destabilising. Stormont is just back up and running. We have a lot of problems we need to sort out.”As Northern Ireland prepares to celebrate its centenary in May 2021, the future is more uncertain than anytime in the past. A next census which will be released next year is expected to show a majority of Catholics in the province for the first time.However, privately many unionists say that the future position of Northern Ireland will be settled by how Brexit unfolds and whether Scotland eventually secedes from the UK. Of these, the position of Scotland is seen as a gamechanger.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/03/13/19/for-rent.jpg","title":"workers renters and the selfemployed need more government help through coronavirus","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Renters will be protected from eviction under new legislation but could still go heavily into arrears as a result of Covid-19.

The value of sterling also slumped by some 4 per cent against the dollar on Wednesday, hitting its lowest level since the collapse of 1985.In a statement the bank attributed this to investors seeking the safety and liquidity of shorter term debt.“Over recent days, and in common with a number of other advanced economy bond markets, conditions in the UK gilt market have deteriorated as investors have sought shorter-dated instruments that are closer substitutes for highly liquid central bank reserves,” it said.In a conference call with journalists after the decision the bank’s new governor Andrew Bailey said that markets had been “bordering on disorderly”, persuading the bank to restart its asset purchases.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The estate agent said it had apologised “unreservedly” to the tenant and offered them compensation.“We are taking the Covid-19 outbreak extremely seriously and we have reiterated to our staff that whatever the situation, anyone’s self-isolation should not be interrupted,” Foxtons said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The crash mirrored the fortunes of traditional markets and came amid\u0026nbspglobal economic turmoil caused by the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic.Bitcoin’s recovery saw it return\u0026nbspabove $6,000 on Thursday, having briefly traded as low as $4,000 a few days earlier. Other major cryptocurrencies, including ether, XRP and bitcoin cash, also saw significant price rises as investors returned capital into digital assets.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Bitcoin’s crash was a knock-on effect of the stock market collapse, as panicked investors sold any assets they had for cash, so they could pay off urgent debts to their broker,” cryptocurrency expert and author Glen Goodman told\u0026nbspThe Independent.The coronavirus outbreak, which has seen more than 230,000 confirmed cases and close to 10,000 deaths around the world, has caused chaos across global stock markets and seen major currencies like the pound fall to their lowest levels in decades.There has not been an economic downturn of this magnitude since the 2008 financial crisis and some central banks are already considering similarly drastic measures in order to prevent complete collapse.\u0026nbspThe Reserve Bank of Australia and the European Central Bank are\u0026nbspreportedly considering emergency monetary policies, including quantitative easing. This would see the banks artificially increase the money supply by essentially printing new money.The finite supply of bitcoin – no more than 21 million will ever exist – has led some investors to consider it a so-called safe-haven asset, similar to gold.“For the longer term, investors are now starting to worry about central banks cranking up the money printing machines,” Mr Goodman said.\u0026nbsp”This could send investors to assets that can’t be endlessly printed, like gold and bitcoin.”Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

those with a higher than normal body temperature - because of infection with Covid-19.However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever.\u0026nbspThis is because it takes between two\u0026nbspand 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever.5 Should I spray alcohol or chlorine on myself to kill Covid-19?Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body and spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes, such as your eyes and mouth.Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful for disinfecting surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations.Similarly, there is also no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline can protect people from infection by the new coronavirus.6 Will a pneumonia vaccine protect me against the virus?Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against Covid-19.The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine, which researchers are currently working on trying to develop.Although these vaccines are not effective against Covid-19, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health.7 What about antibiotics?Antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria, and should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment for Covid-19 - which is a virus.However, if someone is hospitalised for the new coronavirus, they may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The government needs to protect the right to life and at the same time consider the impact on human rights as it strives to protect the country in this unprecedented time.”The committee said quarantine and self-isolation had an impact on the right to liberty and right to life, while a potential ban on public gatherings affected freedom of assembly and association, and school closures hit the right to education.Restricting people’s ability to work has a “disproportionate impact” on the self-employed and other groups, while the impact on small businesses engages the “right to peaceful enjoyment of one’s possessions”.The committee said that any future moves to prioritise or ration healthcare must be “justifiable and non-discriminatory”, and that the prevention of timely funerals could violate freedom of religion.Members said the government must consider the wellbeing of people held in prisons, immigration detention centres and mental health units, as well as the right to\u0026nbspjustice – after new trials of more than three days were stopped.The committee warned that homeless people and those in temporary accommodation will find it difficult to comply with any formal instruction to self-isolate.It called for evidence to be submitted on the steps taken to ensure the government’s plans comply with human rights and to address the impact on groups that will be disproportionately affected by emergency measures.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

These iniduals will not have a right to live in Britain after the deadline of June 2021, unless they successfully appeal the decision.The number remains proportionately small, as there have been nearly 3 million applications processed overall, but it marks a considerable jump from the previous monthly figures, when just seven people had been refused.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAt that point the refusals were all on the grounds of criminality, but most of the latest refusals were due to issues around eligibility –\u0026nbspusually because the applicant has been unable to provide the relevant\u0026nbspdocumentary\u0026nbspevidence.While the number is still proportionately low, campaigners have raised alarm at the sudden increase, and it is likely to prompt concern around difficulties more vulnerable people face when obtaining evidence.Charity helping children in care stay in UK has to stop taking casesEU settlement scheme delays leave people unable to get jobsNine out of 10 EU settlement scheme appeals successful, data showsWithout physical proof of our status, EU citizens like me live in fearThe Home Office said officials had made every attempt to obtain the necessary evidence before refusing applications, and that decisions to refuse were not taken lightly and signed off at a high level.Maike Bohn, co-founder of campaign group\u0026nbspthe3million, told The Independent she was concerned by the fact that while there had been no refusals on eligibility grounds before February 2020, there was now a sharp rise.“This is hard to explain. We urgently need more explanation from the Home Office as to why those cases have been refused,” she said. “It is concerning that as soon as the UK left the EU we see people being refused settled status.”Christopher Desira, immigration solicitor at Seraphus law firm, said there were likely to be more and more refusals beyond criminality grounds, which may worry a lot of people in uncommon family arrangements, which tend to be the most complex applications.\u0026nbspHe also raised alarm over the gaps in free outreach and advice services that are likely to form due to the coronavirus outbreak, which may cause problems for those receiving requests for further information from the Home Office, but not know how to respond, and called on the Home Office to pause any refusals until the emergency is over.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So in those areas, it’s OK to reopen schools, even now.”Singapore reported 47 new cases on Wednesday, but of those 33 were imported – including 30 returning Singapore residents, taking the country’s total to 313.The imported cases had travelled to European countries including the UK, Turkey, France, Germany, Austria, Croatia and Switzerland, as well as India, Indonesia, the Philippines and the US.South Korea, which has been widely praised for its handling of the outbreak through aggressive testing measures, has reduced its rate of new infections to double digits in recent days. On Wednesday, that jumped to 152 new cases. At the peak of its outbreak, it was reporting upwards of 850 new cases a day.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I can laugh now but it resulted in me leaving that school that I was in.I was lonely at the time. But the timelines kind of fit perfectly with me leaving school and Unitas opening.”Slowly but surely, Samiya started venturing into the facilitys other rooms, trying her hand at art or taking part in the games played in the sports hall.Over several months, she felt more herself again.Everyone is so lovely, really and truly, I’m not just saying this, Samiya says. It’s in the name. Its the unity, you know Like all OnSide Youth Zones, Unitas was set up to give opportunities to kids in deprived areas that werent previously open to them.Its name, chosen by young people, comes from the Latin motto of Barnet — unitas efficit ministerium or unity accomplishes services.Child poverty in the nearby wards of Burnt Oakand Colindaleare higher than the national average of  per cent.Woodhouse and Childs Hill also have a third or more of their children living in poverty after housing costs are considered, according to data from the End Child Poverty Coalition.Taylor Dawson is another regular whos been coming to the centre since last summer — something which he never thought hed do.He used to be so anxious that he would never leave his house unless he absolutely had to - but Unitas changed him.The -year-old now helps out with the centres sessions run on Sundays for people with additional needs.“Some can come in with autism, ADHD, anything on the spectrum, Taylor tells Sun Online.“I have additional needs myself. It helps really well, so I know how to help the other kids as well.But its not just others who Taylor is helping — hes helping himself.“It’s helped really well with my confidence, because I never used to leave my house because I’ve got anxiety, Taylor said.So I’d never leave, I’d never go out with my friends. The only place I would go is the shop and back.Taylor loves that he now has a fruitful alternative - and hes noticed a dference in the lives of others around him too.All the kids who used to roam the streets, that attitude is not nice, he said.My mum won’t put down the picture of me with him, Latoya McLean says of a photo of her with Prince Harry.The heartwarming snap was taken last year after Latoya received the Giving Back award on stage at the Royal Albert Hall during the inaugural OnSide Awards.Her prize was for young people that have gone above and beyond for their youth centre and their community”.The -year-old has been involved with Unitas since the planning stages and is now one of the centres leading figures.For Latoya, joining Unitas was all about transcending the expectations that other people had for her and her peers.Young people are seen in such a bad perspective that I think they live up to what’s expected of them, Latoya said.They never push past that boundary. Society makes boxes and expects every young person to tick it.So I guess thats why I wanted to join the group — to reach my true potential and find what I was meant to be.As members enter Unitas, theyre searched for blades and other weapons with metal detectors as they step over the threshold.Its for their own protection — one of the centres main aims is to offer kids a safe place to go.For some of the people that we work with, they might have experienced quite traumatic events growing up in their childhood — things like domestic violence, abuse, Tony says.Some young people, they’re trying to move away from a le on the road and certain types of criminality.The existence of centres in deprived areas can also have positive effects for the wider area.Members can get a hot meal for £ — full-sized portions of fish and chips are on offer during Sun Onlines visit.One parent commented to one of my staff colleagues that their food bill had come down signicantly through the course of the week because they have three or four children who come here,” Tony says. “Beyond that, local residents comment on how young people feel better about the area that they live in, that the regeneration of the wider area has made them feel more confident — and you see that in their behaviour.”A local that can attest to that is Pat Furniss, , who grew up near where Unitas now stands.The mum-of-two, who used to work as a teacher, is now on the youth centres reception and is treated as a de facto auntie by the kids.I just love seeing and hearing the laughter, I think,” Pat says. She used to hear children laughing in the streets outside her home where she grew up — but she doesn’t hear it there so much anymore. Pat added: “I actually gave up working full-time to come and work here in the evenings.And as I say to the kids, I ain’t going nowhere! I’ll be here with my zimmer frame.” The kind of remarkable changes that Tony and Pat have witnessed arent unique to Unitas in Barnet.Wherever an OnSide Youth Centre Opens, remarkable things start to happen.Antisocial behaviour in the area drops between  and  per cent almost instantly, within a month or two,” says John Roberts, Chairman of OnSides Executive Board.Truancy drops and academic rates go up for the kids that attend the youth centre — none of this is rocket science.John thinks the benefits of his youth centres are so urgent that every town in the UK should have one, in the same way that it would have a school or a GP surgery.Many of the young people who currently benefit from its centres feel a lack of societal interest could be because their generation has been misunderstood and looked down upon by others.I just think this youth centre is building up the next generation to change how society feels, Latoya says.The future is safe, she adds.We’re not going to destroy what has been built before us.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And you’d also hope they take more care than they did with the actual production, which started to betray a “will-this-do ” attitude with almost its first caption of the night.“Dermot Munaghan.” And the next one: “Colston Smith.” .A foretaste of what was to come, because the event had technically unravelled within the first hour when Lineker had to introduce a comedy sketch about VAR and the  World Cup final.First it appeared, then it vanished. So Lineker explained the punchline: VAR had not just found in England’s favour it had decided to award the  World Cup to Scotlandand Euro  to Wales.Then the sketch suddenly reappeared again and took six minutes to reach its bloody, teeth-pulling conclusion: “I’m going to change my name to Jamie VAR-dy.”In such circumstances, you can sit and hope the rest of Sport Relief moves, inspires and thrills with a perfect blend of laughter, compassion and entertainment.And I can also hope Scotland are going to win the next World Cup. It ain’t going to happen.Sport Relief is never ever over quickly, ’cos there are a whole load of BBC formats to be put through the ringer, like Line Of Duty, and far too much dancing, featuring everyone from Lineker and McGuinnes to a “social media influencer”, called “HRVY”, which wasn’t another spelling mistake. I think he’s just an RSHOL.At ious other points in this back-of-a-fag-packet evening: Hockey player Sam Quek took , football penalties against a short fat bloke, from point-blank range, and contrived to miss more than a quarter of them. Mel Giedroyc farted on a Question Of Sport special. Rylan accused Romesh Ranganathan of being over-exposed, before playing Andy Murray at crazy golf. And they flagged up an Action Line number, for people who were feeling “emotionally vulnerable”, after the Killing Steves parody, which may have been the most benevolent gesture in the event’s history.What really irks about Sport Relief, though, is that, evencompassion fatigue has never been more of a problem, they’ve decided it’s a triumph before it’s broadcast and the “Best Bits” Sunday show is all ready to go.Corporate backing also means there’s little risk of them not beating the previous total either, which, I hope, doesn’t sound like I’m diminishing the sincere efforts of the public.If there’s one thing I’ll remember about Sport Relief , however, it’s the contribution of David Beckham, who, infor a y advertorial for his new MLS franchise and some crashing product placement , offered two entire people the chance to attend an Inter Miami game and win a shirt signed by such global talents as Lewis Morgan and A J DeLaGarza, who’s played  entire games for Guam.There are moments when the generosity and humanity of celebrities simply overwhelms me.This wasn’t one of those moments.Bloke.CHANNEL  seemed to have all bases covered for its hugely entertaining new dating show Five Guys A Week, at least in terms of complete bellends.So, crammed into a semi-detached house in St Albans, hoping to win the heart of its owner Amy, it had: Christian, whose job “isn’t as glamorous as it sounds” . Uber-woke Glen, from accounts. A stuntman called Michael, who seemed to have mistaken the show for SAS: Who Dares Wins and voluntarily withdrew on day two. Mad, goggle-eyed surfer Trystan, who appeared to be casing the joint for a “kill room”. And the lowest form of le known to any single thirtysomething man – the bloke with the acoustic guitar, Scott, who used to be a bank manager, but now earns a living as a country and western singer and will be performing under the stage name Johnny Cashpoint,he’s got an ounce of sense.The five were chosen for their ability to get right on the viewers’ nerves rather than real boyfriend potential, obviously.And it made for a cracking hour of TV, because they all competitively fancied the pants off Amy, who looked like a younger and much hotter Camilla Parker Bowles,you can imagine such a thing.The show’s greatest strength, of course, is also its biggest format failing, as I’d imagine no one wanted any of them to win.In the event, however, it came down to a straight fight between the lesser of two evils and, probably wisely, Amy chose cocky Christian, who’s looking to whisk her off for breakfast in France, ahead of grovelling Glen, who, rather than looking for “the Michelle Obama to my Barack”, should probably be aiming for the Michelle Collins to his Ian Beale.Five Guys A Week, C, tonight, .pm.The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “What caused the cancellation of six Wimbledon championships in the s ”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Which city in north-east England shares its common name with the body of a ship ”Spin To Win, Phillip Schofield: “What Saturday night TV show is Anton du Beke most famous for ”Hunted, Dan: “Who painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel ”LISA NANDY wasn’t born stupid. She volunteered to be, by standing for Labour Party leader.It means noisily backing every woke cause of the day, until their interests collide, as they did spectacularly on last Tuesday’s Good Morning Britain, where Piers Morgan hit her with two innocuous-sounding questions.“Are babies born either male or female ” and “Would you be happyUsain Bolt and Floyd Mayweather self-identied as women, spent a year having testosterone treatment and competed against women ”Correct answers: Yes and no.But Lisa couldn’t say that for fear of offending either the transgender or feminist lobbies.So instead she blathered, lied, evaded, shouted, demanded an apology from Piers , accused him of laughing and describing transgender people as “grotesque”and at one point muttered: “I don’t know what . . . I don’t know what, well, you know, I don’t know what.”Others would’ve let her off the hook at that point, as she was almost crying at her own stupidity by then. Chunk didn’t.To his eternal credit he ignored two ad breaks and kept up the pressure for a spellbinding  minutes that only ended when Nandy offered to settle the issue of whether Floyd Mayweather should be able to box women by “setting up a commission”.To which Piers responded: “It’s not a commission issue, it’s a common sense issue.”But that, as a wise man once said, is the problem with common sense, Piers. It’s not all that common.Ian Wright: “At this stage, I think three points is three points.”Jamie Redknapp: “Switching off from football is always beneficial sometimes.”Piers Morgan effectively ending Lisa Nandy’s Labour leadership bid on TV’s most consistently entertaining show, Good Morning Britain.Saturday night eye balm from BBC’s Ireland: Edge Of The World. Larry David ending up in the “ugly section” of Tiato’s restaurant, on Curb Your Enthusiasm.Sky’s Breeders managing to make a comedy about children bearable.And John Humphrys’ opening curveball on Saturday’s Celebrity Mastermind: “Name ” “Bez.” “Occupation ” Pass.This Morning, Holly Willoughby: “What should a ‘support neighbour’ look like  ’Cos my mum’s older than me.”Andyour mum isn’t older than you, self-isolate immediately.THIS week’s winner is Future Stewie, from Family Guy, and Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty.All those self-defined “experts” whose coronavirus response is framed not by their humanity or expertise but the desperate need to be proved right.Every selfish moron in the country being filmed panic-buying toilet rolls.Firebrand left-wing stand-up Guz Khan taking the gig economy advertising shilling from Uber Eats.The comically awful use of Photoshopped throwback pictures in BBC drama The Split.And the never-ending queue of fantasists and egomaniacs at E’s Sex Clinic, like third person-speaking Drew, who announced: “I’m not having vanilla sex. That’s not what the Drew brand is about. Le’s too short, man.” The shorter the better . . . man.The Sex Clinic, Matt: “I think I need to learn to love myself.”Five Guys A Week, Glen: “My talents aren’t obvious.

They are resilient. You aren’t going to like it, but you’ll get through it.“You can compare it to the Blitz. People got through the Blitz. It was very stressful but they did it.”My elderly mother lives just a few roads away from me and, like so many with similarly vulnerable relatives, I’m making sure she’s OK.“Just pop a tin of Spam through the letterbox, and I’ll be fine,” she joked in reference to her time growing up during World War Two.But yesterday, three of her immediate neighbours — one of whom she’s never met — put notes through her door to say she should give them a callshe needed anything.In times of such crisis, our first thought is naturally of ourselves and our immediate loved ones.But it seems the upsideof the world slowing down and re-grouping might be that, no longer distracted by the busyness of our normal working days, we will “look up” and “reach out”, as they say in business circles, to those in our communities who might need help.There are plenty of people who already do sterling work in their area, but the onslaught of the coronavirus will perhaps lead to everyone now doing their bit.Quite right too. But the onus can’t solely rest on the shoulders of iniduals, so it’s only right the Government has stepped up to offer some practical help to businesses that will suffer throughout the coming weeks and months.Boris Johnson’s advice that people shouldn’t go to pubs cafes theatres etc is understandable in health terms, but will leave businesses facing a critical downturn in custom through no fault of their own.Yesterday, London restaurateur James Chiaini urged him to “crack open the war chest” and allow local businesses to stay afloat while simultaneously channelling efforts towards helping out in their immediate communities, and it seems that new Chancellor Rishi Sunak has listened.In James’s case, he has staff on hand and lots of food supplies, so instead of shutting down because there are no customers, he and other restaurants across the country could potentially now operate a batch-cooking and delivery service for those in need.Equally, the skill sets of many other businesses can be channelled into providing much-needed, state-funded help where it’s required.And the Government shouldn’t stop there. It should repurpose certain facilities too.Last week, it was reported that the £million Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre in Loughborough, Leics, is currently seriously underused because only current personnel can access it and only  have done so in the past  months.Madness. At the very least, it should be thrown open to all injured veterans who currently have to go through the overstretched NHS.Or how about temporarily repurposing it as a treatment centre for anyone who could benefit from its facilities, thereby alleviating some of the pressure on local hospitals The Government is clearly in uncharted territory right now because it is dealing with an unprecedented situation.But a continuation of joined-up thinking on how best to get us through this critical phase in our history will ensure that Britain’s enviable “Blitz spirit” is encouraged and kept strong for as long as it needs to be.PRINCE Harry is now back behind the closed doors of his rented Canadian mansion, licking his wounds after his public humiliation at the hands of phone pranksters.During a chat with what he thought was climate change activist Greta Thunberg and her father, Harry pledged his support to the non-existent island of “Chunga-Changa” and failed to question why the hoaxers wanted to ship penguins to the North Pole when they’re actually native to the South Pole.Poor Harry.Still, it perhaps explains why, despite attending Eton, he got D at geography A level.Indeed, on all our faces in these challenging times.Heartfelt congratulations to her and husband Chris.FORMER All Saints star Nicole Appleton has given birth to her second child, a girl called Skipper, at the age of .“After hiding my pregnancy for the last nine months – which was so dficult and keeping her a secret from all my friends – I can finally announce our incredible news!” she wrote on Instagram.Fascinating. It’s one thing wearing a big coat out in public, but how do you hide a growing bump from “friends” Has Nicole, whose boyfriend is Stephen Haines, been in pre-emptive self-isolation for the past few months Or is it simply that her petite frame and enviably taut stomach muscles meant she just looked like the rest of us after a big meal Personally speaking, by month seven I looked like I had a medicine ball stuffed up my frock.STORMZY reportedly ripped up his travel plans after meeting Victoria’s Secret model Yasmine Aisha Khala Holmgren backstage at a gig in Stockholm.The pair are said to have holed up in a hotel room for two days where, according to a friend of the grime star, they wanted to spend “quality time” together.That’s one way of putting it.A NEW biography about former Commons Speaker John Bercow claims that he didn’t speak to a female aide for the entirety of a nine hour flight – because he was furious that his toothpaste had been confiscated at airport security.Quite what it had to do with her is anyone’s guess.But one imagines she was grateful for the prolonged period of peace.HANNAH SMITH, a -year-old mum of one, has been handed a suspended sentence after admitting the crime of harbouring a criminal.Her boyfriend, violent robber Luke Harvey, scaled the wall of HMP Sudbury in Derbyshire, where Hannah was waiting to drive him to Skegness for a weekend away.They were later pulled over by police and Harvey, , had ten months added to the -year sentence he received in .Leicester Crown Court was told that the couple had now split up.Presumably, actually spending time together proved too much.HERE is yet another photograph of the singer and actress Jenner Lopez looking sensational at .

Spiegel, co-editor-in-chief of the American Journal of Gastroenterology, said: In this study, Covid- patients with digestive symptoms have a worse clinical outcome and higher risk of mortality compared to those without digestive symptoms, emphasising the importance of including symptoms like diarrhoea to suspect Covid- early in the disease course before respiratory symptoms develop.Despite this revelation, people should still be vigilant in looking out for the primary symptoms of coronavirus including a dry cough and high temperature - as Covid- primarily attacks the lungs and respiratory system.Some patients may also have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose or a sore throat - but these are usually mild and begin gradually.Developing these symptoms does not necessarily mean you have the illness and they are similar to other illnesses, such as the common cold or flu.Some people will not develop all of these symptoms -  and some might not even show symptoms at all, experts say.Sir Patrick Vallance, the UKs chief scientic adviser, said: It looks quite likely that there is some degree of asymptomatic transmission.There’s definitely quite a lot of transmission very early in the disease when there are very mild symptoms.Around one out of every six who gets Covid- become seriously ill and develops dficulty breathing, according to the World Health Organisation .Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are at most risk developing serious illness.This can include pneumonia and swelling in the lungs, which can make it hard for the lungs to pass oxygen into the bloodstream - leading to organ failure and death.Severe pneumonia can kill people by causing them to drown in the fluid flooding their lungs.People with fever, cough and dficulty breathing should seek medical attention, the WHO says.The virus is believed to be transmitted between people through droplets spread from coughing and touching or shaking hands.While sneezing is not a symptom of the new coronavirus, its also thought to be a way that droplets can be spread.Tap to see where COVID- is near youSymptoms are thought to appear between two and  days.New research has found that the average incubation period of Covid- is . days.A study by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in the US found that almost allof those who develop symptoms appeared to do so within . days of infection.Experts say there is little evidence to suggest that people can spread the virus without showing symptoms.Currently, there is no vaccine to protect people against the virus.Antibiotics do not help, as they do not work against viruses - only bacteria.The NHS says that treatment aims to relieve the symptoms while your body fights the illness.Those who are infected will need to stay in isolation away from other people until they have recovered.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There will be people age  and up.They do have to be careful eventhey think that theyre young and healthy.The warnings come amid reports in Italy and France of young people being hospitalised and needing intensive care.Butthat many younger people are being hospitalised, that means there are a lot of young people in the community that are walking around with the infection.So far,  people have died after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK and tens of thousands of people are thought to be infected.Experts are desperately trying to develop a vaccine for the new illness, but warn that it could take months.When asked about dferent strains of the virus, Prof Whitty said with a strong caveat of scientic speculation that it was expected to mutate.He said there was a chance that the virus could mutate around the vaccine, but that some mutations could be actually useful.Smaller mutations... help to track family trees of the virus, said Prof Whitty, adding that this would help scientists to understand and tackle the disease.Sir Patrick added that the UK was absolutely world-class in addressing viral mutations.Tap to see where COVID- is near you To receive our Covid- newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Meanwhile, analysis from Edge Health suggested the NHS will face substantial pressures on critical care beds as the outbreak continues.According to their modelling, there will be a shortfall of , beds in the Midlands at peak Covid- ventilator demand, while the south west has the fewest critical care beds and will need a % increase, or ,, to meet demand.Schools across the UK were preparing to close to all pupils except those of key workers in a bid to halt the diseases spread.Mr Johnson said measures taken so far were helping to slow the spread of the disease, but he did not rule out tougher measures being enforced down the line.The PM also did not rule out stricter controls being imposed on London ahead of the rest of the nation, with fears of a lockdown being imposed like in other nations.Transport for Londonannounced up to  Tube stations would be closed on Thursday and a reduced service would run on the rails from Friday.London Mayor Sadiq Khan warned Londoners they should not be travelling unless they really, really have to, but insisted the network must remain open to aid frontline health workers.Meanwhile, the number of troops in a heightened state of readiness will be doubled to , while Reserves were to be placed on standby to support public services in a new Covid support force.The Ministry of Defence was also planning to put  military personnel into training to drive oxygen tankers around the country to support the NHS.A number of supermarkets are continuing to limit the number of products customers can buy in stores as they try to battle the huge demand from the Covid- outbreak.Panicked shoppers spent an extra £. million on items for stockpiling including medicines, handwash and canned food in the first week of March compared to the previous week as pandemic panic set in, reported The Grocer citing data from Nin Scantrack.Mr Hancocks emergency legislation will also include plans to hand police powers to arrest and isolate people to protect public health but will be time-limited for two years.Some hospitals have begun stopping all non-essential visits to patients, while the FTSE  continued its downward slump as the financial impact of the crisis failed to cease.The cultural impact also continued, with filming on EastEnders and BBC Studios dramas including Casualty, Doctors, Holby City, Pobol y Cwm and River City was postponed.However, there was a glimmer of hope in a day of bleak developments when the PM hailed a game-changer test was coming down the track.It would test for antibodies to the virus and be able to tellsomeone has been infected and recovered, allowing them toto work.    Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She wrote: “If Chinese authorities had acted three weeks earlier than they did, the number of coronavirus cases could have been reduced by  per cent and its geographic spread limited.”Just like the Chernobyl disaster that exposed to the world the very dangerous shortcomings of the USSR, we cannot forget how the Chinese government allowed the virus to spread while engaging in a despicable cover-up.One of the first coronavirus patients started feeling unwell on December . The new illness was linked to the infamous wildle market now forever connected to the outbreak six days later.But health officials in Wuhan weren’t told about it until December .Then the cover-up really began.On December  two Wuhan doctors posted information on the Chinese social media service WeChat about the virus but got in trouble for spreading information.China only closed the market in question and informed the World Health Organisation on New Year’s Eve.But on January  the Wuhan Public Security Bureau reprehended eight more local doctors for posting information on WeChat and an official at the Hubei Provincial Health Commission ordered testing to be stopped and samples to be destroyed.So much time was lost.It also took a further week for information from Chinese researchers mapping the new coronavirus to be made public on January .Unbelievably, the Wuhan Health Commission claimed there were no new cases of Coronavirus between January  and .But by January  it was already too late, with the first case outside of China reported in Thailand.And on January  someone left Wuhan to the USA carrying coronavirus.On January , Wuhan still held its Lunar New Year banquet, seeing tens of thousands of people gather together.It was two days later on January  that the administration’s People’s Daily newspaper mentioned the coronavirus for the first time – and at that point Beijing started to take it seriously.Citizens were warned that anyone who hides the virus “out of his or her own self-interest will be nailed on the pillar of shame for eternity” and Wuhan was finally put into lockdown.But not before around five million people left the city WITHOUT being screened and the New Year holiday in China continued until January  with hundreds of millions people travelling all over the country.It was too late. As usual, the cover up was far worse than the crime.Coronavirus was on the loose, not just in China but around the world.As Bethany Allen-Ebrahimian put it perfectly: “China is now trying to create a narrative that its an example of how to handle this crisis when in fact its early actions led to the virus spreading around the globe.”That is unforgivable.I agree with Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee in the US, who says China has just carried out “one of the worst cover-ups in human history”.To read the full article on Axios, click here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

after days of shops being stripped bare by Brits grabbing as much stock as they can.The dramatic sweeping measures came as:The PM again refused to rule out shutting pubs and restaurants to try to stop the spread, but made no hint as to whether it was on the way soon.We will do it very much by the science and whether we think the advice given is working, he said.If we feelit isnt working and we need to bring in tougher measures... nothing is ruled out.And he again vowed that a package of vital measures for helping working Brits up and down the country was on the way.Boris said this evening: We are going to look after the people who really suffer, we will be directing our support to them first, the people first.The PM stressed that the first patients had started a randomised trial to try and help cure them of the disease.And he promised to ramp up testing to a whopping , PER DAY in future - yet gave no details on how that would happen. Negotiations are underway to buy a new game-changing antibody tests which will tellanyone has had the virus too, he said.If it works, we will buy literally hundreds of thousands of these kits as soon as practical, he promised.After claims from Nicola Sturgeon that more stringent measures on London could be on the way, the PM vowed that no one would be told not to leave their home as is the case in Italy and France.He promised: We are not going to be telling people that under no circumstances they should go to work.There is no prospect of us wanting to stop public transport in London.He also used his daily address to beg employers not to fire their staff as help was coming for them tomorrow.It came after Boris and the Government laid out sweeping new emergency laws to crack down on every aspect of le in Britain today.NHS staff and police will have the power to detain people for up to  hours and force them to be tested for Covid-.The sweeping laws give them to power to order them not to attend work or to stay in isolation, or ban them from travelling.And they will face a £, finethey dont comply.The -page bill will allow for more phone and video hearings in court so the justice system can keep going.Officials will be able to suspend all plane and ship arrivals at airports or ports or there aren’t enough staff to maintain border security.Morgues could be expanded and inquests stripped back in order to try and deal with extra deaths.It also enacts pension changes so retired doctors and nurses can come back into the NHS easily without their retirement cash suffering.The emergency powers will be able to be switched on and switched offand when needed - for up to two years.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: “We are doing everything we can to protect lives and support the NHS, guided by the best scientists and clinicians in the world.“The new measures we will be introducing in the Emergency Coronavirus Bill this week will only be used when it is absolutely necessary and must be timed to maximise their effectiveness, but crucially they give the government the powers it needs to protect lives.The plans also included:Meanwhile, Downing Street denied that the capital would be put into lockdown - with any restrictions on travel or transport.They said Britain will never see the draconian measures like in France and Italy where people are unable to leave their homes without good reason or paperwork.The Prime Ministers official spokesman said: There are no plans to close down the transport network in London and there is zero prospect of any restrictions being placed on travelling in and out of London.London was not being shut or cut off, but the Government wants to try and ease pressure on the NHS by enforcing the rules better.But they said new social distancing measures for London were on the cards.This is likely to include forcing pubs, restaurants and cafes to close.Troops are not expected to deployed on the streets to ensure public order, either, the PMs spokesperson stressed.However, Londons transport network is expected to be scaled back in the coming days, and  stations are set to close for the meantime.Schools will shut their doors from Friday and may not re-open until September. Ministers will reveal more about how kids will get their exam grades without sitting tests in the coming days.Heres some more information about what to doyou lose your job due to coronavirus.And here are your rights to sick payyou have to self-isolate.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One nurse came into my room the other day with a sort of plastic sheeting covering her face, it looked like the sort of clear plastic wrapper flowers come in.And she admitted she is worriedthe virus starts getting worse the hospital will be swamped with coronavirus patients.She begged people to self-isolate and insisted its the only way.Ms Langston added: I can understand their mind-set because I had that attitude before of it’s a load of nonsense, it’s just being all hyped up before I got this– I wasn’t one to buy into all the hysteria.But then I got the coronavirus and I never again want to experience anything like it because it was a deeply unpleasant experience.That’s why I filmed myself in the ICU and sent it to my work mates because they were supposed to be all meeting up for a training event and I wanted to tell them not to go as it wasn’t worth the risk.They’d be better off staying at home self-isolating.Whatever restrictions the government has now been put in place should have been done two weeks ago I believe.My story should be a warning to others – you need to take this seriously.Her husband Richard fears she could have caught the virus at the gym.He said: She’s out of intensive care now and is making good progress.

Tory ministers plan to give themselves vast powers over almost every aspect of public le in order to curb the spread of the Covid- outbreak. The -page Coronavirus Bill - to be rushed through Parliament next week - also allows police to keep you in quarantine for at least a MONTH. It allows mentally ill people to be detained or dead people to be medically certied on the opinion of just one doctor. Sweeping powers will force supermarkets to disclose any problems in the food supply or be fined % of their turnover. And morgues could be expanded and inquests stripped back in order to deal with at least , anticipated deaths. On the plus side, a new volunteer leave will allow people to take unpaid time offthey want to help deal with the epidemic. And it will become easier for retired medics and medical students to join the frontline eventhey havenapost ticked every box of their qualications. The laws are separate to, and were planned long before, reports of a lockdown in London. Downing Street has insisted there is zero prospect of travel in and out of the capital being halted. However, they will allow authorities to enforce the advice not to travel or gather socially - and ensure the state doesnapost drown in paperwork rather than treating the sick. On the other hand, many MPs have raised concerns that the Bill is far too wide-ranging and hands the government too much executive power. Many of its measures can last two years without any extra approval by Parliament. Labour MP Chris Bryant said: I am not going to vote for draconian emergency measures that don’t have a renewal clause, preferably every thirty or sixty days. Two years is excessive for measures that restrict liberty and even six months is not good enough. I hope to table amendments later today. Human rights group Liberty warned the Bill has dramatic changes to civil liberties and greater surveillance could be ushered in through the backdoor - saying there must be tighter scrutiny. So whataposs in the emergency laws  Hereaposs everything you need to know. Police can force you to undergo treatment - or you could be arrested and fined £,. Andyouaposre infectious, police can keep you in quarantine for  DAYS  Police, immigration officers and public health officials will have the power to force someone to undergo a coronavirus test - and they can be fined £,they flee. Anyone deemed “potentially infectious” can be detained for up to  hours, or  hours by immigration officials, while they undergo a screening for the disease. Anyone “reasonably suspected” to have the virus, or to have been in an infected area in the last  days, can be held. They must be informed of their rights but it will be a criminal offence to refuse or to abscond. Public health officers can then exercise further powersthey believe they are “necessary and proportionate” to stop the person infecting others. This can include forcing people to remain in isolation, and restrictions on travel, activities and contact with other people. The Bill gives public health officials the power to force someone into isolation for up to  days. If a public health officer believes the person will be potentially infectious at the end of the period, it can be extended by up to a further  days -  in total. Once an extension has happened, the forced isolation must be reviewed at least every  hours andthe person is no longer infectious they can be released. The quarantine can be enforced by police - who can take anyone who absconds into custody and then forciblythem into quarantine. Overall, these powers exist for as long as ministers have declared there is a “serious and imminent threat to public health” from COVID-. Thereaposll be a new aposemergency volunteer leaveapos for ordinary heroes to help out  The government is introducing new emergency volunteer leaveapos to allow Brits who want to help the fight against coronavirus to do their bit. They hope the new scheme will increase the numbers of volunteers and free up the essential workers in the health service, social care and other vital services. It is unpaid leave, but enforced by law, and there will be funding to compensate those helping for some of their loss of earnings and expenses. The government says the new measure would help remove two of the main obstacles to people volunteering - namely time of work and the need to earn money.  The Bill gives government ministers wide-ranging powers to cancel events and gatherings at their orders in a few circumstances. They have to believe it is either an event which they feel will encourage the spread of coronavirus - or that it will be a drain on the medical resources. It will mean they can instruct authorities to stop people from entering premises, or impose restrictions on people who own or are organising an event to force them to cancel events. It also gives ministers the power to close “events or gatherings of a specied description” meaning they could close bars, restaurants or any other type of specied venue. The Secretary of State for Health will have to make a public declaration of any restriction in writing - and the Chief Medical Officer, or their deputy, will have a role in the process as well. Port, airports and railway stations can be temporarily shut  Ministers will be given the power to order ports, airports or international rail terminals to suspend activitiesthey can show that there is a risk of Covid- spreading or the Border Force is unable to adequately control the border because of pressures where. The Bill says the power can only be usedthere is a signicant risk to the public. The initial suspension can last no longer than six hours. It can be extended by notice for  hours and then at  hour intervalsnotice is given - but each time the government must demonstrate that the situation is dangerousthe port is not closed. Supermarkets will be forced to co-operate with government over panic-buying  The Bill gives the government sweeping powers to force privately-run supermarkets to disclose any disruption is to the food supply. The Environment Secretary will be able to “require information from persons within, or closely connected to, a food supply chain”he believes it is at risk of disruption. Such information can’t be demanded from an inidual - protecting inidual farmers and corner shop owners - but it can be used against food producers, slaughterhouses, packaging centres, distributors and retailers. Firms that refuse to comply can be fined % of their entire turnover, which for a major supermarket firm would be many millions of pounds. The idea is so the government has an overall picture of the food supply in the UK. Retired medics and medical students can be rushed in to treat patients  As part of the Bill, recently-retired doctors and medical students will be registered as regulated healthcare professionals more quickly and with fewer checks. This is to boost the number of NHS staff available to treat coronavirus patients. The Bill also makes it easier to bring NHS workers out of retirement. Currently, a former NHS worker’s pension benefits are suspendedtheyto work. The law will ensure they carry on getting their pension. Other parts of the Bill are similar and designed to remove bureaucracy on coming out of retirement. Royal College of Nursing Chief Executive and General Secretary Dame Donna Kinnair, said: Many nursing students and some recently retired nurses will want to play their part in helping to tackle the epidemic. We have been clear that students in the last six months of their degree must be free to choose to work. They must also be supported and supervised during their placements, and be properly remunerated. And aposbed blockingapos patients can be rushed out of hospital The bill will reduce the stages before a patient with social care needs can be discharged from hospital in order to speed up the process. This is because one of the biggest priorities is to maximise the number of hospital beds available. It will also change the way that councils have to provide social care by allowing them to prioritise the most serious cases. Checks on social workers can be relaxed Social workers who have recently left the profession will be temporarily added to registers to pick up any shortfalls in service. Suitably experienced people could also in temporarily registered as social workers ad the approval of the Registrar of Social Work in either England or Wales - this could include final year social work students. One doctor on their own will be allowed to detain a mentally ill person The Bill temporarily amends the Mental Health Act to allow fewer doctors’ opinions to be sought when detaining someone on mental health grounds. Currently, two doctoraposs opinions are required, it will be reduced to one for the two years from the date this Bill is passed. It also means that fewer doctors need to be consulted when it comes to detaining prisoners with mental health conditions against their will. There will be fewer checks before death certicates and cremations Doctors who haven’t actually seen the dead patient will be able to sign a death certicate under a relaxation in the law. Loved ones will also be able to register a death without visiting the Register Office in person. Meanwhile, authorities in England and Wales will be able to cremate a dead person based on a medical certicate from just one medical practitioner. The current law requires a second medical certicate confirming the details - a reform that was brought in to stop a repeat of mass murderer doctor Harold Shipman. The move “is aimed at simplying the process in order to address the expected increased volume of deaths”, and the need to keep doctors on the frontline, the government says.  Councils can build temporary morgues Councils could be given the power to step up planning to create temporary morgues - with the ability to make inquiries about finding places to hold bodiesnecessary. National authorities - once authorised by a minister - could require iniduals or companies to make available facilities that could help in the storage, disposal or transportation of dead bodies. Examples given are commandeering facilities at private funeral homes or crematoria. If a local authority is failing to perform these duties it gives the national government the power to step in and take over the handling of the deceased. In some cases, it also gives local authorities the power to direct whether a body is buried or cremated It also makes it easier for companies, local authorities and national governments to share information without falling foul of the law. Coronavirus inquests wonapost have juries Current law says Covid- is a “notiable disease” which means every death from it needs an inquest with a -person jury. This would have “signicant resource implications” as the government is planning on the basis of at least , deaths from the virus. So instead a coroner will be able to hold a simpler inquest without a jury in order to give families closure.  The NHS will be shielded from clinical negligence claims The Bill provides an “indemnity” from many clinical negligence claims against the NHS. This includes cases of people who have been treated for coronavirus, and “business as usual” activities that are disrupted or affected in some way by the outbreak. It is not immediately clearthis blocks legal action being brought altogether, or gives the NHS a defence and or covers its costs. We’ve asked for clarity. “Indemnity for such activities is not available where indemnity arrangements are already in place that cover the clinical negligence liability in question”, the government says. The government can force a school to shut, pupils to attend a dferent school, and pupil teacher ratios to change The bill gives the government a range of powers concerning education. It says that what is in the best interests of pupils and staff will “y according to the level of risk which presents itself in a particular place at a particular time”. It gives government the power to require or direct the temporary closure of a school, college or childcare provider. But it also gives the power to make “specied types of direction in connection with the running” of schools and other places. This might include keeping certain institutions open - or it could mean some pupils of key workers or who are vulnerable attend a dferent school to the one they normally do. Finally the bill gives the power to “dis-apply or y specied existing requirements” so this might include things like reducing the ratio of staff to children to account for staff absences but more clarity will be needed on this issue.

The last couple of days I’ve woken up feeling like I’d smoked  cigarettes the night before. Yesterday I woke up feeling like I’d smoked  in the last hour. I had an occasional - but not continuous - cough, a headache and aches in my muscles. It was time to self-isolate. I’d already been working from home since Sunday and hadn’t really been out and about much since Friday. Our team started ‘social distancing’ at the end of last week, cutting down the number of staff physically in our office in the Houses of Parliament to the minimum to avoid unnecessary spreading. I’ve worked from home before, so I like to think I know a lot of the tricks. Get dressed. Don’t work in bed - have a desk set up, evenit’s the kitchen table. Have a set beginning and end to your work day. But I didn’t make it past step one yesterday. My partner is - so far - asymptomatic, but has entered isolation with me. We share an extremely small home - welcome to London - so she’s inevitably a couple of days behind me.  Both of us have made a point of not stockpiling. We’ve got enough - ahem - personal items to last a couple of weeks, but that’s about what we keep in anyway. The only things we’ve got more of than usual are ‘quality of le’ things, like a couple of bags of nice coffee beans. Little luxuries that make a couple of weeks stuck in the house feel less like a prison sentence.  Of course, in trying to do the right thing, we’ve ended up without a few things. Nothing dramatic - the biggest problem is that I don’t have a thermometer in the house, so I can’t tellI actually have a temperature. Not sure it matters at this point - my chest feeling like it’s being crushed under a rock is enough evidence for me - but it would have been nice. But a big shout out to the guys on Amazon offering £. thermometers for free delivery in a month’s time - or £you want it this week. Classy. Anyway, I’m settled in. I’m drinking lots of fluids, resting in bed and getting used to the four walls I’ll be looking at for the next week. Symptoms: Coughing, shortness of breath and chest tightness, headache, muscle pains. What’s entertaining me: Season  of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine on Netflix.

Laura Ross, , is in hospital, suffering a neurological disorder, while her children Charlotte, , and Sam, , are stuck inside the family home in Beeston, Nottingham, self-isolating due to an underlying health issue. Now there is one less thing for them to worry about as a support group near their home has stepped in to help. Ellie, , of the Beeston and Chilwell Area Mutual Aid Group, is just one of an army of volunteers doing their bit to help in the crisis. As her kids Elliot, five, and Emelia, three, wait patiently, Ellie texts Charlotte to say the delivery is there. Then Ellie, who also volunteers at a food bank, tells me: “It is really important we care and look after our elderly and vulnerable members of the community.” For Laura, it has been a leline. Messaging from hospital, she says she had hoped an online shopping order would supply her children while she is in hospital.Laura says: “Charlotte is self-isolating as she has arthritis and is on immune suppressing drugs.“We hoped we would be fine as we managed to get an online delivery slot but a quarter of the shopping didn’t come. “Thankfully, a volunteer from the group was on hand to help my children. The group has been a godsend. To know there are amazing people out there helping my family while I’m in hospital means so much. “I am part of the group and I am trying to help with the admin, as I can’t physically help.” Residents across the UK have created support groups via Facebook and WhatsApp to link elderly or vulnerable residents with volunteers who can collect shopping and medication, post letters or even walk the dog.Paul Swt, , helped set up the Beeston and Chilwell group, which has more than , volunteers. When we meet up, Paul has a van of food and household items ready to be delivered to those in need. After heading to a local pub we co-ordinate the deliveries and make drop-off plans. A few elderly residents living alone approach Paul, who matches them with a volunteer living close-by. After Ellie drops off Laura’s groceries, we get smiles and nods of appreciation from other neighbours.  There is a real sense of community. Later, Paul is due to pick up medication for a mum, for her poorly son, but it is cancelled at the last minute. Paul explains the woman had found a relative to help. He says: “Plans are always changing at the last minute, because people’s circumstances can change.” But he says: “I have an uncle of  and an aunt of  with health problems. I wouldn’t like to think of them strugglingthey didn’t have me. Not everybody has relatives nearby. “We have been posting leaflets through doors so everyone knows we are here.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailWith so much new advice and the ever-changing situation with coronavirus, it can be very confusing. Here, Dr Miriam Stoppard answers your questions on everything from self-isolating to risk groups and future plans... We are told deaths relating to coronavirus are people with underlying health problems. Can you clary what these might be  Brenda Tiley, , from Luton Underlying health problems mean any chronic medical condition such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, lung disease, kidney disease and liver disease. Cancer and cancer treatments like chemotherapy would also make a person vulnerable. These conditions put a strain on the immune system and make the body less resilient, so you should follow all the advice the Government has given us – e.g. self-isolating, not mixing with people, not going out and not travelling.I’m  and have had three heart attacks but feel healthy, should I self-isolate  I also had Asian flu in , will I still have the antibodies from this and will they protect me against Covid-  Frank Robinson, Swinton, Manchester Despite feeling healthy, your three heart attacks put you in the vulnerable group, so you should self-isolate. I wish I could say having Asian flu in  would protect you but I’m afraid it won’t. Each virus is specic and the only thing that would protect us is a specic vaccination for Covid-. My daughter and daughter-in-law are pregnant. Both are going to work from home but are pregnant women more at risk from this virus and are there any precautions they should be taking  Tina Wallman, , Camberley, Surrey Pregnant women are always considered a special group that requires special attention. In this outbreak, that doesn’t change. In fact, the Chief Medical Officer has put pregnant women into the “vulnerable” group, alongside older people and those that have underlying medical conditions. Soyour daughter and daughter-in-law can, I suggest they self-isolate, stay in their homes, do not mix with other people and do not go outdoors unless necessary.  I’m  with underlying health conditions and I play golf regularly. Should I carry on while avoiding physical contact with playing partners, and avoiding the bar and clubhouse  I enjoy the fresh air and exercise. Peter Sidebotham, Stalybridge, Cheshire It’s great that you play golf to keep fit butyou have underlying health conditions I wouldn’t advise you continue to play – there will always be mixing with other people and you’d be exposed to contaminated surfaces. If there’s any way you could play entirely on your own, without any contact with others, it might work. If this isn’t possible you should stop playing golf altogether for the time being. Those experiencing coronavirus symptoms, such as a cough or fever, should self-isolate for  days.You should stay at homeyou or or anyone in your household has a high temperature or a new and continuous cough - evenitaposs mild. Everyone in your household must stay at home for  days and keep away from others DO NOT go to your GP or hospital.Go to NHS.UK to check your symptoms and follow the specialist medical advice.Only call you canapost get online, you feel like you canapost cope at home, or your symptoms do not get better after the seven days. If you are pregnant you should call you have any concerns about yourself or unborn baby during self-isolation. Pregnant women are advised to contact their midwe, out-of-hours helplines or a maternity team who will provide information on whether you need to go to hospital.  I have mental health disorders including depression, as well as underlying physical health conditions. I’m worried I’ll become more depressed, anxious and vulnerableI self-isolate. Should I stop going out because of coronavirus already, and what can I doI do to help my mental health  Name withheld I’m very sympathetic but with your medical background you’d be well advised to self-isolate and put in place some things that could protect you from loneliness. First, I think you should make a resolution to Skype family or friends at least once a day. Phoning a friend a couple of times each day would help as well. Be more active on social media s and engage with your online friends. Make sure you’re eating a healthy diet, not too much coffee, no alcohol – and get a good night’s sleep.  Is delaying the spread the best policy  Won’t it just prolong people’s anxiety  Ian Mussett Delaying the spread is the strategy to take pressure off the NHS. There are downsides and you describe one of them. I don’t think anyone will relax until we hit a peak of some sort. As it happens, it might not be possible to delay the spread. The Government may have acted too late with restrictive measures. To my mind, we should be going further, as they are in France and Spain, with almost total lockdown. It worked in Wuhan and South Korea. Why aren’t we doing it  I’m  with type  diabetes and on insulin. I’ve had an aorta valve change and I’m on blood thinners. I have high blood pressure too. I’m due to look after my granddaughterher school closes but would that be wise  Alan Bebb, Runcorn, Cheshire With all your medical complaints, you’re vulnerable. I think you should be self-isolating, only going out to shop for food or get your medication. I don’t think it is a good idea to look after your granddaughter, she’ll probably be OK but she might carry the virus to you. The latest advice is not to even meet up with your family. My we and I are in our s and she has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We have a holiday booked for June . I have paid a deposit and need to pay the balance in April to keep the holiday. Should I  Graham Newnes, Rutland The NHS has stopped advising coronavirus patients to take ibuprofen amid concerns the anti-inflammatory painkiller could only make things worse. A statement read: There is currently no strong evidence that ibuprofen can make coronavirusworse. But until we have more information, take paracetamol to treat the symptoms of coronavirus, unless your doctor has told you paracetamol is not suitable for you. If you are already taking ibuprofen or another non-steroidal anti-inflammatoryon the advice of a doctor, do not stop taking it without checking first. I don’t think so. The Government’s guidelines say because of your age, you and your we fall into the vulnerable category – especially as she suffers from COPD. This means you should self-isolate, not travel and not mix with other people, like eating out in cafés and restaurants. It’s a shame but I think you’ll have to lose your deposit. I’m  and my we is  and she is susceptible to pneumonia. We’ve recently moved and don’t have any friends or relatives close by. In the case of self-isolating, we’ll have no one to help. What should we do  Roger Baber, Bideford, Devon You could stay in touch by phone, Skype, WhatsApp and social media. By doing this you speak to someone every day. You can also keep your family and friends alert to feeling unwell and they can help you get support. You or your family could phone the local council to seethere’s a service that would do your shopping. I know it’s hard because a lot of us are going to feel bereft in the coming months but we just have to do what we can. What’s the best way to help your immune system cope with the virus  Ray Baguely, , Newport There’s nothing you can do from the outside to boost your immune system. The only way would be to have a vaccination so your immune system produced antibodies specically against coronavirus. Exposure to the virus could stimulate your immune system to produce those antibodies itself.  With over-s spending more time at home, will those without access to a garden be advised to take vitamin D  Linda Rachel, , Ipswich With so little sunshine during the winter, people in the older age group are already advised to take mcg of vitamin D every day in the autumn and winter months. For people confined to their homes it’s even more important to follow this advice. My daughter is in her s and expecting her first baby mid-May. She is terried of there not being a bed available when she goes into labour. How can I reassure her on this  Wendy from Cardf "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus elderly man staring empty","story":"NewsCoronavirus: Elderly man staring at empty Sainsbury’s shelves shows panic-buying impactA heartbreaking photo of an elderly man staring at his shopping list in an aisle stripped bare shows the devastating impact Covid- panic-buying has on someShareCommentsBySimon NevilleLila Randall:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video shelves-empty-sainsburys-store-stockpiling-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news coronavirus-elderly-man-staring-empty-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

The poignant image shows the man looking down at a shopping list in front of bare shelves in his local store in Epsom, Surrey. Other shocking images of pensioners looking for food in supermarkets with limited supplies have also circulated on social media. Lauren Taylor, , who took the photo of the gentleman, said she hoped the picture would kick the public into action to take care of the elderly. The mum-of-two explained that multiple aisles on the supermarket had limited supply. She said: It was awful and just really sad. That was only one aisle and the others were in a similar state of empty shelves. People were grabbing lots of the stuff that were still on the shelves. Itaposs really just sad and disappointing in society that itaposs got to this point. Everyone needs stuff, but he had been left with nothing. Supermarket giants have moved to limit the number of crucial items people can buy. Tesco said shoppers will be limited to buying just three products per line from Thursday. Chief executive Dave Lewis added all counter services will close, to free up staff to restock shelves, and a priority hour will be launched at larger stores between am and am every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Stores that previously opened  hours, will also now close at pm each evening.  The move follows similar measures by Sainsburyaposs, Aldi, Asda and Morrisons, to ease stockpiling pressure amid the Covid- outbreak. Sainsburyaposs revealed it will only allow customers to buy a maximum of three of any single item, while Morrisons said it is limiting purchases across , lines. Asda also announced it is restricting shoppers to three items on all food and closing its cafés and pizza counters, while temporarily reducing the opening hours of all its -hour stores for re-stocking. Aldi has already introduced limits of four items per shopper across all products.  Tesco boss Mr Lewis wrote to staff on Wednesday: It is fair to say that we find ourselves in uncharted waters. Covid- is bringing a change to the UK and itaposs clear that lots of things are going to have to sht around in order to help us cope.At Tesco, we have been doing everything we can to keep business as usual, but we now have to accept it is not business as usual. In the last two weeks, we have seen signicant and prolonged increases in demand across all of our stores and this is leading to shortages in some products for some customers. It comes as Britainaposs supermarket chains are also launching action to help elderly and vulnerable customers, while ramping up operations to meet surging demand for home deliveries.  Sainsburyaposs became the latest group to offer priority home delivery slots to elderly and vulnerable customers, as well as exclusive shopping hours. Its supermarkets will only open to these two groups for the first hour of trading on Thursday, chief executive Mike Coupe said, but will open for an hour longer so other shoppers do not miss out. Sainsburyaposs Local convenience stores will not offer the service. Supermarkets have seen a huge rise in demand for delivery services, with no slots available until next month for both Tesco and Waitrose in some parts of the south east. The surge came as Transport Secretary Grant Shapps authorised a temporary relaxation, until April , of the driversapos hours rules to help deliver goods to stores across the country. The government has advised the British public to:Avoid pubs, clubs, restaurants and all social gatherings Cease all unnecessary travel Everyone should work from home where possible Mass gatherings and sporting events have been cancelled Avoid “all but essential travel” worldwide If one person in any household has a persistent cough or fever, everyone living there must stay at home for  days Pregnant women, those over , and people with certain health conditions have been asked to stay at home for  weeks Schools, colleges and nurseries to close from Friday - GCSEs and A-levels cancelled A Department for Transport statement said the relaxation applies only to drivers supplying food and essential products to supermarkets. The statement added: This includes the movement of such goods from importers, manufactures and suppliers to distribution centres. It does not apply to drivers undertaking deliveries directly to consumers. Iceland outlets across the country have also introduced reserved time slots to give the vulnerable and the elderly a chance to shop in store. Sainsburyaposs said customers over  and those with a disability will have priority access to online delivery slots from Monday, and the chain is also expanding its click and collect service.

One in particular that people have been Googling over the past few weeks is how coronavirus spreads and whether or not the infection can be passed on through food.So hereaposs a look at what we know about coronavirus and food as of right now. The NHS website, currently tells the public that itaposs very unlikely it can be spread through things like packages or food.It adds: Because itaposs a new illness, we do not know exactly how coronavirus spreads from person to person. Similar viruses are spread in cough droplets.

The monarch shared a message of solidarity shortly after she arrived at Windsor Castle with Prince Philip this afternoon. Speaking about the dficulties ahead, as millions of people prepare to stay at home rather than going about their normal day-to-day lives, she said: I am certain we are up to that challenge.The Monarchaposs statement follows similar messages from Prince William, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry.In her message, the Queen asked Brits to do a number of things during this dficult time. To change our day-to-day routines The Queen urges people to follow government guidelines to try to stop the spread. People have been asked to refrain socialising and to only travelitaposs completely necessary. Anyone who can should work from home and schools will close next week. While inconvenient, experts have said itaposs vital to save lives of those in the aposat riskapos groups.  She said: We are all being advised to change our normal routines and regular patterns of le for the greater good of the communities we live in and, in particular, to protect the most vulnerable within them. To work together She has also asked people to come together in their communities. She said: At times such as these, I am reminded that our nation’s history has been forged by people and communities coming together to work as one, concentrating our combined efforts with a focus on the common goal.  To support our emergency services and vital workers While the majority of us are being asked to work from home, those that work in vital jobs still have to go in. This means theyaposre risking catching the virus and getting ill in order to help the rest of us carry on.  Doctors, nurses, delivery drivers, supermarket staff and other people are being widely praised, and the Queen has also urged us to support them. She said: We are enormously thankful for the expertise and commitment of our scientists, medical practitioners and emergency and public services but now more than any time in our recent past, we all have a vitally important part to play as iniduals - today and in the coming days, weeks and months.

Askedhe anticipated people still going into higher and further education without undergoing a formal exams process he told Sky: Yes, thataposs right.

But what will the schools closure mean for children, parents and families Here is everything we know so far, as reported by Bristol Live.

How long will the shutdown be for  The Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said that schools will shut their gates at the end of Friday and then be shut indefinitely - the Government are careful not to put a time frame or date on when they may reopen. When asked by journalists at the Number  briefing that happened simultaneously, Mr Johnson appeared to rebuff the suggestion, made in Wales and Ireland, that the school closures could be for as long as six months - that Friday would effectively mark the end of the school year, and the summer term after Easter would simply not happen, with schools reopening in September. He said he would hope that schools could reopen before then, but with the coronavirus pandemic rapidly spreading throughout Britain, there is no certainty at all on when they would reopen.  Who will still go to school  The Education Secretary said that schools would remain open for the children of keyworkers, to ensure that people who the country needs to continue to go to work and not worry about childcare, will be able to do so. The Prime Minister said these would be the children of NHS workers, police and emergency services personnel and aposdelivery driversapos who are critical to ensuring the continuing working of the food supply from farm to factory to shops. The Prime Minister said exactly who would be in this list would be revealed this week, before Friday - but there are no firm details as yet, on Wednesday evening.   What about grandparents  There was a specic warning from the Prime Minister that, under no circumstances, children should be now looked after by their grandparents, once they are home from school. That generation of older people are the most vulnerable to coronavirus, and the message from the scientists is that young people and the elderly should be kept apart to avoid older people catching the virus.  What should parents do  One of the key reasons why schools are now being closed is to further ensure that a partial lockdown of society happens. Parents are being asked to look after their children at home, and not leave them with grandparents, and this move is designed to increase the numbers of people who largely withdraw and remain in their homes, to stop the further spread.Most controversially, however, Boris Johnson again held back from making lockdowns and closures of businesses an order - even though all other countries in Europe are pursuing those more severe measures.  What about exams  The Prime Minister confirmed that, given schools will be closed for a considerable time and exams start in May, this yearaposs  GCSEs and A-levels would be scrapped. This does mean that exams will not take place in May and June as planned, but we will make sure that students get the exams they need and deserve, said Mr Johnson. Quite how that happens is unclear, but the most likely explanation will be some kind of grade awarded from coursework already completed, or predictive grades or grades from mock exams.  What about vulnerable children  School children who are classed as vulnerable will be still be allowed to go to school - this includes children who have an EHCP - children with special needs - and children who have a social worker or are in care.  What about Free School Meals  The Prime Minister outlined that they would be rapidly drawing up plans for a voucher scheme for children who are entitled to free school meals - but who will now not be at school to receive it each day - to get that food or support. The details of how exactly this works are yet to be revealed.

In a heartbreaking video, Dawn Bilbrough, , from York, asks people to just stop taking more food than needed, warning the public itaposs key workers who will be looking after you when youaposre at your lowest. She admits she had a little cry in the supermarket after seeing the fruit and vegetable shelves totally bare. I donapost know how Iaposm supposed to stay healthy. And those people... people are  just stripping the shelves of basic foods. You just need to stop it. Because itaposs people like me that are going to be looking after you when youaposre at your lowest so just stop it. Please! The video comes as supermarkets bring in more stringent measures to ensure food is distributed more evenly among society. Shelves have been stripped bare at Tesco, Sainsburyaposs, Asda and Morrisons, as customers attempt to purchase essential items such as toilet roll, handwash and pasta. There were also violent scenes at an Iceland store in Ilford, east London, earlier this week after an elderly shopper was pushed and shoved out of a packed Iceland store. Customers were seen queuing outside an Aldi even before the doors opened this morning, with most people heading to the loo rolls section straight away - even though the Government has told Britons not to panic buy. Major supermarkets including Sainsburyaposs, Tesco, Aldi and Morrisons have rationed how much of certain products customers can buy. Some have restricted purchases in-demand items like toilet roll, paracetemol and pasta, while others have brought in blanket bans on multiple purchases. Itaposs just one of a number of measures brought in by the nationaposs grocers, as pictures of empty shelves spread through social media like wildfire. Panic buyers have stripped shelves of everything they can - in some cases leaving just ice cream and chocolate Easter eggs - while huge queues snaked around some supermarkets ahead of opening on Wednesday. Currently there are no official limits coming down from the Government, although pressure is growing to impose them, and supermarket bosses insist there is no shortage - simply people over-buying.  In the interim, the shops have taken action themselves - limiting customer purchases and opening hours. Competition laws will be temporarily relaxed to allow supermarkets to collaborate in feeding the nation during the coronavirus crisis. Retailers will be able to pool staff, share data on stock levels, and share distribution depots and delivery vans as the Government seeks to ease restrictions under the exceptional circumstances. The temporary relaxation only permits retailers to work together for the sole purpose of feeding the nation as they face a strain from intense demand amid panic buying, ministers said. The p plastic bag charge will also be waived for online purchases to hasten deliveries, and driversapos hours will be relaxed so more food can be delivered to stores.

Marilyn Lundy, , says she had to leave Sainsbury’s empty-handed last week after she found the shelves stripped bare because of coronavirus panic-buying. The pensioner, from Urmston in Greater Manchester, says the experience left her feeling extremely fearful. Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, Mrs Lundy explained how she and her -year-old husband, who suffers from heart problems and diabetes, have been trying to self-isolate since last week to protect themselves from COVID-. The couple normally get an online shop delivered every Tuesday, but this week only half the order arrived. Unable to book another slot until April  - two weeks away - she decided to risk leaving the house and head to the shops, only to find that other shoppers had bought up essential items. With my age and my husbandaposs health, we decided to self-isolate a week ago, Marilyn said. I thought that it wouldnapost be too dficult to do as I have been getting my shopping online for years. I will usually get a whole weekaposs shop and then I might pop into the supermarket to get the odd thing. My order arrived on Tuesday and only about half or the order actually came, so I thought okay, Iaposll just make another. These people who have emptied the shelves are now online getting what they need and I find it very wrong.”  Marilyn says she is going to try and get to Sainsburyaposs for the dedicated elderly shopping hour at am, but fears she will miss out again. She says she is also worried of increasing the risk to her husband every time she steps food inside a supermarket. Where do I go from here ” she added. I tried to call Sainsburyaposs but there was no answer, I sent an email but havenapost had a reply. It just feels like people like me donapost matter. The pensioner hit out at those who have been stockpiling unnecessarily - and says supermarkets should be doing more to stop it. They havenapost done enough to stop people stockpiling, Marilyn said.  The other day I saw one couple with as much as they could get in their trolley, and once they had loaded their car, they went back into the shop to buy more. I think itaposs disgusting, I feel very hurt by it. Not everyone can shop online either. Not a lot of people my age do it and certainly not many people over the age of . People are going to the shop and there is just nothing there for them. Marilyn says she has been overwhelmed by offers of help from people on social media and local neighbours, but is keen to keep her independence. I will say that for all the greedy people out there now, there are just as many really nice people out there who have offered help, she added. But how can you ask someone who works to do a whole week shop for you. I am not so proud that I wonapost ask for help when I need it but I canapost give someone a whole week shopping list. Iaposve been independent until now and that is now being taken away from me.  Earlier this week Sainsbury’s announced it would introduce rationing in a drastic bid to limit panic-buying. Its chief executive, Mike Coupe, says the supermarket has listened to customersapos concerns about the impact of shoppersapos stockpiling behaviour on the elderly and vulnerable, and would be taking action immediately.

As European nations crackdown on freedom of movement, and encourage people to work from home, what can you expectyou fall sick with the novel flu. Since the outbreak was announced in Wuhan, China, in December , medical professionals have been grappling to understand the virusaposs symptoms and how they can be treated. Health experts say that the risk of becoming critically ill remains low and not everyone who contracts the virus will become ill. Those who do are likely to experience symptoms similar to that of a normal bout of flu. Now, the experiences of some of those that have recovered from the virus sheds some light on what we should prepare for. . Painful sinuses Painful sinuses are common when you get a fair few strains of a cold or the flu. Sinusitis can leave you feeling awful, both physically and mentally. Pain, most often paired with a dull pressure, generally occurs when your sinuses become inflamed and swollen. You may feel pain in your forehead, on either side of your nose, in your upper jaws and teeth, or between your eyes. While suffering with coronavirus, one man said that his sinuses were agony. Connor Reed, a resident of the Chinese city of Wuhan, is believed to be one of the first Brits to have caught coronavirus. Connor, who is originally from North Wales, contracted the virus in November  - a whole month before Chinese authorities officially announced the outbreak. After  days of feeling ill, recording his day-to-day le in his diary, Connor was treated at a hospital that diagnosed him as being one of the first people to get the new strain of coronavirus, Covid-. The -year-old English teacher described his symptoms starting out with just a snfle which he tried to medicate using hot whisky and honey, before succumbing to what he believed was the flu around a week in. In his diary he wrote: This is no longer just a cold. I ache all over, my head is thumping, my eyes are burning, my throat is constricted. He said his aposbones were achingapos and he had a aposhacking coughapos.  A few days later, the pneumonia had gone but he said he ached asIaposve been run over by a steamroller. My sinuses are agony, and my eardrums feel ready to pop. I know I shouldn’t but I’m massaging my inner ear with cotton buds, trying to take the pain away. Just a couple of days later, he reported feeling better. . Ear pressure As Connor discovered, another of the symptoms of coronavirus is pressure in the ears that make them feel ready to pop. But unlike Connor, you shouldnapost be pushing cotton buds into your ears to try and relieve the pressure - youaposll end up doing more harm than good. Because many of the virusapos symptoms are flu-like, this ear pressure is most likely to be caused by clogged up tubes in your ear thanks to all the nastiness of a virus inside your system. More scientically speaking, when the Eustachian tubebecomes clogged, you can feel fullness and pressure in your ear, as well as some muffled hearing and sometimes even earache. These ear congestion symptoms can also be caused by problems in your middle ear or the ear canal that affects the eardrum. So sometimes itaposs just a case of waiting for the virus to pass. . Thumping headache Again, a pounding or thumping headache is sometimes typical of a bad cold or the flu. But it can also be a symptom of other things too, such as tiredness, dehydration and even a lack of iron in your system.  So donapost go panicking straight awayyouaposve got a bit of a sore head. Make sure you drink plenty of water, get plenty of rest and try to relax. Take time away from your computer screen and avoid alcohol. Health experts are advising anyone suspected of suffering with coronavirus symptoms to take Paracetamol instead of ibuprofen, but keep yourself updated on all the latest NHS information, as things may change as more tests are done on the virus.. . Burning eyes The best way to describe the sensation of burning eyes is to compare it with the itchiness and irritation you would faceyou suffer with hayfever or other allergies. This kind of itchiness and irritation can also come about when you’re among smog, smoke, dust, mold and even animals. The only dference between these cases and the cases described by coronavirus patients, is the fact that the virus triggers this symptom and not an external factor like pets. . Constricted throat It seems as though patients suffering with COVID- experience a mixture of cold and flu-like symptoms, paired with typical symptoms of a small allergic reaction. A constricted throat can be due to swelling and inflammation, brought about after lots of coughing, which we know to be a common occurrence among coronavirus sufferers.  But a constricted throat can also be caused by an infection, allergic reaction, as well as a iety of other conditions. If you find yourself really struggling to breathe, swallow or find any lumps or bumps you’ve not seen before, you may need to be checked by a doctor immediately. So, it’s wise to keep monitoring your symptoms, in a diary like Connor, so you can see when things are beginning to change. . Aches all over It’s no secret that having a cold or a bout of flu normally comes with feeling achy. And coronavirus is no dferent.  Those falling ill with the virus have described aches and pains all over their body, not just as a result of blocked sinuses, ears or nose, but also in their arms, legs and chest too. Many people will find the current coronavirus outbreak a stressful time, too, and this stress and tension can also worsen these aches and pains. . Lungs that apossound like a paper bagapos If when you breathe, your lungs sound almost crackly, then this could be a sign of something more serious than just your average cold or flu. This sort of noise can often occurthe small air sacs in the lungs fill with fluid, as well as the air you’re breathing in and out. These air sacs filling with fluid can often happen as a result of pneumonia - which is a condition linked to coronavirus. If your breath sounds wheezy, this may be down to an inflammation of the bronchial tubes in your lungs. . Fatigue Another common symptom of Covid-, as well as cold, flu and many viruses in general, is feeling extremely tired or fatigued. Being told to rest is common when you’re ill, but feeling tired and not being able to sleep due to coughs and dficulty breathing, can make things all the more dficult. Jaimuay Sae-ung, , was the first Thai national to contract coronavirus in December last year. Despite having underlying health conditions, including a heart problem, Jaimuay survived the illness after doctors isolated her at a hospital in Thailand for treatment.  Her symptoms included a fever and a bad cough, but she developed pneumonia while in quarantine and her family were worried she may not survive. I only knewafter I came to the hospital, the mother of seven told Sky News. I felt a bit sad, a bit shocked, tired and fatigued and I couldnapost eat. Jaimuay said she argued with doctors and nurses at the hospital because she believed she didnapost need to stay there. After  days, her condition had improved and she was eventually discharged following two negative test results. . Lack of appetite Jaimuay also mentioned not being able to eat while suffering with coronavirus. The saying goes that you should feed a cold and starve a fever, so not managing to eat much may help to burn off coronavirus in the long run. Of course, those who are ill should be sure to keep their energy up. . A fever When coronavirus was first brought to people’s attention, a fever was one of the first symptoms to be on the look out for. It was later advised thatyou had been in contact with, or indeed lived with, anyone who had a fever, you should self-isolate. For some people, this is the only symptom of coronavirus they get. One young man, who did not want to be identied, is being treated for coronavirus in hospital after ing home from a short trip and noticing his temperature had risen, the Irish Mirror reports.  He told the RTE’s Claire Byrne Live show: “The only symptoms I had was, basically, the fever. I didn’t have any respiratory problem, any lung inflammation, any cough, any sneezing so was just the fever. “I actually feel great now. I had a fever for a couple of days and now from Friday, I don’t have any more symptoms and so I am just here in the hospital being tested for the virus. The man said he was a “little worried” but “not scared” and said he can not leave the hospital until two consecutive tests show he has tested negative for Covid-. He added: The only thing I would say is that it is boring, I am here and I just have to read, watch some movies and that’s the only things. Apart from that I am fine.” . Tight chest and coughing spells Another of the first symptoms of coronavirus to be identied, was a tight chest and persistent cough. Many scientists and health professionals have suggested that the water droplets passed through a cough or sneeze are the main cause of the virus spreading, which is why they have advised the entire population to wash their hands, cough and sneeze into a flexed elbow and use tissues wherever possible. Having these symptoms on their own has meant that some people with the virus have not considered the possibility that they may have Covid-. Those experiencing coronavirus symptoms, such as a cough or fever, should self-isolate for  days.You should stay at homeyou or or anyone in your household has a high temperature or a new and continuous cough - evenitaposs mild. Everyone in your household must stay at home for  days and keep away from others DO NOT go to your GP or hospital.Go to NHS.UK to check your symptoms and follow the specialist medical advice.Only call you canapost get online, you feel like you canapost cope at home, or your symptoms do not get better after the seven days. If you are pregnant you should call you have any concerns about yourself or unborn baby during self-isolation. Pregnant women are advised to contact their midwe, out-of-hours helplines or a maternity team who will provide information on whether you need to go to hospital.  Carl Goldman from Santa Clarita, who was on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship and later tested positive for coronavirus, said the virus aposhasnapost been that badapos. In an article for The Washington Post, he explained that he developed a fever and aposa bit of a coughapos during his flight back to America and was quarantined on his . I am in my late s, and the sickest I’ve ever been was when I had bronchitis several years ago. That laid me out for a few days, he said. This has been much easier: no chills, no body aches. I breathe easily, and I don’t have a stuffy nose. My chest feels tight, and I have coughing spells.  If I were at home with similar symptoms, I probably would have gone to work as usual. His treatment, he said, consisted of what felt like gallons and gallons of Gatorade. . Jet lag One coronavirus sufferer described her symptoms as feeling like jet lag - a temporary sleep problem that can affect anyone who quickly travels across multiple time zones. Your body has its own internal clock, or circadian rhythms, that sends signals to your body telling it when to stay awake and when to sleep. Similar to fatigue, the feeling of jet lag can make people feel that they’re not quite with it or even a bit spaced out. Bridget Wilkins, who lives in London, flew to Australia via Singapore for a friendaposs wedding last week - but is now quarantined in a hospital in Brisbane after testing positive for coronavirus. The -year-old said the symptoms she had suffered included a headache, a sore throat and tiredness. Without realising she had contracted the virus, she believed her symptoms were from jetlag after her long flight. Speaking to Australiaaposs NEWS she said she had still had symptoms but aposnothing more than thatapos. “There’s a lot of hype and hysteria on the news around coronavirus,” she said. “There should be. It’s very serious, particularly for the elderly and people with existing conditions. But I think we have to calm down, because for most people, like myself, it is just a long cold that we can shake off.

A desperate paramedic who had been out saving lives at work was left staring at empty shelves in a Sainsburyaposs in a picture Environment Secretary George Eustice insisted we have enough food and supplies to go round and warned stockpilers to “be considerate”. But his words fell on deaf ears as coronavirus fears fuelled a “crazy” rush to hoard food, medicines, sanitary products and other essentials. Some stores had scenes of “bedlam” and were stripped bare within  minutes, while staff were abused over queue s and limits on purchases. There were even reports of fights between shoppers and attacks on workers. And some inconsiderate hoarders crashed early-morning slots reserved for the elderly and vulnerable to visit and grab vital supplies. One social media user said: “I was in a store last night and the shelves were bare. The locusts had descended.” Posting a picture of full shelves yesterday morning, they added: “Your night sht shelf-stackers are heroes.” David Williams of shopworkers’ union Usdaw said: “Shopworkers are on the front line. There are incidents of mass scrabbling when stuff goes on to the shelves. People are working out when the lorries arrive at the stores and are waiting for the products to come out.” Supermarkets and supply chains are struggling to cope with the fallout from the pandemic.Some stores are cutting back on their product ranges and moving staff from other duties to get stock on shelves as fast as possible. Shoppers queued from dawn yesterday across the nation to be first in line when doors opened. While supermarkets were overrun, people were urged to use smaller shops, which are often better stocked. Online giant Ocado had to temporarily halt taking orders due to high demand. The firm’s Duncan Tatton-Brown said: “We have had hours with -times the normal level of transactions.” In the Commons, Mr Eustice called for calm and rubbished the idea that supplies are low. He told MPs: “We have signicant resilience in our food supply chain in that food manufacturers are used to coping with increases in demand. There isn’t a shortage of food.” But in Slough, Berks, many shelves in a Tesco Extra were emptied in half an hour. It was a similar story at a nearby Sainsbury’s, which reserved the first hour for the elderly – but was swarmed by younger people staff could not stop. Deborah McIntyre went looking for ingredients to bake a cake for her th wedding anniversary but there were no eggs or flour. She got only one item on her list – margarine.The -year-old said: “This is just crazy. People are panicking and there’s no need. Why can’t they just buy what they need ” Kath Blayden, , was looking for paracetamol, long-le milk, loo rolls and tinned pineapple. Staring at the empty painkiller shelf, she said: “I have never seen anything like this. People are being greedy and I think this will only get worse. There’s enough to go aroundthey weren’t so selfish.” At Tesco, Marion Koppel, , said: “I’m trying to do my normal shopping but people are panic buying so much they are making it impossible. “I don’t know what has got into everyone – please just calm down.” Kathryn Hopkins, , from Doncaster said: “Some stores are opening early for pensioners but in our region their free bus pass is not valid until after .am.” The carer said she had tried to do a shop on Wednesday but failed – despite visiting three stores before am.She said: “It must be a terrible shock to older people who turn up and the shelves are empty. A lot of the basics are nowhere to be seen.” Retired teacher Lesley Thornton said she nearly wept when she saw a couple in their s only manage to get a bag of hotdog buns at a Sainsbury’s in North East London. The -year-old said: “It was bedlam and makes me feel so frustrated. It was so shocking how empty the store was. The whole frozen section was gone. But I saw kind gestures too, with people handing over goods they’d got to others who were looking for it.” But shoppers at a Waitrose in Sandbach, Cheshire, were outraged after a customer piled up a trolley with toilet rolls – and then offered to sell an OAP a pack for £. The elderly woman had gone in for a pack normally costing less than £ but the shelves had been cleared.

Scientists at Public Health England could give the go-ahead for human testing well ahead of the usual time frame for drug development. The health agency is only due to start preliminary evaluation of the vaccine on animals next week. PHE researchers have collaborated with teams at Liverpool and Bristol universities to create an exact replica of Covid- for use in the testing process. Those behind the vaccine have been given permission to commence human trials before animal tests are complete, thereported, in a bid to accelerate the development process. Permission was granted after similar vaccines developed for other diseases were proved safe in human trials. Professor Adrian Hill, head of the Jenner Institute at Oxford, told the: We are conscious that a vaccine is needed as soon as possible and certainly by June-July when we expect a big peak in mortality. He added: This is not a normal situation. We will follow all standard trial safety requirements but as soon as we have a vaccine thataposs working we anticipate there will be an accelerated pathway to get it deployed to save lives. The more vaccine we can provide the sooner the better.  The team at the Jenner Institute only began work on the drug on January  this year. Earlier this month, Anthony Fauci, the director of the USaposs National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he expected it would be at least  to  months before a coronavirus vaccine is widely available. The Jenner Institute said it had based the drug on an adenovirus vaccine vector based on an adenovirus isolated from a chimpanzee.  An adenovirus is a group of viruses that typically infect membranes of the eyes, respiratory tract, urinary tract, intestines and nervous system. The Jenner Institute said: Chimpanzee adenoviral vectors are a very well-studied vaccine type, having been used safely in thousands of subjects, from one week to  years of age, in vaccines targeting over  dferent diseases. It said among its advantages is that it can generate a strong immune response from one dose and is safe to use on people with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes. PHE has been awarded , US dollarsby the US Food and Drug Administrationto help finance its role in evaluating the vaccine. The grant is part of the US governmentaposs plans to help bolster the global response to the pandemic, PHE said. The funding follows a request from international foundation the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovationsfor PHE to assist in evaluating dferent vaccines under development around the world. Professor Miles Carroll, deputy director of the National Infection Service at PHE, said: We look forward to continuing to work with world-leading academic and pharmaceutical partners to accelerate progress towards safe and effective interventions to limit the impact of this new infection as rapidly as possible. Boris Johnson revealed at a press conference on Thursday that the first British patient had been put in a randomised trial for a treatment for coronavirus.

Staff claim they have not been told about the coronavirus risk at the facility. One anonymously said: Nobody knows what is going on and itaposs making people frightened.  We have not had a single communication to tell us what is happening, and every day more rooms are sealed off. Everyone here is expected to put our lives on the line for the Navy. We just want the Navy to level with us and tell us what the risk is. A Ministry of Defence source said the iety of dferent private companies and Navy units that operate the base made it dficult to tell all staff. HMNB Clyde is home to , service personnel,  of their families and , civilian workers, mainly from engineering firm Babcock International. The Linton Block is opposite the aposSupermessapos - one of the baseaposs major leisure hubs.  There are separate bars for officers and sailors, restaurants, cafes and shops, with a bowling alley, ski slope, swimming pool and a gym. However according to personnel serving at the site, the hub is now seen as a breeding ground for Covid- and most faciilties are being closed down in preparation for the worst.

Chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty and the UKaposs chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance yesterday reiterated calls for younger people, especially in London, to heed government warnings. And they said the coronavirus wreaking havoc round the globe and responsible now for more than , deaths worldwide can be severe for under-s. Officials are reportedly fearful that complacency among younger generations could curb government efforts to contain the virus through social distancing measures. Brits have been told to work from home where possible, avoid any unnecessary travel and stop going to pubs and restaurants.  It is reported that the government is still considering enforcing tougher restrictions in London to keep people inside, including bar closures, although a total lockdown is not thought to be imminent.The capital is home , of the UKaposs , confirmed cases, with the Prime Minister conceding that London is a few weeks ahead of the rest of the country.  Prof Whitty said: There are some young people who have ended up in intensive care, or who have ended up with severe disease around the world. But I think it’s important that we don’t give the impression that every single young person is just going to breeze through this.  The great majority will have a mild or moderate disease and will get through this. But there will be some young people who will have severe disease, even though they are otherwise young and healthy - and we have seen cases around the world. We need to be aware that this is not a trivial infection for everybody, eventhey are a young adult. Sir Patrick said: Unless everybody looks at the measures introduced by the government on social distancing it doesnapost have the effect. So what we absolutely shouldnapost encourage is the idea that young people can somehow ignore it because they’re going to be fine. The mixing in pubs and restaurants that we’ve said are really a part of allowing the disease to spread needs to stop.

She said: Iaposm in the intensive care unit and I canapost breathe without this. Theyaposve had to sew that into my artery. Iaposve got a cannula, another cannula and a catheter. Iaposm actually ten times better than what I was before. Iaposve lost count of the days. If anyone still smokes, put the cigarettes down because Iaposm telling you now you need your f***ing lungs and, please, none of you take any chances, I mean it, becauseit gets really bad than youaposre going to end up here. My body is fighting this so once again donapost take any chances. As Tara speaks, she can be seen gasping for breath and struggling to speak due to the lack of oxygen. She first begun feeling unwell  days ago after a holiday to Krakow, Poland, with her husband and two daughters. She was first diagnosed with a chest infection and given antibiotics but rushed to hospital after her health deteriorated last week. Husband, -year-old Richard, said her first symptoms were stabbing pains in her back and lungs, which made it dficult to breathe. Days later, she started to shiver and shake despite taking paracetamol and ibuprofen. Tara wasnapost swabbed the first time they went to hospital as they hadnapost ed from a high-risk country.  Richard told the MailOnline : She was rushed straight into intensive care and at one point we thought she might have to be sedated and go on a ventilator but fortunately she was strong enough for that not to happen. But she was still very poorly. She wanted to make it clear for others that it isnapost just the elderly who are at risk from this virus which is why she made that video. He added that Tara frequently goes to the gym and has no underlying health conditions. He is unsureshe picked up the iillness while on holiday or from a public space like the gym.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA man has become one of only  people in the world to ever recover from locked-in syndrome. Shaun Wilde, , was in a vegetative state for three months and could only communicate with family and doctors by blinking at a letter board. He was unable to eat, drink or talk, but was still breathing and conscious as he was trapped in his frozen body after a blood clot in his brain stem caused a severe stroke. Locked-in syndrome affects around one per cent of stroke victims and around  per cent of sufferers die within four months. But now, as one of only  people in the world to have recovered from the syndrome, Shaun can walk and talk - and has even ed to work. He goes to the gym three mornings a week, has physio at home and has acupuncture to boost his energy. Shaun, of Ballabeg in the Isle of Man, said: “I sometimes get out of breath when I talk for too long, but I do it. “I use a walking stick when I’m out and about, but I walk around the house and work unaided. “I know I’m making progress. I appreciate things that people take for granted - walking, talking, the basic things you only notice when you can’t. “Psychologically you can be affected more than you realise. “When it happened I was probably in a state of shock.” Shaun said that he is “concerned” that coronavirus measures such as self-isolation could see him locked in again. “I have not been told to work from home yet or self-isolate andI did, then I will deal with itit happens,” he said. Shaun’s le was turned upside down when he suffered a stroke caused by a blood clot in his brain stem aged just  on August , . He woke up feeling sick and light headed and went for a walk to clear his head, oblivious of how serious his symptoms were. He went to his mum’s house to watch football on the television, but when his condition worsened, she called an ambulance. Shaun added: “I didn’t think for one minute it was the beginning of a stroke. “It’s a bit surreal. You hear and read about it, but don’t think it will happen to you.  “I was in a dream-like state, I guess it was two weeks before I came round.” As he became trapped in his own body, Shaun communicated through blinking and began to use a letter board, looking at letters on a board and spelling out sentences. He added: “It was frustrating. You take it for granted, asking for things saying things, taking part in conversation.” In December, he was transferred to the Walton Centre in Liverpool, a specialist neurology hospital. Shaun added: “I started off not being able to speak, then I started moving my toes and legs slightly. “It wasn’t to a great degree but enough for them to think I was showing signs of development. “It wasn’t great development, but it showed some progress was being made.” His days were filled with a schedule of rehabilitation involving physio, occupational and speech therapy. His weight dropped to eight stone, from  stone before his stroke, as he was fed by a tube up his nose for eight weeks then a peg tube into his stomach. But incredibly, he began to make progress. Shaun added: “I started to put two or three words together and I built on that. “Slowly but surely I started to be able to make sentences and speak a bit faster.

The generous offer comes after hundreds of people face financial ruin as businesses close or make devastating job cuts due to the killer bug which has claimed  lives in the UK. Martin said: My hope is to get the money distributed within the next couple of weeks, and Iaposm looking for projects that are up and running, or are in the process of being set up – as we want to deliver help at speed. To make this happen – as Iaposm tied up with TV and MSE work providing direct coronavirus help information – I have recruited Archna, a trusted former senior member of the MSE team, and Jonathan, a charity specialist, to review and approve the applications and ensure help is spread across the UK as best as possible. The financial guru has also appealed for donations of at least £, from high net worth iniduals or organisations for his charity fund. Iaposd be more than happy for the team Iaposve set up to facilitate the distribution of your donation too  – and we can bespoke ityou have a particular area you want to focus on, he said. Adding: That isnapost for a second to snub donations that are smaller than that, charities really do need them, but we donapost have the infrastructure to deal with them, so please do give directly to the charities yourself.

All of the major UK chains have made changes to their opening hours to cope with staffing issues, and to ensure that the most vulnerable are given the space and opportunity to get their essentials. And competition laws will be temporarily relaxed to allow supermarkets to collaborate in feeding the nation during the coronavirus crisis. Retailers will be able to pool staff, share data on stock levels, and share distribution depots and delivery vans as the Government seeks to ease restrictions under the exceptional circumstances. The temporary relaxation only permits retailers to work together for the sole purpose of feeding the nation as they face a strain from intense demand amid panic buying, ministers said. The p plastic bag charge will also be waived for online purchases to hasten deliveries, and driversapos hours will be relaxed so more food can be delivered to stores. Environment Secretary George Eustice listened to the calls of retailers and confirmed elements of the law would be waived during a meeting with chief executives on Thursday. Weaposve listened to the powerful arguments of our leading supermarkets and will do whatever it takes to help them feed the nation, he said. By relaxing elements of competition laws temporarily, our retailers can work together on their contingency plans and share the resources they need with each other during these unprecedented circumstances. We welcome the measures supermarkets are already taking to keep shelves stocked and supply chains resilient, and will continue to support them with their response to coronavirus. The Government said legislation will shortly be laid in Parliament to amend parts of the Competition Act , which prevents types of anti-competitive behaviour.

She was right to say that all of us need to change our habitswe wish to protect our loved ones, friends and neighbours. Her Majesty’s calm and measured intervention stands in contrast to Boris Johnson’s comments yesterday, when the Prime Minister struck a flippant tone when he said he wanted to “send the virus packing”. Downing Street is leaving questions unanswered and sending out mixed messages. By telling people to stay away from pubs, restaurants and entertainment venues, the Government has left millions of retail, leisure and hospitality staff at risk of losing their jobs. If you put people’s livelihoods on the line, you must explain how they will survive financially. Everyone accepts this is an unprecedented challenge for the Government. But Mr Johnson risks losing the public’s trusthe does not sharpen up his administration’s response.  Race shame The Windrush scandal failed a generation that helped rebuild this country in the post-war years. The way they were treated by Home Office ministers and officials was shameful. As the report by Wendy Williams makes clear, the department was “institutionally ignorant” when it came to race. Innocent people’s lives were turned upside down because of the aggressive immigration policy pursued by the Government. While the apology by Home Secretary Priti Patel is welcome, it does not go far enough. The report’s recommendations must be implemented in full, and that includes ending the hostile environment towards migrants. If Ms Patel’s words are genuine then she needs to prove it in her actions.

But as most of the world goes through periods of isolation and shutdown, we take a look at how other countries have handled widespread closures. The virus had its first recorded cases in the Chinese city of Wuhan toward the end of last year, which saw officials put the area on lockdown in January to help stop the spread. Although this was greeted with astonishment, it looks to have gradually proven successful - now there are some fears of a apossecond waveapos once le s to normal and people begin mixing again. But authorities in China now say there has been no record of new infections of Covid- in the virus epicentre or in the surrounding Hubei province, for the first time since the outbreak began. In the UK, itaposs believed tens of thousands of people are infected, with the death toll now standing at .  Prime Minister Boris Johnson most recently announced the closure of schools from Monday and the cancellation of exams.Transport for Londonannounced up to  underground stations would now be closed, with a reduced service running from Friday, and night tubes axed.London Mayor Sadiq Khan warned Londoners they should not be travelling unless they “really, really have to”, but insisted the network must remain open to aid frontline health workers.Although Boris Johnson advised members of the public to avoid pubs, clubs, restaurants and theatres, chatter on social media says some residents in the capital are still heading out as they usually would. But could the government impose a lockdown soon, whether it be London or the rest of the nation  And what could it look like  Also, what does a lockdown really mean  While new stringent measures by the government are being revealed almost daily to help tackle the outbreak, Mr Johnson has warned they wonapost hesitate to introduce tougher action to protect peopleaposs health when necessary. In his daily press conference, he said: Weaposve always said that we are going to do the right measures at the right time. We live in a land of liberty, we don’t tend to impose those sort of restriction. But I have to tell you: we will rule nothing out. We will bring forward further and faster measures where necessary. He added: I think a lot of people are making a real heroic effort to comply with the advice that we have given but as I’ve said tonight and in the past few days we keep everything under continuous review and we will not hesitate to bring forward further and faster measures where we think that is necessary. Ending his conference by reiterating more measures were on the table, he said: It would be quite wrong to do so…we do not rule out taking further and faster measures in due course.”  Italy was the first to head into lockdown as it became the worst affected country in the region, with now more than , confirmed cases and nearly , deaths. On March , the Italian government shut down the northern areas which were worst hit, but just two days later, the control was extended over the rest of the country with measures in place until April . Under the rules, residents are only allowed to travel unless urgent, veriable work situations and emergencies or health reasons. This means employers have been urged to put their staff on leave to avoid work-related travelthey cannot work from home. Schools and universities shut down, with exams cancelled, however religious institutions have stayed open as long as people stay one metre away from one another.  All sports venues, museums, and venues such as cinemas and clubs have been closed, as gatherings have been banned, while only supermarkets and pharmacies remain open. Those diagnosed are not allowed to leave their homes at all, and those suffering from symptoms are encouraged to stay at home also. Comments on social media show residents are taking precautions very seriously, with video footage being widely shared of people singing together and joining in with group workouts, but from safe distances on their inidual balconies. in France their lockdown in began from noon on Tuesday for  days.We are at war, a public health war,” President Emmanuel Macron said in an address on Monday as he declared the nationwide lockdown to fight the virus that has infected more than , people in the country and killed . As reported by local media outlet France , travel to work is allowed as long as the work is essential and cannot be done from home, shopping for groceries and brief outings for exercise is accepted, along with health-related appointments such as heading to the pharmacy. Residents are also allowed to leave their houses for imperative family reasons, such as looking after children and the elderly. However when leaving their homes, they must carry a document certying why they have left the house and failure to do so will result in a fine. Some , police and guards are currently patrolling the region to enforce the lockdown. France had already closed down its restaurants and bars from Saturday, and schools and universities closed on Monday. Spain has been in an official state of emergency since last Friday and therefore declared a nationwide lockdown by closing all businesses except for essential services, such as pharmacies and supermarkets, in an effort to curb the spread of COIVD-.

Katherine Wilson, an American living in Italy, has written a list of dos and donaposts advising parents of what she wishes sheaposd done before the country went into lockdown.Italy is the country most afflicted by the dreaded virus in Europe with over , confirmed cases, the Daily Record reports. Today their death toll became higher than China, where the outbreak originated.The country is now on total lockdown meaning  million people are confined to their homes. But the mum-of-two, who is based in Rome, says before the Italian Government enforced lockdown and just advised social distancing, people, including her, were not listening.  She said: Our teens were stir crazy at home. Their friends were going out, and the government hadn’t told us No!  So, reasoning that this was a disease that didn’t strike teenagers, we told them to wash their hands and unleashed them onto the sidewalks and piazzas   into other peoples’ cars and homes.Writing on grownandflown, Katherine says other countries should not make the same misguided choices Italy did and follow coronavirus advice. She said: Ten days in, I feel that it is my duty to compile a list of Do’s and Don’ts. One that I wish I’d had only a couple of weeks ago. DO: Keep them at homeThe only  thing that could have savedthis tragedy in Italy is social distancing–a couple of weeks ago. I’m not talking about a high five instead of a handshake, or grandkids not hugging their grandparents. I’m talking about not being in the proximity of another human being who is not your immediate family.DON’T: Pay attention to what other parents are doing.When your teen complains that other parents are letting their kids go out and party, your reply will be something along the lines of “Where are my Beats ” Tune him her out. If in a few weeks reality reflects that you were too conservative, then Hallelujah.DO: Relax the usual screentime rulesGlobal technology gave this virus the possibility to travel at the speed of light, and it also gave us Netflix. Nobody is expecting you to entertain stimulate engage when there is a global pandemic. Biology class will become Instagram which will become TikTok which will become Houseparty. Accept it.DONaposT Panic buyThere is no reason to hoard. In Italy, we are allowed to go to the supermarket every daywe need to, and the shelves are full.Instead of stocking up on toilet paper, buy food that you’ve always wanted to cook but never had the time. In lockdown, you’ll have time to let things simmer, soak and rise. DON’T: Read Covid- updates obsessively This thing can become a sick reality show – addictive and horrying. It can encourage you to spin out apocalyptic scenarios. We know that all we can do is wash our hands, take care of our health, and stay at home. Our grandparents were asked to go far away and die for their country. Stay at home  That is doable. It has to be, because there is no choice.

We’re just taking it day by day, trying to maintain fitness and looking after ourselves as best we can.“It’s a really hard situation to explain. It doesn’t feel real.“We’ve just been told football’s now stopped and we don’t know when we’ll be playing again.“Everything’s just been shut down all of a sudden and it’s a really weird feeling. It’s not really sunk in yet.”Dundee have gone six matches unbeaten, with five consecutive clean sheets, and sit third in the table.The Dens men are just four points behind second-placed Inverness Caley Thistle, who they were due to play this weekend before the cancellations.Forster said: “The season as a whole hasn’t been good enough for us but the way things were going recently, it was starting to look positive for us with regard to hitting form in the lead-up to the play-offs.“There was a real bit of optimism building and it’s frustrating that that momentum has just been stopped with no indication of when we’re going to be able to play again, andwe are going to be able to play again this season at all.“I’m a big believer that whatever is going to be will be. You can only worry about things you can control # and this situation is definitely out with our control.”The loan signing of Scotland international Christophe Berra from Hearts has made a huge dference.Berra, , was bombed out by Daniel Stendel after the former Barnsley manager’s Tynecastle appointment in December.Forster said: “Big Christophe has done well for us. He’s got a lot of experience and he’s played at a high level so it’s good for defenders like myself to play alongside him.“You can learn loads from a guy like that. We’re similar types of players, we both like to defend first and foremost.“We pride ourselves on clean sheets and things were going reasonably well for us before the shutdown.”Forster – who was in Celtic’s academy before making the senior breakthrough at Hibs – feels he was held back by injuries in the early part of his career and he is delighted to put that frustration behind him.He said: “I feel the best I’ve ever felt physically and mentally.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance.

member for Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale has resorted to Freedom of Information requests in a bid to get answers.A row erupted last month between the Conservative-led administration at Scottish Borders Council and the SNP government at Holyrood over funding for a replacement school.Claims by council leader Shona Haslam and education portfolio holder Carol Hamilton that the Scottish Government had rejected a plea for help was angrily refuted by both Ms Grahame and the Cabinet Secretary for Education, John Swinney.It emerged that no formal request for financial assistance had been made to the Scottish Government ahead of the claims being made.And it was several days later that Councillor Haslam eventually sent a letter - not in her role as council leader but as a ward councillor for Tweeddale East.Details of funding for a replacement Peebles High have remained sketchy with pound million being required to plug the gap between an expected pound million insurance pay out and the estimated demolition and rebuild costs of around pound million.Over the past few weeks Christine Grahames attempts for further clarication over funding from the council leader has been met with the cold shoulder.Ms Grahame told us: \"I have asked a number of follow-up questions to establish how plans for Peebles High would be progressing, however Councillor Haslam has now responded to say that she is not prepared to answer my questions.\"At the heart of this is the question of getting a proper replacement for Peebles High School that serves the school community properly.\"The issue should never have been made party political and I remain hugely frustrated that Councillor Haslam decided to issue a press release attacking the Scottish Government on February , apparently before any request was even made.\"How does trying to score cheap points against the SNP with a factually inaccurate press release serve the school community or indeed foster a co-operative approach between the council and the government \"It is behaviour that, frankly, should be beneath a council leader.\"Although Scottish Borders Council claim their decision to impose a record hike in council tax from next month is to help fund a new replacement school in Peebles, it is expected that money will still be required from Holyrood.But government officials have yet to receive any request from Newtown St Boswells.Ms Grahame added: \"As Irsquom sure Councillor Haslam well knows, her letter of February , issued after she claimed the Scottish Government had refused funding, does not constitute a formal funding request, given the lack of any details.\"And I remain unclear why shersquos written as a local ward councillor rather than in her role as leader of Scottish Borders Council.\"I have yet to see any correspondence that shows any formal request to the Scottish Government, let alone anything that constitutes it refusing funding, and Councillor Haslam is now refusing to share any further information.\"It is her complete refusal to engage with me on this matter which has led me to put in a formal FOI request to try to get to the bottom of whatrsquos actually going on.\"This is causing a huge deal of concern in the school community and I, like them, simply want to know what is actually being done to support replacing the school, all politics aside.We did put all the points raised by Ms Grahame to Councillor Haslam.She told us: \"Public consultations are ongoing with parents and users of the school and we will be taking these plans forward with the Scottish Government in a constructive manner."},{"url":null,"title":"a72-closed-nine-days-near-peebles","story":"MOTORISTS on the A are facing major disruption and y ersions from Monday.Daytime closures are set to take place

During her stay, she was gravely ill after falling off her horse into a bog. The house is now a four-star visitor attraction telling the story of Scotlandrsquos tragic queen.Born on December ,, Mary was just six days old when her father, King James V of Scotland died and she became queen.As the new monarch was so young, Scotland was then governed by a succession of regents while Mary spent her childhood in France.Mary ed to Scotland in , a widow. Four years later, she married her half-cousin, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, and in June  they had a son, James.In , her second husband was murdered. James Hepburn, th Earl of Bothwell, who was generally believed to have been behind the murder, was acquitted. He abducted Mary and they married in a Protestant wedding service just twelve days after orcing his first we.Theirs was not a popular union and Catholics, not recognising orce, therefore, considered the marriage to be unlawful.Following an uprising against them, Mary was imprisoned in Loch Leven Castle and, on July , , she was forced to abdicate in favour of her son who was just one year old.Mary tried to regain the throne, but was unsuccessful. She sought the help of Queen Elizabeth I of England, but Elizabeth thought she was a threat to her own throne and she imprisoned Mary in a series of English castles and manor houses.In , after more than nineteen years in custody, Mary was beheaded for plotting to assassinate Elizabeth.What will you see The house sits in attractive gardens which are home to some of Jedburghrsquos famous pear trees, descendants of the original pear trees planted around Jedburgh Abbey in the early s.Inside the towerhouse, a display of paintings, artefacts, and textiles associated with Mary explores not only her le and times, but the cult that has grown up around her.The period feel inside the house has been preserved with thoughtful design, which allows the story of Maryrsquos le to be told in an engaging way.The Rogues Gallery introduces the iniduals in the drama of Maryrsquos le, while the Last Letter Room reveals her final thoughts before her execution.VisitingThe museum is situated on Queen Street, near Canongate car park, where parking is free.

Keith Mitchell picked up the ball on the left and released McFadyen down the left flank, from where he produced a fine low cross which substitute Donald McCallum struck low into the Neilston net with his left foot to make it -.But with some  minutes to play and the Pupils cruising, Neilston halved the deficit, a visiting striker gambling on Ferguson’s kick, and blocking it, the resulting break of the ball landing in his path for an easy finish, providing a leline to the men from East Renfrewshire.But their hopes of an equaliser would quickly fade, after a Neilston player-coach – already booked on the touchline for dissent ­– was sent off for a foul on Mitchell within a minute of entering the field of play.The same player then proceeded to throw a running punch as he left the field, before both teams became embroiled in an on-pitch melee.After the fisticuffs fizzled out, the game of football resumed and a healthy Kintyre Park crowd watched a settled final  minutes of action as the Pupils did enough to seal a welcome three points, over the team they had beaten on the road in front of the BBC Scotland cameras a month previously.Finally, midfielder Ryan Gilchrist, enjoying a regularto first-team action, was given the man-of-the-match award, with the creative energy of McFadyen another highlight for the Pupils.Tomorrowthe Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils travel to Busby on league duty, with kick-off at pm.

Every year, as the summer faded into autumn, it gave its gt of apples to anyone who happened to pass. Children from the local village who were always hungry would sit under it and eat ripe apples until they had tummy ache. Old folk would come and collect the apples to make pies, sauces and chutney.When the apples from the lower branches had been eaten, the children would climb and pick the ones higher up. It was a game to catch them and put them in a basket.There were so many apples that the older children had to carry the heavy baskets down to the village and shared the apples with everyone.The tree gave so many apples that everyone in the village had as many as they could eat or use. There were always plenty left over on the ground for the animals and insects who also feasted on the fallen ripe fruit. Thankfully nobody owned the tree, it had seeded itself many years ago on the verge of the road that led to the village.Then one year, a traveller arrived just as the apple tree was beginning to bear fruit. He sat under the tree and admired the beauty of it. The apples were ripening in the sun and one of them fell by his feet. He picked it up and ate it. It was crisp and sweet and really delicious.A group of children arrived from the village. ldquoHello mister, they said with a smile, ldquowersquove come to pick apples. They set about picking the most reachable ripe apples, while of course eating some of them in the process.ldquoWhat delicious apples, I must tell my we and children about them, said the traveller as he set off along the road.ldquoHere, said one of the children, holding out a handful of apples. ldquoThese are really ripe, give them to your family. We have more than enough to carry.The traveller smiled. ldquoHow kind, he said. He put them in his pockets and went on his way.But that evening, the child who had given the apples to the traveller was chastised by her parents. ldquoWhy did you do that  Now that man will come back with his family and take our apples.ldquoBut the tree gives us more apples than we can eat, the girl said, ldquosurely a few can be shared with people outside the village. Besides, the tree is by the side of the road, arenrsquot the apples for everyone, thatrsquos what yoursquove always said ldquoYes, they are for everyone, her father replied, ldquobut not just for anyone.His daughter was confused by this answer she didnrsquot understand what it meant. However, it seemed such a small and unimportant issue that she said nothing more of it. She knew that there would be more than enough apples for everyone, and even anyone.A few days later, when the girlrsquos grandmother went to collect ripe apples for a pie, she met the stranger with his we and two children. They had a small basket full of apples. The family were friendly and greeted the grandmother, but she ed a forced smile. She quickly collected her apples and rushed home.She told about the strangerrsquos family collecting the apples and the girlrsquos father was angry.ldquoSee, he said to his daughter, ldquoI told you they were not for just anyone. Now there will be none left for everyone .But his daughter was still confused. There were always many hundreds of apples. ldquoYou are young and donrsquot understand, he said. ldquoTomorrow we will get up early and make sure we can collect our share of the apples.The following day the family were up at the crack of dawn. They took all the baskets they could and went to the apple tree. Their neighbours peered out of the window, wondering what the family were doing.Then they saw them at the apple tree, filling many baskets of ripe apples. Later in the morning, some children from the village joined them.One of them went to pick up an apple that had just fallen. But the grandmother rushed and snatched it first and put it in her basket. So the child just smiled and gently shook a branch and another fell.When the familyrsquos baskets were full, they carried them back to the house. But it took them three trips, and the father left his daughter to guard the full baskets while he and the rest of the family carried as much they could.ldquoWhy are you collecting so many apples at once  asked one of her friends.The young girl nibbled her lip and looked at the ground. ldquoDonrsquot know really. My father says Irsquom too young to understand, but he says the apples are for everyone but not just anyone.ldquoWhorsquos anyone then She looked up and shook her head: ldquoNot sure, but anyone is taking our apples so we have to get them first.When the children of the village ed home with their apples, they told their parents what had happened.ldquoAnyone is taking our apples, so there will not be enough for everyone.The next day, more families got up early and set off for the apple tree.This time, the apple picking was very dferent to the way it had always been. In the past, people would pick the apples with each other, because everyone knew there was enough to go round. This time they were picking them for themselves.Fights started and people began to pull apples that were not ripe. So many people climbed onto the branches to get the apples that the tree started to creak.Soon, not a single apple remained on the tree. For the first time ever, there were none left for the animals or insects. Some peoplersquos homes were so full of apples that they hardly had room to move inside the house.Other people, who were not quick enough, had no apples at all. Some of these were people who really needed the apples. But those who had many wouldnrsquot share them for fear that anyone would get them.The houses of the people who collected more apples than they needed became full of fruit flies and other insects as their piles of apples began to rot.But the next year, everyone was ready. They had made big baskets and were determined not to miss out. But when they arrived at the tree it was surrounded by a hastily built wall with a guard at the gate.ldquoWho has done this  they cried.It was the king. He had heard of the apple tree and how crisp and sweet the apples were, so much so that people would fight and hoard the fruit. So, as the richest and most powerful man in the kingdom, he decided he would make sure the apples graced his table.ldquoBut there are more apples than the king can eat! protested the people.ldquoIndeed, said the guard ldquoand the King is generous. He will sell you the apples he does not need.ldquoSell them  But the apples have always been free for everyone!ldquoNot any more, said the guard.The young girl went up to her father. ldquoNow I understand, she said, ldquoanyone is the king."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-gp-practices-east-lothian-introduce-new-measures","story":"North Berwick Health Centre has announced that none of its registered patients have tested positive for coronavirus and asked that people phone the Edington Hospital in advance before paying it a visit.Those who think they have been in contact with someone with the virus are asked to not visit the surgery and phone  for advice.From Monday , all GP and advanced nurse practitionerappointment requests will be triagedby phone call.Lammermuir Medical Practice in Haddington has also taken this approach.People who call either practice will be asked for a summary of their symptoms, information about recent travel andthey have been in direct contact with a person that has been tested positive for coronavirus.The inidualrsquos GP will thenthe call anddeemed safe and necessary, they will then be given an appointment for that afternoon.Those with pre-booked appointments with a GP will be contacted by the health centre to discuss arrangements.North Berwick Health Centre has removed its self check in service -people now have to check in with a receptionist.It has also launched a new online prescription ordering service, those not registered can visit northberwickhealthcentre.scot.nhs.uk news,.htm, download a form, fill it in and hand it in.Lammermuir Medical Practice has also disabled its online appointment service.Tranent Medical Practice has made its surgery pod, a self-service device that allows patients to get their weight and blood pressure checked, unavailable for use.Those with routine appointments at Harbours Medical Practice in Cockenzie are asked to phone the practice, pressing option two, as it is making changes to its routine appointment system.It has also asked that people with symptoms, those who have had contact with an infected person or those who have been in an affected place to not enter any of its buildings.Prestonpans Group Practice has also given this advice and asked that evenpeople have mild symptoms they should not visit the surgery.Meanwhile, Orchard Medical Practice in Haddington is asking all patients not to attend the practice but instead to phone to request an appointment.

Countries with a more dirigiste approach, like France, and outright authoritarians, like China, are taking the lead with hyper-lockdown backed by fines and riot police and sweetened by bold promises that firms and workers will not lose out.Whether that is possible or just vain-glorious hot air from the Elyseacutee Palace remains to be seen. The Scandinavians are taking a typically communitarian approach and promising people that the state will provide calibrated compensation to bolster incomes. But their social safety net was anyway far more generous than in neoliberal Britain.We have the lowest pensions, the lowest sick pay, the most miserly unemployment benefit and income support. And still millions are unable to access it in the gig economy or because they earn too little. Britain after a decade of austerity is a low-wage, low-security economy, and that isnrsquot going to change overnight. Or could it The country will have to be mobilised as in a war. The Second World War was actually very good for the economy ndash or at least good for GDP. The United States turned industry into a weapons-making machine of unprecedented productive power. The Arsenal of Democracy turned out hundreds of warships, thousands of tanks and bombers, millions of guns, billions of pieces of ammunition.Wages and profits soared during the war economy in America and in those parts of the world not actually devastated by the fighting. It was war production that finally brought the Great Depression to an end. Indeed, it arguably laid the groundwork for the next  years of global economic growth.Full employment became the default policy for western governments. John Maynard Keynes was vindicated. We had the NHS, welfare, mass consumerism. Then came inflation, globalisation, neoliberalism and the financial crisis.After , the Government and the Bank of England mobilised some pound. trillion to stave off a collapse of the financial system. That was a very crude way of dealing with the crisis and created moral hazard by rewarding bankers for their reckless greed.But that isnrsquot going to work this time, evenwe wanted it to. The banking system is not the epicentre of this crisis. And the inconvenient truth is that the Covid- crisis is not going to be like the Second World War.Battleships and Sherman tanks are useless against an enemy like a virus. We can produce respirators and intensive care units in large numbers and probably quite quickly ndash quicker than many people seem to believe. But that is not going to make the economy boom.The coronavirus economy is more like the Great Depression, when millions were out of work, demand dried up in the shops, the economy went into a deflationary spiral and even loose credit and money-printing become pointless. Put simply:no one has any money to buy stuff, stuff doesnrsquot get made. Money needs to get into peoplersquos pockets, and fast. What we did for the banks in  we must now do for people.However,you simply throw printed money at a situation like this, the danger is that we will end up with what they have in Zimbabwe: hyperinflation. So we are going to have to create a simulacrum of a war economy. People will have to be remunerated for the socially responsible task of staying at home for the duration.This is a bit like Universal Basic Income, only more so. The trouble with UBI, advocated by right-wing economists like Milton Friedman, in Capitalism and Freedom, and sponsored by tech billionaires today, is that it is essentially universal basic poverty. The sums talked about in the UK, or deployed in the experiments such as in Finland, are nugatory ndash around pound a month. That is too little either to keep body and soul together or provide effective demand in the economy.What we need is more like Universal Average Income. People will need to have something approaching their remuneration pre-Covid to stop them going into spontaneous spending lockdown. If that happens, the demand shock across the economy ndash and itrsquos already happening to airlines, restaurants and hotels ndash could destroy the economy within a couple of months.The good news is that ndash unlike the Second World War ndash we do know who is going to win in the war against Covid , and we know it will not last for many years. Around  per cent of us will get it the vast majority will be fine and the epidemic should be over in  months at the most. We didnrsquot know that about Hitler.In the aftermath, the Government might also have to consider job creation on an industrial scale. One way would be to go with the flow and recruit redundant service workers into the caring professions. The Government could create a kind of National Social Care Service to parallel the NHS. People could retrain as psychologists to treat the growing problem of mental illness.In the s, Franklin D Rooseveltrsquos New Deal measures to combat depression, economic and psychological, included investment in the arts. Unemployed writers, artists and performers were put to work by the Federal Arts Project to improve the quality of le. That gave us Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Orson Welles, John Housman. The arts may seem low on the priority list, set against food supplies and the health service, but it would be a tragedytheatres closed and talent went to waste.We need something to elevate the spirit. There is a serious risk that with the malign effect of social media, people are going to be subject to waves of paranoia, fear and depression. I feel it myself. We live in a spiritually-deprived culture where we are not accustomed to living with death. The churches were where people turned in moments of crisis in the past.

Its central idea was that he was among the first to detect and then ride the wave of populism that led, among other things, to Brexit and the election of Boris Johnson. Scotland played a part in this tale in as much as Mr Cummings, then working for Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, suggested his boss visit Easterhouse in a bold move to show how the party had changed. Easterhouse, then, was the early prototype for the ldquored wall that delivered a huge majority for Mr Johnson in .Going back to those one word assessments of Mr Cummings, Irsquom with the journalist Peter Obone who described him as ldquodull. It is hard to take seriously the idea of Mr Cummings as a genius, the sage of Downing Street, in large part because he has committed the most basic error of any adviser and become the story. Being visible, he is expendable.Moreover, one cannot help thinking thathe was that smart he would be in Boris Johnsonrsquos job and have a lackey of his own. Mr Cummings is not the messiah.

He just happens to be the latest catnip mouse for the media to play with till it gets bored.: Schools to close by end of weekThe main feeling on watching Maitlisrsquos documentary was that the concerns it highlighted were dated and irrelevant. Not so much five minutes ago as five months. Much has been made of how the coronavirus crisis is changing our lives and will have a long term impact in ways we have yet to fully appreciate. I donrsquot know. The triumph and tragedy of humans is that fundamentally we do not change that much. Capable of great kindness and empathy, as in the many people who are volunteering to help others, they can also be the same grubby, panic-buying shower to be seen in every supermarket.That said, the crisis is having an impact on politics. I donrsquot mean the suspension of party hostilities. That will not last. As yesterdayrsquos PMQs showed, there is growing pressure on the UK government to help the poorest and most vulnerable to the same extent that it is aiding business.The crisis is, however, shaping the way Mr Johnson does political business, from the new ministerial structures and implementation committees to the daily televised press briefing. I would not be surprisedthese White House-style events became permanent fixtures, like televised debates during elections, in London and Edinburgh. Any chance to hold governments to account is good for democracy.One way and another, the man who a couple of weeks ago was being slated by critics as a part-time Prime Minister is putting in quite the sht.So, too, is Nicola Sturgeon, and though it is hardly a competition she is coming out of the process better. All over the world the virus crisis is testing leaders and governments as never before. Whatrsquos that Warren Buffett quote  ldquoOnly when the tide goes out do you discover whorsquos been swimming naked.Thus we have the so-called strongmen of politics, from the US president down, exposed as vacillating and unconvincing. The most prized government commodity today is trust, and we can see who inspires it and who does not. Mr Johnson is beginning to look tired and bowed. If this crisis does prove to be a marathon not a sprint he needs to pace himself.If the past weeks show anything about politics it is that in times of stre people still look to inidual leaders for guidance. No-one ever responded to a crisis by saying, ldquoSend for the PMrsquos chief aide. That reliance on leaders is fine, as long as the right man or woman is in the job.From Edinburgh, London and Paris to Tehran, Washington and further afield, we will soon see the proof of that."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-frontline-staff-tests-stepped-prevent-exodus","story":"The Scottish Government says some Covid- testing on healthcare workers has already started at a local level anda national approach is being developed which will scale up these initial efforts.It comes amid speculation that a new four-hour test could be made available in Britain.Scotland reported its third coronavirus death on Wednesdayand First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed schools across Scotland would close by the end of this week as a result of ldquonew advice from Government scientists.They will also close in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.Ms Sturgeon said many schools had reached a point where ldquothey have lost too many staff to continue as normal and would not necessarily reopen after Easter, or even before the summer holidays.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said schools and nurseries across the UK would be expected to accommodate vulnerable children or the children of critical workers, such as NHS staff and police during the closure, with free school meals continuing to be provided to all eligible youngsters.He added that exams would not go ahead as planned in May or June, but that pupils would ldquoget the qualications they deserve.Earlier Mr Johnson told the House of Commons the number of tests that can be carried out each day for coronavirus will be increased from , to ,, with a goal to expand it to , per day in England within four weeks.North of the Border, there are three NHS laboratories currently processing tests and the Scottish Government is working with a range of partners to increase capacity to exceed , tests per day in the coming weeks.A number of options to expand that further, and as quickly as possible, are being explored.The Prime Minister said: ldquoWe are prioritising testing of NHS staff for the obvious reason that we want them to be able to look after everybody  with confidence that theyrsquore not transmitting the disease, and this country is actually far ahead of many other comparable countries in testing huge numbers of people.It comes as a coronavirus test that reveals who has had Covid- but not shown symptoms is close to becoming available in a move being hailed as a ldquogame-changer.The Governmentrsquos chief scientic adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said Public Health Englandrsquoswork on the antibody test is ldquoprogressing very fast, and will provide valuable insight into the pandemic.Mr Johnson said: ldquoThe great thing about having a test to see whether yoursquove had ithellip is suddenly a green light goes on above your head and you can go back to work safe and confident in the knowledge that you are most unlikely to get it again.ldquoSo for an economic point of view, from a social point of view, it really could be a game-changer.ldquoYou can really see the potential of that advance, which, as I say, is coming down the track.Sir Patrick added: ldquoIt is a gamechanger.

This quite predictably resulted in panic buying, not just by the vulnerable but everyone who believes they might be next. In this context, believing you might be confined to your home for three months, its quite rational to buy up all the toilet roll you can find.Deprived of bog roll and soap, its hardly surprising that some people have now resorted to raiding public conveniences for supplies.But for Borders Council to address this problem by closing down those toilets, completely undermines the ability of the public to wash their hands, the single most important measure people can take to reduce the spread of coronavirus. Instead of this stupidity, our public authorities should be ensuring that all public toilets are kept open at all times and up the frequency they are cleaned, so that people can use them without fear. Ive yet to hear the announcement.The Victorians understood the importance of sanitation and cleanliness to public health and as part of that understanding they built public toilets all over the country. Since the  crash, the Scottish Government has allowed our public authorities to close many of these toilets to make savings ndash as several of your readers have highlighted in these pages ndash ignoring all the lessons of the past. Coronavirus should prompt a massive rethink. We need to put the public back into public health and not expect people to manage this crisis, and other crises that are sure to follow, in the privacy of their own homes ndash or in the case of the homeless, on the streets.Nick Kempe, Glasgow G.THE governments in Westminster and in Holyrood are doing their utmost to protect the country from the current pandemic. Much is being put in place to protect iniduals and business, but an interesting point was made by SNP MP Dave Doogan in the Commons when he asked the Economic Secretary to the Treasurythe loans being put in place for businesses to allow them to pay employees is not in fact welfare which should be put in place by the Department of Work and Pensions. Businesses will struggle to survive, so should not be expected to take on loans to afford their employees some form of income. In the circumstances employees incomes should be met by the Government through the DWP.Catriona C Clark, Falkirk.CLEARLY many key workers will need childcare. But there are others in regular jobs who cannot work from home, but who are well, and able to go to work and who will be prevented from doing so for lack of childcare. They will create an additional financial burden for the Government, or, worse, send their children to vulnerable grandparents.Instead of having debates about who are key workers, why not start off by offering childcare in school to all who can demonstrate a reasonable need for it, and see where that gets us  Many teachers will be available, whilst many parents will not use this service. So it is quite possible supply will cope with demand.Scott Macintosh, Killearn.SURELY now is the time for the BBC Scotland television channel to quickly make its mark as a valuable resource to transmit teaching modules related to the Scottish school syllabus, give pupil and student reassurance, promote public helplines and so on. The Open University operated thus in its early days with timed overnight transmissions that students could record. Our needs are now far more fundamental and much of the daytime schedule could surely be available.I expect that I am not the only one who becomes irritated when Scottish transmission on the main channels is interrupted to move to Westminster. We are aware that dferent coronavirus restrictions and solutions will apply across the country, and that advice is changing rapidly. There is a need to give a regular direct voice to the Scottish Government and Chief Medical Officer. While much has been available on websites, these are a far less accessible medium for most, so letrsquos complement the already excellent and relevant productions like The Nine and Debate Night to provide a bespoke Scottish offering.John C Hutchison, Fort William.THE isolating effect of the coronavirus will have unprecedented negative effects on our society and economy in the weeks and months ahead. Key to mitigating losses will be our ability to adapt, both in terms of working practices but also in how we view ourselves in relation to each other.Many rarely-seen souls in our society have struggled or coped with isolation as their norm. They include the elderly, the socially alienatedand those with troubles and illnesses that make social interaction impossible or unbearable.This virus is a cruel leveller. However, we can use it to find new ways of working and, most importantly, to develop greater empathy, understanding and love for those to whom isolation has been their norm. We may face challenges in how much we can reach out to others right now, but let us hope that we take lessons from this and recreate communities throughout Scotland and beyond where our care for each other is the defining feature. By so doing, we will all lead more fulfilling and meaningful lives.Wing Commander Allan RM Steele, Gfnock.WITHOUT diminishing the effects of the dreaded virus in the least and the real problems caused to many, perhaps those seen leaving supermarkets with multi-packs of toilet rolls might pause and look at some of the pictures from Africa and Asia during the latest locust crisis or from Syria with grieving parents looking at rubble covering lost loved ones.Could supermarkets be encouraged to accept donations at the till towards food banks and put essentials into bags before hitting the shelves  Those of us who would like to contribute find it increasingly hard to get access to tins and toilet rolls to donate.James Watson, Dunbar.Read more: Number of Coronavirus deaths doubles in  hours"},{"url":null,"title":"these are the 10 most popular dog breeds in the uk","story":"Research conducted by Dogfriendlycottages found that these are the  most popular dog breeds in the UK - do you agree .

Where services are completely suspended, a full refund will be applicable.Mr Hinkles continued: “I would strongly advise our affected customers to manage their booking through our website as we are experiencing exceptionally high call volumes into our call centre.“The situation is incredibly serious and alongside the obvious health and safety implications, puts the future of the entire aviation industry in jeopardy.#With this in mind, we have joined with other UK carriers to seek emergency measures from the Government to support all airlines in the sector.”Hinkles revealed that Loganair staff have been asked to consider a series of measures aimed at protecting employment levels — including reducing working hours by  per cent and accepting a  per cent reduction in salary as a result or taking a period of unpaid leave.He said: “We are working hard to avoid redundancies and lay-offs as have already been seen at major international airlines and as are likely to follow at several UK airlines in the coming days.”It is expected that a quarter of Loganair’s fleet of  aircraft will be put into temporary storage as a result of the schedule reductions.Full details of how to manage your booking are available on its website at www.loganair.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

That means we will continue to plan and prepare for the weeks ahead, working closely with our NHS partners and following national guidance on public health.“Our aim is to ensure the resilience measures we have in place best meet the needs of our local community and minimise disruption as far as possible to the services we provide.#There has been widespread concern regarding visiting cruise ships and the OIC has faced criticism for not shutting its ports.Council leader James Stockan moved to reassure the Orkney public.He said: “Elected members met our senior management team to review the extensive steps already taken to prepare for the likely impact on Orkney of the coronavirus pandemic.#I believe the organisation is well prepared to respond effectively to what is a fast-changing situation.“I am aware there is concern in our community about visits to Orkney by cruise ships. No other port in Scotland has stopped such visits and we are following national guidance on this.“We have had port health procedures in place for many years for dealing with cases of infection aboard ships of all kind. These procedures are aimed at preventing infection coming into the country.”All cruise ships have been asked to provide a maritime declaration of health before visiting Orkney, whether or not they have any illness on board.Cruise companies are already well underway with cancelling voyages.The council saysthere was a suspected case of Covid- aboard a ship, the council’s port health and NHS Orkney’s public health teams would work in conjunction with Health Protection Scotland and the Scottish Government to decide on the best course of action to take.If a situation of this kind arose, the most likely outcome is that the ship would be redirected to a port on the Scottish Mainland close to more specialist health facilities, OIC adds.Councillor Stockan added: “Although there has been a focus on cruise ships, people do of course travel to and from Orkney by other means — and that makes it very dficult to prevent the spread of the virus into the county.#This makes it all the more important that we as a council — and our wider community — do all that we can to reduce the potential impact on us all.”To help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, and to protect local communities as far as is practicable, OIC is only allowing travel by staff and elected members to meetings and training events on the Scottish Mainland in exceptional circumstances.In Orkney, councillors and staff will not be attending community council and other public meetings.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day .

His mother had told him to run to her brother’s house to find refuge: the military had already come in the night and killed his father and his brother, and he was likely to be in similar danger. That night, the military forced his mother to sign over ownership of their family farm to the state.Eskander had been imprisoned for four months in an underground prison in Ethiopia without his family’s knowledge, almost one hundred miles away from their farmstead in Dima. Dima is in the Ethiopian regional state of Oromia, the homeland of the Oromo people: a large minority ethnic group who have been subject to political oppression, cultural suppression and the victims of internment and state violence. He had been taking part in a student protest at the technical college where he was studying electrical engineering, carrying a placard that read Stop Killing Oromo People, when the military arrived and opened fire on the protest group. Between forty and fty of the students were arrested and taken to a military camp. From there, he was sent to the underground prison where he was beaten with sticks, cut with knives and tortured with hot metal bars. His body is still marked with the scars from this torture. All of this happened in , and the following year, after he’d lived in hiding with his uncle for five months, his mother sold her possessions to raise funds for Eskander to escape Ethiopia to the relative safety of South Sudan.In April  he left Ethiopia. This was only the beginning of a decade of turmoil that saw the teenage college student progress through his twenties working for two years without pay on a building site in Sudan, imprisoned in Libya by people smugglers, crossing the Mediterranean in a plastic dinghy, being subjected to a brutal assault by a group of men in Italy, living in a bus station near Milan and spending time in Direct Provision in Monaghan before finally boarding a bus to seek a new le of safety in Belfast in April . He claimed asylum, but refugee status and the stability that comes with it has not yet been granted.All of this was written in a statement he’d made for the Home Office through an interpreter. It will form part of his application to be granted five years leave to remain. He sat in silence as I read it all in a coffee shop on the Ormeau Road along with our running coach at Annadale Striders, Michael McKnight. We had gotten to know Eskander well in the preceding year and his positivity and enthusiasm for running had won us over. The scale of the horror he’d been through was until then unknown to us. After he arrived in Ireland, a doctor in the south suggested that running would be a good way of helping to manage the trauma of his experiences, and he was a natural.“I ran my first race on St Patrick’s Day, , in Dublin, with no training,” he told me, “and I ran eighteen minutes for k. I wore thin shoes from Lidl.”He was a natural and he stepped up his training while living in Monaghan, winning many races, and the medals and trophies he won adorn his bedside table in his small room in Stranmillis, along with newspaper cuttings about his athletic achievements. His dedication to running is unwavering, and to those who know his story his successes have been inspirational. He has been on the podium of many road races in the north, including the Laganside k and the Armagh International k, and has matched the course record time at Ormeau Parkrun. The week after he matched the record, dragging me along with him to a personal best of under sixteen minutes, the two of us ed and he was treated like a celebrity: I was approached by several people excitedly asking “do you think Eskander can break the record this time ”For all his talent on the road, it’s cross-country racing where he really shines. At the McConnell Shield race in Ballyclare, one of the north’s oldest and most prestigious races, he put in a stellar performance against some of our best runners. When I crossed the line at that race, Paul Lawther, an original Annadale Strider, and a one-time NI record holder at every distance from m to ,m, immediately said to me with sheer delight: “Did you see what Eskander just did ” He had put a ten second gap on the field in the last four hundred metres, beating two Northern Ireland international athletes. Recently, he finished in second place overall at the prestigious NI and Ulster Senior Cross- Country Championship.It would appear that this is barely scraping the surface of his potential. Michael McKnight has talked with Athletics NI officials about Eskander’s talents and the international representation that could easily follow. Eskander himself dreams of running for Ireland at the European Cross-Country Championships.“I want to make a story for Belfast, for athletics and for Ireland,” he told me.For any of that to happen he needs to negotiate the dficult process of gaining refugee status. He often jokes with me that next year he’s “going to Kenya to train withEliud Kipchoge”, but when it comes down to it he says that what he really wants is “independence and safety, to be free from distress and to be able to breathe in peace again”.Eskander’s gentle manner belies the deep effects of the events of the last decade, of the toll they have taken on his body and mind. He tells me that he continues to require medication to manage the effects of the trauma, to cope with depression and to allow him to sleep. He feels that this is his last chance to make a le for himself he is committed to studying several days each week in Belfast Met, developing his spoken and written English. He tells me that he cherishes his friends and the sense of community he has found in Belfast, that he has been accepted to continue with his study of electrical engineering that was ended abruptly at the time of his imprisonment, but it depends on the Home Office’s decision. He tells me with increasing desperation that he hopes the Home Office will give him another chance at le."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"invest ni host 319 visits by investors but only 14 came to west of","story":"ONLY  visits were made to the West Belfast constituency by potential inward investors, hosted by economic development agency Invest NI, compared to  in South Belfast new figures reveal.The figures for   also show that East Belfast received  visits, while North Belfast had  visits. West Belfast is continually at the bottom of Invest NI inward investor figures for the city.West Belfast MP Paul Maskey told the Andersonstown News that he has already requested a meeting with the newly appointed Invest NI CEO Kevin Holland to discuss his concerns and how the agency has “treated West Belfast over the years”.“It is clear that these figures highlight the inequalities in certain areas,” he said.“Invest NI have a history of igoring areas like West Belfast over the years and I will be stating that quite clearly at the meeting. Thankfully the unemployment rate in West Belfast has reduced in recent years, but it could be further reducedInvest NI stepped up to the mark and brought potential investors to this part of the city.“I will also be raising with them about their lands in West Belfast and what they plan to do to ensure they are used and developed to assist future investors. I will be insisting the new CEO recies this ongoing inequality as a matter of urgency.”SDLP representative Paul Doherty said that with signicantly less inward investment visits taking place here than in other parts of the city, West Belfast is yet again “being left behind”.“We want to see all of Belfast prosper, but this is simply unacceptable given the level of high unemployment and ongoing disadvantage experienced by the people of West Belfast.“I will be calling for an urgent meeting with Invest NI to seek clarity on why West Belfast continues to receive unfair treatment. Invest NI has a responsibility to target areas of need and I will be making it clear to them that they must ensure that West Belfast is given greater priority going forward.”The local rep said it is understandable why Invest NI have come under pressure to change the way they operate.“These figures are testimony to that. This isn’t a one-off either, we have seen similar figures year in, year out which are consistent with the decline in investment and jobs in West Belfast and a constant flow where,” he said.“At present, we have companies in West Belfast who are eager to expand and provide those all-important and much-needed employment opportunities. We also need to harness the potential of the talented workforce that already exists in West Belfast, and it is key that Invest NI assist companies in making that a reality.“I have met with some talented entrepreneurs in West Belfast in the last number of months and they too are understandably frustrated at what they see as constant missed opportunities of bringing investors to this part of the city where they can engage and pitch the potential of this area for investment.“We need to showcase West Belfast. The continued growth of Huhtamaki, based just off Kennedy Way, is further proof that West Belfast can be a great place for businesses to locate, but it is vital we build on that. Invest NI need to develop stronger relationships with all stakeholders in the West in order to grow current businesses such as Huhtamaki, who can continue to grow and employ more people.”A spokesperson for Invest NI said: “Invest NI and the  local councils are actively working in partnership to help grow investment and the economy in every part of Northern Ireland. Investment comes in many forms and a set of figures about the number of inward visits is not reflective of the work that is going on.“For example, nearly  per cent of Invest NI’s offers are to companies outside of Belfast, with recent investments in Derry such as the  jobs being created by Alchemy Technology Services, the  jobs being created by Fintru, the  jobs being created by Danske Bank, the  jobs being created by Terex Corporation as part of a £ million investment in a new facility in the city and expansions by Computershare and Axa.”“Addressing the point that over  per cent of inward visits go to Belfast – this should be viewed in context. The vast majority of visit programmes start in Belfast before going to other locations, or in some cases the investor has no time to visit specic locations so are hosted at our HQ in Belfast. What is more relevant is that over the last five years, nearly  per cent of investors chose to locate their project outside of Belfast.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/a81a8305-8941-4184-938b-d8cf49594400-e1584361711502.png","title":"keep the virtual presses rolling by subscribing to our e papers","story":"OVER the coming weeks, as the Coronavirus crisis most likely deepens, our priority will be to ensure our communities stay safe and healthy.As newspapers based in the heart of vibrant communities on both sides of the Atlantic, we recognise our special role in providing a measured, vital news service to our readers.We also have an obligation to bolster small businesses — the advertising backbone of our papers — who face uncertain times.Already many of those small businesses have either signicantly reduced their operations or, in the case of many entertainment venues, closed their doors for at least two weeks.That in turn will mean a precipitous drop in the display advertising revenues we depend on to keep thepresses rolling, pay staff and meet our overheads.One way in which you can support our teams is by taking out a subscription to our epapers.

The father-of-four was sent to Long Kesh, Cage , to serve out his sentence. It is understood that when Mr Dodds arrived he was in his bare feet after his shoes were confiscated. That night a serious confrontation took place which resulted in British troops being sent in to restore order. Francis was on the receiving end of a severe beating which left him heavily bandaged and needing crutches to walk.Medical notes detail how Mr Dodds consistently sought medical attention for chest pains, extending to his left arm and for a discoloured and infected big toe. The Medical Officer for the prison examined him and recommended that he be referred for an arteriogram. Despite this no arteriogram was ever carried out. On September   Francis was examined by a doctor and told he was fine. The following day, September , he collapsed and died. The post-mortem report determined that the cause of death as coronary thrombosis.Mr Dodd’s sister Joan Nolan told the Andersonstown News that any information from those who were in prison the same time as her brother would be of great help to her family’s case.“I was  when Francis died, there were six of us and Francis was the only boy. I had gone to Canada and was in Canada when Francis died. I didn’t get home for the funeral and Canada was just a nightmare then,” she said.The Dodd’s family, supported by RFJ, say Francis’ death may have been avoidedhe had been removed from Long Kesh for thorough medical examination. Joan described her brother as very much a “joker” and “young at heart”.“Francis left behind a we and four children. He would have been a very proud father with his daughter getting her -Plus and going to St Dominic’s Grammar School.“Unfortunately I’m the only one left of the family, any fresh information would be very beneficial to the family, he was my brother.”Speaking on behalf of RFJ, caseworker Paul Butler said Mr Dodds had been complaining of chest pains for several months before his death.“The prison’s medical officer had attended to him on six dferent occasions in the weeks before his death. Moreover, in April and May  – four months before he died – Francis had been taken to Lagan Valley and Royal Victoria Hospitals in relation to pain in his left foot which was also discoloured and obviously a circulation problem.“The hospital had recommended that he be referred to the Royal Victoria Hospital for an arteriogram. This is a procedure that examines the arteries to seethere are any blockages. The prison governor refused to allow this and unfortunately Francis was ed to Long Kesh and no arteriogram took place before he died.”Former prisoners can contact RFJ on   or email paul.butler@relativesforjustice"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"renewed calls to shut schools","story":"THERE have been renewed calls to shut schools in the north to combat the spread of the coronavirus.Ten special schools closed indefinitely from today .

It allows you to tune out, appreciate the things that are around you and focus on something that isn#t on TV or negative news, he explains.If you#re going to a shoreline or estuary, you can still see some of the wintering waders and wildfowl.You can see curlew along the shoreline, which is pretty brilliant to look at, and there are redshank, another iconic bird,you are around Belfast Lough.Coming into spring,you are in woodland you#re starting to see migrant species coming back, such as the chfchaff, a warbler from northern Africa which is starting to make its way through.Rewarding places to birdwatch include the RSPB#s Portmore Lough nature reserve which has plenty of wide open spaces where you can stay clear of other people while getting your wildle fix.Some of the waders are coming into breed there at the moment - you could see little grebe along the lake shore, reed bunting in amongst the reeds and wigeon and teal as well.Anywhere that has woodland would be quite interesting this time of year, such as Belvoir Forest or the woodlands in the Glens of Antrim are always pretty good, Phil adds..

Tai chiWe#ve all seen footage of people in China outside in parks performing the elegant moves of tai chi.Bangor-born Tai Chi teacher Michele Gibsonsays: Normally we do our classes indoors because the weather in Northern Ireland is not generally very suitable, but it can be practised outside - in China they do it outside all the time.But you can do it in snow as long as you#re well wrapped up - you can do it outside at any time.Michele says Tai Chi is a series of exercises that work on dferent parts of the body.They tend to be breathing exercises as well as movement. The movements are aerobic without being like an aerobics class, so they#re good for your heart and lungs in a very gentle way, she says.Tai chi is good for high blood pressure. It massages all your internal organs and it#s very good for your balance.It#s good for your muscles and tendons, keeping them strong and keeping your bones healthy. It#s an all-round good exercise which can be done by anybody. It can even be done sitting down, although it#s mostly done standing.I would recommend it to anybody who feels they need a little exercise but doesn#t want to pound it out in the gym.

Its job is to keep you safe from nasty germs that might infect you and most of the time it does a great job. This is why pc of people will fight this virus with minor symptoms.But sometimes your immune system isn#t up to the job. This can be because you become infected with a massive dose of a virus, which runs amok and makes you feel awful. Or perhaps you are over  and, like most things in your body, your immune system is less able. Or you might be taking drugs that suppress your immune systemyou have an inflammatory disease. Oryour heart or lungs are weak, the virus can really harm you. So the question is, is there anything you can do to boost your immune system  The answer is a resounding yes.Look after your immune systemTo know how to take care of your immune system, first you need to understand the weapons your immune system has, which are actually very impressive. When you come into contact with a germ you#ve never met before you#ve got ious barriers to try to stop it getting into your body. As well as skin, you have mucus - snot is a really important barrier as it traps germs and has special biochemicals that can kill them, in this case mainly bacteria. Your body is also actually covered in bacteria, inside and out , and many of these are beneficial. They out-compete the bad guys and even make chemicals to poison them. This stops the invader from eating the resident bacterias# lunch.The germs can sometimes win, however. They have cunning tricks up their sleeves to breach the defences. A virus like SARS-CoV burrows inside the cells that line your lungs. That#s where they multiply. However, pretty soon the rapid response unit of your immune system will arrive. Special white blood cells can attack the invader. So-called macrophageseat the germs up and destroy them. They also call the alarm to bring out another white blood cell called a T lymphocyte. These are like police superintendents, controlling everything and even killing off the virally-infected cell themselves to stop the virus spreading. It#s the T lymphocytes that remember, so that when you get reinfected they are good to go. T lymphocytes are an important aspect of why vaccines work. They also control another important white blood cell, the B lymphocyte. This is the cell that makes antibodies. These are very specic proteins that are great at stopping a virus like SARS-CoV in its tracks and B lymphocytes also remember.We remain optimistic that there will be a vaccine soon. Vaccines are weakened forms of a germ or part of it, which causes a weak immune response. But the cells of the immune system are now trained. And when the intruder comes they kill it. It#s a bit like the sherf has put up wanted posters around town and when the bad guy turns up he#s recognised and killed quickly and you won#t even know you#ve been infected. This is why it#s so important to get a vaccine for Covid-.What can you do The trick is to keep all these cells of your immune system fit and healthy. This begins with what you eat. A ied diet with lots of high-fibre foods really boosts your immune system - immune cells love healthy food and hate fatty foods, so a healthy diet is essential.Also,you don#t over-eat and have good gaps between meals, this really mobilises the immune system increasing the numbers of immune cells by as much as three-fold, so lay off that second piece of pie and have gaps of at least four hours between meals. Don#t over-do this, though, as being malnourished has a hugely negative effect, as can be seen in developing countries where it#s a huge cause of death from diseases like TB.Do probiotic drinks work The evidence for taking probiotic supplements is mixed. It#s much more effective to change your diet to a healthier one.And what about vitamins Vitamin D has become a hot topic in immunology. It is used by our immune cells, and is something that people across the island of Ireland can get quite low on in the winter. So it#s good to take in more of it. Taking extra vitamin C, however, is probably a waste of time for those who are well-fed. Eating your five-a-day of fruits and vegetables is the best way to maintain necessary levels. It#s water soluble so you will just pass any excess into your urine.Stay activeTo be immunologically fit, you also need to be physically fit. White blood cells can be quite sluggish. Exercise mobilises them by increasing blood flow in your body, so they can do their surveillance jobs and seek and destroy all over your body. Adults should be physically active in some way every day, and do at least  minutes a week of moderate aerobic activityor  minutes of vigorous activity . Either suffice.The advice for older people, who are more vulnerable to infection, is to do whatever exercise is possible. Anything#s better than nothing. But a letime#s exercise could signicantly stop your immune system declining with age. In , a study found that  non-smoking amateur cyclists aged  to  still had the immune systems of young people.Like eating, you can overdo it though. You can exercise to a point where it has a negative impact on your immune system. Elite athletes are more prone to infections. So don#t overdo it. As ever, moderation is the key.Stay calmOne of the many effects of exercise is that it reduces stress, which is next on our list of immune-boosting priorities. Stress hormones such as cortisol can decrease immune , a common example of which is when chickenpox strikes twice. If you have had it, the virus never completely goes away. During periods of stress, it can reactivate again and you get shingles. And we all know that stress makes us more susceptible to colds and flus. Worrying about Covid- might actually make you more susceptible to it.What about alcohol Forget boozing through the coronavirus crisis though, because heavy drinking also depletes our immune cells. This is one reason why alcoholics are more prone to infections. So the hot whiskey might make you feel better for a short time but it might also slow down recovery.Sleep wellExercising and eating well will have the likely knock-on effect of helping you sleep better, which is a bonus because a tired body is more susceptible to infection. A study last year found that lack of sleep impaired the disease-fighting ability of immune cells. If you#ve got a regular sleep pattern, you have natural body rhythms and everything#s fine. If they go out of kilter, then you#ve got problems.So the bottom line is a good night#s sleep, combating stress, a balanced diet, and moderate exercise are all great at boosting your immune system, in the never-ending battle between us and the germs that infect us, and that includes the latest bundle of evil, SARS-CoV.

Alongside £m already announced by the Treasury the day before, this amounts to an injection of more than £m, the Secretary of State said.Meanwhile, Stormont has unveiled a £ million official grants programme for vulnerable businesses, alongside a rates holiday for three months for all businesses.It comes after the public have been asked to avoid pubs, clubs and theatres, while hundreds of flights and hotel stays have been cancelled, leaving businesses struggling with cash flow.On Tuesday, the Chancellor Rishi Sunak vowed to do “whatever it takes” to help the economy, as he warned that “never in peacetime have we faced an economic fight like this one”.Among the financial measure outline by Mr Sunak is £bn in government-back loans for business and a rates holiday.If you are a Northern Ireland business owner, here#s what support is available to you.Q Will I still have to pay rates, evenI have had to close A On Tuesday, Finance Minister Conor Murphy announced an emergency £m rates package for all Northern Ireland businesses. This will mean businesses will not have to pay any rates for the next three months.In order to help businesses with short-term cash flow problems, rates bills from April to June will also be deferred.There have been calls, however, for the rates holiday to be extended to a year, as is the case for the hospitality sector in England.Q What other support is available for businesses A Businesses will now be able to avail of £bn in government-back loans at low interest rates. These loans are designed to help firms pay rent, salaries, stock and suppliers.The loan scheme has not been welcomed by all, however. Bill Wolsey, managing director of the Beannchor Group, which has temporarily laid off  staff and closed the majority of its pubs and hotels, said putting businesses into further debt is not the answer.Q The Chancellor also announced funding grants of up to £, for small businesses, does this apply to Northern Ireland A The Stormont Executive has unveiled its own grants schemes to assist businesses with cash flow pressures brought about by the Covid- outbreak. The official rescue package includes a grant scheme worth £, each for around , small businesses and a payment of £, to around , firms involved in retail, tourism and hospitality.The new small business grant scheme of £, will be provided to all small businesses eligible for the small business rate relief scheme with a Net Asset Value of up to £,. A new immediate grant of £, will go to for companies in the retail, tourism and hospitality sectors with a rateable value between £, and £,. Q Are any other financial measures expected to be announced in the near future A Yes, further announcements are due in the coming days.There are several concerns which have not been addressed, including whether VAT bills for small businesses due in April will be deferred. Business leaders have also called on employer#s national insurance contributions to be waived, while those self-employed are also facing a tax payment in July.If you rely on benefits or are struggling financially due to the coronavirus, here#s what has already been announced to help you.Q How can I sign on for benefits during the pandemic A Communities minister Deirdre Hargey has announced that all benefits offices will be closed and contact will be made over the phone to protect the public and frontline staff. All front line services will be suspended initially for a period of three months to assess where we are with this virus and any contact will be done via the telephone or other forms of communications, she said, speaking on BBC Radio Ulster. Appointments have been postponed for a period of three months, which may be extended. Q Do I still have to sign on in person A Ms Hargey said that those who normally have to sign on in person for benefits will no longer have to turn up to the benefit offices. No one will be penalised for any attending the office, she said, adding that those who usually have to submit medical advice or certicates in person are not currently required to do so. Q Will I be contacted about my face-to-face interview A We#re contacting those people over the next few days to let them know their appointments have been suspended initially for a period of three months. We will be constantly reviewing that, said Ms Hargey.  Q Is there any other support available A The Communities Minister said she will address discretionary support payment legislation over the next few days. These are payments for those who are on a wage from April  of under £,, low income families who are fallen on hard times - that they can come and apply for a grant for things like household costs, food bills, heating costs, she said. Ms Hargey said she is also moving on issues such as statutory sick pay and universal credit. Those workers who happen to lose their jobs here who are on contracts or who are self-employed can now come forward to claim those benefits and get that additional support, she said. Q I am on the Steps  Success employment programme - do I have to attend A Ms Hargey said: All programmes going forward will be suspended for a period and people will not be penalised for not attending the office.Q I work in a small business - what will my job prospects look like in the near future A Speaking in Stormont on Monday, Mrs Dodds revealed plans to re-ert laid-off staff in the coming months.I think it is something that my department will quickly look at,we are in the position where firms have to close, she said. Many people will have skills in food preparation that we may need in our hospitals and so on as this thing reaches a peak, so we will be looking at this and how,one business closes, there are opportunities in other areas.Belfast Related ContentCoronavirusCoronavirus fact check: From masks to mortality rates - how to separate fact from fictionThe coronavirus crisis has become a breeding ground for myths and conspiracies - how do we separate fact from fiction \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news ab .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcd-b--ab-dccefd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news ab .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcd-b--ab-dccefd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news ab .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcd-b--ab-dccefd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news ab .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcd-b--ab-dccefd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news ab .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcd-b--ab-dccefd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Republic of IrelandHow former army trauma surgeon Michael Ryan from Ireland is leading global fight against coronavirusDr Michael Ryan was at home in his kitchen in Galway one day, and his phone rang, the caller identied himself as Bill Gates.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadDeath of Northern Ireland man on honeymoon in Las Vegas was drugs-related Workers# lives #put on hold# and savings #obliterated# as coronavirus job losses take toll across Northern IrelandTributes pour in as Nobel Prize winner and #a true soldier of peace# Betty Williams dies at Coronavirus: Ballyclare businessman stranded at South Africa airport after visa restrictions Ex-Down GAA star cautioned for shouting abuse at loyalist band ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

As testing is only being carried out when cases are needing hospitalised, I would like to reiterate that it is a suspected case.I had made an application to the Department of Education for two exceptional closure days on Thursday  and Friday  March.However, I have been unsuccessful and these have been denied.A spokeswoman for the Department of Education said: Requests for exceptional closures should be made initially to the Department of Education.These are likely to be approvedneeded to facilitate an enhanced deep clean following discussions with public health professionals.If schools have submitted an exceptional closure which has not been approved and are able to provide a fuller explanation as to why the closure is needed, then the Department would be happy to review the request.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadDeath of Northern Ireland man on honeymoon in Las Vegas was drugs-related Workers# lives #put on hold# and savings #obliterated# as coronavirus job losses take toll across Northern IrelandTributes pour in as Nobel Prize winner and #a true soldier of peace# Betty Williams dies at Coronavirus: Ballyclare businessman stranded at South Africa airport after visa restrictions Ex-Down GAA star cautioned for shouting abuse at loyalist band ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

No one really knows how this is all going to pan out, but we came up with the WhatsApp idea because we thought it would be a good way of ensuring that people would always be able to make contact with someone near them.We delivered notes to all the houses in the street urging anyone who was interested to join the group so we would have a means of communication without coming face-to-face.The plan is to share any information we have with each other and to share any supplies that people desperately need over the next weeks and months.

They are similar to the disciplinary measures that there are in school for the pupils, Jonny explained.We#d been planning to introduce all this during the summer holidays, but we#ve now brought everything forward to term time.It#s not just Jonny#s home le that has been hit by the virus, but his love of football too.I#m a big fan of Ards Football Club and though it#s not the most important thing in the world at the moment I will miss watching them, he said. Our social club is shut, so that#s draining the resources for the football team too.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fe-db-ca--bcafddc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fe-db-ca--bcafddc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fe-db-ca--bcafddc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fe-db-ca--bcafddc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fe-db-ca--bcafddc_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"BooksCoronavirus: Bookshop delivery service a huge hit with customersA bookshop that launched a delivery service for customers facing quarantine has been overwhelmed by the response.Northern IrelandSpar shops limiting purchasesSPAR, Eurospar, Vivoxtra and Vivo stores in Northern Ireland have implemented a restriction on the purchase of all products.UKDown distillery#s sanitiser missionA Co Down distillery that has turned its hand to making sanitiser desperately needs more bottles for another batch.Northern IrelandNIFRS safety at home warningThe Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Servicehas announced new measures to help keep firefighters and the public safe during the coronavirus pandemic. ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadDeath of Northern Ireland man on honeymoon in Las Vegas was drugs-related Workers# lives #put on hold# and savings #obliterated# as coronavirus job losses take toll across Northern IrelandTributes pour in as Nobel Prize winner and #a true soldier of peace# Betty Williams dies at Coronavirus: Ballyclare businessman stranded at South Africa airport after visa restrictions Ex-Down GAA star cautioned for shouting abuse at loyalist band ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I can#t see it happening at the moment, God knows how it#s going to affect the housing market, he said.Two of his friends were also among the  staff to be temporarily laid off by the Beannchor group.A lot of people will have dependants living in the household, others are living together and sharing rent, he added.People in hospitality are often on minimum wage and working on zero hour contracts. They have quiet periods after Christmas but they usually plan for that.But no-one expects that to go on after March. Those people definitely don#t have the savings to see this out.Mr Hagan#s mother Christine Boydsaid her son felt panicked over the sudden loss of his job.He#s lost everything, he#s literally no money to pay for his car insurance or phone bill. All he got was a call to say #sorry there#s no work#, she said.It was a big deal for Jack to get this job. He has ADD and Tourette#s Syndrome so he has a lot of issues with socialising.Now it#s been taken away and it#s set him back again.He#s had to go to the jobs and benefits office to get Universal Credit which for him is about £ a month.He#s panicking now because he doesn#t know where he#s going to get the money from, I#m going to have to try and help him out.He has been quite down and even I#m quite anxious worrying about him. I spent about three hours on Friday on the phone and filling out forms for Universal Credit.So that#s been stressful and I needed to take time off work to help him.She also called for measures to help the economy currently being used in Italy and the Republic of Ireland.I#ve got rent to pay andmy younger son comes home from nursery, will I have to keep paying for it  she said.If I knew those bills were frozen it would make a big dference to me. At the minute I#m not sleeping very well because of this stress.The government need to be clearer about what they#re doing to help everyday people.Meanwhile, the chief executive of Hospitality Ulster Colin Neill has said that Northern Ireland is now facing a tsunami of job losses.Speaking to the Stormont Assembly Economy Committee, he said: We now have a disaster on our hands. This is an emergency situation.Overnight thousands of jobs went to the wall and we are expecting thousands to go by the end of the day - this is real and the government are watching this happen as time ticks away.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadDeath of Northern Ireland man on honeymoon in Las Vegas was drugs-related Workers# lives #put on hold# and savings #obliterated# as coronavirus job losses take toll across Northern IrelandTributes pour in as Nobel Prize winner and #a true soldier of peace# Betty Williams dies at Ex-Down GAA star cautioned for shouting abuse at loyalist band Armagh auction house could close in wake of St Patrick#s Day vandalism,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Responding to the announcement by the First and deputy First Minister of a range of measures to support businesses in Northern Ireland, Londonderry Chamber of Commerce President Redmond McFadden said: “These latest measures will go some way to providing support to some of our hardest hit small businesses and we welcome the work that is underway by our local Ministers in a short space of time. googletag.cmd.push Businesses in the North West, and across Northern Ireland, have been calling for government grants to be made available to address this crisis and I am glad that the Executive has listened to these concerns. “Immediate grants of up to pound, for all small businesses and pound, for hospitality and retail businesses will be welcomed by many of our members. However it is still important that the Government offers clarity around staff pay. Many businesses have already had to let staff go because they simply do not have cash to pay them without any money coming into the business. It is crucial that there is clarity around staff pay and how staff can continue to be paid so that they can pay their livings costs and feed their families. “We also need clarity on how and when businesses can apply for these grants, who is eligible to apply, and how quickly this funding will be released to businesses. The Chamber will be looking at all of these measures and is ready and available to support the Executive in getting crucial information out to businesses in the coming days.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The government has advised people with symptoms to stay at home and to not leave their house for seven days or If they live with other people, all household members have to stay at home for fourteen days. However, trade unions for medical professionals are pushing for access to Covid- tests so that they can know whether they are infected with the virus and in danger of passing it on to patients. googletag.cmd.push They say that based on current advice, the same people may have to self-isolate more than oncesymptoms re-emerge because without testing there is no way of knowing whether they are immune or still at risk to themselves and other people. GP at Aberfoyle Medical Practice, Dr John O’Kelly raised concerns that one of the doctors at the centre who had a high temperature and flu like symptoms is now off and self-isolating as per government advice. The local doctor said he rang the Western Trust and was told it is not testing health workers yet and he will therefore be off for an ‘extended period’. googletag.cmd.push  Dr O’Kelly, who is former Chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners in Northern Ireland said the practice is managing to cope with two doctors off at present but the loss of any more staff would put signicant pressure on resources. “With regards to testing, I think it would be helpful for testing to be available for health professionals, carers who are attending elderly and infirmed patients and Nursing Residential staff. “If we lose health professionals for - weeks this has a potentially serious knock on effect on the service we can provide.” Askedit was worrying that health workers could potentially be forced to self-isolate more than once, he added: “You are correct that people could be off repeatedly. I am not sure how prepared the service is to deliver that number of tests but I feel it is important we protect and support our front line services. “The World Health Organisation, who are the most experienced in dealing with epidemics - although this is pandemic - have recommended testing as an essential element in getting control. “At present we are managing to cope with two doctors down, further losses including loss of nursing and secretarial support, will put incredible strain on our resources.” Yesterday British Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised to ramp up testing but it is unclear how much it will be increased in NI specically. ‘PRIORITY TESTING’ The Department of Health for NI provided an update on testing yesterday evening, saying:“We are working to signicantly increase our testing capacity so that we can support testing of health and social care workers. “Members of the public who have been advised to self-isolate at home will not be routinely tested. Testing will continue to be carried out as appropriate on iniduals admitted to hospital and testing may also be carried out to support the management of outbreaks or clusters of disease in residential or care settings. Testing capacity is urgently being expanded in order to enable testing of essential healthcare workers.” In response to a question from Derry Sinn Feacutein MLA Martina Anderson earlier this week, Health Minister Robin Swann, revealed that ‘owing to constraints on lab capacity, locally and nationally, testing is now being prioritised for a number of groups’. “The current order for priority testing during periods of signicant demand is, first, a patient requiring critical care for the management of pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome , influenza or an influenza-like illnessand, secondly, a patient with an alternative indication of severe illness, such as severe pneumonia or ARDS,” he explained. “The next group is all other patients who require admission to hospital for the management of pneumonia, ARDS or an ILI. A further group is the cluster of disease in residential or care settings for example, long-term care facilities and prisons. Symptomatic healthcare workers will be tested as well. “That is under active review, nationally and locally. Additional capability is being urgently worked up in the lab system, and that will ease some of the demand pressures on lab services. It is not that we have reduced testing but that we are now prioritising the testing capability that we have available, and we are increasing that capability.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Bronagh Cooper has worked in the community for over  years and has been working as a SPRING Social Prescriber with Bogside and Brandywell Health Forum since its launch in July . She has changed the lives of hundreds of people within the community, helping to tackle the issues of mental health and depression.SPRING social prescribing is a new initiative which takes a holistic approach and works with iniduals offering more than medicine. Social prescribing creates a link between the health service and the community and enables a GP or primary health care professional to refer patients who suffer from social isolation, low mood, mild depression, chronic pain, long term conditions or physical inactivity to community support programmes and activities.Bronagh is the SPRING social prescribing co-ordinator for the Western Health and Social Care Trust area, and in the last year alone, has received  referrals from people in Derry on the SPRING Social Prescribing Programme. Social prescribing is rolled out across Britain and Ireland, and Bronagh underwent a rigorous interview and skills test to be appointed the Norths Social Prescribing Link Worker Champion. She said: “Becoming a champion means my role is to raise the profile of SPRING Social Prescribing and that everyone in the community recognises it as a good model of practice. We also want to ensure that social prescribing is recognised as a health profession, like social work and other health professionals are within the health services, and funded by the Health Service.”Social prescribing is available to anyone over -years-old and has been adopted as a good model of practice by GPs across Northern Ireland. The pound. million SPRING Social Prescribing project is funded by the National Lottery Community Fund and Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs . The health project aims to reduce pressure on GPs while improving the health and wellbeing of patients across Northern Ireland. Bronagh added: “Social prescribing encourages the social model of health care. If an inidual goes to their GP with symptoms, like depression or chronic pain, the GP will then give them a social prescription. “That is where I come in as a social prescriber. It is my role to meet with the inidual and get to the bottom of what the cause is. GPs only give medication to treat someone with anxiety, but my role is to find out what the root cause of the anxiety is and help address that. “The aim is to reduce the amount of medication a person is on and to reduce the number of visits required to the GP practice.“I find a lot of joy in my work. My purpose is to guide people to programmes to help improve their health. For example, I had a client, a young man in his ’s. He had no friends or family for support and was regularly visiting his GP, being treated for depression. His GP, gave him a social prescription and I met with him and realised the root cause of his depression was social isolation.“We co-created a support programme of things he would enjoy. I am there to guide him and accompany him to his first few classesneed be, giving encouragement and support. He has gone from sitting at home alone all day to being out of the house five days a week attending his local men’s shed, cooking classes, exercise programmes and counselling. He has gone from having no interaction with anyone, to creating a community support network and is much happier. “I have older clients who may have been bereaved, and lost their sense of self or clients with chronic pain or long term health conditions. “Social prescribing is about looking at the needs of the inidual and looking at the needs of the community and putting those support programmes in place. For example, we have set up two chronic pain supwWalking group. The idea grew from a girl in her ’s who wanted to exercise but didn’t want to be seen. I had done the Camino and found great peace walking in nature. I wanted people to experience the same peace so we put the nature group in place and go on dferent walks each month and then have some tea and buns in a cafeacute afterwards,” said Bronagh.The nature walking group is open to the whole community, as is all of the support programmes established by SPRING Social Prescribing. “The idea is to identy the need within the community. People tell us what they need and we put that support in place. We don’t isolate our programmes, they are open to the whole community and to anyone who feels they would benefit,” explained Bronagh.“I have found that people know they need help, but they don’t know where or how to get it. My role, and the role of SPRING Social Prescribing is to guide them to that help,” added Bronagh.To find out more about SPRING Social Prescribing in your area log on to https:www.springsp.org  googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Like many others at present, the drama student at Ulster University’s Magee Campus is working from home due to the coronavirus pandemic but her mind is firmly focussed on the task at hand on Saturday night. She’s having ‘withdrawal symptoms’ from not seeing her two biggest fans, grannies Peggy and Sheila, who have also become household names thanks to their guest appearance on the show. googletag.cmd.push But Brooke has been calling them on a regular basis and wants to ensure they’re kept safe.  The -year-old is from Bellaghy Co. Derry but lived in the Rosemount area for two years while studying and has family connections in the city. Her love of music developed at home, growing up her father ‘almost burnt the house down’ when he fell asleep as a child listening to the record player. None of her family are singers but they’re all passionate about music and listen to the ‘golden oldies’. Brooke’s own taste has been informed by those cherished records and she’s been fortunate enough to see idols live such as Dolly Parton, Cher and Tina Turner. Other favourites include the Eagles, Aerosmith and John Mayer. googletag.cmd.push She never envisaged a career in music - ‘every competition I entered I never got through, except from one year at Ballymena Festival which I won’, she said. Unbeknown to Brooke a friend submitted an application of her to audition for The Voice UK . She was shocked to get call back from the producers before going across to England in April last year, where she secretly filmed her Blind Audition – an experience shrouded in secrecy from her wider friends and family. AFFIRMATION  At the beginning of January Brooke’s first appearance was aired on ITV. All four coaches were visibly moved by her performance. First to turn were will.i.am and Meghan Trainor and they were quickly followed by Sir Tom Jones and Olly Murs. A tug-of-war took place between the coaches but American singer-songwriter Ms Trainor convinced the Derry woman to join her team and quickly declared that she had a potential winner on her hands. That cover of Lewis Capaldi song Bruises was a breakthrough moment and one that changed her outlook. “I’m so grateful for everything because it really has shown me that by getting turns from all the coaches, it has reassured me and reaffirmed everything that I want to do, it has given me that push and urge to say, ‘I should be doing this, I will do it and be as good as I can’.” It has already proven a seminal moment in her le and one which she now uses as motivation. “I watch that back on my phone when I’m going to perform on the show again, “ she reflected. “It gives me that lt and belief that I was worth the four chair turn. “I genuinely didn’t think it was a good performance of that song because as soon as they turned I went into panic mode. I’ve sung it so much better. “But the crowd were standing applauding, it was a surreal moment and one I’ll never forget.” Directly after the performance the -year-old’s sense of humour shone through, while speaking to the coaches she joked to Tom Jones and Olly Murs that her grannies were both single. Her own harshest critic, Brooke also wasn’t happy with her performance during the Battles round and views this Saturday night as an opportunity to redeem herself. Saturday’s Knockout performance is set to be special as she sings a song that is close to her heart. “It’s a song with a lot of meaning for me, it was the first song people heard me sing in school and has had a lot of luck for me. I hope it does again on Saturday,” she added. ROLE MODEL The reaction in her hometown and further afield has been humbling and spurred her on. She explained: “People have been so supportive, particularly over the last few days when I’ve noticed my social media followers going up. “To think that people want to listen to me is amazing. I’m so glad I have the local support and want people to be proud of me and able to relate to me because I live in the same place.” A woman of many talents she also plays camogie having represented the county team and Bellaghy’s senior team. She shares the interest in sport with family members including her younger brother and two older sisters. However, The Voice remains her primary focus at present with her time split between Derry and London. If she didn’t grasp the opportunity with both hands and devote herself to it entirely she feels it would always be a source of regret.  Brooke said she may be biased but believes choosing Meghan Trainor as her coach was the ‘best decision’ because they share a lot of similarities. “She FaceTimes me, messages me on Instagram, she is unbelievable and is here to make a point. I believe she’ll look after me in my career and is just a brilliant, brilliant coach.” Although only nearing her st birthday, the young Derry woman has ambitions of pursuing a career in music, or acting, regardless of the outcome on Saturday night. “I want to act, I want to sing, I want to bake, everything that comes at me I want to say yes because you never know what will come out of it. “I just want to help people, I want to give them something that takes them away from their worries. “It’s about growing as a person and artist, and being a good role model to young people who are looking up to me most, like Meghan has been for so many - that would be my dream achieved.” Tune into The Voice on ITV this Saturday at :pm as Brooke takes on the Knock Outs for a place in the Live Semi Final. The semi-final and final which were due to air on March  and April  have now been postponed until later this year.

A tug-of-war took place between the coaches but American singer-songwriter Ms Trainor convinced the Derry woman to join her team and quickly declared that she had a potential winner on her hands. That cover of Lewis Capaldi song Bruises was a breakthrough moment and one that changed her outlook. “I’m so grateful for everything because it really has shown me that by getting turns from all the coaches, it has reassured me and reaffirmed everything that I want to do, it has given me that push and urge to say, ‘I should be doing this, I will do it and be as good as I can’.” It has already proven a seminal moment in her le and one which she now uses as motivation. “I watch that back on my phone when I’m going to perform on the show again, “ she reflected. “It gives me that lt and belief that I was worth the four chair turn. “I genuinely didn’t think it was a good performance of that song because as soon as they turned I went into panic mode. I’ve sung it so much better. “But the crowd were standing applauding, it was a surreal moment and one I’ll never forget.” Directly after the performance the -year-old’s sense of humour shone through, while speaking to the coaches she joked to Tom Jones and Olly Murs that her grannies were both single. Her own harshest critic, Brooke also wasn’t happy with her performance during the Battles round and views this Saturday night as an opportunity to redeem herself. Saturday’s Knockout performance is set to be special as she sings a song that is close to her heart. “It’s a song with a lot of meaning for me, it was the first song people heard me sing in school and has had a lot of luck for me. I hope it does again on Saturday,” she added. ROLE MODEL The reaction in her hometown and further afield has been humbling and spurred her on. She explained: “People have been so supportive, particularly over the last few days when I’ve noticed my social media followers going up. “To think that people want to listen to me is amazing. I’m so glad I have the local support and want people to be proud of me and able to relate to me because I live in the same place.” A woman of many talents she also plays camogie having represented the county team and Bellaghy’s senior team. She shares the interest in sport with family members including her younger brother and two older sisters. However, The Voice remains her primary focus at present with her time split between Derry and London. If she didn’t grasp the opportunity with both hands and devote herself to it entirely she feels it would always be a source of regret.  Brooke said she may be biased but believes choosing Meghan Trainor as her coach was the ‘best decision’ because they share a lot of similarities. “She FaceTimes me, messages me on Instagram, she is unbelievable and is here to make a point. I believe she’ll look after me in my career and is just a brilliant, brilliant coach.” Although only nearing her st birthday, the young Derry woman has ambitions of pursuing a career in music, or acting, regardless of the outcome on Saturday night. “I want to act, I want to sing, I want to bake, everything that comes at me I want to say yes because you never know what will come out of it. “I just want to help people, I want to give them something that takes them away from their worries. “It’s about growing as a person and artist, and being a good role model to young people who are looking up to me most, like Meghan has been for so many - that would be my dream achieved.” Tune into The Voice on ITV this Saturday at :pm as Brooke takes on the Knock Outs for a place in the Live Semi Final. The semi-final and final which were due to air on March  and April  have now been postponed until later this year.

Seven years later, he would be the first Maghera senior footballer to lt silverware after their MacLarnon Cup win over Omagh CBS. Back to back Ulster minor winner Laverty played on the Derry senior team of the mid-s, picking up two senior medals. His first cousin and godfather Colm Mulholland, who turned  in December played for Derry in the  All-Ireland final. Lavertys Derry senior debut came by chance. Jim McGuigan was organising the transport to Sligo for the opening game of the pre-Christmas section of the   league. googletag.cmd.push He asked Lavertyhe wanted to go to the game on the bus, just to watch. After all the ious pick up points passed, there were only  players on board, including Anthony McGurk who was nursing a sore ankle. “Do you want to play,” McGuigan asked in the direction of Laverty. Before he had a chance to reply, manager Paddy OHara told McGuigan to get him togs and socks a pair of boots from somewhere. “So there I was playing my first game. I remember the game was moved to Tobercurry, because of a waterlogged pitch. We won the game and remember Michael Kearns was playing for Sligo.” googletag.cmd.push It would be a further four years before he would make his championship debut. During that time, as a student at St Joes in Belfast, he won an All-Ireland Fresher medal and three Ryan Cupmedals. Regrettably, despite having a team capable of winning the Sigerson, the Ranch werent permitted to enter. With his native Lavey, he played for over  years, winning two championships, but for the last  years he calls Portrush his home. Every day, he will walk down the Coleraine Road to the shop, passing back over from County Antrim to his native Derry. He will pass the home of John Eddie Mullan, a league winner with the Oakleafers in , and the pair would often chat. Last week, when Lavertys phone rang and the opportunity arose to rake up the memories of  again, there was an excitement in his voice. Last year he had the thyear gathering of the  minor winning team that were defeated by Cork in All-Ireland final. “Brendan Kelly, Mickey Moran, Vincent Conway, Frankie McCotter and myself were on that team,” Laverty remembers. “The MacLarnon Cup final was a really good game of football compared to the MacRory which was dour and not very interesting.” Martin ONeill, who would later that year play alongside Laverty for Derry minors, played on the winning St Malachys team, managed by Phil Stuart, that lted the MacRory Cup. “Hugh Cudden, our goalkeeper, is now in Canada and Liam Harbinson is away in South Africa or Zimbabwe and Frankie McCotter lives in London.” Laverty scored one goal in the final with Harbinson, who played some Irish league soccer, notching the other, after dribbling clear of Omagh defence. “Liam is a relation of Sean OConnell and had a swagger like Sean OConnell. He was a very good soccer player, as was Mickey Moran. Playing in the school playground, you would know they had a bit of skill from soccer about them.” In those days, as Laverty remembers, organised games against other schools didnt come into vogue until third or fourth year. “What struck out for me, when we started in St Pats Maghera, there was only  pupils at it. We went into the assembly hall, there was no floor in it, we were standing on the grass as the school wasnt totally finished. “Frankie Kearney and Brian McKevitt took us in the early years. Then we had Sean Murphy and Eamon Small coaching us as well.” There were few highlights of the football in the early years but soon there was a greater enthusiasm and more boys were taking an interest. Frankie Kearney left the staff, going to St Pauls Kilrea. McKevitt went back to teach in the Abbey. Sean Murphy, with Jim B Bradley assisting him, took over the running of the senior team. “It was brilliant,” enthuses Laverty. “We were the first senior team and got Maghera into the MacRory. Adrian Boyle was still at Maghera the following year and remembers playing in the MacRory. “It was a fantastic feeling to win it and Omagh had a great team at that time. It was a ding dong game. We had a good team and were all very determined to win on that day.” Laverty was the captain and refers to manager Sean Murphys qualities in the classroom being transferred to the dressing room. “He was a good teacher and then he was a good manager as well. Everybody wanted to play for him. He had a good way of getting things across and he was a good motivator, you wanted to play for him.” Another ingredient for success, which Laverty mentions, was the school basketball team. Under the watch of Charlie Murphy, they won the Ulster title, with a - win over Methody. “It was up in San Souci Park, in Queens,” he adds, with the details floating down the phone-line asit were yesterday. There was a hiccup before the final. Maghera didnt have numbers on their vests and wouldnt be allowed to compete until a local intervention saved the day. St Colms Draperstowns U team were there and coach Seamus Kelly, loaned them their vests. Kelly, who passed away recently, would have an influence on Lavertys Derry career under Frankie Kearneys tenure. “Seamus was a shrewd man and was one of the mentors of Derry teams of ,  and . Sean OConnell would have been helping out with training – while still playing – and big Liam Hinphey was the motivator. Seamus Kelly was the tactician, he was very quiet but was shrewd operator.” “Methody came out in silk tops and togs, with all their fancy numbers. The vests we got were as tight as a fiddle string and too small for us. “There was a Methody boy who got a few tackles that day, that werent part of basketball, but thats another story,” added Laverty, with a hearty laugh. On the basketball starting team of five, were Mickey Moran and Eugene Laverty. Tommy McCloy of Lavey was another footballer but would leave school before the MacLarnon winning season. Also at the school during that era was current Lavey man Paddy Shivers, who went on to play for Derry as well. Laverty cant understand why Shivers wasnt on the Maghera team at that time. “I wasnt good enough,” Shivers has recently told Laverty. “He was a good footballer. He coached the team and played on the Lavey team for years. He was a PE teacher up in St Colms in Draperstown, took teams and did very well.” Laverty never forgot Shivers. He knew his footballers and, especially, a midfielder when he saw one. Winning captains names will continue to go up on the walls of St Patricks Maghera, but Eugene Laverty will always be the first. From the team on , who set the standard for others to follow. READ ALSO - Match report - Omagh - Maghera - Click here...

This is so hard to accept and understand. googletag.cmd.push “I will miss my friends, my teachers, my classrooms, the bus run, the sound of the bell, the sound of the playground at break times, the sound of the music in the corridors, the smell of lunch from the canteen, the building itself, I will even miss my grade cycles, my cleaning staff, my canteen staff and my principal. “How hard we can try just cant create that from home, because together we are a team, together right here in this building we are a family.

The closures will take place with a phased approach from today and over the coming days. The decision comes less than a week after council closed all its buildings to the public and cancelled a number of up and coming public events. Members met again today to get an update on council services and contingency measures being put into place by council to protect its staff and the public and help reduce the risk of COVID- across the Council area. Members heard that while play parks will be closed over the coming days, public parks and cemeteries will continue to remain open. googletag.cmd.push Other essential services such as bin collection services will continue to operate. Recycling centres remain open however some adaptations have been made to limit the number of cars entering sites at the one time in an effort to encourage social distancing. Members also agreed to postpone the Foyle Maritime Festival and the Strabane Summer Jamm both scheduled to take place over the summer months. Earlier this week Clipper Ventures confirmed to Council that the Clipper   Race is postponed. Members also heard that a number of signicant events including the Worker’s Rights and Social Justice Week and the Battle of the Atlantic VE Day commemorations planned for May have also been cancelled. googletag.cmd.push Events scheduled beyond the summer months will remain under review. In line with Government guidelines, many council staff are working from home while others providing front line services continue to report to work where internal working arrangements that include social distancing and additional health and safety measures are being implemented. All of this is being done in full consultation with unions, with a commitment to provide as many essential services as possible. Members were provided reassurance by council officials that adaptations have been made within council services to facilitate the continued delivery of vital services and that any operational changes to any service will be communicated to the public. While some council committee meetings have been postponed, new arrangements have been put in place for a Full Council meeting to take place later this month. Members were of the view that the key decision making process should continue for as long as possible. Members were also informed that while the City of Derry Airport is open and fully operational and council in partnership with the CODA Board is looking at contingency measures to mitigate against the severe and immediate financial impact of COVID- and is engaging with Ministers and officials over the coming days to discuss options for protecting this vital service. Elected members were informed that the council’s Business Support team are currently disseminating the information from Central Government in relation to rates relief and business support and will be available to offer advice and guidance to local business. In relation to community resilience and community support members were informed that Council is currently looking at mechanisms of how it can provide support to the local community sector at this time. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Cllr Michaela Boyle chaired the meeting and welcomed the update and praised the efforts of Council in making key decisions at this challenging time. She spoke about the dficulties being faced by the local business community sector and made reference to the decision by O’Neill’s in Strabane to close its doors. “This is hugely sad news for Strabane and not an easy decision for Kieran and his team to make but I think it’s the right one and we will hopefully see the business up and running again in the near future.” The Mayor added: “The Council continues to provide strong leadership and is putting the health and safety of its staff and the public to the fore as it responds to this crisis in a responsible and proactive manner. The Council is also being proactive in working with our statutory agencies and partners in terms of contingency planning and service provision.” Providing reassurance to the public, the Mayor said that while Council facilities are closed to the public, essential services will continue for as long as possible and they can contact the Council directly at    or follow Council on Twitter and Facebook and on the Council website atwww.derrystrabane  coronavirusfor regular updates. She encouraged the public to take note of the advice from the Public Health Agency and to watch out for elderly family members, neighbours and friends. She praised the efforts of health workers, shop assistants, bin collectors, delivery men and all those providing the essential services during this dficult and challenging time. “By working together and looking out for one another we can all do our bit to limit the spread of this virus and protect our local community by taking the necessary precautions to stay safe,” she concluded.

The closures will take place with a phased approach from today and over the coming days. The decision comes less than a week after council closed all its buildings to the public and cancelled a number of up and coming public events. Members met again today to get an update on council services and contingency measures being put into place by council to protect its staff and the public and help reduce the risk of COVID- across the Council area. Members heard that while play parks will be closed over the coming days, public parks and cemeteries will continue to remain open. googletag.cmd.push Other essential services such as bin collection services will continue to operate. Recycling centres remain open however some adaptations have been made to limit the number of cars entering sites at the one time in an effort to encourage social distancing. Members also agreed to postpone the Foyle Maritime Festival and the Strabane Summer Jamm both scheduled to take place over the summer months. Earlier this week Clipper Ventures confirmed to Council that the Clipper   Race is postponed. Members also heard that a number of signicant events including the Worker’s Rights and Social Justice Week and the Battle of the Atlantic VE Day commemorations planned for May have also been cancelled. googletag.cmd.push Events scheduled beyond the summer months will remain under review. In line with Government guidelines, many council staff are working from home while others providing front line services continue to report to work where internal working arrangements that include social distancing and additional health and safety measures are being implemented. All of this is being done in full consultation with unions, with a commitment to provide as many essential services as possible. Members were provided reassurance by council officials that adaptations have been made within council services to facilitate the continued delivery of vital services and that any operational changes to any service will be communicated to the public. While some council committee meetings have been postponed, new arrangements have been put in place for a Full Council meeting to take place later this month. Members were of the view that the key decision making process should continue for as long as possible. Members were also informed that while the City of Derry Airport is open and fully operational and council in partnership with the CODA Board is looking at contingency measures to mitigate against the severe and immediate financial impact of COVID- and is engaging with Ministers and officials over the coming days to discuss options for protecting this vital service. Elected members were informed that the council’s Business Support team are currently disseminating the information from Central Government in relation to rates relief and business support and will be available to offer advice and guidance to local business. In relation to community resilience and community support members were informed that Council is currently looking at mechanisms of how it can provide support to the local community sector at this time. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Cllr Michaela Boyle chaired the meeting and welcomed the update and praised the efforts of Council in making key decisions at this challenging time. She spoke about the dficulties being faced by the local business community sector and made reference to the decision by O’Neill’s in Strabane to close its doors. “This is hugely sad news for Strabane and not an easy decision for Kieran and his team to make but I think it’s the right one and we will hopefully see the business up and running again in the near future.” The Mayor added: “The Council continues to provide strong leadership and is putting the health and safety of its staff and the public to the fore as it responds to this crisis in a responsible and proactive manner. The Council is also being proactive in working with our statutory agencies and partners in terms of contingency planning and service provision.” Providing reassurance to the public, the Mayor said that while Council facilities are closed to the public, essential services will continue for as long as possible and they can contact the Council directly at    or follow Council on Twitter and Facebook and on the Council website atwww.derrystrabane  coronavirusfor regular updates. She encouraged the public to take note of the advice from the Public Health Agency and to watch out for elderly family members, neighbours and friends. She praised the efforts of health workers, shop assistants, bin collectors, delivery men and all those providing the essential services during this dficult and challenging time. “By working together and looking out for one another we can all do our bit to limit the spread of this virus and protect our local community by taking the necessary precautions to stay safe,” she concluded.

Just last week, the Judges Road club were preparing for their All-Ireland League game with Sundays Well, hoping for a win which would take them away from relegation uncertainty and into a potential play-off position near the top of Division C. But the worldwide events of the past few days have not only ended sport locally, nationally and beyond, it has also put any game into context, with peoples lives at risk because of the spread of the Covid- virus.Rather than sit around and wait for the latest news however, City of Derry Head Coach Paul OKane, his staff and his players have made a public offer to go out into the community to help in anyway needed. OKane himself has already been out delivering groceries and prescriptions to the most vulnerable unable to travel in a bid to keep them safe during these uncertain times. “Its just something that we thought we would like to do,” he explained. “I spoke with the president and I spoke with the vice-chair of rugby, and there have been plenty of the players who have stuck their hands up. Were all at a bit of a loose end now and we know that theres vulnerable people out there and to be honest theres been a very good response. “Its certainly opened my eyes to how vulnerable in particular the old people are, even for simple things such as getting their shopping done or getting their prescriptions done and weve been out and about getting a few things done today. I think its just important we try and do something.”The importance of sport to the local community has never been more evident than in recent days with most sporting events and clubs taking a necessary step backwards. Sport however, can still give back, according to OKane.“Were really an extended family when you see how far and wide it reaches and people maybe dont realise that sometimes because were so erse,” he continued. “Were here for the whole community, were cross community, were cross-border and we have people involved in the club travelling from everywhere. “Its just important to try and help anyone we can, eventheyre not attached to the club, eventheyre just a part of the city or wider area. “We have players from Inishowen, Letterkenny, Strabane and Limavady, and from both sides of the water in Derry itself. We have footprints on every side of the community here. This is the least we can do for the wider rugby family in the city and the city in general.”It could be weeks or even months before the sporting calendar resumes, but in the meantime, OKane is hoping that the crisis will bring out the best of our community.“Its not just rugby because Im a Derry City fan and I try to get to every game I can,” he said. “Im from a gaelic background as well. I helped coach Doire Colmcille and Im originally a Limavady Wolfhound, so its great to see all those wee communities trying to do their bit, and were a part of that. “Were at a bit of a loss at what we do at the minute so we have to try and make the best of it and help whoever needs help and try to rally around. From a sporting point of view, you dont know what you have until youve lost it. “Its crazy how much it affects us, evenits sitting watching sport or going training. Some of the guys are going out of their mind because they cant train.

Just last week, the Judges Road club were preparing for their All-Ireland League game with Sundays Well, hoping for a win which would take them away from relegation uncertainty and into a potential play-off position near the top of Division C. But the worldwide events of the past few days have not only ended sport locally, nationally and beyond, it has also put any game into context, with peoples lives at risk because of the spread of the Covid- virus.Rather than sit around and wait for the latest news however, City of Derry Head Coach Paul OKane, his staff and his players have made a public offer to go out into the community to help in anyway needed. OKane himself has already been out delivering groceries and prescriptions to the most vulnerable unable to travel in a bid to keep them safe during these uncertain times. “Its just something that we thought we would like to do,” he explained. “I spoke with the president and I spoke with the vice-chair of rugby, and there have been plenty of the players who have stuck their hands up. Were all at a bit of a loose end now and we know that theres vulnerable people out there and to be honest theres been a very good response. “Its certainly opened my eyes to how vulnerable in particular the old people are, even for simple things such as getting their shopping done or getting their prescriptions done and weve been out and about getting a few things done today. I think its just important we try and do something.”The importance of sport to the local community has never been more evident than in recent days with most sporting events and clubs taking a necessary step backwards. Sport however, can still give back, according to OKane.“Were really an extended family when you see how far and wide it reaches and people maybe dont realise that sometimes because were so erse,” he continued. “Were here for the whole community, were cross community, were cross-border and we have people involved in the club travelling from everywhere. “Its just important to try and help anyone we can, eventheyre not attached to the club, eventheyre just a part of the city or wider area. “We have players from Inishowen, Letterkenny, Strabane and Limavady, and from both sides of the water in Derry itself. We have footprints on every side of the community here. This is the least we can do for the wider rugby family in the city and the city in general.”It could be weeks or even months before the sporting calendar resumes, but in the meantime, OKane is hoping that the crisis will bring out the best of our community.“Its not just rugby because Im a Derry City fan and I try to get to every game I can,” he said. “Im from a gaelic background as well. I helped coach Doire Colmcille and Im originally a Limavady Wolfhound, so its great to see all those wee communities trying to do their bit, and were a part of that. “Were at a bit of a loss at what we do at the minute so we have to try and make the best of it and help whoever needs help and try to rally around. From a sporting point of view, you dont know what you have until youve lost it. “Its crazy how much it affects us, evenits sitting watching sport or going training. Some of the guys are going out of their mind because they cant train. Its been massively impactful and when we get back at it, I think we will appreciate things a lot more.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Our priority is protecting our people and saving lives, which is paramount. As an Executive, we are doing everything we can and will continue to do so in the days, weeks and months ahead but we all have a role to play to protect ourselves and others from Covid-.The Executive has also paid tribute to health service staff who are performing ldquoheroically during this unprecedented time.Mr Swann said the entire health service is under growing pressure and appealed to people not to add to it unless they had to.ldquoPlease, please be patient and treat our great staff with respect, said the health minister. ldquoThey are there to care for you you are their first concern. Please show them the same concern and consideration.The Executive has also taken the opportunity to urge the public to follow the public health advice which means continuing to wash hands regularly for at least  seconds and anyone with mild symptoms should stay at home they will not need to be tested.People are asked not to contact or go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or emergency department.

St Maryrsquos High School in the town is closed today only for an exceptional closure.Some schools are working to continue lessons for Year - students to prepare them for their forthcoming examinations but have asked that all other children are kept at home.Despite the current government advice to keep schools open, attendance is likely to be down from Wednesday onwards as worried parents keep children at home for their protection or other more vulnerable family members.Principal of St Patrickrsquos Primary School in Saul, Mr Mark McGrath, said: ldquoWe are open again on Wednesday but we fully respect parentsrsquo right to do what is best for their own family situation.Down High School is closed today for a school development day but is open tomorrow and Friday for Years - only. The school has cancelled a planned ski trip to Austria as well as a senior rugby tour to Seattle in the USSt Patrickrsquos Grammar School in Downpatrick is also operating a similar arrangement and have asked pupils not to attend school this week.However, the schoolrsquos principal, Mr Joe McCann, has said that pupils facing exams, who need to leave in work or collect work from teachers, can come into school between am and am each day.Mr McCann also informed parents that its cleaning provider spent all of Monday cleaning the school in preparation for any pupils coming in today.The main impact of the coronavirus on most schools has been the cancellation of planned school trips and any after-school activities.Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch was forced to cancel three school trips which were due to start last Saturday.One of the trips was a ski holiday to Folgaria in northern Italy, the worst affected area of the country.Over  of the schoolrsquos best Irish dancers, singers and musicians were to take in New Yorkrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parade and a concert. A ten-day trip to South Africa has also been cancelled by the school.Mr Peter Dobbin, principal, told parents that the schoolrsquos primary duty of care was to ldquothe health and safety and to the wellbeing of each and every student and member of staff.ldquoThese are unprecedented times and we are navigating unchartered waters, so please bear with us as we try to ensure that we maintain learning and teaching at this time, said Mr Dobbin.He said that he and his staff were also preparing for ldquoan inevitable school closure in due course and would ensure that no external visitors, including parents, would be allowed past the entrance foyer, unless it was under ldquoexceptional circumstances.He revealed that the school had implemented ldquoenhanced cleaning procedures since the beginning of the month.The school has also cancelled all extra-curricular activities and postponed the Year  and Year  parent teacher meetings, scheduled for next Tuesday.Mr Kevin Lambe, principal of Shimna Integrated College, Newcastle, confirmed on Monday that the schoolrsquos sky trip to Austria had been cancelled.Outlining his schoolrsquos response to the current coronavirus threat level, Mr Lambe said that additional cleaning protocols were in place and that all evening activities involving community groups had been cancelled until further notice.He added: ldquoOur current priority is to put in place arrangements to support studentsrsquo continued learning and revision should schools close..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th March 2020 Cemetery.jpg","title":"Cemetery blaze report due out  ","story":"POLITICIANS will be provided with an update on the recent blaze which ripped through part of a building at Struell cemetery in Downpatrick.The blaze mdash which is believed to have been started by an electrical fault ndash has left Newry, Mourne and Down Council with a repair bill running into tens of thousands of pounds.The Fire and Rescue Service carried out a detailed examination of the building in the aftermath of the blaze and members of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee are expected to discover its initial findings tomorrow night.Mechanical equipment, including a small digger, was destroyed in the blaze at the Old Course Road cemetery three weeks ago, with firefighters able to prevent flames from spreading to a toilet block which remains operational.The cemetery was temporarily closed by local authority officials in the wake of the fire but was subsequently reopened. Council insurers also visited the site to inspect the scale of the damage.The roof of the cemetery building which was badly affected by the fire contained asbestos tiles which resulted in debris falling within the structure and on ground immediately beside it.Council staff erected fencing around the damaged part of the building to prevent access to the asbestos material with arrangements made to remove it off site by an approved asbestos contractor.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said politicians will be keen to hear tomorrowrsquos update and how soon the main building will be fully operational.

I also think it is ludicrous that you only have schools and public buildings closed on one side of the border, he said.ldquoI know that from talking to parents last weekend, especially those with vulnerable children, that they are really fearful about sending them to school and into public buildings. People are effectively voting with their feet and taking decisions themselves.Cllr Clarke said elected representatives had to listen to what the public was saying and that confusion had been fuelled by conflicting medical advice from across the globe.He added: ldquoWe simply have to look at restrictions on public buildings and even perhaps how many people go into play parks. This council needs to send out a strong message that it is taking this issue seriously following. We have already cancelled of this weekrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parades. We have to start by getting our own house in order.The DUPrsquos Billy Walker mdash who initially said that his party would ldquoreluctantly support the closure of leisure centres mdash subsequently agreed that all council buildings should go into lockdown following the Prime Ministerrsquos statement.He said that in the interests of the publicrsquos health and safety ldquothis is the right thing to do, even though Northern Irelandrsquos chief medical officer, Michael McBride, said that leisure centres could remain openthey were properly managed.ldquoAll the political parties need to work together to make sure that the people out there are properly informed as there are mixed messages. To be honest, some have attempted to turn this issue into and Orange and Green situation and that is wrong, declared Cllr Walker.ldquoThe bottom line for us all is that we do not want any member of the public to get infected with this virus. We want to come out the far side of this crisis unscathed and prevent as many as people as possible from contracting coronavirus. We have to send out a united message.The UUPrsquos David Taylor said while politicians could ldquodebate all day about who was right and who was wrong in relation to conflicting medical advice, they had to approach the issue in a collective manner and give confidence to the community that they are united in their approach.He added: ldquoThis is not a political issue. It is one that affects each and everyone of us. It is a very serious issue given the potential damage it could cause to peoplersquos lives and we could actually lose some as a result of this. We need to take collective approach and act responsibly.ldquoI have serious concerns about the way the virus is impacting the business community and some of the stories I have heard are frightening, with some businesses down by as much as  percent and jobs at others at risk. We need the Assembly to provide a package of measures to help.SDLP councillor Pete Byrne said that at this time the public need clarity with the overwhelming majority of them of the view that acting early is better than acting too late.ldquoPeople want us to show leadership and while we are taking about closing leisure centres, we have an obligation to protect the interests and health of people and our staff, he said.ldquoWhile I support the closure of leisure centres, we also need to look at community centres, many of which are visited by huge number of our senior citizens for a range of activities and programmes. We need to send out a clear message to people.Cllr Byrne said there also needed to be a focus on the criteria for reopening public buildings following their closure, suggesting that an alternative venue needs to be found for future council meetings to promote social distancing, suggesting the Down Leisure Centre as a possible location.ldquoWhen we close public facilities we are going to push people into parks but we must ensure that there is social distancing in these locations. We need staff there to assure people and perhaps we could redeploy those from our leisure centres to make sure are parks are up to scratch, he added.Cllr Henry Reilly highlighted the great deal of anguish in the community, suggesting that a two-week closure smacked of ldquotokenism as the coronavirus issue will not be over by the end of March.He also highlighted the need to ensure that frontline staff, especially those who work in refuse collection and household recycling centres, are provided with appropriate protective equipment.Cllr Jarlath Tinnelly urged the Public Health Agency to provide information leaflets on the coronavirus to every household in the country, while Alliancersquos Andrew McMurray said his party supported the decision to close all council buildings, excluding those which deliver statutory s.He added: ldquoMoving forward, it is imperative that we enact and support the decision made by the council. On the wider issue, I would ask all residents to follow the advice given by the Public Health Agency, to shop responsibility in order to avoid shortages and to look out for the most vulnerable in our communities.Other councillors who spoke at Monday nightrsquos debate included Roisin Mulgrew, Michael Savage, Oonagh Hanlon and Harold

Fountain Foodbank has launched a new drive through facility in response to the coronavirus epidemic.The cross-community facility mdash which has seen an upsurge in demand over recent days and handed out almost  food parcels last week mdash introduced the new service this week in the wake of Mondayrsquos advice from Prime Minister Boris Johnston that people should avoid all ldquonon essential contact.Volunteers from the foodbank, who are appealing for more donations to help them cope with the increase in demand in what are unprecedented times, are asking people with cars to drive into the car park at Downpatrick Presbyterian Church where the foodbank is based.People are being asked to remain in their cars and once they have handed over their voucher, the food parcel will either be left beside their vehicle or placed in the boot.The volunteers have confirmed that they will also be changing the way they hand over parcels to people who arrive at the foodbank on foot or accept the generous donations people from across the district provide them with.Foodbank co-ordinator Shirley Lennon said people continue to be generous and revealed that she was heartened this week to see collection points the charity has at a number of local stores filled with items.She also revealed that while in the Asdarsquos Downpatrick store yesterday morning, she was approached by a woman who gave her an envelope with money it which her grandfather had donated.Shirley explained the woman approached her after spotting that she was wearing her Fountain Foodbank hoodie.Shirley has been at the helm of the foodbank since it opened and described the impact of the coronavirus issue on the community as ldquochallenging.She also confirmed that the volunteers who provide the food parcel service are committed to continuing to help others across the community in need.She described the climate the foodbank is currently operating in as ldquodficult and revealed that it was extremely busy last Friday.ldquoOn Tuesday of last week we gave out  food parcels which was busy but not unusual, but suddenly on Friday everyone seemed to panic and there were  parcels given out to help  people.ldquoTo put that number of parcels in context, it was like the Friday before Christmas when we give out around  parcels. This is the only time that we would distribute that many.Shirley said she believes that this is as a direct response to what is happening across the community, explaining that measures had been put in place to restrict the time volunteers speak with people in a bid to protect their health.ldquoWhile I was not there last Friday when people were calling I believe that there was a sombre atmosphere. We gave out a lot of food and we reckon that we will be busy from here on, she continued.ldquoIt has been dficult to replace the food that was given out. We do not have that big a store, but we have managed and it is quite well stocked again just now, but it is dficult. Normally we have financial donations which lets me buy what we need, but there is no long le milk to be had anywhere. It has been hard for me to do that normal shopping for the foodbank.Shirley explained that while she collected an order from the Asda store in Downpatrick yesterday, she was unable to get the quantity of some items that she would have liked.The foodbank co-ordinator saidshoppers would think about the charity when they are shopping it would help, explaining that people are being good, with messages coming in from people saying they will make donations. Shirley said that local churches have also been helping.ldquoThere has been a good response from people which is very much appreciated, but the increase in demand is having an impact on our stock, coupled with the inability to get the food, she said.ldquoPeople should not be panic buying, but it seems to be the way they react at times like this.She said that the Downpatrick foodbank and the Pantry foodbank in Newcastle are anticipating greater need and with people having no jobs and no money coming in, ldquothey are going to be in more dficulty.Shirley added: ldquoEveryone who used the foodbank over the past few months do not have the reserves to go and panic buy, that is why we are going to be busy.Donations can be left at the Fountain Foodbank on Tuesday or Friday mornings between am and noon.

The distance is approximately six miles on an out and back course, majority of the race on the flat with a brutal climb of  feet in half a mile.A new registration venue meant a slight course change which avoided the road section, crossing a few fields and down a lane that took competitors back onto the river path.Leading out the runners was Newcastle ACrsquos Seamus Lynch and Mourne Runnersrsquo Johnny Scott.

She said: “James and Anne had completed all the necessary health screening forms and waited  hours to get the required flight permit to land in Lanseria.“All was agreed, passport details were shared with the South African authorities and health data showing they had not been to a high-risk country and in fact been in Africa since late February.“Anne had police called to her in the airport as she refused to sign a form which stated, ‘you are a person from a high-risk country’.“The form also was in the name of another unknown person, hence the refusal.”Hagan Homes has built more than , homes across Northern Ireland since it was established in .Ms Heeks is a retired specialist respiratory nurse from England who is keen to get back to the UK where her skills could be utilised in fight against coronavirus.The spokeswoman said the couple called the UK Foreign Office to be told that “any country has the right to refuse entry,”.She also said: “The British Embassy made contact with James this morning and they are trying to resolve the issue but still no update on progress.“Meantime they are still being held in this van on the Tarmac.“Police and the airport officials also tried to put them both back on the small plane they arrived in, but the plane cannot leave with them as they have had their entry to South Africa refused.“They cannot fly without a permit and they are now almost ‘illegals’ but they are not even being repatriated.”The spokeswoman added: “This trip was a once in a letime opportunity to celebrate Anne’s th, but this has now turned in to a living nightmare.”The British Embassy in Pretoria has not yet responded to a request for comment.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Michael said: “People think, the music is dark and intense, they’re going to be really dark and intense.The band’s original line-up of Michael, Andy and Fyfe \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...“The most messed-up people I find are people in pop music. A lot of them are horrible twisted people with weird agendas and they become quite damaged iniduals. Then they go on stage everything is rosy.“It’s really the old cliche – never judge a book by its cover. With us the lyrics are kind of twisted, but there’s a big, dark sense of humour there.“We let off steam when we go on stage and jump up and down for  minutes. You tend to be pretty chilled afterwards.”When the band first got together in  lead singer and guitarist Andy Cairns was a pupil at Ballyclare High. Michael, who attended Larne Grammar with Fyfe Ewing , wasn’t present for the band’s first recording though he was there in spirit.On the front cover of metal magazine Kerrang! in He said: “Fyfe and I were in the same English class and would have traded records. He was in a band, I was in a band. “His band and Andy’s band had played a gig at Jordanstown Uni. They had more in common than they did with their own bands. “They did a demo together. I was there in spirit because Andy didn’t have a bass guitar so Fyfe asked me and I lent Andy my bass. Andy played it on the first demo.” Michael soon joined to play his own bass and things clicked from the start: “Our first gig was at Giro’s supporting Decadence Within. It went down really well, I was flabbergasted. “We weren’t trying to be U or Guns N’ Roses – those were the two big musical things at that time in , . I don’t mind U and I quite like Guns N’ Roses but we had our own little thing going on.“You kind of gravitated towards anyone who liked something that wasn’t Bryan Adams at school. In Larne where I grew up the metallers hung out with the goths, the goths hung out with the indie kids and you heard Joy Division, The Dead Kennedys and Slayer. We clung together as musical outsiders.”The friendship between Michael and Andy has extended more than  years: “I think I was  or  when Andy and I first met. When the first album came out I’d just turned . I’ll be  later this month.“One thing we did find quite early on is that we tend to be huffers. We got that out of our system. If you don’t like something you say then, you don’t leave it for six months and have a meltdown in the middle of eastern Europe.“There’s a lot of rock and rolls myths and stereotypes out there that people love. One of them I think which is not correct is that you need to have creative tension in a band. Maybe that’s works for one or two albums, but that burns itself out really quickly.“It’s really great working together as part of the band, what I get out of it is quite special, I think I’m very lucky.”Michael contrasted the crazy intensity when the band shared a house together in Belfast’s Holylandswith the situation now where they all live in dferent parts of the UK.He said: “I think there was one time me and Andy worked out over an -months period we’d been within  metres of each other every day with the exception of Christmas Day.“Now I live in Larne, Andy lives in Cambridge and Neilour drummer lives in Derby. When we meet up there’s lots of interesting stories and dferent experiences to share rather than walk down the main street in Larne going, ‘oh there’s the lads’.”On Fyfe, his original bandmate who left in , he said: “I haven’t spoken to him since he left. We have friends in common. He’s doing alright I believe. He moved to Brighton, he’s been there  years now. He’s had very little involvement in the music business.“It’s a real pity because he was such a great drummer, it’s just he couldn’t really get on with the lestyle. Somewhere down the line we’ll meet again.”Family man with attic of collectablesLast year Michael contributed a recipe to a celebrity cookbook to support his nephew Matthew who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia.Michael said: “Matthew is doing well. The family is getting things back on track. It was a big thing, he’s still a bit traumatised as you’d expect but he’s doing well.”Of family le at home in Larne he said: “My we works full time soI’m at home I’m daddy day care. The only downside is when I’m away, I’m away   so there’s a whole dferent set of challenges for my we who’s an absolute saint.”Askedhis children, aged nine and five, were excited about their dad being in an band, he said: “They saw us at a big festival in Europe which was great because they were at the side of the stage and they were able to see , people from the other side. “They’re quite blasé about their dad being in a band. They’re not into music that much, they’re more into games, football and karate.”Michael went on to discuss some of the Therapy  treasure trovecontained in his attic: “I’ve got Fyfe’s original snare drum that he used on Babyteeth, the basses that I used on Troublegum. I’ve got a lot of the flyers, posters, tour passes and recordings and audio stuff I’ve kept over the years. The attic is a disaster area.”In the early days of Therapy  a pair of denim dungarees were Michael’s stagewear of choice. Askedstill had them, he said: “I actually do. I’m quite pleased that I’d still fit into them but I never wear them.“When we did the Troublegum shows a while ago there were some bets that they’d turn up again, but it didn’t happen for whatever reason. But never say never – right now I don’t think the world is ready for that.”Michael explained that there were in fact two pairs of his trademark dungarees, one of them he referred to as ‘the good pair’ then immediately burst out laughing.“Can you imagine denim dungarees after three weeks of touring ” he said. “It’s hard to find a -hour laundrette when you’re on the road. They were crunchy. I’m surprised they’re still in one piece.”Dates cancelled due to pandemicTherapy  have had to cancel some European tour dates later this month because of the coronavirus.Michael said: “We’ve had to cancel where the crowds would have been above ,, some of the big festivals we were really looking forward to. As it stands we’re still planning to play some of the smaller shows unless told otherwise. “It’s something that you just can’t account for. Gigs sometimes have to be cancelled because of illness or injury but this is beyond the band’s control. It’s a bit of a headmelt.”Touring major European cities is a far cry from the band’s gigging schedule in : “When we started there was the Warzone Collective in Belfast and Hope Promotions in Dublin. They worked in conjunction and would bring hardcore punk bands over like Fugazi and Concrete Sox. “We knew the Warzone people and that led to us being invited down to Dublin to play with the likes of Babes In Toyland. “They’d rent rooms above pubs for gigs, in Belfast they used the Art College and the Conor Hall. “We were quite lucky to get in at that DIY stage.”It’s okay not to be okayMuch is currently being done to raise awareness and funds for musicians suffering from mental health issues, particularly through Aware NI, PIPS and Help Musicians. As a band Therapy  have been tuned into the struggle from day one with many of Andy’s lyrics exploring the pressures that weigh on the human mind.Michael said: “It’s something that we’re all very aware of and very sympathetic towards. Being a young male in Northern Ireland there’s a bit of a ‘come on, man up’ vibe. That has been very damaging for a couple of generations now.“There is a rock and roll myth that everyone’s an all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting gunslinger – you roll into town decimate it and move on. It’s not really like that.“I don’t think anyone hasn’t been touched by themselves or someone  who has had a mental health issue.“It’s such a fragile thing. It’s right there, there just seems not to be the widespread acknowledgement that it exists and for treatment. It’s so underfunded. It’s a real tragedy.”He added: “We’ve always had a lot of empathy, we take people as they are, we don’t have the answers, but we do try to let people know that it’s okay to not be okay. “Just talk about it, talk to your friends, talk to someone, reach out. Thankfully that stigma is moving away.“We’ve always been celebrating the outsiders – be yourself, do you own thing, what makes you happy, self preservation, looking after yourself.”Michael continued: “It’s one of these rock and roll myths that people want their musicians to be messed up and die young and leave a pretty corpse. “None of us subscribe to that at all.“We like to have a good time when we’re on tour, but doing it for so long there’s a massive element of self preservation.“It’s about doing a good gig. People don’t come and see you againyou’re stood there looking bored or hungover. It’s not pleasant for anyone – the player or the watcher.“We all feel a big responsibility to put on a good show.

He made me feel very relaxed, said one patient after meeting Charles.ldquoWithin  seconds I felt at ease. It was nice to be able to say what you wanted, and he genuinely had an interest in the patients, said Kathryn Guercio, a Health Care Assistant at Marie Curie.For Kathryn, the royal visit was an opportunity to thank the prince.ldquoWhen I was  I left school with no qualications. I was an absolute angry drop out. I joined the Princes Trust volunteers because they didnrsquot know what  to do with me, Kathryn said.Established by Charles in , the Princes Trust helps vulnerable young people to find employment and gain valuable training.ldquoI did a fortnight of caring in Surry and I loved it. I absolutely loved it. Thatrsquos when I thought I could do this. I just love looking after people.ldquoItrsquos because of that choice to join the Princes Trust volunteers that I ended up where I am, so I genuinely do thank him for taming a very wayward -year-old.Describing her job at Marie Curie, Kathryn said: ldquoI love it here. Therersquos no comparison. You can give that  percent every sht. And wersquove got a cracking view. The sun rises and then the moon rises. We get to see it all across the water. Itrsquos gorgeous.Following the tour, the prince ended his visit at a reception where he met actor and Marie Curie ambassador, Suzanna Packer.In a brief speech, he commended the staff and volunteers for their dedication which he called lsquotruly remarkable.rsquoHe then unveiled a plaque to commemorate his visit and cut a daffodil-themed cake made by local Michelin-starred chef, James Sommerin.Angelina Hall and Cathy OrsquoDoherty, co-owners of Glass By Design at Station Approach, were commissioned to design and produce the plaque.ldquoIt was an honour for us as local artists to be asked to make this, said Cathy. ldquoItrsquos something which is going to be here for people to enjoy.His Royal Highness was also the first person to sign the charityrsquos Great Big Daffodil - a -foot tall model with paper books in the shape of petals which will start a UK wide tour this week.The Great Daffodil Appeal is an opportunity for people to share their stories, memories, or tributes to a loved one.After signing the book and cutting the cake, Charles gave a final farewell to the staff who had gathered to see him and left with his entourage.The prince met with flood victims in Pontypridd later that afternoon.His trip to South Wales also included engagements at the CAF train factory in Newport, the Aston Martin Lagonda factory in St. Athan, Barry, and the British Airways Maintenance Centre in Cardf. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How do those people then stay, snuggled in snoozy paradise for hour upon hour until their alarm gives them a nudge and they arise rested and ready for a new day  I have never been a good sleeper, even as a child. If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy. None of us know what is going on behind the closed door of either someonersquos home or their mind and whilst I hope you sleep well,you canrsquot, use that time wisely to think, to empathise and to learn. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March .

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents. We hope this will inspire the launch of similar schemes in future.The Nextbike project is being funded by Section  sustainable transport contributions. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When askedthey supported the construction of a dam,  per cent said they did not.The same number advocated for ldquonature friendly solutions to flood management.Local engineer David Bacon proposed pumping water from the lower end of the Cadoxton, where the flood risk is highest, onto the Sully Moors.Andrew Peterken, a Dinas Powys resident whose property is at risk of flooding, argued that natural flood management solutions should be trialled and the situation reviewed at a later date.The public have been invited by Natural Resources Wales to offer their feedback on the Outline Business Case until Friday, March .For more information, visit: naturalresources.wales about-us our-projects flood-scheme-projects dinas-powys-flood-scheme appraisal-of-dinas-powys-flood-scheme-options  langen. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

As the rain lashed down pretty much all day Friday and the wind did too much howling and yowling for my liking, we went to bed and then awoke to roads that looked like rivers between Sully and Barry and fields resembling lakes in Dinas Powys.My son and I played lsquospot the tops of the treesrsquo as we drove a erted route to get to his football match on Saturday morning and discussed climate change and the power of nature atas we drove through sun, hail, wind, and rain to get him to his match.The third weekend of storms has taken its toll. It feels tiring and worrying to be soaked once more.But it occurred to me as we left the house early and crawled along with other erted drivers that just a few miles up the road in Pontypridd and indeed in other parts of Wales and across the UK, people are witnessing their homes and business, their lives, being washed away and so as irritated and fed up as I may have been, I scrabbled for perspective.Perspective is a tough one. There will always be someone worse off and someone better off and whilst you can sympathise and empathise and seek to understand, you can only really know your own lived experience.But this is in part why I am so interested in the news, because in dealing with, embracing, enduring, revelling in my own le, I appreciate that window on the world to open my mind, teach me things and remind me that there are others in similar, same, better and much worse situations than me. It doesnrsquot stop a flooded road being frustrating, but it does remind me that in the midst of chuntering and muttering, because I do indulge in a chunter and mutter, thatpossible, it is important to take a moment to think about a world outside ourselves and our immediate surrounds.It can feel depressing. It is easy to feel powerless. But I do believe that as citizens in a democracy, it is important to have an idea about what is going on becausewe always turn a blind eye, eventually I fear, we might stop seeing anything at all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

She said the local community would become a lsquocrucial support systemrsquo as the epidemic sweeps through the country and vulnerable people are forced to self-isolate.ldquoI spent a pretty uncomfortable  hours wondering whether to try to organise something myself, or even how to do it, and then I came across the Covid- Mutual Aid UK movement, and I realised thatI could then I should, said Jo.She said the group aims to cover every home in Llandough by deploying volunteers to each street, close, and block of flats.To request assistance or offer support, contact: LlandoughMutualAid@gmail.Both groups can be contacted on their Facebook page. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Quincey said: “Among those travelling from Ulster are three bands from Donegal, however another band joining them can make the unique claim of already having made that long journey not once but twice.” Portadown True Blues first marched in Toronto in  and then again in  when over  members of the band travelled over , miles to parade.Portadown True Blues on the march in their home town : -TONY HENDRONNNQuincey commented: “Over the decades that have past, relationships kindled during those trips have seen Canadian Brethren make their way back to the ‘home country’ to parade on the Twelfth in Portadown, and this year several of the True Blues who made that journey over  years ago will be ing the favour.”Sam Hill is part of the Portadown Trues Blues committee who are organising the band’s third trip to Toronto.The -year-old said: “This will be my first time in Toronto. The last time the band was there was  and I was still in the Army at the time.“The band over the years has been speaking about going back. “It’s a big financial commitment which made it dficult.“We actually got a special invite from the Canadians for the th anniversary because the band was there before in  and .“We discussed it last year and decidedwe were going we’d be taking the families and all with us.“It was thrown out to the general public as well to come with us and there’s some joining us, some of them are Orangemen. “It’s going to be a big trip.“We were up to  but a few have dropped out because of the coronavirus. We’re down to about  – three bus loads.“Everything is still going ahead as it stands. We’re just going on advice from our own government and Canadians. Canada haven’t got the same flight ban as the US.“We’ll have to sit tight and wait to hear. It could be a last minute decision.”Of the cost of the trip which has prompted a lot of fundraising from the band, Sam said:“It’s cost £, to get everybody there.“We’ve been on the ball with fundraising since August last year.“Now we’re into March and the marching season has started, we’re really looking forward to it.“We did sayeverybody paid their own fare to get there we would raise funds to offset the costs when we get there, to pay for things like buses for excursions. “Some of us are going for  days, the majority just going for a week.“I’m going with my we Sharon, my son and my daughter, I’ve got an older son who isn’t going.“There’s  fathers and sons going out of the band. With one family there’s three generations – Victor Graham is going with his son David and his grandchildren Sam and Bobby.“Aside from the parade they’ll have us playing in Orange halls, clubs and places like that. We’ll be trying to get a bit of freetime for sightseeing, Niagara Falls, the CN Tower, places like that.“There’s people who will be meeting up with family when they’re over.”Of the ‘old boys’ going on the trip Sam said: “There’s a few boys going that were there in  and .“We’ve actually a boy coming from New Zealand, Philip Currie. The plan is he’ll come back to Northern Ireland and travel with us.“Another boy Jimmy McCullough, who was there in , he lives in Las Vegas now, he’s coming up to meet us from there.“He still has his unorm. When he comes home he guests with the band.“Two of the boys who are still in the band – Nigel Morrison and Trevor Whitten – they’ll be there too.“It’s going to be a bit of a reunion as well.“We’ve been going through the band archive to see who was in the band at the time, we’ve been in contact with them.“The reason why we’re going back is it’s the th anniversary or the formation of the Orange over there. It’s the longest running parade in the history of North America.“Because it was the th anniversary and they did ask us back we thought now was the time to go.”In  Portadown True Blues became the first blood and thunder band to form in Portadown.The band was founded by three men - Connie Linton, Glen Yeman and the late Eddie McKinney. Their practice takes place in Clounagh Orange Hall.Sam, who has been in the band since , said: “The band has between  and  members, from primary school age up to older ones. Me and Johnny Burns are there the longest. Johnny has been there  years.“I’ve been secretary, I’ve been chairman, the whole lot. I’m just an ordinary band member now and I’m on the Canada sub committee.”Sam is joined on the True Blues Canada sub committee by band chairman Stephen Woods, Stuart Currie, Dickie Craven and Jamie Kerr.Orangeism was present in Canada less than  years after its formation in Co Armagh, with the first documented Lodge being active by  in the city of Montreal in the province of Quebec. Other lodges soon came into existence, but they were essentially all a loose confederation until  when the Grand Orange Lodge of British America was formed. The ‘father’ of the Canadian Order is widely regarded to be the controversial Wexford born Canadian politician and newspaper mogul Ogle Robert Gowan. Initially membership was made up of Irish immigrants, however its ethos soon saw it expand its remit to recruit heavily from English, Scottish and other Protestants from across Europe. In the th Century it could boast lodges made exclusively from those of Italian descent, and of Mohawk Indians. From a membership of approximately , in the mid-’s, by the early th century it had well over , brethren across several thousand lodges. In Newfoundland a third of adult males were members, making it more popular there than even back at ‘home’ in Ireland. Four Canadian prime ministers were members of the institution while numerous other brethren have served at other levels, with famously almost every Toronto mayor between  and  unashamedly Orange. Whilst the membership today is a pale reflection of its past glories, there are still thousands of Canadian Orangemen, and the ‘Orange Hall’ is still a part of the physical landscape.Toronto’s Orange presence was such that it was often called the ‘Belfast of Canada’ and although numbers are reduced the annual procession is the longest running in North America.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1584292147825.jpg--covid_19__update.jpg?158429214700","title":"covid  update ","story":"AS of pm on Sunday, March , testing has resulted in new positive cases, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Northern Ireland to.
